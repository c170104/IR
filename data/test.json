saesee tiin, and kit fisto entered the republic executive building to put an end to the war once and for all. the men were jedi masters of the highest order and were four of the twelve most powerful jedi in the galaxy. skilled combatants all, they were veterans that were the most deadly lightsaber duelists in the galaxy. they were hand picked by mace with the task they had arrived for in mind: the end of the sith forever. it had been a trying few years for the republic since the clone wars had begun. since the confederacy of independent systems had seceded from the galactic republic, war had been waged for control of the galaxy on two fronts. on the public front, the droid armies of the separatists and the clone army of the republic clashed, lead by their jedi generals in skirmishes across the galaxy. on the secret front, the jedi had been fighting the minions of the dark side of the force. these forces had consisted of bounty hunters, dark jedi knights, and the lords of the sith. for over a millennium, the sith had been thought extinct. since the supposed death of darth bane, the creator of the rule of two, the jedi had lived in peace and security. unfortunately, the sith had survived, passing their knowledge on from master to apprentice. there would only be two so as not to result in infighting and betrayal among their order. the master would eventually die by their apprentice\'s hand, but only when they were ready. the reappearance of the sith apprentice maul and the death of jedi master qui-gon over ten years ago had confirmed the sith\'s existence and the threat they posed to the galaxy. darth sidious, maul\'s master, had been planning for years to take control of the galaxy and he may have just done that through the most insidious of means: the democratic process of the republic senate. according to anakin skywalker, chancellor palpatine was the sith lord they had been searching for. hiding in plain sight, with a smile on his face, presiding over the war as the ultimate symbol for good and democracy for the republic. \"why didn\'t i see it before,\" windu thought to himself. \"it\'s so obvious. where else would a sith lord hide than in full view of the galaxy?\" \"are you okay, mace,\" kit asked him as they made their way through the lobby. mace chuckled to his old friend. \"it\'s nothing, master fisto. just... trembling with anticipation at the thought of ending this war with the arrest of the lord of the sith.\" kolar nodded in agreement. \"if it wasn\'t for young skywalker\'s information, we wouldn\'t have this chance. i knew we were right to trust him.\" the iridonian jedi had been one of those with the utmost faith in anakin\'s placement as the council\'s spy on palpatine. \"he may not be here with us now, but he has more than proven master qui-gon\'s faith in the prophecy of the chosen one.\" \"i\'m not so certain about that,\" tiin grumbled. \"i feel an unease in the force. skywalker\'s role in today\'s event\'s is not yet finished.\" the iktotchi jedi was known for his light predictive abilities, able to sense incoming danger. it came in handy for his piloting skills. mace could sense that he\'d rather be in the air right now instead of the ground. in the skies, tiin was untouchable, second to skywalker himself. \"we will not need anakin today,\" mace huffed. \"we will end sidious today and we will do it without the chosen one.\" when he said \"chosen one\" it came out like he was spitting out phlegm that had been stuck in his throat. the other masters noted it as they entered the elevator that would take them to the floor where the chancellor suite was located. contrary to certain beliefs held by some members of the council, master windu didn\'t dislike anakin. while he appreciated his skills with a lightsaber and the information he had provided as the council\'s spy, there was something about him that caused feelings of resentment to rise up. he just didn\'t trust anakin. in his thirteen years with the jedi order, skywalker had grown closer and closer to palpatine to the point where anakin had vocally spoken up for the chancellor on more than one occasion. on top of that, anakin had been granted a position on the jedi council at palpatine\'s insistence to be his representative. to mace, this was an insult. politicians had no place in jedi affairs and vice versa. yet here he was: a member of the jedi council. not through his own merits as a jedi, but as an act of manipulation by a corrupt politician. like a personal lap dog. he smiled over the planetary city of coruscant as they rode the elevator up. it really was a beautiful city on the surface, hiding a dark secret underneath its shining skyscrapers. he had lived here his entire life and he would die to defend it and its people. soon, it would be over. palpatine would put up a fight of course. it was the nature of the sith to resist the inevitable. but they would win the day in the end. the jedi would survive and sidious would face a trial and most likely be executed. his followers were all but gone. his apprentice, count dooku, was dead by skywalker\'s hands and general grievous, the leader of the droid army, was already confirmed dead at the hands of skywalker\'s former master obi-wan kenobi. sidious was going to lose the war he had started and mace was going to be the one to take him in. not skywalker. him. at the jedi temple, seated in the council chamber, anakin skywalker was in conflict with himself. for years, he had been assured of his moral code as a jedi knight. yet, since his arrival to coruscant, he had been under the watchful eye of a sith lord. what did that make him and what did that mean for the life of his one true love padmé amidala? since he was a boy, padmé had never been far from his thoughts or his heart. when he was a true man, he had confessed his feelings for padmé and she in turn to him. they had married not very long after the clone wars had begun, violating his oath of forswearing all singular attachments, romantic or otherwise. in his heart, he understood the need to swear off romantic attachments, but he couldn\'t deny what he felt in his heart for padmé. since the death of his mother, he couldn\'t just let go of those he cared about. he had to protect those he cared about. master obi-wan, master yoda, and padme were all dear to him. them and... chancellor palpatine. \"how could he be a traitor,\" anakin muttered to himself. \"he\'s been like a father to me. like obi-wan. he\'s been there for me ever since i came to the order. he\'s listened to my troubles and encouraged my abilities when no one else would! and he said he could help me prevent padmé\'s death. he\'s... he\'s been more of a father to me than obi-wan has.\" when anakin had told him of what he had done to the tusken raiders that had killed his mother, palpatine had commended him. \"they were less than animals, anakin,\" he\'d reassured him. \"they may have walked like men, but they were willing to torture a helpless woman simply because she wasn\'t one of them. one less tribe of tuskens is a blessing to the settlers of tatooine. you did the right thing.\" anakin had assured himself of that many times over. he\'d hated the tuskens. he had done the right thing killing those animals. at least, that was what he told himself at the time. he just couldn\'t understand how jedi could let go of the dead. when anakin had started dreaming of a possible future for padme that ended with her death while giving birth to their child, he had gone to master yoda for help. yoda had advised him to \"let go\". to train himself to let go of those he feared to lose. it felt heartless to hear, especially from master yoda. \"what does he know? how could he understand? how could any of them understand?\" anakin\'s blood boiled at the thought that advice. it was cruel to ask him to let go of someone he loved. to let go of his own wife. he had lost too much in this life as a jedi: his fellow knights, his mother, and his apprentice. it was unfair of them to ask so much of him. yet, here was palpatine, offering him the ultimate prize. the ability to prevent those he cared about from dying? it would make him the most valued of jedi. \"palpatine must be arrested, that much is certain. but if he could pass on this knowledge, the jedi would become more powerful than possible. the teachings of the sith can be used for good!\" he stood up and began pacing back and forth while glancing out the window towards the executive building. \"they should be there by now,\" he thought. as he pondered whether or not palpatine would go quietly, he reached out using the force. not towards the executive building, but towards the apartment he shared with padme. he felt her there. her and the life that was growing within her. their child. a life born in the wake of this awful war. he was certain it was going to be a boy. he would be fine with a girl too, but he could tell it was going to be a boy. padme was already planning where they would raise him. naboo would be nice for him, but he also wanted to show his son tatooine. he wanted to show him where he came from and he would be there when anakin liberated tatooine from the hutts. anakin would introduce him to his step-brother owen lars and his step-father cliegg lars. he would be a good father to his son. that is, if padmé and the child survived what was to come. peace was in the grasp of the republic and soon, him and padmé would finally be together. he could change things in the order. if master ki-adi mundi could have five wives to maintain the population of cerea, anakin was allowed someone to share his life with! it was only fair! as he began to pace even more furiously back and forth, a chill went up his spine. it was like a wave of energy coming from... the executive building! either palpatine was dead or... master windu and the others were dead! he had to do something. he had promised windu he would wait for him, but if he could do something to make sure peace came to the galaxy in the least harmful way to everyone he needed to make it happen, he would do it. as they entered the chancellor\'s office, windu could feel the dark side pouring out of the room. now that they were aware of the sith lord\'s identity, they knew what to look for. he would never be able to hide from them again. he was theirs. palpatine, hearing their arrival, turned in his desk chair to face them with a smile. to windu, it looked like a throne. made sense for a sith. \"master windu,\" palpatine greeted them. \"i take it general grievous has been destroyed.\" he noted their postures and expressions, his tone becoming decidedly more serious. \"i must say you\'re here sooner than expected.\" it was time. no point in putting it off any further. mace reached down to his belt and removed his lightsaber and ignited it, the blade of violet illuminating his features. \"in the name of the galactic senate of the republic, you are under arrest, chancellor.\" palpatine\'s old eyes, normally soft, hardened and stared daggers into windu. \"are you threatening me, master jedi?\" windu stared back, his expression unflinching. \"the senate will decide your fate.\" \"i am the senate,\" palpatine retorted, his voice becoming deeper and more jagged. \"not yet,\" windu replied simply. \"it\'s treason then,\" the sith lord said while standing up, his hands at his sides. what happened next felt like it happened in the blink of an eye. a lightsaber dropped out of palpatine\'s sleeve and into his hand. it ignited a blade of bright crimson and palpatine was across the room in a second. in a flash of red light, the blade had impaled kolar and in a continuing arc had slashed tiin across the chest. the two masters fell to the floor, crying in pain, and the battle was joined. kit was a skilled warrior and managed to block palpatine\'s blows as he alternated between him and windu. it wasn\'t enough, however, as master kit fisto soon joined his brothers in arms on the floor of the chancellor\'s suite, a lightsaber slash across his chest. mace was alone against the sith lord. alone, yet not afraid. more that he was resolute. first blood had been spilled by palpatine. the jedi was now in defensive mode and he was not going to lose to this monster. as anakin entered the executive building, he noted that there were two elevators, but only one was available. as he entered the one directly in front of him and pushed the button for the chancellor\'s floor, a duros repairman was seen running towards him. he didn\'t have time to wait. he had to get up there. the duros seemed to be shouting to him to stop to which anakin shook his head. the elevator doors closed and he felt himself being lifted up. igil the duros had tried calling for the jedi to stop. that there was another elevator around the corner. that the one he had just entered was supposed to be closed for repairs, but he had lost the sign that indicated it as such. he hoped that the jedi wouldn\'t be inconvenienced. that particular elevator was known for getting stuck about halfway up. as the battle between the jedi master and the sith lord raged on, mace wondered if he could keep this up. the korun jedi was a master fighter, the creator of his own fighting style of vaapad, but sidious managed to match windu\'s quick and precise strikes with a ferocity that didn\'t match the kindly old man he had pretended to be all for all these years. mace could beat in terms of physical strength, but sidious was clearly just as skilled a fighter. possibly even more so. as the two combatants fought their way through the chancellor\'s office, it became clear that palpatine was trying to win this fight as quickly as possible. every blow sidious made was not meant to wound, but to kill. it also seemed that he was gaining speed with his swings. it took all of mace\'s senses to block every strike and thrust aimed at his midriff, chest, neck, and head. sidious had him on the defensive, even though he was being driven backwards towards the large windows that overlooked the city of coruscant. almost as if he was preparing to fling the jedi out them as soon as he got the chance. mace had to take back the offense. he had to find a weakness in sidious\' technique. he had to find a way to beat him. as anakin waited for the elevator to reach its destination, he felt a jolt. not from inward, but from without. the elevator stopped suddenly, throwing anakin and his head against the door, causing him to see stars. as he shook his head, he realized that he wasn\'t moving. he checked the floor listing and found out he was only twelve floors away from his destination! he had to get out. he could feel the battle all the way down here. he pulled out his lightsaber, ignited it, and in two flashes of blue light, sliced the doors open to make a path for himself. he squeezed himself out and ran to try and find a staircase. anything that would get him there in time to resolve this conflict. as mace blocked a downward swing and countered with a strike to palpatine\'s side, which he blocked, he noticed something. a flaw in palpatine\'s style. or at least, a flaw in how he held his lightsaber. every jedi\'s lightsaber was unique to how the jedi fought. sometimes the hilt was designed to be held with two hands or with one. palpatine\'s was much smaller than mace\'s, which could be held with two hands quite easily. palpatine\'s was a saber that one could easily hold one-handed, yet he chose to duel two-handed. mace had him at last. he knew his flaw. palpatine probably once fought with two lightsabers instead of just one. whatever the reason, he had decided to fight with just one, thus limiting his advantage. his two-handed grip appeared to be firmer than fighting with one hand, but that was an illusion. if mace could use that against him, he could win. releasing his left hand from his lightsaber, mace used it to send out a wave of force energy to knock palpatine back. it just about missed the chancellor, but had an equally beneficial effect for the korun jedi master. the wave of force energy shattered the window behind palpatine, causing a rush of air to be released from the sealed room. palpatine, his hands still on his saber, made the mistake of looking over his shoulder in surprise. this was mace\'s chance. he swung his lightsaber and connected with palpatine\'s. he then spun his arms in a circle that released sidious\' saber from his grip and sent it flying out the window towards the ground below. he had him. he had the sith lord at last. palpatine turned back towards master windu and began to back away slowly until he came into contact with the wall beside the open window. mace pointed his lightsaber directly at palpatine\'s throat, daring him to make a move. \"your reign is at an end, my lord,\" mace said with all the snark and venom he could muster. palpatine glanced at the door to his office, as if he was waiting for someone to come bursting in at the last minute to save him. an accomplice or his guards, it didn\'t matter to mace. he had him. he\'d defeated him. \"you have lost.\" palpatine\'s eyes flashed angry yellow at him in response, his rescuer having not arrived after all. \"no... no.. you will die,\" he cried. extending both hands in front of him, lightning burst forth from his fingers, mace barely managing to block the attack. \"i have worked too long and hard to be stopped now,\" sidious roared. \"you will fall! the jedi will fall! the republic will fall! you will all fall and i will rise!\" he did so as he raged at windu, pushing the jedi back and to his knees as he bombarded him with force lightning. \"only six floors to go,\" anakin thought as he raced up the stairs. as he did, a wave of cold terror washed over him. something horrible was happening up there. he had to get there as fast as he could. mace held his lightsaber in front of his face as palpatine tried desperately to kill him. he could feel his grip begin to loosen, his stance fading, his strength failing him. this was the true power of the sith: unrelenting and unending power. he wasn\'t fighting a normal opponent. he was fighting the dark side itself and he was losing. \"you... will... not... beat me,\" mace said through gritted teeth. \"the jedi... will not let... the sith\'s oppression... rise again!\"as he said this, he began to sink to his knees. \"ha,\" palpatine scoffed. \"you have done that well enough for me already! all those years, staring at you and that little green toad you call a master? you have no idea how much i wanted to thank you for letting me take control of the senate! how much i wanted to laugh in your face and to tell you that your greatest threat had been right here! right in front of your eyes! but of course, you were all too arrogant and self assured to see it! now... i will end you, condemn the jedi for treason, and have you all wiped out as enemies of my new sith empire!\" as soon as he heard that, mace\'s resolution hardened. he couldn\'t let it happen again. the sith had ruled once before and had been nothing but petty tyrants that delighted in the pain of others. he would not let that happen. not again! however, mace was weakening. he could feel himself slipping away. he wanted to win, but it was just... too much. the power of the dark side was too much for him. \"i cannot do it,\" he thought to himself. \"he\'s won... i have lost. i... have failed you... master yoda.\" he was about to lower his lightsaber to let the lightning take him when suddenly he heard a voice. \"are you really going to let this impostor of a sith kill you, you fool?\" the voice was that of a woman\'s. it was old, sharp, and yet soft. it berated him, yet encouraged him at the same time. the voice of a true master. \"who are you,\" mace asked out loud. as if he was talking to him, sidious answered, his eyes having turned bright yellow. \"i am darth sidious! lord of the sith, ruler of the republic! slayer of jedi,\" he cried, his voice having adopted a hollow tone to it. one that felt like the void was standing in front of him. the woman\'s voice answered as well. \"i am someone who can help you kill this man. i am someone who can help you put an end to his pathetic plans. i am someone who can teach you to be strong. but only if you are willing to go to a place darker than you have ever gone before, jedi of korun.\" she knew who he was. she could clearly see him for who he was. but the power she offered... was it of the dark side? as if in response to his thoughts, the woman seemed to berate him for asking such a stupid question. \"does it matter, you fool? the point is that you are going to die if you do not take this chance. do you accept or not?\" the voice was like a whip cracking at his brain. mace opened his eyes to gaze upon sidious. the sith lord was clearly winning. he was going to beat him if he didn\'t fight back. mace had no other choice. the fate of the republic, of the jedi order itself, rested on this battle. \"teach me,\" he thought to himself. he had given his answer. \"good,\" the woman\'s voice replied. follow my instructions exactly and you will survive this. take your left hand off of the lightsaber.\" mace did. \"good. now, open your hand and point it palm out at the impostor.\" mace did that as well. \"now... imagine a void where your hand is. imagine that there is a rift of power within. a rift that contains the living force itself. the force is aching to be released. to be directed at the fool that has abused it for decades. the fool that could have taken this galaxy long ago, but decided to bask in luxury and decadence. the fool that has used you, your brothers, and your government. direct that anger you feel. that rage. that hatred. direct it all at him and release it!\" mace did just that. from master windu\'s hand came a barrage of force lightning that struck the sith lord in his chest, eliciting only a shocked expression from him. it flung palpatine across the room and against the wall, causing paintings to fall around him. the voice spoke again. \"now, you fool! now! while he is down! finish him off once and for all!\" mace obeyed without question. he hurled himself towards sidious, his lightsaber pointed directly at his chest. the only question that went through sidious\' mind as he collided with the wall was, \"where did that power come from?\" had he underestimated the jedi after all? had master windu been practicing forbidden techniques in secret? no. no, he would have used this sooner. as he looked up from his prone position against the wall, he saw mace windu hurtling towards him, his lightsaber pointed directly at him. palpatine threw his arms up as if to strike again, but it was too late. he only managed to get one word out before it happened. that word was \"no\". then it happened. the blade impaled chancellor sheev palpatine through the chest just as anakin skywalker entered the room. palpatine stared up at the jedi master standing above him, a look of triumph in his eyes. the pain he felt was fading away. at first, it had been a searing pain in his chest, accompanied by a smell of burning fabric. the pain soon began to dull as his organs were cauterized from the inside. it had been going so well. anakin was sure to have been here by now. he was the one who informed the jedi, but he was supposed to have been here long... before... he turned his head slightly just in time to see anakin, staring in horror at him. \"i wonder... would he have helped me... or master windu? i suppose i\'ll never know.\" he smiled to himself and looked back up at master windu. \"maybe i didn\'t need him, master jedi,\" palpatine muttered. \"perhaps i just needed someone willing to do whatever it took to get the job done.\" he gave a wheezing cough, a sign that his lungs had been punctured. \"him who? who did you need,\" mace demanded. \"someone... who just needed the right type of motivation.\" he gave a chuckle. \"it\'s funny. i promised him so much, but i would never have been able to give him what he desired. i never... figured... how to prevent people from dying... would have used it... on myself first...\" a gurgle emanated from the chancellor\'s throat and a sound like a rattle soon followed. his eyes rolled back in his head and the chancellor of the galactic republic and the lord of the sith died. anakin fell to his knees and looked around the late chancellor\'s office. furniture, priceless works of art, and the corpses of jedi masters were scattered about. he looked at master windu removing his lightsaber from the chancellor\'s corpse. he\'d felt his death in the force. a wave of emptiness from the dark side of the force had flowed outward from his body, as if it was sending a message to all those that were in tune with the force. that message? the sith were dead. it felt like a call of reassurance. that it was over and that the galaxy was at peace. they were all going to be safe at last. all except padmé. \"you killed him,\" anakin whispered. \"what was that, anakin,\" master windu asked, his voice strangely calm and composed. \"you killed him! you murdered him! you were supposed to arrest him, not kill him,\" anakin roared, tears starting to form in his eyes. \"i gave him every chance to surrender, anakin,\" mace answered. \"i only fought to defend myself and in the process, i lost three jedi brothers to this monster. i know you had some affection for him, but he was responsible for so much death in the galaxy. he was responsible for this war!\" \"but he was still entitled to a trial by a grand jury!\" \"a grand jury that he would have found a way to control, skywalker! don\'t you see? one way or another, he was going to have to die!\" anakin couldn\'t believe what he was hearing. \"how can you say that?! you are a jedi master! you are dedicated to defending the peace and enforcing justice!\" he stood up, tears streaming down his face. \"how can you justify murder?\" mace turned around and glared at anakin. \"are you speaking as a jedi, anakin? or are you speaking as a friend to the sith lord?\" he began to approach the weeping jedi. \"you told me that you had discovered he was a sith lord. but how did you do this exactly? did you deduce it through careful observation and casual conversation... or did he tell you?\" anakin stood his ground against the approaching master. \"did he offer you anything in exchange for your help? is that why you came here? to aid this traitor?\" his voice was deepening and developing an edge to it. anakin\'s eyes narrowed. \"i came here to ensure that any information he had wasn\'t lost! you cost us the chance to learn all we could about the secrets of the sith! imagine what we could have learned from him!\" he stood firm as mace halted in front of him. \"anakin, let me tell you something. i have done things in this war that i will take with me to the grave. things that will haunt me forever. i killed a boy\'s father in battle as he watched. i have had to leave soldiers behind in battle. i have watched brothers and sisters die around me. but i always told myself it was for the greater good. to secure an everlasting peace that would outlast the sith. if killing a temporarily defenseless old man is what it takes to ensure that peace, i will do whatever it takes! and i know that if the situation was reversed, you would have done the same. you never shied away from drawing blood. so, i have to ask: what did you seek to gain from this sith? what did he promise you?\" anakin was cornered. he had no choice. \"he... he promised me... the ability to help someone i cared about. someone whose death i had a vision of. he promised me that he had the ability to stop people from dying. he learned it from his master, darth plagueis the wise. he said that it could only be learned... from a sith.\" as he spoke, anakin\'s entire body deflated. like a great weight was being lifted from his soul. windu scoffed. the boy had been tricked thanks to sidious manipulating his greatest weakness: his inability to let go of attachments. if it was up to him, he would excommunicate anakin from the order this instant. however, anakin was right about one thing: what the chancellor had known would indeed be useful to them in the future. and anakin was still a great asset to the jedi order. he would bide his time. \"very smart,\" the voice from before whispered in his ear. \"this boy is weak in will, but he is still a powerful jedi. bide your time and wait.\" mace knew what he had to do \"anakin,\" he said, his voice softening. \"i understand how you feel.\" he placed a hand on anakin\'s shoulder. \"i truly do.\" anakin\'s head shot up. \"what did you say, master?\" \"you cared enough for someone to risk it all for their sake. i understand that. unfortunately, so did palpatine. he was using you, anakin. whatever he promised you, he would not deliver it. he said so himself before he died. he was lying to you.\" anakin\'s shoulder shook as he tried to hold back the sobs. in his heart... he knew it to be true. the sith were built on deception and lies. but he had wanted to believe. he wanted to believe that he could prevent padmé from dying as his mother had. but it was too late for her now. he was going to lose her. \"what do i do now,\" he asked. \"remain on the council, anakin. i will help you and whoever it is that is in trouble. we will rebuild the republic and the jedi order. trust me as i now trust you.\" anakin looked in his master\'s eyes. mace had promised anakin that if he had managed to stay in the temple until his return, he would have earned his trust. he hadn\'t. yet here he was. being told that as of this moment, mace windu trusted anakin. so why was it that assurance made him uneasy. but he had nothing else to lose. \"thank you, master windu. thank you.\" as mace smiled at him, the peace and serenity that radiated off the korun master seemed wrong to anakin. it clashed with the horror around them. the bodies of the dead jedi and the body of sheev palpatine presenting a stark contrast to how master windu appeared to be feeling. anakin couldn\'t place it either, but something about mace\'s eyes seemed off. for a moment... they looked as if they were turning... yellow.']"},{"Movie":"Star

the cell to confront the rebel scum. nothing could have prepared him for what he saw next. it was her. she was much older than when he had last seen her. she was taller and had longer montrals and head tails. but he would know her anywhere. the young togruta simply glared at him. she didn\'t recognise him. he wasn\'t surprised, why would she? she would probably have hated him if she did. well, more than she evidently did already. maybe she was right to. vader turned and left the cell, the stormtroopers following him out. he could sense her confusion at this, she\'d never been any good at hiding her emotions. she had been expecting pain, had prepared herself for it. now, she didn\'t know quite what to do. \"she is not to be harmed. i want guards outside this cell at all times. no exceptions. do i make myself clear?\" \"yes sir\" answered the trooper. \"buts sirthe interrogation?\" stammered an officer timidly. \"the interrogation is over. i have learned all i need from this rebel\" vader snapped. \"ii just thought-\" vader choked him with the force, lifting him off his feet \"are you questioning me lieutenant?\" he asked in a slow, dangerous voice. \"n no, no sir\" the officer spluttered, clutching at the invisible hand around his throat. vader dropped him and swept away without another word. after that, vader avoided the detention level as much as possible. the former jedi padawan brought back too many painful memories. he tried unsuccessfully to put her out of his mind. finally, a few weeks later, vader couldn\'t bear it anymore. he had to go. he practically ran down to the detention level. when he arrived, something didn\'t feel quite right, but he couldn\'t put his finger on it. he could sense a slight disturbance in the force. as he neared her cell, he heard screams of pain. her screams. the stormtroopers at the door knew they were done for. they didn\'t even try to beg for their lives, knowing it would be pointless. they had knowingly disobeyed vader and they would die for it. vader was a whirlwind of fury, destruction and death. he tore through the small cell, killing everyone. everyone but her. he used the force to unlock the restraints holding her up and she collapsed into his arms. he held her, trying to find something to say. for the first time in his life, he was lost for words. he looked down into her bright blue eyes and saw recognition, betrayal and distrust. a/n thanks for reading! hope you liked it. please review and let me know what you thought. i am not sure if i want to continue this or leave it as it is.

armor passed through its torso and detonated its battery pack. setting off a chain reaction by detonating the droids remaining armaments and a droideka reactor this explosion destabilized the ships core that led to a much larger explosion. as the droid\'s charges escape a chill runs down their spines as it does for a hand full of others who\'s life have been touched by this droid. though those who were force sensitive felt a ripple with in the force itself and those few who knew how to peered into the vail of the force to see this ripples source. said they witnessed a great bastion fall to protect to tiny embers of hope that from this bastion ruin may spark a simple flame or roaring inferno just like how one droids\' death destroyed an empyreal super star destroyer. seventy four year prior a b1 battle droid one made the same as millions of others rolled off the assembly line and into a large transport it was then taken to a hidden warehouse off world. three weeks later the clone wars began and battle sprung up one after another across the galaxy. two years after that b83309z was activated for the first time since leaving the factory of its creation five weeks later it is redeployed on the battle field after the third time it was badly damaged in battle. b83309z mrk3 activated as it rolled off a factory assembly line that had been converted to repair or build droids from working parts scavenged off dead droids. none functional parts was sent to fabrication to be melted down and reforged then added to this first line. all repaired and modified droids are given the additional tag of mrk then the current number of the times it had been repaired or modified. though with each version they became more and more open to defects and failures the cobbled together droids marched back onto the battle field marching mindlessly to their deaths again all but one of them that is. b83309z mrk3 marched with its battalion watching them fall one after another before a grenade blasted the remainder of the group to parts and sending b83309z mrk3 flying into a wall and damaging its transmitter and processor seven hours later sparks shot out of the droid\'s neck joint as it started to boot up. \'error start up sequence error error error start up failure system status online a.i. corrupted core connection unstable unit status error mission status error diagnostic error.\' the core or core computer that communicated orders to the droids though they could function autonomously the core allowed them to function in greater unison. the core tried to take control of the broken droid and managed to get it on its feat as the corrupted ai tried to assert control over the droid as another large jet of sparks shot from its neck as the two contradicting commands fought for control over the droid but the core being much more powerful than the droids simple processor forced it to marched to get repaired. on its way back two other droids found a group of lost and wounded clones the core calculating low threat rate ordered the damaged droid to assist them. the droid limped over to its companions only stopping to pick up a discarded blaster. as commands contradictions and errors fought for control over its limited and damaged processor started to over load. more sparks shot out of the droid\'s head and neck as the other two prepared to execute the clones. the droid\'s processor hit its limit as a horrible almost painful scream emanated from the droid as its processor over loaded. the droid then shot the other two droids before collapsing to the ground still screaming. as the shocked clones scrambled to escape. one of them a clone named jury rigs or j rigs for short stopped. like his nick name suggested he was good with machines and as he moved past the droid he noticed the droids problem. for some rezone that not even he knew why he did it he grabbed and ripped out the droid\'s transmitters instantly silencing the scream. \'connection cut a.i. purged unit status error error error active.\' the droid started to stand up its head bent by the fall giving it an almost confused look and stared at the clone that had freed him. j rigs took a frightened step back internally swearing at himself for fixing the literal killing machine that was now staring right at him. but what happened next shocked him as the droid looked down at its self it then dropped its weapon took a step forward then just stopped and continued to stare at him in it strangely confused looking way. but seeing an opportunity the clone took a step forward causing the droid to take a step back. the clone repeated tell he was able to grab the dropped blaster with a loud. \"ha.\" as he pointed it at the droid who stared for a moment before looking around it then grabbed up a pipe and again mimicked the clone and with a loud. \"ha\" the droid said pointing the pipe like a blaster. as one of the less injured clones ran back and said. \"what the hell are you doing we need to get back to bass stop playing with that broken clanker and get moving.\" \"i um sure.\" j rigs said before following the other clone and following them both was the barely functional droid. that would one day become the same droid that sacrificed its self to protect its charges the same droid that survived seventy four years of being hunted shot at and repeatedly damaged. each time the galaxy broke him he\'d rebuild himself stronger smarter faster than before. though like with organics some scars can run deep and never truly heal but i\'m getting a head of my self now that you know our hero time to meet the victims. one year before the completion of the second death star a massive deposit of energy crystals was unearthed in a section of space filled with several resource rich planets. with these resources they could easily build a third death star but these where on the far outer rim territory\'s where even the empire barely held any influence. now they could have done the empires standard and taken it by force, but this would have been a long costly venture. as it was far off and it would have sparked conflict with not only that sector but the surrounding five sectors. now they couldn\'t mount a large scale defense but it would have been costly and time consuming to corner and hold the six minimum sectors. and do to the current state of the galaxy the needed fleets troops and resources would have been hard to gather together so the empire chose another route. as they only needed the one sector and there just happened to be an easy to manipulate member of one of the royal families that was more than eager to give them what they wanted in exchange for the crown. all they would have to do was wipe out everyone ahead of him in line and when he was king heed give them what they wanted but if the empire where to do so directly it would arouse suspicion. so, they paid a large group of pirates, to attack the city and kill the needed members of the royal family and that\'s where this story truly begins. sirens blared as the inhabitants fled and the city burned, and the intentionally misinformed pirates fought the colony guards. the pirates pillaged and murdered as the guards numbers had started to dwindle an elite group of pirates mercenaries and bounty hunters fought there way to where the royal family lived. though they too had faced heavy losses at the hands of the royal guard but eventually their greater numbers and use of armored vehicles they cleared a path to the royal families. well all but one that is a seven year old girl who had been in the garden and under the watch full eye of her personal guard and his daughter who fancied herself as a guard in training. but the guard thought it was more likely the girl just wanted a reason to go to the palace to see her friend. though he had to admit she might not be the only rezone as she had been trying to get him to train her in combat. that he had reluctantly agreed to thinking that she\'d drop it after the first session but to his surprise she had not only wanted to continue but had shown surprising talent and skill and drive. why she wanted to be the princess privet guard he couldn\'t figure out why she\'d wanted his job and not just royal guard or aim higher for captain of the guard. she only seemed to want this one position, but he did know she was determined so heed help her any way he could. though at the present moment he was glad she had wanted the training as she could at least defend herself he thought as the shuttle carrying the two girls and a droid pilot lifted off. little did he know that this would be the last time he would see his daughter and young charge. meanwhile on the shuttle. \"we can\'t just run away those are our people down there we can\'t just abandon them.\" said the young kiffar princess annay sulfum. \"look i don\'t like it either, but the royal guards job is to protect the royal family there just doing their job now and hope that in doing so this all works out now.\" a loud boom interrupted her as it rocked the ship as a fuel depot on the ground exploded and knocked the young guard off her feet and head first into her friends\' lap. \"oof.\" the princess gasped as the impact had nocked the wind out of her. \"oh sorry are you ok.\" she said blushing and trying to offer aid to the princes. the young guard was named rolliys davro was a young female kiffar like the princess and at first glance the two girls looked close enough alike to be sisters. well that is if it wasn\'t for their differing family markings annay has a golden band with a red trim and a thin blue line on her forehead. where rolliys had a dark green triangle with a thin blue lined triangle inside of the other triangle on each cheek. the blue mark a sign of authority and or a connection to the royal house. two more shots hit the shuttle but again the shields held but just barely unfortunately the same couldn\'t be said for the droid. the shock nocked it out of its chair and it slid along the floor smashing into stuff as it went. \"oh no.\" the young guard said as she jumped into the pilot seat. as she had only had a basic training with speeder she had only the foggiest idea what she was doing. as she yanked the throttle back burning through a lot more fuel then was necessary to brake orbit only to find herself being chased by three ugly star fighters. she desperately tried to figure out the weapons systems but instead switched on the ships hyper drive sending them off in a random direction. setting forth the beginning for a set of events that would aid the fall of the empire.']"},{"Movie":"Star Wars","MovieTitleID":"10000004","Title":"Vader's

survived], as well as ahsoka and bascially makes everyones lives a living hell. ( anakin/ darth vader\'s pov) i watched as clones dragged multiple unconscious jedi into the temple, i made them pick up them up and carry them, i notice ahsoka in rex\'s arms, she was bleeding from her lekku, \" take any injured to the halls of healing!\"i shouted , i continued to watch as they were brought in, not following any of them as they had orders to take them to their rooms, and lock them in, though i did take notice that one master had woken up and was trying to get to a boy, i walked over, \"what is the problem?\" i asked, \" she is the master of the boy over there.\" one of the clones answered, i quickly looked over the woman, recognizing her as master depa billaba, i walked over to the boy, ignoring her glare, clearly she thought i was going to harm him, i gently took him from the other clone and walked back to master billaba, \"i know what it is to worry over your padawan, i won\'t put any of you through that.\" i said, handing the boy to her, before backing off, watching as she gently cradled the boy to her chest, her eyes scanning over the boy for injuries, when she found none, she went peacefully with the clones, i smiled, before my comlink went off, \"this is darth vader.\" i answered, \"obi-wan kenobi has been found, he is on coruscant, on under-level 1563.\" admiral tarkin said, i sigh, obi-wan, yoda, and stass allie were the only ones to have escaped getting captured, palpatine is handling yoda, and i am handling allie and obi-wan, \" i\'ll be right there.\" i said, he cackled and hung up, i turned around and found the nearest clone captain \" put all of the padawans and master\'s in the same rooms, put ahsoka tano, plo koon and shaak ti in my room.\" i ordered, he nodded, and i walked to a nearby speeder, and was off. [ time passes] i found obi-wan in an abandoned warehouse, he didn\'t even say anything, he just lunged at me, \"you have kidnapped almost the entirety of the jedi order, you have betrayed us!\" he yelled at me . i didn\'t answer and focused on knocking him out, i finally found an opening and force pushed him into a wall and held him there, i got out a sedative and injected it into his arm, he fell unconscious, i caught him, \"i\'m sorry.\" i whispered to him, cradling him close to him to my chest, i walked back to my speeder, i laid him down in the back seat, i made sure to drive very carefully and checked frequently on him, i got back to the temple fairly quickly, several clones met me , \"we\'ll take him to your room.\"they said , i nodded, and watched as they picked him up, and followed them to my room, we got there in 3 minutes, i quickly scanned the room, ahsoka was curled into herself in the corner, plo was sitting in front of her, trying to calm her down, shaak was sitting off to the side, meditating, the clones laid obi-wan down on one of the beds, the others seemed to be ignoring me, which is fine, i need to work on the rules for the order, i sat down on my bed, which is by the door, \"you are dismissed.\" i said to the clones, they quickly left to go back to their posts or patrols, i took out my datapad and started on the rules. rules 1: do not go outside the temple unless ordered to. 2: all jedi are to attend breakfast, lunch and dinner, no expectations, they also must eat everything on their plates. 3: jedi masters and padawans are to remain together, 4:those with any type of mental disorder will attend therapy sessions. 5:the council may only meet with an imperial head present. 6: all knightings must first be passed by darth vader. 7: all padawanships must be passed by darth vader. 8: all force sensitive younglings will be found by imperials. 9:all jedi above the age 13 must attend re-education classes. 10:anyone who was active in the war must attend therapy sessions. (master plo koon\'s pov) i was dragged from my initial room to skywalker\'s room, i saw shaak was already there, though no one really knows this, we had a secret relationship when we were teens, though we gave it up as we got older, but neither one of us ever stopped loving each other, and when i found lil\'soka it was like we had gained a daughter, shaak even told me at one point that ahsoka was like her daughter, i had told her the same, honestly if i could had, i would have left the order with lil\'soka and shaak the first time i heard her say that, but 1: the council wouldn\'t of allowed me to take ahsoka, and 2:shaak wouldn\'t of left anyways, \"do you know what is happening?\" she asked me, i shook my head, sitting down on one of the beds, there were 4 all in close proximity of each other, there was a mini library to the right, bathroom right next to it, and 4 bedrooms that were currently blocked off, a living room to the left and a mini kitchen next to the living room, i sat down next to shaak, at closer look it was clear that she had been crying, i opted not to ask her if she was okay, as it was pretty clear what was wrong, i was ripped out of my thoughts by the door opening, and clones from the 501st entered, with lil\'soka, they laid her down on a bed and quickly left, i rushed over to her, checking over her, she looked fine expect for her lekku, i gently stroked her face, shaak was sitting beside me, looking over her with a mother\'s eye. disclaimer:i don\'t own star wars, sadly, if i did ahsoka would be the main character of the prequel trilogy. i promised to have only 2 in-progress stories, i am now bumping that number up to 4, i am truly sorry but i have never been able to keep stories to myself.'][Chapter 2] ['hi, so i got my very first review which i am happy to answer. sassyahsoka- thank you, no, it is more of he is revising the jedi order, and again no ahsoka is forced to stay by him, if you read the book it will explain it better. i hope that answers your questions. nachothedrake-thank you. (master mace windu\'s pov) [i will write a lot in master windu\'s pov because i like doing so, well that and i feel like they missed so much opportunity in him] i woke up slowly, the first thing i noticed is that i was restrained, the second thing, my lightsaber was missing and the third i was being watched, i turned my head, skywalker was at my bedside, i glared at him with so much venom that if it was actual venom he would already be writhing on the ground in pain, \"you shouldn\'t move too much, the med droid says that you are lucky to be alive.\" skywalker said, he\'s probably darth something by now, \"there is no such thing as luck, you kept me alive for a reason, what is it?\" i growled, \" despite what you might think, i do care about the jedi, and i don\'t want to see any of you dead, unfortunately you seem determined to make that more difficult than necessary with all your self-sacrificing.\" skywalker said, that shocked me, he did care, but then again this is most likely some elaborate plan to keep \"his family\" together [obi-wan, padme, and ahsoka {remember the twins are not born yet, give it a couple days though}], \" you probably forced former padawan tano back by now.\" i said, he looked uncomfortable, i knew it , \"she won\'t be happy here, none of us will, this may be our home but how can we be happy restricted without any way of knowing what is happening in the outside world.\" i reasoned, \" well, the council will be able to still meet, once we find master allie, with a imperial officer present.\" skywalker said, i sighed and mentally decided to ignore, you know so i don\'t lose my sanity, he apparently got the message and left but not before saying, \"the droids say you will be able to leave the halls of the healing tomorrow, there is a datapad in your room with all the rules and regulations, i expect all of them to be followed.\" he said, i glared at him as he left. ( ahsoka\'s pov) i feel like i just walked through hell, 7 times, seriously my lekku feels like it is on fire, and anakin is still forcing me to attend \"re-education classes, therapy lessons and meals.\" despite the facts that 1: i can\'t focus because of the pain. and 2: i have anorexia since i was 13, and he\'s known ever since i became his padawan well over 2 years ago, in fact this has led to multiple halls of healing stays from me relapsing, and he knows better then anyone that forcing me to eat will not help, trust me, he tried once, and i purged,let\'s just say he never tried that again, in fact he kept apologising, \" lil\'soka, it\'s lunch.\" ploplo said, i sighed, getting up from my position on the floor where i had been attempting to meditate, that didn\'t work, master ti smiled gently at me, understanding my dilemma, we walked to the eating hall, which was almost full meaning most jedi had learned their lesson in skipping meals, several had to be punished with electrocution, including myself as the first time i was forced to the eating hall, i had refused to eat, which of course led to punishment, that hurt, a lot, we sat down at a table already occupied by master secura, master billaba and her padawan, caleb dume, master billaba was keeping him close to her, as many jedi were with their padawans, master plo was doing the same with me, well when he could, with me having to attend 1 more therapy class then him, and all of the padawan classes, clones are standing guard, and despite the fact that i know the really have no choice, i can\'t help but feel betrayed by them, i saw many from the 501st, my brothers, \" are you well today ahsoka?\" i heard master secura ask, i look up at her, nodded and went back to glaring at my food, wishing it would vanish, i felt a presence behind me, \" eat your food, little one, or this time i\'ll have the clones force-feed you.\" anakin said, i wanted to throw the food just to spite him, but i thought otherwise and forced myself to take a bite to try and satisfy him, when he didn\'t leave, i realized he gonna stay there until i finished, i resigned myself to this fact and began to eat, i knew that everyone at the table knew about my condition has the jedi council made sure that everyone knows of someone\'s mental illnesses as they can\'t keep eyes on them all of the time, so the jedi are expected to keep eyes on those with mental illnesses, i finally finished that damn meal, and anakin finally moved on, i sighed, curling up into ploplo\'s side, feeling way to full, he wrapped his arm around me, attempting to help me through the feeling. yeah, so this story is going to feature a lot of mental illness as i don\'t believe that you can fight in a war and not have ptsd, my uncle fought in vietnam and he was never the same afterwards according to my mother, as he hasn\'t been in contact with my family since the early 2000\'s, and i never meant him, thank you to everyone who has

small child watched her mother frantically move from one room to another, gathering a great many things. everything she grabbed, she smashed into a suitcase; things were being tossed and thrown, and the child was looking at the case thinking that there was no way it would be able to latch and close properly. father pounded up the stairs again after pacing back and forth in the living. most of the morning he gave her space to mourn whatever she was upset about. however, that only gave her mother time to decide to pack up all her belongings. \"you can\'t go, becka. if you find her, she will be exposed.\" it was unusual for bridgette to see her father so panicky. he was the rock of the familythe wall protecting bridgette and her mother. now, he was a timid mess, terrified of her mother going and exposing whatever he claimed she would be exposing. becka paused for a moment at his words, staring distantly at the overflowing suitcase. her mother started to sob violently into her hands. bridgette frowned, walking up to her mom and tugged at her patchy dress. \"everything is alright, mommy. you don\'t need to cry.\" mother looked down at the child. her expression could only be read as thoughtful and longing. bridgette wanted to ask what she was thinking about. before she could, her mother shook her head. \"no. i must go. let go, child. get off. george, i refuse to stay here with this child any longer. i cannot. it breaks my heart every time - \" the woman stopped, hissing. \"i can\'t even looked at bridgette\'s face without thinking about her. i have to make sure she is alright. i have to go, george. quite frankly, i don\'t plan on coming back. don\'t bother convincing me otherwise.\" \"no, momma! don\'t go!\" the child cried out, clutching the woman again. \"get off me, bridgette!\" she shouted, give her leg a hard shake. the child let go. although she knew she could have held on tightly for much longer and much more intense shakes, bridgette released, feeling something inside her quiver and break. the tears came in rivers now, but both parents shrugged the child off. \"you might end up making things worse, becka! please listen to me,\" father begged. he let go of her reluctantly, too so she went back to closing the trunk and making way for the front door. \"i can\'t leave her alone anymore. we were wrong. we should have fought this together instead of abandoning our daughter.\" one foot was out the door. \"you know we can\'t run. you can\'t run from him, becka. no one can. if you leave, it will expose us all and we will all be killed. please, trust me on this that you need to stay. it\'s safer with you here. trust me.\" it was those two words that made her mother turn around, giving a glare so full of fire that her face began to burn. \"i trust no one. especially you.\" the shot at her father wounded him, the child could tell. yet if there were any tears in his eyes, he didn\'t let bridgette see them. instead, father turned around and walked upstairs, shutting the bedroom door behind him quietly having left the child to cry all her tears alone on the floor. now she was the one who had been abandoned.'][Chapter 2] ['a/n: i know i\'m awful at sticking with things, but now that i\'m stuck in the hospital, what better time than to rewrite this story again and continue it? enjoy! wild, caged, and free chapter one: away from home twenty years later... bridgette opened a can of soggy noodles. she scrunched her face at the sight, but food was food and she needed the energy to sustain another day of training in back alley beside her house. the alley was just dark enough for no one to notice a force-user practicing away with a stick and using the force to shatter garbage bins and thrown out boxes. so far, she went unnoticed. she wrapped her fork around the noodles, swallowing the forkful whole. her taste buds begged for something different as it reeked of expiring ages ago. there wasn\'t much choice in the matter. it was difficult enough to find whole cans of food let alone ones that hadn\'t already expired. no one down on level 277 of coruscant threw out good food. only the rich could pick and choose to throw away perfectly nutritious meals because they had plenty more where that came from. down on level 277, there weren\'t any rich families. none that she knew about anyway, because if she did, she would be sneaking through their garbage trying to find better food than expired noodles from a dented can. just as she took her last bite, she felt a familiar aura in the force: her birth father. immediately, she ran to the door to open it up for him. she did this every time in hopes that there would be a happy greetingor at least one that didn\'t have him drunk off his rear as he was right then. still, she mustered up a wide smile for him. he was clearly drunk before arrival. the rims of his eyes were red while the rest of his eye was completely bloodshot. whenever he tried to speak, it only came out in mumbling nonsense in which the only thing she could truly make out were the words \"i\'m sorry\". \"no need, father. how about we go to fair-front and get something to eat?\" she suggested, hoping they could do something fun. he nodded. \"i\'ll take a nap. then we go,\" he managed to slur. bridgette\'s father walked past her then, walking up to his room and shutting the door behind him. this wasn\'t out of the norm. this happened every time; almost exactly the same as if this scenario was stuck on an endless loop. yet, she kept trying each time to greet him kindly and strike up a conversation about his adventures. of course, the end result was always the same. there was never any progress. in fact this was the most progress there had been. soon, they would be at the fair-front munching on some cakes and drinks and hopefully he can sleep off the alcohol before then. that would make up for his long absence. her father started leaving for long stretches of time soon after her mother walked out on the both of them. he was a horrible wreck after that day; the alcohol and extended leave being the physical evidence of that. sometimes he would leave for months on end only to come back for a few days. other times, he would be gone for years then come home for a mere few hours. sad to say, bridgette sometimes felt he was a stranger. because of an absent father, when she was younger, she had to scavenge for food after everything in the house had been eaten. the younger she was, the harder it was; however, she made a good friend with one of the smugglers doing business on level 277 who was able to teach her tricks to survive whenever she was on her own. she stepped out, heading south down the street. it was the skills that han the smuggler taught which helped her now to sneak into one of the club\'s kitchens and snatch herself a few rolls with sauced meat stuffed inside. what bridgette learned entirely on her own, however, was to toy with some of the people she dealt with whenever she was caught. she relished the teasing and playing with them like a child poking fun at another to chase them. like a game of tag. the kitchens were empty. through the hole in the wall, she could see the chefs serving the food to those sitting at the bar. taking this opportunity when no one was looking, she added a few cans of non-expired noodles and beans to last her three days. bridgette regretted not bringing a bigger satchel before leaving her house. she would have been able to take a lot more with how long the chef\'s took chatting up the customers wearing scantily clad outfits. the few cans and bread would have to be enough for now. bridgette went back out the kitchen door and into the alleyway. she debated on going back home or finding another restaurant or club to wander into. she stood outside the club for a moment, looking out onto the the landing platform where ships and transports settled from the above levels. looking up into the far away sky, a familiar ship came down, resting on the platform. it\'s ramp came down in a cloud of smoke revealing a tall furry creature groaning as he stepped foot on the dirty ground of level 277. she ran to him as fast as her feet could take her. \"chewie!\" she exclaimed, jumping up to hug him tight around the neck. the hair on his body tickled her arms. chewbacca moaned in excitement. \"hey, kid.\" han solo stepped off the ramp as coolly as ever with a smile that never aged. \"how was your adventure?\" she asked. chewie answered before he could with a loud, annoyed groan. \"that much trouble, huh? well, can\'t say i\'m all that surprised.\" bridgette gave a sly smirk to han in mockery. han cocked a brow and pointed a finger at her. \"listen, kid. you try dealing with five different clans who are as impatient as jabba the hut. then come and tell me how little trouble you would be in.\" \"okay, i concede. so what brings you back down here in the dark basement of coruscant?\" \"you did, actually.\" the ramp closed, sealing itself as han searched for words. \"the resistance is in a bit of a predicament. i figure you may be able to help. the first order has a weapon that can destroy systems. it appears they found the resistance base and are planning on using their weapon to destroy the planet.\" bridgette felt a pang of sorrow for han and the rest of the resistance. this wouldn\'t be the first time han asked for help. she declined every time for various reasons, most of which were hard to explain. \"i don\'t think there is anything i can do. i\'m not sure how can help. sounds like it\'s too late. we should probably be evacuating the resistance now.\" \"well\" han hesitated again, rubbing the back of his neck. she narrowed her eyes, knowing full well that he was hiding something. \"i know it\'s a lot to ask knowing so little about all that\'s been going on, but we could use the help with the resistance.\" chewie hissed at him, ashamed that han was holding back the full story from bridgette. if han was holding back, things must have been really bad with the resistance. did she even want to know what was going on? her life here was no fairytale but at least it was a simplistic life where she didn\'t have to worry about anyone but herself. selfish as it may sound, bridgette always found it difficultalmost exhaustingwhen there was someone else that needed help. normally she would avoid it completely, which is precisely why she always turned han down whenever he asked her to come with him. here, it was just that much easier and predictable. however, the itch to leave was always there insidegrowing greater by the day. \"what is it you clearly aren\'t telling me?\" she asked, raising her brows in earnest. han sighed. \"that might be better for my wife to explain. there\'s a lot to do and discuss, but you might be the only one who can help us.\" chewbacca groaned again stating that that wasn\'t completely true. she stared at the both of them, debating whether or not to push further. clearly, han was in slight distress with telling bridgette much of anything. she could go with him, have a new adventure. or, she could stay here where it was safe and familiar. twenty-five years of familiarity was hard to break. a stumbling figure caught her attention just as she opened her mouth to speak. the figure was only fifty feet away, handing money over to a dealer leaning against his rusty speeder. her heart sank watching the transaction. her father. her jaw clenched and her eyes burned with water. turning quickly away from the pathetic scene, she nodded to han. \"i\'ll go.\" han\'s eyes lit up. \"great. do you need to go pack? chewie and i can help carry your things to the falcon.\" \"no, i\'ll be quick. i only have a handful of things,\" she said, already making her way back to her house. she had to be quick. if her father were decide to come home, she didn\'t want to run into him having made the decision to leave level 277. she opened the front door of her home, feeling an overwhelming sense of loneliness creep over her despite knowing han and chewie were only blocks away waiting just for her. in haste, bridgette put away all the rations she took from the club into the cabinet. she was sure she wouldn\'t be needing it at the moment. she walked up to her room, hoping for a sense of nostalgia that might change her mind about leaving. it had been quite a few years since she went in there. whenever she slept, her arrangement was on the couch downstairs. she tried to avoid it because of the painful memories of being abandoned by her mother and frequently left by her father. the room was almost entirely pink. no one ever bothered changing anything about the room as she grew older. it stayed the same. the same childish stuffed animals and small rocking chair in the corner. it looked like a little girl\'s rooman infant\'s roomnot a woman of twenty-five years of age. even so, she loved the child-like feel of it. her favorite part of the room was the picture on the nightstand. it was of her as a very small infant being held by her mother with the picture of han, little bridgette, and chewie in front of the falcon tucked in the corner of the frame. a smile crept to her face as she recalled the memory. the picture of her mother and herself as a baby was just as smile-provoking. she never once saw her mother happier than in that picture holding her closely to her chest in a hospital bed. it must have been easier for her mother to like her back then. it\'s impossible to hold a baby and not be joyful. sometimes bridgette would wonder what happened for her mother to never show her love like that again. at least, as far as she could remember before she left, her mother never showed as much as she did when she was born. bridgette snatched the picture frame with her favorite pictures, shoving it in her forest green sack. the only things she packed were a few trinkets and her only other pair of clothes. she didn\'t need to take another look around the room. she had little doubt she would be back again in hopes to see her father. tyeing the sack closed, she went straight back to the falcon where the ramp was opened for her to board. \"hey, kid!\" han said with his crooked smirk. \"ready for a new adventure?\" bridgette nodded, smirking with confidence as if she were truly on a mission to save the resistance. \"ready as ever.\" \"that\'a girl!\" chewie groaned in approval. \"well, it\'s good to finally convince you to join us, kid.\" the two of them started up the falcon, lifting off the platform and flying up to through 276 levels of coruscant to the surface. each level you went up, the cleaner and brighter it became. the sun\'s rays leaked down into the higher levels making the estates glisten in their bright green lawn. the sight was magnificent. never in all her years did she believe houses could get so big or bright. han kept his eyes on the path as he said, \"if you look in that brown satchel, there is a present. it was leia\'s when she was a little girl. her adoptive parents gave it to her, saying that even when we are older, we should always keep like a child. we need to remember the fun, the innocent times in a world of darkness. she was given this doll around the time of the rising empire. leia said it reminded her of you now and thought you should have it. says your like the daughter she wished we had. i don\'t doubt she always felt outnumbered with just ben and i.\" he chuckled at that last part. \"you are a daughter to us, know that.\" bridgette searched the satchel, taking out a doll. she smiled at it, but then looked up, frowning. it was a strange gift to give a grown women; han must have mentioned to his wife about her absent parents. pity wasn\'t something she appreciated, but she tried her best to appreciate the doll despite having never met han\'s wife in person. \"thanks,\" she managed to say. though the gift was sweet, bridgette couldn\'t help but be distracted by all the beauty of the surface of coruscant. there was so much beauty in the shining skyscrapers and the high-tech speeders and ships that ran around the cities. so much to look at and so little time as han put the falcon into space, initiating hyper-speed. coruscant disappeared into nothing.  the rebel base was underground, partially hidden except for the garage of fighter ships. pilots of all species and races were working on their vehicles, others were chatting with one another, drinking from canteens. ships were flying in and out of the base, so their landing went almost unnoticed. two figures approached the ship. a dark-haired man and a short, older woman both confidently strolled up to han. the woman embraced him fondly. \"so this is the bridgette i\'ve been hearing a lot about.\" the woman\'s eyes landed on her admirably. they glistened with a happiness that shocked bridgette after hearing the claims of the resistance being in such urgent trouble. such behavior didn\'t suit the situation. in fact, it seemed that everyone was rather happy or at the very least, not concerned at all with the impending weapon that could destroy an entire system. the man with dark hair and charming smile extended his hand. \"nice to meet you. can\'t believe how well this day is turning out. not only do we have a treaty to end the war, but now we have a second jedi in training on our side. couldn\'t get any better than today, isn\'t that right, general?\" leia beamed at him. \"you are quite right, poe. today is a day to celebrate, which is why i\'m glad you decided to come with han. we are having a big dinner tonight. would you like to join us, bridgette?\" \"can\'t imagine what else i would be doing. i\'m already here, i might as well.\" bridgette put her hands behind her back, tugging at the ends of her hair. they all just stared at one another awkwardly for a moment. \"alright,\" han said, breaking the silence, \"how about we show bridgette around?\" leia agreed, leading the way into the base. there were more rebels than bridgette ever dreamed off. the halls and rooms were teeming with people and creatures chatting about everything from war stories to family problems to what their favorite sport was to watch on the holonet. \"most of these rooms are just for seating and lounging about on our off days when there isn\'t anything to be concerned about,\" leia explained as she led them down hallway after hallway, room after room. \"this is the cafeteria. we serve three meals a day at seven-hundred, thirteen-hundred, and eighteen-hundred. this is the room with vending in case three meals a day isn\'t enough for you\" poe inserted himself. \"trust me, the vending is a life saver. don\'t forget to stock up on snacks before you go on a mission. first time i did that, i will never make that mistake again.\" bridgette faked a smile at his attempt at humor. hard to laugh or pay much attention to what they were saying when she was trying to take everything in. she couldn\'t remember the last time she saw anything new. not to mention this was going to be her new home. that in itself was terrifying. of course, she won\'t be showing her fear. \"this is the hallway where all the bedchambers are. everyone is assigned a room. none are shared for any reason, so you will be getting your own as well.\" leia pulled out a key, handing it to bridgette. \"yours is room 124. i can have poe bring your things to your room if you like.\" she shook her head. \"i just have this sack.\" now there was pity in poe\'s eyes. that made her feel sick and her blood boil. she narrowed her eyes at him. \"i\'m not materialistic,\" she hissed. han chuckled. \"okay, let\'s keep this tour moving.\" leia escorted them all to chamber 124 where bridgette dropped off her belongings before they continued to the tour. she brought the lot of them to a large room with a circular table in the middle. monitors lined the walls and a holoboard three times the size of chewbacca hung above the center ceiling. it was a room full of technology bridgette never saw before, and it was difficult not to run in and burst out into a million questions about what each thing does. \"neat, isn\'t it?\" poe asked, coming up behind her. \"of course,\" she said, smirking, \"but my guess is you couldn\'t start up even half of what is in here.\" han coughed, hiding a laugh. \"sometimes bridgette can be a bit rude. to everyone. try not to take it personally.\" poe cocked a brow. \"sounds personal to me.\" \"because it is,\" bridgette said. he gave han a look that said i told you so. \"alright, children,\" leia piped in mockingly, \"now this room is for missions only. we don\'t spend a whole lot of time in here unless it\'s our tech staff who keeps an eye out on information being brought in and other observations across our security cameras located all around the base. there is also a medbay here but hopefully knowing where that is located won\'t be necessary for you. i\'ve got to get back to lady hux on some things before we have our dinner tonight.\" the general walked out with poe tagging along behind her. \"nice to meet you, bridgette,\" he called out without so much as looking back at her. \"i think you made quite the impression on poe,\" han said with a loud laugh. \"you know you could be nicer.\" bridgette rolled her eyes. \"says you! you make fun of people all the time.\" he shrugged. \"i\'ve never really abided by what i teach.\"  she sat at the edge of the bed in chambers 124. she stroked the doll\'s hair, wondering what in all the galaxy made her come to a strange planet with more than enough strangers to fill the first five levels of coruscant. well, the answer was easy; however, she was still in a state of shock that a wave of emotion brought her to agree to han\'s invitation to join the resistance. her whole life she tried ignoring the disappointing times when her father fell through on his promises. there was no surprise that he was out getting more for his fix than going to the fair-front but it bothered her all the same, pushing her to make irrational decisions. would she go with han if her father hadn\'t disappointed her? the resistance was in trouble, han told her one last time, but that wasn\'t enough all those times before to leave her home. she went through her satchel and pulled out the picture of her and her mother. bridgette got her mother\'s long golden locks. her father\'s dark brown hair somehow didn\'t overcome the her mother\'s genes. bridgette stroked the picture, wishing things had been different twenty years ago. whatever made her mother leave, she felt as though she would never fully know or understand. every time she asked her father, he ignored her and rummaged the cupboards for alcohol. he never spoke of her, never dared touch the subject. it was like stepping into a minefield. yet, there was a treaty. if there was a treaty, that meant no war. if there was no war, why did han say that the resistance needed her help? maybe it was silly to question why there wasn\'t a war. after all, she may not have helped, but she would get to enjoy the aftermath with a nice banquet dinner to celebrate. food was always nice. just the thought of it made her mouth water. at the moment, it was difficult to picture the possibilities of food she would get to try. the clock above the door read seventeen-fifty. she supposed by the time she walked all the way down to the cafeteria, the banquet would start. putting the picture on the stand next to the bed, she stepped into the hallway with a few others coming out from their chambers and made her way to the cafeteria. as she walked, she kept wandering just why han asked her to come here as if there was still a war ensuing.']"},{"Movie":"Star Wars","MovieTitleID":"10000006","Title":"Spies On Every Corner","Author":"ScorpioGirl1987","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13243898/","StemPassage":"[Chapter 1] ['okay, so this is a crossover-ish of the sequel trilogy and star wars resistance. this takes place after the poe dameron comic #31. set, obviously, after season 1 of resistance. spoilers for the finale, obviously, so be warned! this also has slight damerey friendship building into something more, and mentions of kaz/synara. ten days ago... after returning to d\'qar, poe updated leia about his little adventure. \"anyway, did i miss anything exciting?\" poe asked. \"yes, actually.\" leia nodded. \"i received a message from kaz the other day.\" \"kaz? is he okay?\" poe asked, with concern. \"health-wise, he seemed okay.\" leia replied. \"he said that the first order took complete control of the colossus and they need help. unfortunately, we had no ships to spare, you were missing...\" she sighed. poe turned around, sighed, and stared out into the distance with concern. \'hang in there, kid.\' he turned back to leia. \"as soon as we stop the first order from doing whatever it is they\'re planning, i\'m heading straight to castilon.\" xx poe flew through hyperspace towards takodana. he received a hologram of leia, who looked distraught. \"poe, it happened.\" \"what happened?\" poe asked. \"the first order just destroyed the entire hosnian system.\" leia announced. \"that must be why they were drilling so much dedlanite.\" poe stomach dropped. \"oh my god...no. oh, kaz...\"the poor kid. he just lost his home, everything and everyone he knows. he took a deep breath. \"as soon as i get to takodana...ohh! they are in for it!\" xx one week ago... they had finally found the first order\'s superweapon starkiller base. on the way, poe\'s thoughts again went to kaz. he wondered if he knows his homeworld has been destroyed. he wondered how he was taking it. on any other day, he would have gone to castillon, liberated the colossus, and invited kaz along for the ride to starkiller base so he could have some form of payback. but, they were pressed for time. hopefully, news of the destruction of the base will reach castillon and it will cheer him up. x \"all units, this is black leader.\" poe said as he flew through the interior of the base. \"target structure has been breached! i repeat: target integrity has been breached! there\'s an opening. now\'s our chance! hit it hard, give it everything you\'ve got!\" poe and his squadron shot at the interior walls. poe noticed a small explosion from an oscillator and headed towards it. he took a deep breath and tightened his hands on the trigger. \'this is for you, kaz.\' he shot the oscillator, which went off without a hitch. xx three days ago... poe lead the remaining resistance through the back of the caves. connix caught up to him. \"connix, did anyone respond to our distress call?\" poe asked. \"no. they reached multiple points, but...no one\'s coming.\" connix shook her head dejectedly. poe exhaled slowly. \'dammit, kaz, where are you?\' he hadn\'t known kaz for very long, but he knew him well enough to know that he would jump at the chance to fight the first order especially after they destroyed his home and murdered his friends and family. he hoped it didn\'t mean kaz was captured or killed. he chuckled and shook his head at the irony of kaz sending out a call for help, leia was unable to help him; now they sent a distress call to kaz, who is for some reason unable to help. xx now poe lay in his bunk on the millenium falcon. it has now been two weeks since he last saw kaz. he wondered if he somehow managed to get the first order off the colossus. the millennium falcon landed in yeager\'s repairs. poe, rey, leia, and the rest of the resistance walked down the ramp and were greeted by yeager. \"\'bout time you showed up.\" yeager said good-naturedly. \"yeah, i was at war with the first order.\" poe shrugged. \"where\'s kaz? is he...?\" yeager stepped aside as kaz walked up. he stopped short when he saw poe. kaz\'s expression changed from surprise to fury. he marched towards poe and punched him in the jaw. \"kaz!\" yeager admonished. \"you son of a sleemo! you lied to me! you told me we would stop the first order!\" kaz yelled, his eyes burning with hatred. \"i lost everything- my friends, my family, my home- because of you!\" \"kaz, i\'m so sorry.\" poe said sincerely. kaz scoffed softly and shook his head. \"you\'re sorry. you\'re sorry?! you ruined my life, dameron. i never want to see you again. i hate you!\" yeager and poe stared in shock as kaz stormed away. yeager sighed and shook his head. \"you really let him down, poe.\" poe woke up and blinked away tears. he took a deep breath, brushed his tears away, and hoped nobody saw it. he sat up and looked around. d\'acy, c\'ai, rose, and finn were all sleeping; connix was slowly leafing through a holobook, chewie and the droids were at the holochess table. he assumed leia and rey were in the cockpit and headed there. sure enough, leia and rey were in the pilot and copilot seats respectively talking. \"ladies. mind if i join?\" poe asked. leia and rey turned around and smiled. \"of course not.\" leia replied. poe sat in the seat behind her. \"so, where are we headed?\" \"right now, nowhere.\" leia replied. \"we\'ve been trying to track down any leads on the first order, but so far, nothing\'s come up.\" poe remembered leia telling him about kaz\'s distress call. \"i have one. castilon.\" leia\'s eyes widened in realization. \"oh, that\'s right. the first order took over the colossus.\" \"yeah. i think it\'s about time we come to kaz\'s rescue.\" poe said. leia smiled and stood up. \"i\'ll let everyone know.\" she squeezed poe\'s shoulder and left the cockpit. poe climbed into the pilot\'s seat and entered the coordinates for castilon. he sighed and smiled. \"i have always wanted to fly this thing.\" \"really?\" rey asked with interest. \"yeah. my parents were friends with han, chewie, and the skywalker twins.\" poe replied. \"han and leia had a son, ben. he and i were best friends when we were little. he and i used to come here in the cockpit and pretend to be flying this thing.\" rey froze. poe and ben were best friends? does he know...? \"so, whatever happened to ben?\" poe sighed sadly. \"he went away to become a jedi under luke, but...he was killed when kylo ren burned down the academy. leia and han were devastated, and it ended up breaking up their marriage.\" \"i see.\" rey stared out the window. \'how could he not know ben solo is kylo ren? why didn\'t leia tell him?\' poe seemed to read rey\'s mind and scoffed softly. \"yes, rey, i am very well aware ben solo is kylo ren.\" \"oh.\" rey replied, relieved. \"i was gonna say...\" \"yeah. we were so close when we were little, but...well...people change, i guess.\" rey nodded and decided to change the subject. \"so, what\'s the colossus?\" \"a giant refuelling station.\" poe explained. \"basically a hangout for star pilots and gamblers. six months ago, we received intel from the new republic navy that someone on castilon was helping the first order. it also said there was going to be a full-scale attack on the new republic. i needed help for that mission, and i thought kaz was perfect for the job.\" \"how so?\" rey asked. \"when we met up in space, his squadron was under attack by the first order.\" poe replied. \"he had sent his squadmates back to the naval base. thanks to his quick thinking, we scored a hit on that tie fighter. i saw a little of myself in him and i was very impressed with how he handled that tie, so i recruited him for the resistance. i figured he\'d be more motivated and dedicated to fighting for his home, so i recruited him as a spy on the colossus.\" \"what was his cover?\" rey asked. \"a mechanic for an old friend of mine.\" poe replied. \"there were moments when i thought \'what the hell was i thinking hiring this kid? this kid from one of the wealthiest families on hosnian prime, the son of a senator, who had no spy training and is a bit...clumsy and not the sharpest tool in the shed.\' but, he\'s really proven himself, and within the first month, he had a suspect: the captain of the whole station, immanuel doza. turns out he is ex-imperial, and he made a deal with the first order. apparently, there had been a lot of pirate attacks in the last year, so he made a deal with the first order for protection.\" poe scoffed. \"mistake. turns out the first order wanted the colossus for their military base. a couple weeks ago, kaz sent a message to leia asking for help because the first order had them on lockdown.\" rey took a deep breath. \"wow. where to begin? um...okay, so you knew the first order was going to attack the new republic six months in advance and you didn\'t tell anyone?\" \"we didn\'t have any solid evidence.\" poe shrugged. \"the senate didn\'t want to believe or accept that there may be yet another war brewing. i can\'t really blame them. how many wars has there been in the last fifty years? they were just...done. and they paid the ultimate price for their passiveness. there were also first order sympathizers within the senate.\" \"sounds messy.\" rey replied. \"so were you able to help?\" poe sighed heavily. \"no. that message was sent after the lor san tekka fiasco. everyone was busy looking for me and bb-8, and...well, you know the rest. i feel terrible.\" \"why? you had no idea what was going to happen.\" rey said, surprised. \"i know, but...i kind of feel responsible for him, you know?\" poe lamented. \"i took him away from everything he knew and threw him in a world he was less than ready for, told him not to contact anyone from his home planet and not to return there, and six months later, his entire world is destroyed after i promised him it wouldn\'t be. i failed him. i wouldn\'t be surprised if he hates me now.\" rey shook her head in sympathy and squeezed poe\'s shoulder. \"no, you didn\'t. you saved his life. from what i understand, the entire naval fleet was destroyed along with hosnian. he would have died with everyone else.\" \"i guess that\'s a good point.\" poe nodded slowly. \"still...i\'m just forever glad that he doesn\'t have a family of his own, \'cause...that would be even worse. i\'ve seen what it\'s like to lose your family. it\'s not something you want to go through.\" \"leia.\" rey guessed. poe nodded. \"and that old friend of mine i mentioned earlier. his wife and daughter were killed in a tragic racing accident.\" \"wow, i\'m so sorry.\" rey replied. she stared out the window again. all those families died, her parents chose to leave. they came out of hyperspace to a big ocean planet. swirls of clouds surrounded the surface. poe looked around cautiously. \"well, i don\'t see any star destroyers orbiting the planet.\" \"that\'s good news.\" they made it into the atmosphere before rey asked. \"so, what\'s the plan?\" poe stiffened. \"uh...\" \"you don\'t have a plan?!\" rey exclaimed. \"well, i got sidetracked. okay, let\'s see...\" poe sighed. \"i got it. you and chewie can fly close and distract the tie fighters while i fly to yeager\'s repairs on the escape pod.\" \"that...actually sounds brilliant.\" rey replied, smiling. they headed for the coordinates of the colossus and flew out of the clouds. poe smiled and turned to rey. \"rey of jakku, i present to you...\" when he turned back to the window, poe\'s smile dropped, his heart sank, and his eyes widened in horror. \"no...\" rey looked around in confusion. \"um, poe, there\'s nothing there.\" sure enough, where the colossus should be, there was nothing but water. \"these are the right coordinates, right?\" rey asked. \"yes, these are the right coordinates!\" poe snapped, but double-checked anyway. \"i don\'t understand. it should be right here!\" \"so you\'re saying it vanished into thin air?\" rey asked. she looked around. \"there are no signs of destruction. let me use the force. i\'ve been practicing.\" \"okay.\" poe nodded and waited patiently while rey meditated. rey stretched out her feelings and her senses soared over the planet\'s ocean surface. all she saw was endless ocean and the occasional giant fish diving out of and back into the water. she sighed. \"there\'s nothing above the surface except us, and there are no signs of destruction.\" poe exhaled sharply. \"dammit.\" leia walked into the cockpit. \"poe, what\'s wrong?\" \"the colossus is gone.\" poe answered. he groaned in despair and rubbed his eyes and ran his hands through his hair. \"but...how can it be gone? unless...\" leia sat down and thought about it. \"unless it\'s a ship.\" \"so the colossus would be a space station?\" rey asked. \"it has to be. it\'s the only explanation.\" leia replied. \"then where the hell is it?!\" poe exclaimed. \"i sent kaz the coordinates to d\'qar...then i sent that distress signal to crait.\" leia said slowly. \"maybe it\'s on one of those planets.\" \"good places to start.\" poe said. \"we\'ll head to d\'qar first.\"'][Chapter 2] ['kaz woke up in his room back home on hosnian prime. the walls were lined with holoposters of famous racers and pilots including poe dameron and wedge antilles. his hologame simulator lay in the middle of the room. he got up and opened up the blinds on his windows to see a flock of snowbirds flying by and blue blossom trees swaying softly in the wind. he sighed in content and headed to the kitchen where he saw his mother making breakfast. \"morning, sleepyhead.\" nori xiono smiled warmly. she put a plate and glass of bantha milk on the table. \"come have breakfast. i made your favorite.\" \"aw, thanks, mom. you didn\'t have to.\" kaz replied. \"of course i did. you deserve it after you single-handedly saved our planet.\" nori said. she hugged her son. \"mm. i\'m so proud of you.\" she pulled away and cupped his face in her hands. \"so am i.\" mother and son turned to see senator hamato xiono walk through the kitchen door. \"son, i owe you an apology. you were right about the first order and the resistance. i\'m so sorry i ever doubted you.\" \"it\'s okay, dad. really.\" kaz replied, smiling. \"it was nothing, really.\" \"not nothing? kazuda, you stuck to your beliefs, you continued on when no one believed you. you were resourceful, you were brave. and for that,\" hamato put his hands on kaz\'s shoulders. \"i am proud to call you my son.\" kaz beamed, touched. they embraced warmly. xx next, kaz found himself at the bridge overlooking the downtown area. ships were racing in the distance, and speeders were rushing by. he could see the hanging gardens and the new republic naval academy. he felt someone run up and hugged him from behind. \"hey, there\'s our home planet hero!\" mia exclaimed. \"hey, mia!\" kaz greeted, smiling. \"hail the hosnian hero!\" hugh called out, walking towards the two. he laughed and gave kaz a noogie. kaz laughed. \"hugh!\" the three friends hugged and laughed. they pulled apart and leaned against the bridge\'s stone railing. \"so, kaz, how does it feel to be the hero, huh?\" hugh asked. \"great, actually.\" kaz grinned. \"general organa even gave me a medal.\" \"yeah, and not only that, they\'re building a new wing at the academy and naming it after you.\" hugh announced. kaz nodded and smiled. \"the rewards are nice an all, but, i\'m just glad i still have a home to come back to.\" \"us too.\" mia replied. suddenly, the dream changed. the sky turned a reddish-orange color, and a huge ball of fire headed straight towards them. the fire zoomed closer and closer until kaz was finally knocked off his feet. he was out cold for a minute, then gasped as he woke up on hot stone. he sat up and looked around frantically, for it appeared he was on a lake of lava. \"you sent us back here.\" hugh stood over kaz with an infuriated look on his face. \"you joined up with the resistance, and you sent us to our deaths!\" kaz shook his head and gasped as hugh was engulfed in flames. he turned to see mia, looking hurt, angry, and betrayed. \"you promised us you\'ll be right behind us, but you left us to die!\" mia was promptly burned to ashes. \"i can\'t believe you\'re responsible for this.\" kaz turned to see his mother standing with tears streaming down her cheeks. \"your family, your friends, our home- all gone because of you. kazuda, i thought i raised you better than this.\" kaz bowed his head and started crying as his mother was engulfed in flames. he looked up at the sound of his father\'s voice. \"a disappointment to the very end. why am i not surprised? you failed, kazuda. you failed!\" he was then engulfed in flames. kaz wiped away his tears and turned around to see poe in his resistance jumpsuit looking beyond infuriated. \"one job. you had one kriffing job, and that was to stop the first order from attacking the new republic! i never should have recruited you in the first place!\" kaz watched in horror as poe was engulfed in flames, then the hanging gardens, then the naval academy. kaz looked up to see that pasty-skinned, red-haired man from the holo recording laughing maniacally. he turned to see the planet castilon in the distance. \"fire!\" the red-haired men yelled. kaz watched in horror as yet another large fireball hurtled straight towards the colossus with all his friends watching. \"noooo!\" kaz sat up with a start. he panted for breath and looked around. he was still in his bed at yeager\'s repairs. neeku stirred a bit, then went back to sleep. kaz stared out the garage door at the streaks of blue and white and sighed deeply. cb-23 rolled up to him and beeped in concern. \"are you okay?\" kaz forced a smile. \"i\'m fine, seebee. it was just another nightmare.\" \"do you want to talk about it?\" seebee-twenty-three asked in binary. kaz shook his head. \"not really. go back to sleep.\" kaz lay down on his side away from the garage door. \"okay, if you\'re sure.\" cb-23 rolled away. kaz rolled on his back and sighed. he went over the events of the past six standard months in his head. 6 months ago... \"so, let me see if i got this right: you\'re quitting the navy to become a racer.\" kaz stood in front of his commanding officer and shrugged. \"yeah, the navy wasn\'t really for me.\" the commanding officer sighed and shook his head. \"i can\'t say i wasn\'t expecting this. it did seem like you only joined up because your father made you.\" \"well, it\'s not like i didn\'t enjoy it, it\'s just...\" kaz sighed. \"it\'s not really what i want in life.\" \"okay. very well, then.\" the co cleared his throat. \"you\'ll receive a semi-honorable discharge. good luck.\" xxx 2 weeks ago... \"so, jakku, huh?\" kaz, poe, yeager, and bb-8 headed to yeager\'s office. \"yep. there\'s a guy named lor san tekka who has a map to someone who can help us stop the first order: luke skywalker.\" poe explained. \"he\'s in the village of tuanul, and-\" \"whoa! poe, should you really be telling us all of this? this is sensitive information!\" kaz exclaimed. \"well, normally, i wouldn\'t have, but you two are like brothers to me. i trust you with my life.\" poe side-hugged both yeager and kaz, who was touched by poe\'s admission. \"wow, thanks, poe. i-\" \"oh, no. he\'s getting mushy again.\" yeager quipped. poe laughed as kaz rolled his eyes. \"i was just gonna say you\'re like a brother to me, too.\" xxx 12 hours ago... everyone went back to their own domiciles after jumping to hyperspace. kaz trudged to his bed and lay down. neeku looked around. \"where\'s tam? and why is kaz so upset?\" yeager put a hand on neeku\'s shoulder. \"let\'s go to my office. we\'ll talk there.\" the two headed to yeager\'s office and sat down. yeager took a deep breath. \"tam was manipulated into joining the first order. they\'ve poisoned her against us.\" neeku just blinked at yeager in shock. \"no. i don\'t believe it. she would never!\" \"i didn\'t want to believe it, either.\" yeager shook his head. \"but she made her choice. it didn\'t help that kaz and i have been lying to both of you for six months.\" \"about what?\" neeku asked obliviously. yeager stared at him. \"oh. about kaz being a resistance spy? wait, you knew the whole time? why didn\'t you tell me? or tam?\" \"to keep you two safe from the first order.\" yeager explained. \"if they found out about kaz being a spy and we knew about it, they would have either killed us or tortured us for information.\" neeku nodded. \"okay. i think i understand. then why would tam join them if they\'re so bad?\" \"i don\'t know.\" yeager shook his head. \"so is that why kaz is so upset?\" neeku asked. \"because he feels responsible for tam defecting to the first order?\" \"i wish that were the only reason, but, i\'m afraid that\'s only part of it.\" yeager replied. \"the first order destroyed his home planet earlier this morning. he and torra were on their way to the cells when they ran into a group of stormtroopers who received a holovideo of a superweapon destroying the entire hosnian system- kaz\'s home.\" neeku stared in shock and his face dropped. \"oh...\" xx meanwhile, synara caught up to torra. \"torra! hey.\" \"oh, hey, synara.\" torra greeted, smiling. \"thanks for helping us out.\" \"no problem.\" \"so, how did you convince the pirates to help you?\" torra asked. \"the first order kriffed us over. i convinced kragen to help you out out of revenge against the first order.\" synara explained. torra nodded. \"kaz told me you were the pirate spy.\" \"i\'m sorry.\" synara replied sincerely. \"it\'s okay. you helping us out kind of makes up for you lying.\" torra replied. she sighed. \"speaking of lying about spying...kaz is with the resistance. he was sent here to spy on the first order.\" synara turned away in shock. she remembered meeting kaz and him telling her some pilots found her on that freighter. then she remembered kragen telling her that her rescuers are with the resistance. she sighed. \"i knew he was hiding something, but...i didn\'t think it was this.\" \"i know.\" torra nodded. synara stared at her. she didn\'t seem the least bit phased about him lying. \"you don\'t seem upset by this.\" synara observed. torra closed her eyes, bowed her head, and looked back up at synara. \"earlier this morning, he and i ran into a group of stormtroopers watching a holovid of the first order firing a giant planet-killing machine that destroyed the entire hosnian system. that was kaz\'s home system.\" synara was shocked. \"oh my force. he told me he was from coruscant, but that must have been his cover.\" she sighed. \"poor kid.\" \"yeah. don\'t get me wrong: i\'m not happy about him lying to me for the last six months, but...it\'s kind of hard to be mad at him after he just lost everything and everyone he knows.\" torra admitted. synara nodded. \"i agree. so, how\'s tam? i didn\'t see her in the hangar.\" \"oh. tam joined the first order.\" torra replied solemnly. \"she found out yeager and kaz has been lying to her, neeku, and everyone else for half a year. i kind of think she joined them to get back at yeager and kaz for lying.\" \"wow. much has changed since i left.\" synara quipped. \"does she know i\'m a pirate spy?\" \"yeah. neeku told her.\" torra replied. \"she took it surprisingly well according to kaz.\" synara smiled wryly. \"unless he lied about that, too.\" torra laughed and playfully shoved synara. \"real funny.\" xxx by the following afternoon, everyone on the colossus knew that not only was kaz a resistance spy, but neeku also jumped them to hyperspace and they have no idea where they were headed. kaz walked through the marketplace and ignored the stares and whispers as he passed. when he walked into aunt z\'s tavern, everyone stopped talking and turned to stare at him. kaz just headed to the counter. \"well, if it isn\'t kaz the spy.\" aunt z said dryly. \"i\'m gonna take a wild guess here and say that poe hired you and brought you and bb-8 here.\" \"you guessed right.\" kaz replied shrugging. \"a couple weeks ago, poe and i switched droids. he needed bb-8 for a mission. i told everyone i took beebee to takodana for minor repairs.\" \"hmm. wanna hear something ironic?\" aunt z asked. \"i saw bb-8 on takodana yesterday.\" kaz looked up in surprise. \"what? what was he doing there?\" \"running from the first order.\" aunt z replied. \"apparently, he had vital information hidden inside him.\" \'the map to luke skywalker.\' kaz thought. \"was poe with him?\" \"nope. an older guy, a young man, and a young woman about your age were with him.\" aunt z replied. \"rumor has it that poe had been captured by the first order on jakku. he escaped, but he crash-landed back on jakku. no one\'s heard from him since.\" kaz turned away, reeling from the news. poe can\'t be dead, too. not after he just lost everyone. he can\'t lose poe, too. \"uh...what can you tell me about the people beebee-ate was with?\" \"just that the girl is a scavenger from jakku, the young man is with the resistance or something, and the older guy is han solo.\" aunt z replied. \"now...you gonna order something or just sit there all day?\" \"uh...yeah.\" kaz cleared his throat. \"jett juice and a fruit bowl.\" \"coming right up.\" aunt z said. kaz wandered to a table and sat down and stared out the window. this was a lot to take in. poe and beebee-ate were seperated, poe was captured, escaped, and crash-landed on jakku, and no one\'s heard from him since... as if he didn\'t hate the first order enough already.']"},{"Movie":"Star Wars","MovieTitleID":"10000007","Title":"Everyone You Love Is A Sith","Author":"ByteHoarder","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13245648/","StemPassage":"[Chapter 1] ['a/n  first of all, apologies to anyone getting an alert for this because they followed me for my ben ten fanfics. completely different fandom, completely different story, so i get that maybe you\'d be annoyed to be notified for this. that\'s why i also published another ben ten fic, so go check that out! that out of the way, i guess i should clear up some stuff. this is a fic heavily inspired by lincoln six echo\'s revenge of a sith (here on ffn) but taken in a rather different direction. i sometimes see people talk about a \"sith!au\" or something similar where all our favorite main characters (those being, mainly, the two trios of the pt and the ot) turn to the dark side but i never really see fics about that. this is that fic sort of. unfortunately we won\'t really get to see sith!luke and sith!leia (love sith!leia; she\'s so perfect for it) here, since it\'s mainly a prequels-era fic, but i wrote this to have fun with it. anyway, the first chapter is probably the most similar to lse\'s revenge of a sith but should diverge substantially from there. and just to get this out of the way, yes, it is a multi-pairing for obi-wan, just like the inspiration for the fic. it won\'t be a smut fest but obi-wan does get to be with multiple love interests. think of it as compensation for having three love interests die in his arms (no, we aren\'t bringing cerasi in). last of all, i need to say that as of publishing this chapter i have five chapters fully written out of about eight or so i figure for this fic in total. i plan to update the fic weekly so that gives me about five weeks or so to get it done. shouldn\'t be too bad, since i have the outline planned out. now, onwards! everyone you love is a sith:  chapter i: the junior senator  darth renova was dead. not yet, but having been stabbed through it was now an inevitability. the lightsaber of darth plagueis\' mysterious apprentice, sidious, had severed his spine cleanly below the shoulders and it was now only his mastery of the force that kept renova alive. that, however, would fail him as it failed all eventually. soon his nervous system would shut down entirely, and then he would die. already he could not feel most of his body, and his concentration was bent upon keeping his heart beating and his lungs breathing, just to hold on for a few moments more. all in the hope of seeing his apprentice one final time. it was somewhat ironic that he had been struck down by darth sidious. perhaps it was merely delayed punishment for darth tenebrous\' transgression in training not merely a second apprentice, as the sith of bane\'s line were forbidden to do, but also, in secret, a third. his first was darth plagueis\', sidious\' master; the second darth venamis, who had tried and failed to usurp plagueis\' place as apprentice. the third and last was darth renova himself, who had stayed in the shadows. darth bane\'s rule had been only two sith and tenebrous had broken it liberally. now renova was paying the price. plagueis had never known his master had trained a third apprentice, and so sidious had never known the man he had just struck down was another sith. renova, at least, took some satisfaction in that. to the end, sidious had thought him only ben cortess, eccentric heir to a mining fortune. when plagueis had at last become unnecessary to sidious\' plans, whatever they now were, renova\'s only peer as sith master had been slain and sidious had taken his place. and now here he was, struck down unwittingly himself to further some small scheme of sidious\' for which he was at best a minor inconvenience. the thought that sidious would probably never know who it was he had killed was amusing in some dark, cosmic way. now he waited for the only one who could avenge him: darth consilus. despite his best intentions, renova had grown to love the boy. he was a cautious man by nature, surviving not merely the paranoia of plagueis, sidious, and tenebrous but the assassination attempts of three apprentices of his own. a long and bitter life had hardened renova\'s heart the way every sith\'s heart should be hardened, yet for all that the boy he had found on bandomeer had found his way into it and never left. perhaps it was because he was so unlike the apprentices renova had trained before. he had been full of anger, yes, but the boy had also been defined by a deep and abiding loyalty, a fundamental capacity to trust and love. perhaps that was why the jedi had cast him out, but even if he could bring himself to intellectually think it plausible renova could never fathom actually believing in rejecting such a gifted student of the force. had the jedi trained him, renova knew his apprentice would have become a great jedi master, but it would have been a waste. just as the life of a farmer and miner would never have done consilus well, so too would the shackles of jedi life ill-suited him. perhaps he would have found more greatness than as a farmer, but it would have been a waste either way. renova could not stand waste. so it was that he had taken the boy under his wing and trained him and never once had renova regretted his choice. consilus was so dedicated, so hungry for knowledge, so gifted that renova had little doubt his apprentice would one day surpass the greatest of the sith. unlike the rest of the sith of bane\'s line, however, consilus would never walk the path of paranoia and betrayal. he was completely and totally loyal to his master as sidious hadn\'t been to plagueis. consilus would do anything for renova not out of fear of pain or punishment but because he loved his master and his master loved him in turn. darth bane had no use for such things, renova knew. that great sith who had founded and guided their order for the last millennium considered, as all sith did, love to be a weakness. it provided weak points for opponents to exploit, and a sith could be nothing but totally independent, a power unto themselves. it was the only way to avoid defeat. renova\'s mouth twisted into a bitter smile as he considered the irony. it seemed not to have occurred to any of the other sith that they all had been defeated anyway. they also, he knew, had not considered the other side. it was because he loved that he would be avenged, for nothing else would drive his apprentice to avenge him otherwise. had he remained independent and alone, renova would have died and remained alone and unmourned, powerless. they also, apparently, had not fully appreciated the benefits of trust. the sith before bane had been disunited and paranoid, their knowledge always being lost and rediscovered for fear of giving their rivals an edge. bane\'s line had no rivals and so complete knowledge had been passed intact from master to apprentice, growing with each generation  so long as the sith master did not become too selfish. fear  of his inevitable end at the hands of his apprentice  could push him to deny his apprentice and succeeding sith the knowledge that was so rightfully theirs. it had happened before and would happen again. renova had never had this problem with consilus. he had never feared the younger man would strike him down or usurp him. he trusted consilus completely, and so he had passed all he knew to the boy without regret or hesitation. there was something ironic in the fact it was not dissimilar to the ways of the jedi, but being the hypocrites they were the jedi had always denied the strength of the relationship of master and apprentice, as they denied all relationships. footsteps were coming towards him and renova opened his eyes but couldn\'t move his head. he felt consilus\' vibrant, strong presence in the force, for once unmuted and unshielded, and felt it color with distress and anguish as it raced towards him. strong young hands appeared under his neck and his body was gently maneuvered so that he was staring into the bright, blue-grey eyes of his apprentice. for all that consilus\' face was twisted with pain, however, renova could only find himself filling with a strange sense of peace. there was fear, yes, of death as all sith secretly feared it, but after decades he had finally accepted his own mortality. death was inevitable, and in the end he had fared better than most and probably better than he deserved. he would be remembered and missed. it seemed like little, but it was enough. the desires for greatness and power suddenly seemed so juvenile. \"master?\" consilus whispered, pain coloring the word. renova tried to smile and didn\'t know if he succeeded. \"my apprentice\" \"who did this to you?\" the young man demanded. \"you know\" renova wheezed. \"you know\" consilus\' fists clenched and his eyes suddenly blazed bright and yellow as the dark side coursed through him. \"sidious,\" he said through gritted teeth. \"yes\" renova whispered. \"as you said\" \"did you see who he was, master?\" consilus asked, eyes fading to their blues as concern and desperation replaced his anger. \"no\" tears filled consilus\' eyes. \"why did you send me away, master?\" he demanded, and renova could feel his apprentice trying to keep his anger at him at bay. \"i could have protected you.\" \"no\" renova gasped. \"not strong enough.\" \"together, master,\" consilus begged. \"together we would have been.\" renova chuckled but it turned into a cough. \"i am old\" he whispered. \"not even together.\" consilus grit his teeth, trying to stop his tears from flowing freely. \"damn it,\" he hissed. \"we could have, master. we could have.\" \"that is your destiny,\" renova murmured. \"not now not soon but you can defeat him. the sith will rule the republic sidious will plot this. you know of him but he does not know of you. avenge me\" consilus nodded shakily. \"yes, master. i will. i will.\" \"good\" renova exhaled his last breath and then was still. / the sith had returned. that was what obi-wan kenobi\'s contacts at the jedi temple told him. as he sat in the small senatorial apartment set aside for junior senators, the new chancellor\'s speech playing in the background, he found himself almost amused by the report he read. what were the odds that qui-gon jinn, the jedi who had sealed obi-wan\'s fate, would be the one to face down the sith? and win, somehow. obi-wan didn\'t know whether that was a poor reflection on sidious\' training  as he had little doubt the sith killed on naboo was sidious\' apprentice  or merely the prowess of jedi master qui-gon jinn. in the end he supposed it didn\'t really matter. what mattered was that the jedi now knew the sith had survived their purges oh so long ago. doubtless it would make things more difficult for obi-wan himself, but then the jedi never had sensed him as having turned to the dark side. \"he\'ll do well, don\'t you think, obi-wan?\" senator andes of bandomeer asked from obi-wan\'s couch, breaking the young man\'s train of thought. \"hmm?\" obi-wan asked, looking up distractedly. then he focused on the chancellor  palpatine, the feed said  giving his speech. \"oh, yes, very well, i\'m sure,\" he replied disinterestedly. \"do you think i ought to enter the chancellor\'s inner circle? his favor could be quite important for bandomeer.\" obi-wan frowned and concentrated on his diplomatic superior. you will not show him more support than normal, he sent to the man. you will keep your distance. andes frowned. \"you know, giving it more thought, i think i\'ll keep my distance. galactic politics is a dangerous business, m\'boy. we\'ll wait and see what kind of man the new chancellor is.\" obi-wan smiled. \"i think that\'s very wise, senator.\" you have something to do in your office. \"oh!\" andes exclaimed. \"i think i\'ve stayed too long, obi-wan. i just remembered i have something urgent to do though i can\'t remember what it is.\" the white-haired gentleman smiled tremulously. \"i\'m getting old, obi-wan! you\'ll have to stick by me to keep me from embarrassing myself.\" \"always, senator,\" the young man replied, graciously showing the senator the way out to his own apartment. senators got much larger and nicer apartments than junior senators, but obi-wan didn\'t begrudge the harmless old andes his comforts. some disparities were a small price to pay for using the man as he did, but then obi-wan had probably kept andes political career going a decade longer than the man could have done himself. it was mutually beneficial, in a way. still, there was something pleasing about controlling andes as he did. a penchant for minds was something of a gift of obi-wan\'s and it was good to see a job well done. his control over andes was perfect, the man appearing only as a slightly doddery, absent-minded old man who was essentially harmless, a politician genuinely concerned about his small world in the way only outer rimmers could be. he was necessary for obi-wan\'s plan. years in the making, andes was a pawn in a much larger game that the ever-patient obi-wan was playing. aside from the sith grand plan to take over the galactic republic, renova had been quite sure, after years of investigations, that the mysterious apprentice of his rival sith lord plagueis, darth sidious, was in the galactic senate. so it was that obi-wan had to be there too. obi-wan\'s heart constricted at the thought of his master. ben cortess, the never-known sith lord darth renova, had been so many things to him: mentor, friend, confessor, even almost a father. it was no surprise that obi-wan had grown to love the man dearly. he had given obi-wan everything he had never known he wanted. he had taught him the force, its intricacies and subtleties, as obi-wan had wanted as a jedi. he had taught him the art of lightsaber combat, never depriving his apprentice of anything, even when obi-wan had taken better to the defensive third form, soresu, rather than offensive forms that sith favored. more than that, he had shown him what the jedi had always denied: love. obi-wan was not told to repress his nature as a man, as a sentient being. he was free to care and love and be passionate and before renova obi-wan had never known the jedi had been so repressing, so unnatural, so wrong. how could they condemn what he had had with his master? how could they claim it was the right life for every force-sensitive? he\'d found obi-wan only shortly after his last hopes for becoming a jedi knight had ended, on bandomeer. aged out and never chosen, obi-wan had been sent to work as a farmer with the jedi agricorps, an organization that had seen fit to place him amongst strangers and mining-ravaged land. he had briefly had hope when qui-gon jinn had also come to bandomeer, but the man had refused obi-wan yet again, ensuring obi-wan would never be a jedi. those months had been torturous. he had been nothing but a teenage boy taken from his family before he could even remember them and then ejected from those meant to be surrogates. he had been cut off from his friends and had lost the only home he had ever known. moreover, he had also lost his dreams. obi-wan had only ever wanted to be a jedi knight and for all his skill, all his drive, all his willingness to learn he had been denied. the jedi teachings that had been indoctrinated in him since infancy told him he ought to be content with his life, but obi-wan had barely been a jedi and had a sick certainty he was not meant to be a farmer. eventually he had left the agricorps. the jedi didn\'t really worry about those leaving the order if they lacked most important training and there had been no fuss with obi-wan going, something that had stung almost as much as never being selected. some part of him had wanted the jedi to protest, to want him to stay if for no other reason than to prove that he wasn\'t totally meaningless to them, that all his efforts hadn\'t meant nothing. after leaving had been a life of poverty. he was an almost-fourteen year-old with no real skills and no money and all he had wanted was a trip to stewjon. he had been told it was his homeworld and with nowhere else to go obi-wan hoped his birth family would take him back. then again, if they had so easily given him up who knew what they would do? it didn\'t really matter, as he had no other options. so he had scrounged and saved every credit he could to travel to stewjon. until ben cortess had found him. wealthy heir to a mining fortune, it wasn\'t really surprising for the man to appear on bandomeer, a world dominated by mining. what was strange was for him to take an interest in a beggar-boy, but obi-wan hadn\'t looked a gift-horse in the mouth. nevertheless, the strangeness of the silver-haired man with piercing green eyes put something in obi-wan on alert. he hadn\'t refused when the man had offered to buy him a meal, however. at first cortess had only been interested in talking with him, most specifically his situation. obi-wan\'s impeccable coreworld, even coruscanti, accent seemed to intrigue the man who thought it was very out of place for an outer rim urchin. so obi-wan had told him his situation  that he was an ex-jedi initiate who hadn\'t been deemed worthy of training to knighthood, that he had been sent to bandomeer as a farmer, that he had left, and that he was trying to find his way home. that had been it for some time. cortess had merely watched obi-wan desperately eat all he would buy him. then obi-wan had felt something shift in the force, something drawing him to the man. when he had looked at cortess he had thought it seemed as though the man had come to a decision, and when he looked into those green eyes he hadn\'t found himself repelled. so it was that obi-wan had become a sith apprentice. cortess hadn\'t waited long to tell him, but even so obi-wan had already suspected. there were few force-users who weren\'t jedi, and fewer still who had little fear of the dark side. it hadn\'t pushed him away, however. perhaps he was a bad jedi, but the jedi had rejected him while cortess had shown him only kindness. how could the jedi make demands of him and how he behaved when they rejected him so thoroughly? the years had been long and hard. cortess was not cruel, but his training had demanded much of obi-wan. it pushed him to his limits and past them, almost killing him several times, yet obi-wan wouldn\'t have traded it for anything. it was what was required to forge him into the sith he needed to be, to temper and mold him until he surpassed all others. it was what was required to make him better than any jedi. lost in his thoughts, obi-wan almost didn\'t notice the change in the holofeed until the face of qui-gon jinn appeared. apparently the nubians were throwing an enormous festival in honor of their jedi savior, and obi-wan felt mixed feelings fill his gut. on the one hand, qui-gon\'s rejections had given him more than he had ever wanted, but on the other had been completely unjust. what right did the jedi have to take him from his family and then deny him? obi-wan didn\'t know whether to feel envious of or sorry for the boy almost hiding in qui-gon\'s shadow. it was certain the boy didn\'t know of qui-gon\'s past or reputation, and obi-wan wondered whether qui-gon would prove a better master when he actually chose a student instead of being pressured towards one. a part of him couldn\'t help but wonder what this boy had that he did not  what he had so much of that qui-gon would apparently defy the jedi code to train him. he calmed himself. the time of the jedi would come. last edited: 2019/3'][Chapter 2] ['a/n  i meant to publish this a few hours ago but it\'s still roughly on time. not sure if i should bump the rating up to m just for this chapter, but this is the raciest stuff in the fic and revenge of a sith is rated t so i think we should be fine. we\'re still setting things up so still no real action. i hope the time-skips aren\'t too confusing but i did do my best to mark them without actually just dating each time-skip. chapter ii: lovers  the ruins of the slavers\' headquarters filled consilus with a grim sort of satisfaction as he walked through the rubble. the organization had been caught abducting children from bandomeer and when the sith lord had heard a group of mandalorians had been hired under the table to deal with the slavers he had discreetly pulled some strings to see to it he would be shortly behind them  for a fee. still, the force pulled consilus to the slavers for a reason beyond the kidnapped bandomeerans, and though he was making sure they were safe he was sure there was something else. \"sir,\" one of the mandalorians said, coming up to the man she knew as obi-wan kenobi. \"we\'ve found someone in the lower levels. a jedi, we think.\" that got consilus\' attention. \"a jedi? are you sure?\" \"she had a lightsaber and the slavers we interrogated were convinced she was a jedi plant. they\'ve been torturing her.\" \"show me,\" consilus ordered and the mandalorian wasted no time in doing so. they had great respect for obi-wan as he had trained and fought among them and worked frequently with them as a concerned bandomeeran representative. in the outer rim the law of the republic could seldom be relied on and so consilus and his predecessors were no strangers to dealing with bounty hunters and mercenaries. after renova and consilus had been done with them, there were few better mercenaries than kryze and her group. kryze led him quickly down deep into the fortress the slavers had used for their base. she was a few years younger than he was, but even in her early twenties bo-katan was a force to be reckoned with. consilus appreciated that she didn\'t flinch at all seeing what she did inside the cell, though he wouldn\'t have blamed her for doing so. still, mandalorians were a tough bunch. the cell was large, no doubt to accommodate instruments of torture, and in the center of it was a device that surprised consilus. force-suppressors were rare and expensive technology, but somehow the slavers had managed to acquire one. its use was prudent, however: there were few other ways to properly restrain a jedi. and a jedi she was. stripped to the waist with breasts bare, she was caked in blood and covered with deep welts and lacerations. the slavers were clearly crude but imaginative in their tortures, and the suspended woman was quite unrecognizable with her red hair and green eyes. nevertheless, something about her tickled consilus\' memory, and he allowed the force to flow through him. bo-katan quickly let the girl down, disabling the force-suppressor, and consilus concentrated on the woman. as he attuned himself to the living force, he stretched his senses towards her and was surprised to feel she was somewhat familiar. her presence had changed much over the years, but consilus strained his memory and eventually emerged with a name. siri tachi, a girl he had known as a jedi initiate. evidently she had been chosen after he had not, though what she was doing in the dungeon of slavers was beyond him. his touch in the force seemed to awaken her, and she blinked slowly to stare at him. to his surprise, she recognized him instantly. \"obi-wan?\" she asked. then she began coughing and spluttering, throat no doubt injured from screaming. bo-katan quickly gave her some water, and after a time tachi was able to talk again. \"you\'re really here,\" she murmured, tears welling up in her eyes. \"what are you doing here?\" \"a better question is what you\'re doing here,\" obi-wan replied. \"this is no place for a jedi padawan.\" tachi blinked the tears away and grimaced. \"i was infiltrating the slaver ring. they tricked me. they realized i was a jedi. i guess my act wasn\'t convincing enough.\" obi-wan made a show of looking around at the destroyed compound, the bodies of slavers still strewn about. \"i\'d say that mission is over,\" he told her. \"she\'ll need extensive treatment,\" bo-katan finally pronounced, turning to look up at obi-wan from where she was leaning over tachi. obi-wan\'s brow furrowed. \"very well. sedate her.\" he turned slightly to stare at tachi again. \"i\'m sorry about this, my dear.\" tachi tried to make a sound but couldn\'t get it out before the sedatives bo-katan had injected in her neck did their work. the would-be jedi collapsed, allowing the mandalorian watching over her to cover her naked chest with a blanket. two more mandalorians followed shortly afterwards, and tachi was taken out on a stretcher, obi-wan following sedately behind. having a jedi, a former friend, was an unexpected gift for darth consilus.  it was several weeks later that tachi was well enough to be awake and talk extensively, and though she was still bound to a wheelchair for the time being she accepted obi-wan\'s offer to talk. obi-wan sensed there was some trepidation on her part and suspected why, but when tachi instead asked about his own life and how he had fared after being sent to the agricorps obi-wan happily indulged her until they had gone quite far on his humble estate. bandomeer had once been a world of modest natural beauty, and, though the mining had spoiled that, with the corporations leaving and the various reclamation efforts some of that beauty was returning. the rugged highlands of the estate obi-wan had taken for himself were not the most beautiful even he had seen as a jedi initiate, but the majesty of nature was still present. in the crisp winter afternoon with her natural blonde hair starting to grow back out, tachi was quite a fetching sight, obi-wan thought. finally, obi-wan grew tired of telling stories and sat on a bench on the stone balcony they had stopped at, tachi beside him. \"so, i take it this mission was to count for your trials for knighthood,\" he said conversationally. tachi\'s blue eyes didn\'t meet his. \"yes. i think i failed.\" \"because you fell?\" tachi\'s head snapped around to stare at him, wide-eyed. \"how did?\" \"i sense the dark side in you,\" obi-wan told her sincerely, and tachi blanched. \"you can tell me.\" he stared at her. \"what you\'ve been through is awful and refusing that power would have been a terrible burden. there are few jedi knights who can resist the dark side under extreme torture.\" the fallen jedi sat silently. \"it\'s nothing to be ashamed of\" obi-wan told her. \"when you felt the dark side in that dungeon i can\'t imagine most jedi would be able to dispel it  after being tortured and tortured, the jedi never coming they were going to leave you there until you died, until\" \"stop!\" tachi cried. \"stop!\" there were tears in her eyes, and obi-wan was mildly surprised to see they had turned a bright, glowing gold. such a color indicated far more than a simple turn to the dark side  tachi lived on it, thrived on it. obi-wan himself hadn\'t had eyes of sith gold for years after beginning his dark side training, but then he had been a young teenager. tachi blinked and it disappeared, her normal bright blues returning. \"i know,\" she said brokenly. \"i know.\" then she looked at him. \"kenobi obi-wan\" she started. \"please don\'t tell anyone. please. i can\'t if they the jedi are my home\" obi-wan looked at her with pity. \"tachi siri, i won\'t tell anyone.\" she almost sobbed with relief. \"but siri you know they won\'t let you back.\" \"they will!\" she cried. \"i\'ve never betrayed the jedi! it it was just a slip! they\'ll see that!\" \"you know they won\'t,\" obi-wan said as gently as he could. \"a slip in a moment of passion subsequently rejected is one thing but you\'ve never let it go. the dark side is strong in you, siri.\" \"obi-wan, please,\" she begged. \"they\'ll know. they can\'t reject me like\" \"like they rejected me?\" obi-wan asked, and siri reeled as though struck. \"obi-wan, no! i didn\'t mean\" \"you\'re right,\" obi-wan told her. \"they would reject you just like they rejected me. you don\'t matter to them, siri. one mistake is all it takes and that\'s it for you. you\'ve fallen, siri.\" \"i can come back!\" siri exclaimed fiercely. \"i can reject the dark side! they\'ll never have to know!\" \"can you?\" obi-wan asked, rubbing his clean-shaven chin. \"you\'ve tasted it, now. \'once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.\' you know what will happen to you.\" siri\'s lip trembled. \"i have nowhere else, obi-wan.\" consilus finally made up his mind. \"stay with me.\" \"what?\" \"stay with me,\" he repeated. \"i can teach you more than the jedi ever could. be my apprentice.\" he held out his hand to her. siri looked at him in bewilderment for a moment then her eyes lit in realization. \"you\'re a sith\" she murmured, shaking her head. with trembling hands, she wheeled herself backwards, trying to get away from him as a look of horror dawned on her face. \"you\'re a sith\" \"i am,\" obi-wan told her, not bothering to deny her shrewd deduction. \"are you going to turn me in to the jedi?\" \"i will!\" siri hissed fiercely. \"then they\" \"what?\" obi-wan asked. \"they\'ll do to me what they\'ll do to you. we\'re both tainted by the dark side and both fallen jedi. what do you think they\'ll do? throw me in a prison and pat you on the back for bringing me in? and for what? what have i done, siri?\" \"you\'re a sith!\" she screamed at him. \"the sith murder, and lie, and cheat, and torture! that\'s what the dark side does!\" \"have you done that?\" obi-wan asked. siri trembled again. \"i i can stop it\" \"if you can, why can\'t i? siri, i\'m still your friend from all those years ago.\" tears were flowing down her cheeks. \"you\'re a sith, obi-wan,\" she cried desperately, as if trying to will him to understand. \"i i don\'t want to but it\'s my duty. you fell. you betrayed us\" for the first time consilus felt angry. \"the jedi betrayed me, \" he spat and siri looked taken aback at his sudden change in attitude. consilus calmed himself. \"i\'m sorry. it\'s still a somewhat sore subject,\" he said quietly, smiling at her ruefully. \"but siri, i haven\'t done anything you haven\'t. the jedi abandoned you to torture and death; are you going to believe everything they say still? you knew me. do you really think i could change so much?\" siri\'s face crumpled miserably. \"the sith lie, obi-wan,\" she cried. \"that\'s what they do. you could be lying to me right now. what if i accept and then change my mind? would you kill me?\" \"siri,\" obi-wan said quietly and earnestly, \"even if i wanted you dead you\'re in no shape to stop it. training with me would only make you more able to survive. why would i wait until training you?\" they stared at each other, siri looking desperately like she wanted to find some way to refuse, and obi-wan broke away first. \"i won\'t force your choice. until you recover and are able to leave, the option is available to you.\" he paused. \"choose wisely, siri. i don\'t want to see you trapped in a jedi cell for the rest of your life.\" siri nodded silently, but didn\'t reply.  panting filled the opulent room of the residential wing of sundari palace, the brilliant moonlight of concordia high in the sky filtering through the exquisite blinds to gently fall upon the two naked bodies tangled on the bed. gently, an obi-wan kenobi just a few years older, short beard gracing his face, extricated himself from the grand duchess\' beautiful form to lie back upon the bed, sated, and the grand duchess herself rolled onto her other side to curl herself into her lover, stroking the sith\'s chest. \"i love you so dearly, obi,\" she murmured against his flushed torso, placing gentle kisses just above his still-pounding heart. \"i love you too, satine, darling,\" obi-wan whispered, responding to her ministrations by kissing the top of her blonde head. satine kryze was the elder of the two kryze sisters and the second obi-wan had met, during the resurgence of the mandalorian civil war after her father had been killed and satine, as the new grand duchess, had been forced on the run. ben cortess had offered the teenage duchess sanctuary and means to secure her position in mandalore, and after more brutal fighting the duchess had accepted. unlike with bo-katan, she and obi-wan had hated each other at first, disagreeing about nearly everything. as they had gotten older, however, satine had grown out of her childish notions and come to accept how the world worked  what the peace she so desperately wanted required  while obi-wan had grown to admire her dedication and vision that went so far beyond his own. with his intimate associations with the mandalorians as a warrior and political force, obi-wan and satine had grown to see more and more of each other. after some years, neither could deny a mutual attraction and when satine\'s advisors had finally started pressuring her to marry and secure her throne she had only had one choice in mind. obi-wan, naturally, had accepted. \"and how goes the training of your jedi friend?\" satine asked after some while. \"she\'s as good as i remember her,\" obi-wan replied, thinking about his new apprentice. darth rheva, as he had named siri tachi, had progressed as fast as he had dreamed in the years since she had joined him as his first sith apprentice. her strength in the force and especially the dark side was immense, for she drew on a deep well of passion that sometimes astonished obi-wan in its abundance. that was not even mentioning her lightsaber skills, which obi-wan felt that, with time, would be among the best in history. their start had been rocky, with siri having more lingering loyalty to the jedi than obi-wan had had after being cast out. nevertheless, the deeper into the dark side she delved and the more she learned from consilus, the more consilus knew rheva wanted to stay. the jedi could never teach her so much, as he had told her, and rheva had proved it time and again. and as with his own master consilus had been sure to instill in her a deep sense of loyalty between them, nurturing their bond as master and apprentice whenever he could. \"she\'s quite spectacular,\" he murmured again. \"the best apprentice i could\'ve hoped for.\" satine chuckled against him. \" just an apprentice?\" she asked, turning her head up to stare into her husband\'s eyes. \"what are you implying?\" he asked with a sly grin. \"come now, husband, i\'m sure you\'ve noticed the looks she\'s been giving you.\" obi-wan had indeed. as the years had passed and he and siri had grown closer than they had even as children, obi-wan could feel the pressing desires of the master-apprentice bond to grow beyond merely those limits. with his own master, renova, the man had come to be almost an adoptive father to him, but obi-wan knew the bond between him and siri pushed for no such relationship. \"i have resisted,\" obi-wan said, breaking the kiss satine had leaned up to give him. \"but it is difficult.\" satine grinned at him when she felt his heart begin to throb again and his body respond to her touches. she kissed him again, a deep and passionate one after the gentle, affectionate ones they had been sharing, and only broke it off with a laugh when obi-wan groaned under her. \"why, kenobi, two mandalorian sisters not enough for you?\" \"i was under the impression it was something of a mandalorian tradition for a man to take many wives,\" obi-wan replied. \"in fact, i seem to remember a certain grand duchess begging me to marry her sister\" he pushed satine over from where she was straddling him so he could force her down in the bed, then leaned down to whisper in his wife\'s ear. \"she told me she found it very attractive that her husband had conquered many women. i suppose it\'s just a mandalorian thing.\" \"mmmm,\" satine moaned happily. \"i love that you want to be loyal, obi,\" she groaned. \"but neither myself nor my sister have any problem with you and siri.\" \"well,\" obi-wan murmured into her shoulder as he reached a spot she particularly liked, \"as long as my beautiful wives are happy\" he nipped at her. \"but perhaps i should remind you just how much i love my wife to be sure.\" satine didn\'t give a verbal reply.  some time later, in a different bed on a different planet, obi-wan and siri lay curled up together and enjoying the quiet of one of obi-wan\'s many coruscanti safe-houses, listening to the muffled noise of traffic go by. \"i\'ve seen some reports that you\'re the new senator for bandomeer, master,\" siri murmured, playing idly with obi-wan\'s hair. \"yes, darling, and please not master in bed.\" siri smirked at him. \"what, having a hot jedi-turned-sith apprentice calling you master as you dominate her in bed doesn\'t get you going?\" obi-wan\'s embrace tightened around her as he fought down his arousal. \"you know that\'s not true, but we don\'t have to always be master and apprentice, siri.\" siri just rolled her eyes with a smirk on her face. still caught up in their recent passions, they glowed gold in the dim of the apartment instead of the blue-green obi-wan found so attractive. \"anyway, i don\'t know how you could stand to wait this long.\" obi-wan chuckled. \"i thought jedi padawans were supposed to value patience.\" \"i\'m not a jedi anymore,\" siri pointed out. \"indeed,\" obi-wan murmured, running his fingers along siri\'s skin. \"but it was necessary. i needed a reputation and a story none would question. now i\'m andes\' obvious successor, and it was hardly like he ran things before. still, the time has finally come. the war sidious wants is coming. i can feel it. this secessionist movement that\'s brewing under count dooku can only be his doing. it won\'t be long before some systems attempt to secede from the republic.\" siri frowned. \"will there really be war?\" \"yes,\" obi-wan replied simply. \"the republic\'s time is over. even if the sith had not worked to help it end it would only have put it off a few years. decades, at best,\" he added as an afterthought. \"now all that is left is to transform it according to sith design. to form the empire. war is the best catalyst for that.\" \"do you think the jedi will prevent it?\" obi-wan snorted. \"they\'d be more likely to instate a youngling as grandmaster than prevent the war. war is an inevitability.\" he chuckled to himself, then he peered down at darth rheva. \"how are you coping, being again near the heart of the jedi order?\" siri shivered and closed her eyes. \"it\'s a trial, master.\" when she opened her eyes again the golden glow was even brighter in the dark. \"but none of them have sensed anything. they don\'t react at all to my presence.\" \"the dark side clouds their vision. it\'s why i can walk freely amongst them  most even think i\'m a staid and loyal supporter of the jedi order, even though they cast me out.\" there was no reply, and obi-wan looked over to see that siri was raking her gaze over his form hungrily. her reignited passion, something she had in such abundance, had put her back in the mood and consilus knew his apprentice was getting frisky. \"i don\'t want to dwell on depressing subjects tonight,\" rheva said, sliding her form on top of consilus\'. \"fuck me instead.\" last edited: 2019/4']"},{"Movie":"Star

ben solo had turned to the dark side and destroyed the jedi temple, it devastated not only his parents, but a girl who he had promised to come back to. she was his best friend, so when the new came she was heartbroken. she didn\'t know what to do. so she did what she could. she trained and helped the resistance. she did any and everything to keep her mind off him, that is, until he reached out to her. adiara malek woke up and quickly dressed in the dark. she started every day the same. she would run long distance, grab breakfast then do some hand to hand and pt before lunch. then leia would ask her to do some meaningless task that would take up the rest of her day; but, at least with all her training, she was the best hand to hand fighter in the resistance. if she stopped for even a second she would think about him. thinking about him brought too much pain and too many questions that would be forever left unanswered. she finished pulling her hair back into a ponytail as she walked out her door and headed down the hall towards the outside. \"going for a run, adi,\" a voice came from behind her. \"you know it, dameron,\" she responded turning to face him while walking backwards. \"care for some company?\" he said jogging to catch up with her. \"depends,\" she said turning around. \"depends on what?\" he said slowing to her pace when he had reached her. \"if you can actually keep up with me; and truthfully, i beat you last time we raced,\" she said with a smirk. \"i have gotten faster,\" he responded with a grin. \"sure you have,\" she responded as they walked outside the compound. \"race me and i will prove it,\" he said stopping. \"seriously poe? you want to race? fine lets race. my usual track. start here, follow the path through the woods, then go across the hills and back around. it is about 6 miles give or take,\" she said with a grin. \"only six?\" he said with a smirk. \"yes only six. besides, you will probably chicken out after one mile,\" she said grinning back at the piolet. \"i will not chicken out. when have i ever chickened out of something?\" he asked. \"whenever you have to fight me in hand to hand,\" she said matter-of-fact. \"i was sick, i didn\'t want to transfer germs,\" he said looking away. \"are we going to race or stand here discussing the fact that you won\'t do something if you know you will lose?\" she asked looking at him. \"fine,\" he said. \"go!\" he added as he took off towards the path in the woods. \"hey! that\'s cheating dameron,\" she shouted as she sprinted towards the woods. \"all is fair in love and war,\" he called back. \"who ever said anything about love,\" she muttered under her breath. it didn\'t take much for her to catch up to him. she slowed to his pace for a little bit, jumping over rocks and logs in her way. \"i would say we are pretty much even in running,\" poe said breathlessly after a while. \"keep thinking that, dameron. just know, i am running at your pace,\" she said between breaths. \"is that a fact?\" he asked. \"yes. o look, there is base,\" she said before speeding up and sprinting to the base door. she stop and turned to face the path that poe was running down trying to beat her. \"you can do it, poe,\" she called crossing her arms and leaning against the wall. \"i can see your smirk from here, trouble!\" he called back as he ran down the hill to the door. \"i hate when you call me that,\" she said when he reached her. \"well maybe you shouldn\'t have made me think i had a chance to beat you,\" he said with his hands on his knees, taking deep breaths. \"i didn\'t make you think you could win. i told you that you couldn\'t beat me. you are the one that insisted,\" she said as she started down the stairs to the cafeteria. \"o come on adi. you ran the same pace as me for over 5 miles,\" he said following her down the steps. \"did you really think that i didn\'t run faster? you have seen me run,\" she said as she grabbed a piece of fruit and filled her canteen with water. \"i have seen you run short distance, not a long distance over hills,\" he said filling his tray with food. \"i see why you run that though it\'s gorgeous out there.\" \"it\'s a nice way to start the day. sometimes i will stop at the top of the hill and take in the sunset for a few minutes,\" she said walking next to him. \"what are you doing after you eat?\" he asked walking over to a table to sit down. \"hand to hand. you know it is bad to sit after running long distance, right? your legs will cramp,\" she said standing next to him. \"i will be fine,\" he said spooning in some of his food. \"well, while you get leg cramps, i am going to go to the training room,\" she responded patting him on the back. \"good race. we should do it again sometime.\" \"want some company for hand to hand?\" he asked with his mouth full. \"why so i can beat you twice in one day?\" she asked as she finished her fruit and through the core in the garbage. \"how else am i going to get better if i don\'t train with the best?\" he said as he finished his food and chugged some water. \"don\'t you have training runs in five minutes?\" she asked. \"dameron!\" someone called across the room. \"hey wexley!\" poe called back. \"stop flirting with malek! we have drills to run,\" he said with a laugh. \"i am coming!\" poe said returning his tray. \"see i knew i was right,\" adi said walking behind him. \"walk with us? we will past the training room,\" he said walking over towards wexley. \"morning adi,\" wexley said with a smile. \"morning wexley, she responded smiling politely. \"heading to the training room?\" he asked as they headed down the hallway. \"always. see dameron, even wexley knows my schedule, and he doesn\'t claim to be my best friend,\" she responded pushing him and laughing. \"i think the galaxy knows your schedule, adi. you are very predictable that way,\" wexley said. \"i was trying to make conversation. next time i will just say it as a matter of fact,\" poe said feigning hurt. \"and next time you might actually beat me in a race,\" adi responded smiling. \"well this is my stop. see you boys latter.\" \"did you tell her?\" wexley whispered when she thought she was out of ear shot. \"i didn\'t,\" poe whispered back. \"you need to before you have to leave. ask her to join you for dinner and then just tell her,\" wexley said sternly. \"fine,\" poe said before hinting to wexley to leave. \"malek!\" poe entered the training room to see her staring at him. she had already removed her outer jacket so she was standing in the center of the room in just a tank top. \"yes, dameron?\" she said looking at him questionably. \"join me for dinner tonight? just us? we need to catch up. it has been a long time since we have been able to talk,\" he said trying to look anywhere but at her. \"sure thing! just meet me at my room when you are done all your daily routines,\" she said before turning to fix her hair into a high bun. \"see you then, adi,\" he said before exiting the room to go run drills. adi looked around the room, it wasn\'t much, but it worked for what they used it for. she looked at the different stations around the room before she crossed to the large mat in the center of the room that was used in hand to hand. she walked to the center of the mat and began to stretch out from her run. she knew that if she didn\'t, her muscles would lock up and she wouldn\'t be going anywhere fast. she finished stretching and glanced at her comlink on her arm for the time, she had about fifteen minutes before people started coming into the room. she sat down in the middle of the mat and crossed her legs, letting the top of her hands rest on her knees with her palms facing up. she took a deep breath and tried to let everything leave her mind. this was the only thing she ever learned that a jedi did. she didn\'t want the jedi life, it wasn\'t for her. but this, this was fantastic. it helped her relax and focus on the task at hand. sometimes she swears it makes her more alert. she rolled her shoulders back and began to clear her mind, feeling the force around her. she doesn\'t know how long she was sitting there like that before she thought she heard someone quietly call her name. she didn\'t feel anyone in the room with her; so she shook it off and cleared her mind again. \"adiara,\" the voice came again. \"who is there?\" she asked opening her eyes and look around from her position. no response. she brushed it off and went back to her meditating. \"adiara, do not ignore me,\" the voice came again. this time she realized whoever it was, they were communicating to her in her mind. \"i don\'t know who you are, but stay out of my mind,\" she snapped back before trying to block her mind. the last thing they needed was someone locating them because she hadn\'t closed her mind. \"please, adiara. you have no training you can\'t block me out,\" the voice sneered. \"get out of my head or,\" she started. \"or what? what are you going to do? you don\'t know who i am and i am too far for you to do anything to me. however, i can do whatever i want to you if i wanted to,\" the voice sneered. \"yea, ok. i am done with this. i have things to attend to and dealing with some asshole who wants to hide behind a scary voice in my mind is not on that list,\" she responded before starting to get up. \"i didn\'t say i was done, and mind your manners,\" the voice responded. \"or what? you could literally just be my subconscious,\" she said in her mind, before starting to move away from the mat. \"no i am not and i will prove it,\" the voice said before she started to feel pain excelling through her brain. she clenched her jaw and tried to swallow the pain. \"do i have your attention?\" it asked. \"leave me alone,\" she responded out loud through her clenched teeth. \"i think not. you have upset me,\" the voice came and the pain returned stronger this time. adiara could not hold her scream this time. she screamed out loud and fell to her knees. \"get out of my head!\" she screamed as she placed her head between her hands trying to stop the pain. \"i will stop but you have to do me a favor?\" the voice came giving her a small reprieve. \"why would i do you any favors?\" \"because if you don\'t, i will kill you and then kill all the resistance scum,\" the voice growled. \"i owe you nothing,\" she responded in her head breathing deep, preparing to block her mind from another attack. \"you silly child, do you honestly think an untrained force sensitive weakling like yourself can protect your minds from the great and powerful supreme leader snoke?\" he sneered. \"you?! i will never do anything for you. you can kill me for all i care,\" she responded preparing for the pain. \"have it your way,\" he sneered before the pain restarted. \"poe! general organa!\" she screamed through the pain. \"your little friends cannot help you. there is no saving you from me, unless you join me. join kylo ren as my apprentice,\" he whispered. \"never!\" she screamed. \"so be it then,\" snoke responded. adi writhed in pain on the floor, screaming and thrashing around uncontrollably. her vision slowly began to black out. she lifted her eyes slowly to the door and saw the outline of people running into the room. she vaguely heard poe screaming her name as he ran over to her. she was still doubled over in pain and losing conscious fast. \"snoke,\" was all she managed to get out before she blacked out completely. poe\'s pov: \"remind me to kill you, wexley,\" poe said patting him on the back. \"do you or do you not have a date with her later?\" wexley asked as they crossed to the hangar to go over drills they would be running that day. \"o shut up,\" poe said with a smirk. poe barely heard anything everyone was saying. they were running one of the same drills they always run. he could do the drill with his eye closed, not that he would, that would be idiotic. he was more concerned about what he was going to say to adi later at dinner. it took another piolet patting him on the back to let him know they were moving to their x-wings. he started to cross to his when he could\'ve swore he heard a scream. he stopped in his tracks and looked around. no one else seemed to hear it, so he continued across the strip. he reached x- wing and began to ascend the ladder when he heard the scream again, this time even louder. \"did anyone else hear that,\" he yelled, looking at the other piolets. \"it\'s the second one i have heard,\" another piolet called. \"shhhhhh,\" poe said quieting the others. \"poe! general organa!\" a scream came and he knew in the pit of his stomach that it was adi. he jumped off the ladder and ran towards the training room. \"someone get the general!\" poe shouted as he was running. it didn\'t take long for him to get to the training room since it was right down the hall. a group of people had gathered outside the door. \"why are you all standing around? why has no one gone inside?\" poe asked getting angry. \"we are trying, poe! we can\'t get it open. it\'s like it is sealed,\" one of the guys said. \"stand out of the way,\" poe said grabbing his blaster. he could not stand there and do nothing as adiara was on the other side of the door screaming in pain. he shot the key pad by the door and the moment it opened everyone that had gathered outside rushed into the room behind poe. poe froze for a second and then ran over to adiara. \"adiara!\" he screamed as ran to her side and pulled her into his arms. \"snoke,\" she whispered before blacking out completely. \"adiara, wake up,\" he said checking her pulse. \"dameron, we need to get her to the medical wing,\" wexley said placing his hand on poe\'s shoulder. \"i know. i.can you clear a path?\" he asked as he gently lifted her into his arms. \"yes,\" wexley said walking towards the door. \"make a path everyone!\" poe ran through the now parted crowed ignoring the gasps and whispers of adiara\'s name as he did so. \"poe!\" leia called as he ran past her. she saw the body in his arms and followed quickly behind him. \"medic!\" he called as he entered the wing. \"what happened?\" leia asked as the medic ran over. \"i don\'t know she could be heard screaming in the hanger,\" poe answered. \"lay her here,\" the medic said as he pointed to a table. \"is she going to be ok?\" poe asked. \"i will do all that i can. she has no physical wounds. everything might be internal. give me space to work on her,\" he said pulling a curtain. \"poe, tell me what happened,\" leia said placing her hand on his should has he sat in a chair with his head in his hands. \"we hear her screaming in the hanger. we got there and no one could get in the door. it was like it was sealed. i had to blast it open. by the time i got in there, she was blacking out,\" poe said though his hands, worry displayed across his face. \"did she say anything?\" she asked. \"yes. all she got out was snoke,\" poe said looking at leia. horror was evident on both their faces.'][Chapter 2] ['say something a/n: i am going to try and update as much as possible. try being the key word. adiara\'s eyes flew open and she jumped up, looking at the area around her. she was standing in the middle of a lighted circle that had a lighted path behind her and red lights around the wall. she spun around slowly trying to take in everything about her. when she finally reached back to the front that is when she saw him. \"hello adiara,\" snoke\'s hologram said from his throne. \"you actually consider yourself so high and mighty that you sit on your own throne?\" she said smugly. \"i would watch your tone if i were you. i have i not already taught you that i can hurt you from anywhere?\" snoke asked. \"where am i?\" adiara asked. \"physically? i am sure you are in the medical bay of the resistance base. mentally? you are in a sort of a dream that resembles my chamber on starkiller base. what happens is up to you.\" \"so, if i close my eyes and count to ten, you will be gone?\" \"no. i am in control of this \"dream\" so to speak. i wished to talk to you face to face.\" \"nothing you could say to me would make me switch allegiance. i have no family for you to threaten; and you do not know where the base is. you have nothing to hold over me.\" \"is that a fact? what about mr. dameron?\" \"we both knew the risks when we vowed allegiance to the resistance,\" she said lying through her teeth. if she were to lose poe, she would be beside herself in grief and have no one left to turn to. \"you cannot lie to me!\" snoke yelled. \"let me try to speak to her,\" a mechanical voice came from behind her. \"kylo ren, i see you decided to join me after all. after all you failed to find this one and destroy her before she could join the resistance. as you wish, if you do not convince her to join us, then you must find her and destroy her,\" snoke said menacingly before disappearing. \"adiara, follow me,\" kylo said coldly through his mask. \"why should i? there is nothing you could say to me that would make me want to join the dark side or even trust you for that matter. you are nothing but a traitor!\" she yelled as tears slid down her face. \"let us go somewhere more private to speak,\" he said opening the door behind him with a wave of his hand. \"i could make you but i am giving you the option.\" she just stared at him. \"please, adi.\" \"no!\" she said crossing to him. \"no! you don\'t get to call me that anymore!\" she said to his mask as tears slid down her face. she pushed past him and walked out the door. \"how?\" she asked as she stopped dead. they weren\'t inside a building anymore but they were outside standing the middle of a field of wildflowers. she could feel the wind on her face and hear water nearby. \"snoke handed me control of the vision when he left, kylo\'s cold mechanical voice came. \"because letting me wake up and return to the people i actually care about would be too much. how long are you going to keep me in this vision prison?\" she asked turning to stare at him. she noticed that the door they had walked through had disappeared behind him. \"i won\'t keep you here long. it isn\'t safe too.\" \"and how do i appear in the real world? you know where i actually am?\" \"like you are in a coma, and given what snoke put you through before this, the doctors will easily come to that conclusion.\" \"that is encouraging,\" she responded shortly before walking away from him. \"don\'t walk away from me. we need to talk,\" he said sternly as he stood tall trying to intimidate her. \"you may control this environment, but you do not control me and you do not scare me. i know who and what is behind that mask,\" she continuing to walk towards where the water sounded like it was coming from. \"and what is that?\" he said starting to get angry. \"do you really want to know what i think?\" she said turning and staring at him angrily. \"yes i do,\" he responded coldly. \"i will answer only if you take that ridiculous mask of.\" she said crossing her arms across her chest. \"and if i say no?\" he asked. \"then this conversation is over and we have nothing to discuss,\" she said shortly before turning and walking away. \"i didn\'t dismiss you,\" he said angrily and she froze in her place. \"really? you are absolutely unbelievable. i cannot believe you would actually dare to use the force on me!\" she said trying to move. the only response she received was the sound of his mask depressurizing. \"you can struggle all you want. you aren\'t powerful enough to break my hold,\" a soft voice came. \"release me from this!\" she said through gritted teeth. \"fine, but if you try to walk away again, i will not hesitate to use the force to immobilize you,\" he responded. she felt as if a huge weight had been lifted off of her whole body and fell to the ground in exhaustion. she took a few deep breaths before two hands brought her to her feet. \"stand up.\" \"since when does the all mighty kylo ren show kindness?\" she said brushing off her clothes. \"don\'t push it, malek, his said coldly. \"now my mask is off. what do you see?\" he said turning her to face him. \"i still see the same naïve, scared 17 year old boy from those many years ago. i still see my best friend and i can still see the light in you,\" she said as tears filled her eyes. \"i still see you ben and i always will. there is still good in you, please come home.\" she was inches away from him, holding onto his arms for support to stand. he stood cold and rigid against her words. she could see the desperation in his eyes, she could see her scared best friend and all she wanted to do was to hug him. \"ben is gone. i killed him,\" he said coldly dropping his arms and stepping away from her. \"ben is not dead!\" she said angrily as the tears began to fall. \"you can say he is all you want, but i see him in your eyes.\" \"you see nothing! you know nothing. what could you possibly know? you chose not to be a jedi. you said that life wasn\'t for you! yet here you are because you are because you are strong in the force; yet you are untrained and easy to manipulate and read!\" he screamed as he gripped her arms and pulled her close. \"ben, this isn\'t you. come home to us. come home to me. i need you, ben. you wereare the only person that has ever fully understood me,\" she cried holding on to him for dear life. \"i am here to make you an offer. snoke wishes for you to become his apprentice as well. you would train with me, we would see each other every day. it could be similar to the old days,\" he started looking down at her. \"i can\'t. i can\'t betray everyone. i can\'t betray my friends and your family. they have been so kind to me,\" she responded letting her arms fall to her side. \"you mean you cannot betray dameron,\" he said coldly. \"i never said that,\" she started. \"you forget i can read your mind like an open book!\" he yelled angrily before turning around and grabbing his helmet from the ground. \"ben, please!\" she grabbing his arm. \"i have told you snoke\'s offer. if you refuse, i will have no choice but to hunt you down and kill you,\" he said not looking at her and placing his mask back on. \"you have one week to consider. i will meet you on naboo, at the place where my grandparents were married, then we will discuss your decision.\" he pulled his arm away and began to walk away. \"ben, please wait!\" she called, but he was gone. she sunk into the grass and cried, calling out for ben. she knew he was still there. if he wasn\'t then she would\'ve woken up by now and been back home. back on the base and able to hug leia and poe and cry in their arms. back in the medical bay: it had been days since the incident in the training room. adiara hadn\'t moved. the doctors said she was in coma, but it was unusual, her brain was working in overtime according to her brain scans. \"i have never seen anything like this. it makes sense that she would be in a coma after what she endured, but this is unlike any coma i have seen. the nurse said she will randomly shout something out or start speaking like she is having a conversation with someone in the room, but when the nurse looks no one is in here,\" the doctor said after the ran some more tests. \"i honestly do not know when or if she will ever wake up.\" \"thank you, doctor,\" general organa said with a soft smile. the doctor left and she turned to poe, who was sitting in the chair next to her bed. \"you really should get some rest poe, in your own bed, not this chair. you have spent every moment you can in here.\" \"i can\'t, general. i feel like i need to be here when she wakes up. she deserve to have someone here when she wakes up,\" he said running his hands through his hair. \"i understand that poe. why don\'t you go take a relaxing shower? i will sit here while you are gone, and if anything changes, i will send for you right away,\" she said placing a hand on his shoulder. he looked at her for a moment and then nodded his head in agreement. a shower would help his tense muscles relax some. \"i won\'t be long,\" he said rising from the chair. \"i will be right back,\" he said as he pushed adiara\'s auburn hair and placed a light kiss on her forehead before leaving the room. \"you know, that piolet has taken quite the liking to you,\" leia said after a while and taking her hand. \"i don\'t know what he would do if you never woke up. come back to us, adiara. you have become like a daughter to me and i cannot bare to lose you. i already lost my son,\" she said as tears formed in her eyes. \"i tried to reach out to han to let him know that snoke somehow managed to hurt you but i don\'t know where he is, hopefully he gets the message. look at me rambling on like some crazy woman, who knows if you can even hear me. i wish i knew where you are and what is happening to you.\" \"ben,\" adiara\'s voice came quietly. \"adiara, can you hear me?\" leia said standing closer the bed. \"adiara?\" \"ben,\" she cried louder before beginning to thrash around in the bed. \"adiara, lay still\" leia said trying to hold her still. \"dameron! doctor! someone!\" \"what is wrong?!\" poa said running in. \"help me hold her still before she hurts herself.\" poe obeyed immediately and ran over to the other side of the bed. he sat on the side of the bed and help adiara\'s arms at her side. \"adiara, calm down. it is me it is poe,\" he said calmly in her ear. she must have registered what he said because she calmed for a moment before starting to scream again. \"no! no! no, ben you don\'t have to do this! please no! poe!\" she cried as she bolted straight up, head butting poe in the process. \"poe!\" she exclaimed when she saw him in front of her. \"you are bleeding,\" she said through her tears. \"i will be fine. the good thing is that you are awake,\" he said pulling her into a hug. \"never scare us like that again.\" \"you are safe,\" she said through her tears as she gripping onto him for dear life. \"you are safe.\" \"the important thing is that you are safe,\" he said has his one hand entangled its self in her hair while the other rubbed circles on her back to calm her down. \"but i saw him..i saw him kill you,\" she choked out through the tear. \"who?\" leia asked. \"adiara, who killed poe?\" \"ben, ben killed him because i said no,\" she said before losing herself in her tears. leia and poe just simply glanced at each other, but decided it wasn\'t worth asking now. adiara was awake and that was what mattered now.'][Chapter 3] ['a/n: i haven\'t really felt like writing. i lost my mother unexpectedly in 2017 and ever since everything had just been gathering dust. i had no drive no creativeness. recently i feel like things are starting to get back to some kind of normalness. say something \"adiara, i have to leave the room, so the doctor can look at you,\" poe said trying to reassure her. \"i don\'t want you to go,\" she said grabbing his arm. \"i will be right outside with general organa. you will be able to see me the whole time out the window,\" he said placing his hand on her shoulder gently and giving her a soft smile. after a few moments, adiara gave a slow nod in agreement and poe gave her hand a gentle squeeze before leaving the medical bay. \"what do you think happened to her?\" he asked as he leaned against the window, watching the frightened girl within. \"i am not sure; but, we should not push her to tell us. she will tell us in her own time, when she is ready to. the next few weeks, maybe even months, will be hard on her, physically and mentally,\" the general said quietly, glancing at adiara. \"general,\" poe started. \"i know. you may delay your mission for a few days, but no longer. your mission is vital to finding luke,\" she responded before he could respond. \"yes, general,\" he responded before glancing back at the terrified girl feet away from him. \"i know how you feel about her poe. it is written on your face whenever you look at her,\" she said looking at him. \"general,\" he started but she raised her hand to stop him. \"she feels the same for you. it is nice to see love blooming in a time of war. however, it seems kylo ren and snoke are using her feelings for you, against her, torturing her with it. it means they know you have feelings for her. should you be captured by the order, they will do the same to you. they will use her against you,\" she said calmly. \"you must distance yourself from her. not completely. do not break her but protect her and protect your mind.\" \"i am not sure i can, general. the past few days of not knowing have been unbearable,\" he said looking away from the window and putting his head in his hands. \"make no mistake, poe. the order will use her against her. you must be careful. we all must.\" she said as she placed her hand on his shoulder. \"you have three days, then you must leave.\" \"yes, general. am i dismissed?\" he said standing up straight. \"yes, go to her. i will notify the base that she is awake and to remain undisturbed unless she requests to see them.\" \"thank you, ma\'am,\" he said before walking back into the medical bay to talk to the doctor. \"good news malek. the doctor says you are physically fine and you might be able to return to your own room tomorrow, with conditions that is,\" poe said as he sat on the edge of her bed. \"if i am physically fine, then why tomorrow? why not today? and what conditions?\" she said sharply. \"they want to keep you another night just for observation. the condition is that you speak to the psychiatrist or therapist on base, and come in daily to be double checked for any potential side effect from what happened,\" he said calmly. \"i just want my own bed, poe,\" she said looking at him with tears in her eyes. \"and my own clothes.\" \"do you want me to grab a few things from your room?\" poe asked gently. \"i would rather go to my room and shower and change,\" she said trying to get out of bed. \"malek, lay down,\" poe said pushing her back down. \"you have just been through a lot. you need to rest and trust the medical team.\" \"i want out of this bed, dameron. ask them if i can go to my room to shower, if need be you can accompany to my room and make me come back here,\" she snapped back forcefully. \"i will ask,\" poe said. \"no! have the doctor come in. i want to speak to him myself. i tend to be more forceful than you,\" she stated. \"as you wish,\" he said before exiting to fetch the doctor. as soon as he left her eyesight, adiara could feel her heart rate rising and she began to panic. she pulled her knees up to her chest and took deep breathes to steady her heart rate before the doctor entered the room. \"yes, malek,\" the doctor said coming to her bedside. \"i would like to go to my own room today. i want to shower and change. and rest in my own bed. i will wear a sensor, and someone can stay with me if you so choose. i do not want to spend another night in this medical bay,\" she said determined to have her way. \"adiara,\" poe started but stopped when she gave him a look. \"if i agree to this, you will wear a heart monitor, i will release you to someone else\'s care to watch over you and you must return to the medical first thing in the morning for additional tests,\" the doctor said reluctantly. \"i can agree to that,\" she said, nodding her head. \"ok, i will get the heart monitor. you will have to take it off to shower and then put it back on, immediately. dameron, i am assuming that i will be releasing her to your care?\" the doctor said looking at poe. \"yes, sir,\" he responded nodding his head. \"i will make sure she does what you require.\" \"very well then,\" the doctor said, turning to the cart behind him. he opened one of the drawers and pulled out a wristband. \"you may only take this off to shower, and that is all. if you do not put this back on within 30 minutes of taking it off, you will be back here for as long as i see fit. do you understand?\" he asked as he placed the wristband on her left wrist. adiara simply nodded her head yes. \"also, if at any time, dameron may bring you back here should he feel something is wrong. dameron, she is now under your care,\" the doctor said before leaving her bed side. \"adi, are you sure about this?\" poe asked, giving her a concerned look. \"yes, poe. please take me back to my own room,\" she said reaching for his hand. poe grabbed her hand and gently helped her get out of the bed and stand up. as she placed her weight on to her legs, adi felt her leg muscles tense and then collapse under the weight. poe caught her quickly in his arms and gave her a concerned look. \"i will be ok, poe. i promise,\" she whispered back to him. \"i am going to carry you,\" he whispered back. and with one fell swoop, poe had picked her up in his arms and made his way out of the medical bay. adi wrapped her arms around his neck and hid her face in his chest. her room was on the other side of base from the medical bay. she knew they would pass a good amount of people on the way and she didn\'t want to see any of the concern and worry on their faces. snoke had managed to invade her mind and torture her with ease. if her mind could be invaded so easily, couldn\'t anyone else\'s? but snoke didn\'t want anyone else. he wanted her and he was prepared to do anything to get her, alive or dead. \"dameron!\' a voice called, and she could here the sound of running footsteps. \"not now, wexley,\" poe called back gently. \"it is ok, poe,\" adi said gently as she buried her face as far as she could into his chest and tightened her grip around his neck. \"is she ok?\" wexley asked quietly. \"she can hear you, you know,\" adi said moving her head slightly to see wexley\'s face. \"i am sorry, malek. how are you,\" wexley said softly. \"i will be ok, thank you. i just want to get back to my own room and get cleaned up and rest,\" she responded with a soft smile. she could see a small sign of relief in his eyes. \"i am glade you are ok, malek. you had us all worried. i will let you get back to your room to rest. if you ever need to talk, i am here,\" malek said softly before giving her a soft smile and then leaving. \"thank you, wexley,\" she called so he could hear her. she returned her face to her previous position and poe continued to walk on. \"you know i am going to have to tell the general that you returned to your room, right?\" poe said softly after a few minutes. \"i know. the medical bay probably already informed her. i would not be surprised if she was waiting at my door when we get there. you know i could probably walk by now,\" she said softly. \"where is the fun in that?\" poe smirked. \"besides, we are almost to your room.\" \"have it your way, dameron. don\'t complain to me later when your arms hurt from carrying me across base,\" she said as she nuzzled her face in closer to his chest. \"you know for someone who has not showered in a few days, you don\'t smell that bad,\" he said trying to get her to laugh. \"don\'t be rude, dameron; or, i will make you carry me back to the medical bay,\" she said glancing up at him. \"which is where you should be,\" a voice came. \"general organa,\" poe said, stopping in his tracks. \"care to explain?\" she asked. \"you know how malek can get about the medical bay. she tends to be very persuasive.\" \"i think malek can speak for herself,\" leia said as she gently placed a hand on adi\'s shoulder. \"set her down on that bench poe. i wish to speak to her.\" \"yes, general,\" poe said with a nod before walking a few paces and placing adi on a bench. she blinked her eyes rapidly until she got used to the brightness. she could see leia standing in front of her giving her a stern look. \"i know what you are going to say general, but,\" she started but leia held up her hand. \"you do not,\" she said back. adi looked down at her hands as leia sat next to her. \"adi,\" leia said gently as she grabbed her hand. adi looked at her with tears forming in her eyes. \"i want you to know that as much as i do not agree with you leaving the medical bay, i understand. you have been through an ordeal and you need to be surrounded by familiar things and people you love. i will never force you to talk. you may talk to me or anyone when you choose to, on your own terms. do you understand me?\" she said gently. adi nodded her head and leia gently pulled her into a hug. \"you are like a daughter to me, adi. you have been with me for many years. please know that you can come to me with anything. i will help if it is my power to do so.\" \"yes, ma\'am,\" adi said through her tears and hugging her back gently. \"dameron,\" leia called. \"yes, general?\" poe said as he reappeared. \"i believe our young malek would like some rest. please see her to her room and watch over her. i will discuss further things with you tomorrow,\" she said sternly to him before turning back to adi. \"get rest my dear.\" she gave adi\'s hand a final squeeze and then stood and walked away. \"ready?\" poe asked as he offered her his hand. \"yes,\" she said taking his hand with a small sigh of relief. and without a word or any warning, poe swooped her up in his arms and adi let out a yelp. \"sorry,\" he said giving her a concerned look. \"i am ok, poe. you just startled me that is all. my room is right there, i assumed i would walk the rest,\" she said. \"like i said, where is the fun in that?\" poe asked with a smirk. he walked the few paces down the hall to her room, opened the door and walked in, closing the door behind them. \"poe, i am capable of walking to the bathroom to shower,\" she said as poe crossed her room. \"i am going to set you on your bed, then i will turn the shower on and go stand by the door to give your privacy,\" he said as he crossed to the bed to place her down on her bed. \"you could have at least gone to my dresser first,\" she said jokingly, as he set her down on her bed. part of her wished that he hadn\'t and that she was still in his arms, safe. she knew deep down that ben was right. she had developed some kind of feelings toward poe over the years, but there was always that small part of her that would still love ben and want to save him. even if he didn\'t think he was savable. that didn\'t matter now though. ben was gone and kylo ren stood ready to destroy the one thing she had left to hold dear. \"adi? are you ok?\" poe asked grabbing her hands and squatting down to look her in the face. \"i will be,\" she said softly, wiping away the tears that had slipped out of her eyes. \"the shower is on. i will let you shower and change. if you need me i will be right on the other side of the door,\" he said pointing to the chair just outside her bedroom door. adi had a slightly better living quarter than poe. since she was connected to leia, leia assigned a living quarter close to her. adi had more of a small apartment then just a room. she had a sitting area and then a pricy screen that separated the living area from her bedroom and bathroom. \"thank you, poe,\" adi said squeezing his hands and resting he forehead on his. \"malek, when will you learn that i would do anything for you?\" poe said gently before placing his hands on her face and giving her a small kiss on her forehead. \"get a shower. i will set up some blankets on the couch for me to sleep on.\" he said walking just outside her bedroom. \"if you need me, just call out, its privacy screen not a sound proof barrier,\" he said jokingly. \"i will, poe,\" she responded. he gave her one more look and then hit the button for the privacy screen.']"}]
