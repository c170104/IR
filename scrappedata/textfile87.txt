I was in college in Toronto studying to be a Graphic Designer. Since I started college later than most of my friends, I was still in college and only on my 3rd year. Matthew went to college the year he graduated high school which means he's done now...and now he's getting married. I called my dad on the phone after I received the card in the mail. \"I got the card in the mail. So you're invited to this stag?\" I asked. \"Are you going?\" My dad was really good friends with Matthew's mom and they still are, and he kind of knew Matthew too, and still does. \"Yeah, sure. Why not?\" he said. \"You're not going to go? Mrs. Hayes said you could come with me if you'd like.\" \"Wouldn't it be weird if I went to his stag? I barley knew him. The reason I really knew who he was was because I lik-.\" I cut myself off. \"...And even if I did know him, I haven't seen him since high school. That's like...7 years now.\" I almost told him I liked him in high school. That was close. \"Matthew doesn't mind.\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah. Are you in?\" I didn't think he remembered me. It would he pretty cool to see him though. \"I guess so.\" I answered Today was the last day of school so I packed up my stuff to stay with my father for the summer. Then I headed out. MATTHEW'S POV \"White or black.\" I said to myself while trying to pick which dress shirt I should wear. Suddenly, my phone went off. It was my mom calling. \"Hello?\" I answered. \"Hey Matty.\" she said. \"I have invited a few more people if thats okay with you. I knew you gave me the green light to invite people but I wanted to check with you.\" \"Ok.\" I said. \"Who did you end up inviting?\" \"Well only two more people.\" she answered. \"I invited the Young's and asked David Young if he could see if his daughter could come too, since she is still in college.\" \"Like, Katelyn Young?\" \"Yes dear.\" Then Matthew remembered. She was his high school crush. I starred in a daze, not even noticing he was while his friend Hayden was talking. \"Hey!\" said Hayden. Hayden looks in the direction I was looking. \"Ooh.\" said Hayden. \"Looks like someone has a crush on the new girl.\" \"No. Not at all.\" I lied. \"I'm just, day dreaming. I didn't notice where I was looking. \" \"Mhm, sure there bud.\" said Hayden. \"Oh ok.\" I said while being nervous. I haven't seen Katelyn in 7 years. This should be interesting. KATELYN'S POV \"Hi dad.\" I said as he opened the door. \"Hello sweetie.\" He pulled my into a big hug. \"I've missed you.\" \"I've missed you too dad.\" After my dad showed me my room I would be staying in. It looks like how I remember except with a few changes for my age. The walls were purple. On the right there was my same old twin bed with my night stand on the left with my lamp on it, and then a desk that my dad added in my room with some flowers and room for my computer. \"This room is really nice dad. Thank you.\" \"Oh hun, this is my room.\" He stared at me for a second with a concerned face, then laughed when he saw me smile and giggle. \"Ahaha good on dad.\" Then I nudged him. \"Go on and get ready sweetie.\" he said. \"Make sure you're ready in an hour.\" \"Ok.\" Then I went into my room and unpacked my clothes. I needed to decide what I wanted to wear for supper tonight. I grabbed out the two outfits I liked the most. What would Matthew like? A navy blue cardigan with a white tank top and black jeans, or a pink cardigan with a black tank top and white wripped capris? Then I stopped for a second. He has a fianc√©e. I ended up picking the pink cardian with the black tank top and while wripped capris. After I looked in the mirrior to make sure I the outfit was perfect, I went into the washroom. First, I grabbed my makeup bag and did my makeup peefectly, even my eye liner was really good, the wings were perfect. My eyebrows, amazing. Everything was good. Then, I grabbed my curling iron and curled my hair. I looked at myself in the mirrior for a few seconds and smiled. Perfect. \"Katie! Come on!\" my dad said from the front door. \"We have to go.\" \"Coming!\" When I walked out, my dad looked at me and smiled. \"You look beautiful sweetie.\" \"Thanks dad.\" I smiled back. \"Now let's head out. We don't want to be late.\" ","Summary":" KATELYN'S POV \"Matthew Hayes and Amy Vardon.\" It said as I read an invitation card that my dad ha"},{"Movie":"Falling in Love","Title":"mianhe&saranghae;","Author":"babyparkk","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12768312","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"baekk apakah kau ingin menjadi pendamping hidupku serta menjadi ibu dari anak anakku kelak\" . \"park chanyeol apa kau sudah gila hah!! appa dan eomma sudah menjodohkanmu dengan keluarga kim !\" . \"baekk mianhae kuharap kau mengerti.kurasa inilah yang terbaik\" . masih newbie maapkan kalo ceritanya pasaran dan kurang menarik. gppkok kalo mau sider setidaknya masih ada yg baca wkwk ","Summary":" \"baekk apakah kau ingin menjadi pendamping hidupku serta menjadi ibu dari anak anakku kelak\" . \""},{"Movie":"Falling in Love","Title":"i'll catch you if you fall","Author":"mrjustindrwb","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9331432","Passage":"[Chapter 1] capture 1. haii,nama gue yfn, gue biasa dipanggil yn. gue tinggal di canada sama nyokap bokap dan kedua kakak gue. gue sekolah di canda senior highschool. gue ini blasteran indonesia - amrik,nyokap gue ini orang indonesia asli, sedangkan bokap gue orang amerik. diantara gue sama kakak - kakak gue ini, gue doang yang keliatan ada indonya, alias blasteran,sedangkan kakak gue dua duanya , kakak pertama gue namanya nick, dia udah kerja di perusahaan ternama dan tinggal di nyc. dan kakak kedua gue namanya jason, gue paling deket sama abang gue yang jason ini, kita satu sekolah juga, cuma bedanya dia grade 3 sedangkan gue baru masuk shs ini. back to stroy. hari ini bakal ada acara perlombaan di sekolah gue, dan bakal ada bazaar+proomnight juga dihari terakhir acaranya. yang ngadain acara ini murid canada shs grade 2 sama 3. \"ynn, turun yukk, kita sarapan bareng mom sama dadd\" kata jason teriak dari pintu luar kamar gue. \"aaah iya jason turun duluan aja gue masih siap siap\" \"okee\" akhirnya jason turun duluan ke ruang makan buat sarapan. galama itu gue keluar buat nyusul jason, mom sama dad yang udah duluan sarapan. \"morning mom, dad\" kata gue sambil mengecup pipi nyokap dan bokap gue ini. \"hai sweety, you look so gorgeous todaay\" kata dad sambil menatap gue kagum. \"ah dad bisa aja, ini tuh biasa ajaaa\" kata gue ke dad manja. dad hanya senyum sambil menggeleng dan melanjutkan membaca korannya. \"sayang kamu mau sarapan apaa? mom udah ngebuatin fried egg sama bacon nih buat kamu\" kata mom sambil ngasih susu coklat kesukaan gue. \"yaudaah mom, aku arapan pake itu ajaa\" \" oke darl, here we aree\" kata mom sambil ngasih sarapan buat gue. \"it looks so yummy,i'll eat well!\" kata gue semangat seraya menghabiskan sarapan gue+susu coklatnya. \"yn cepeet dong, gue takut telat nihh\" kata jason teriak dari luar rumah. \"ah iya jason tunggu sebentaar,mom dad yn pergi dulu ya daaah\" kata gue sambil lari keluar rumah dan nyusul jason ke dalam mobil. setelah itu gue pergi ke sekolah gue. \"goodluck jason for today,do your bestttt\" kata gue sambil meluk abang gue ini. \"aww,thanks sist, take care yn\" kata jason sambil ngacak\" rambut gue. \" you too jasonn, byee.\" kata gue sambil pergi ninggalin jason. \"yn!\" \"caitlin,mileey!\" kata gue sambil meluk kedua sahabat gue ini. mereka ini sahabat gue dari elementary school. \"yn, lo harus ikut lomba nyanyi sambil main piano yn!\" kata caitlin diikuti miley, \"iya yn, lo harus ikut. lo pasti bakal menang yn\" \"ah tapi ini dadakan banget miley, caitlin...gue belom siap-..-\" \"udah ih pokoknya lo harus ikut yn! jangan sia siain kesempatan ini, gue udah siapin semuanya buat lo.\" kata miley ke gue \"hah? maksud l-\" \"udah sini ikut kitaa aja\" kata caitlin sama miley sambil narik gue ke suatu tempat. \"woyy tunggu tunggu\" kata gue berontak terus ngelepasin tangan gue dari mereka. \"kita mau kemanasih? jawaaab gue.\" kata gue sambil natap heran kedua sahabat gue. miley sama itlin bukannya jawab pertanyaan malah saling natap terus narik gue lagi-_- \"hihh miley caitlin jawa-\" \"DIEM YN\" teriak mereka ke gue. sumpah itu ngagetin banget oke-.- \" ..iy..iyaiya..\" kata gue. \"nih auditorium, lo bakal perfom disini, lo dapet urutan nomer 6 dari 8 peserta, sambil nunggu giliran lo, lo bisa latihan dulu di tempatnya justin lo tinggal kesana aja.\" kata miley jelasin semuanya ke gue. \"kita nunggu disini yn, ganbatte!\" kata caitlin diikuti anggukan miley. \"ta-ta-tapi tapi...\" \"gaada tapi tapi yn!\" kata miley. \"ah iyaiya gue pergi sekarang-.-\" \"pinterrr:3\" dasar miley. akhirnya gue pergi ninggalin miley sama caitlin. \"gila ya, kalo bukan garagara miley sama caitlin maksa gue, mana mau gue ikut lomba gini hih.\" kata gue ngegerutu sendiri, \"ini mana lagi ruangannya justin.

As I look around, everything seems to be perfect‚Ä¶ this is something a woman, in her right age, would dream of. This lovely place, the sweet rhythm of waves, the sand that tickles my skinny toes, the wind that makes my contoured tangles falls perfectly against my face, the sunset, oh, its impeccable kiss on the edge of the ocean, the beautiful red roses in their full bloom, the romantic sound of the piano that leaves a melancholic nudge on my heart. And this, this gorgeous white dress that caresses my skinny body. Why do I feel incomplete? My friends, relatives‚Ä¶and him-they're all smiling at me on this very special day. I can feel my heart pounding... beating so fast like I ran a thousand miles. I grip the arm of my aged father‚Ä¶ as we walk through the red isle. I can't forbid myself from thinking how all this started. Though it's been three years, the memories keep on flashing, scratching my wounds of the past, making it fresh and as painful as ever. First week of summer, 2009. I was staring at my just-woke-up face in my vintage mirror for a quite long time. Since it's my first day in class, I was thinking whether to put some make-up on or just leave this odd face pale. Then I realized I was running late for my Fine Arts class. Though it's just an elective, I put it on my priority list since being artsy runs in our blood.I quickly went over my closet, grabbed my favorite kitty pullover and put my ash blonde curls on a messy bun. I know I look so ordinary for the first day of class but, who cares? I mean, I am not one of those girls who love to paint their clown faces. I considered myself less than a simple girl who would prefer to have oil pastels and canvases than make-ups and lipsticks. Before I left my room, I checked the room of my not-so-older sister, I rolled my eyes when I saw her neat room empty. She was gone early again. \"Mom, gonna go now! I'm late again. Love you!\" I shouted as I headed to the door. My school is just a few minute walk from home but it was a scorching hot day so I decided to take my bike. I was about to head to our garage when suddenly a cold familiar voice murmured my name. \"Kate.\" I was surprised when I saw him sitting down on our patio. He looked perfect in his plain gray shirt and slim fit jeans. His beautiful brown eyes were locked with mine. He was staring at me like he's waiting for me to utter a word but I was out of somethin' to say. I just ran towards him as fast as I could and hugged him so tight. \"It's been forever.\" I cried. I rested my face on his chest for a while and let myself feel his warm, now grown body against mine. He then slowly stroked my tangled hair and locked it on my ear, pulled my chin upward so he could have a better view of my face. I should have put some make-up on. Ugh! \"It's been two years.\" He said softly, while wiping away my tears. Whew! I could feel the tension between the two of us. Is he going to kiss me? Oh crap! For the first time, it felt so awkward to be this close to him; it was like there was electricity flowing through my entire body. Maybe this was just a bare result of my constant viewing of Koreanovela. \"H-how long have you been waiting here?\" I asked while slightly pulling myself away from him. \"It's been forever!\" He answered, mimicking my childish voice. We both laughed aloud. There's a lot to talk about since we missed each other so much. We decided to walk to school though we're both late in the arts class, which was facilitated by his uncle, so no need for him to process some papers even if he's been away for two consecutive summers. \"So, what have you been doing?\" He asked while punching my right shoulder from time to time. \"Since you left me two years ago, I have been doing things alone, like painting my bike, buying groceries, cleaning my room, bathing your ugly dog ‚Ä¶ doing same old things, without you.\" I regretted mentioning the latter part because it sounded so melodramatic. I thought he would tease me or mock my voice, but when I looked at him, his face suddenly changed. \"I had two terrible years, Kate.\" He said then put his arm on my shoulder. We had an awkward silence after that conversation. As we arrived in school, people began to stop and look at him. Well, who wouldn't notice this guy? He's obviously good-looking. I felt sort of insecure, because aside from I purposely did not put some 'paint' on my face, those girls, who couldn't take their eyes off of him, were all gorgeously hot. Unlucky me. \"Well, well! Look who's here!\" Somebody from the 'audience' finally razed the amusement. When I looked around, I was very annoyed seeing my sister. He then quickly released his arm on my shoulder and went near her. \"Tris! It's really nice to see you.\" He said then gave her a quick kiss on her cheek. \"Likewise. So, you're staying until my sister's birthday, Travis? We'll celebrate it on Midnight Ball.\" She asked while rolling her eyes on me. How could she do that? Being so annoying at the same time, charming? She's obviously prettier than me. Ugh. \"Yeah, of course. Why would I miss my best friend's party?\" Travis said while putting his arm around my neck. Well, I emotionally died. Yes, best friend indeed. ","Summary":" CHAPTER 1 I feel completely incomplete.

Kisah cinta mereka yang lucu dan romantis tiba-tiba berubah ketika seseorang datang di antara kehidupan mereka, mengakibatkan hubungan Chanyeol dan Baekhyun penuh drama, kesakitan dan tangisan. Happy Reading Chapter 1 ==Tender Love== \"Yeol~ tadi jalanan sangat padat, dan tidak seperti biasanya bus nya datang terlambat, aku tahu aku salah. Kau memaafkanku kan yeol ?\" ucap pemuda manis yang baru saja turun dari bus dan mendekati seseorang pemuda lain yang lebih tinggi dengan wajah tampan yang ditekuk, kelihatannya dia sedang kesal kepada pemuda pendek dan manis yang berada di hadapannya. \"Yeeooll~ kau marah padaku ?\" ucap pemuda manis itu lagi sambil menarik lengan coat sang pemuda tinggi. \"Sudahlah ayo kita pergi sekarang \" ucap pemuda tinggi itu masih dengan wajah kesalnya. \"Kau marah\" pemuda manis itu terlihat cemberut sekarang, mungkin dia sedang mencoba merayu pemuda di depannya dengan wajah imutnya, siapa tahu pemuda tinggi itu tidak akan marah lagi padanya. \"Baekhyun dengar, mungkin saja aku akan meninggalkanmu jika kau bukan orang yang spesial untukku. Untuk lain kali jangan menolak ajakanku untuk menggunakan mobilku ketika kita akan berkencan, kau mengerti sayang ?\" ucap pemuda tinggi itu meletakkan kedua tangannya diatas bahu pemuda manis yang bernama Baekhyun yang diketahui adalah kekasihnya dan menatap kedua bola mata kekasihnya itu dengan dalam. \"hmm baiklah, maafkan aku\" ucap Baekhyun dan membalas tatapan kekasihnya dengan sebuah senyuman manis. \"Baiklah, lebih baik kita pergi sekarang sebelum antrian wahana yang akan kita naiki semakin panjang\" ucap Chanyeol meraih tangan Baekhyun dan memasukannya ke dalam kantung coat coklat yang dia pakai. Baekhyun hanya membalas dengan anggukan lucu dan tersenyum dengan sangat manisnya memancarkan kebahagiaan. Sepasang kekasih itu berjalan beriringan memasuki taman hiburan, sesekali mereka mengobrol dan terlihat bercanda, mereka mengeratkan genggaman tangan mereka dan semakin merapatkan tubuh mereka sekedar untuk membunuh rasa dingin di bulan Desember ini, sungguh manis. \"Apa yang ingin pertama kau naiki Baekhyun-ahh ?\" Chanyeol bertanya kepada kekasih mungilnya yang sekarang terlihat sedang mengedarkan pandangannya ke segala penjuru taman hiburan. \"Baekhyun-ahh, kau tidak mendengarku ?\" Chanyeol bertanya kepada kekasihnya yang masih terlihat seperti sedang mencari sesuatu. \"Itu~ aku ingin itu yeol, aku lapar\" Baekhyun mengarahkan jari telunjuknya ke sebuah kedai makanan. Baekhyun nampak seperti anak kecil yang meminta permen kapas kepada ibunya sekarang, wajah polosnya dan matanya yang berbinar benar-benar terlihat sangat imut, Chanyeol tidak bisa menahan tangannya untuk tidak mencubit pipi chubby kekasih manisnya itu. \"Baiklah, baiklah ayo kita kesana\" Chanyeol mencubit hidung mungil Baekhyun sebelum menggenggam tangan Baekhyun kembali menuju kedai makanan yang ditunjuk Baekhyun. Chanyeol sangat menyukai saat dia menggenggam tangan mungil Baekhyun, dia ingin menyalurkan kehangatan kepada kekasihnya itu, dan juga dia tidak ingin kehilangan Baekhyun lagi sama seperti disaat pertama kalinya mereka berkencan, Chanyeol kalang-kabut mencari Baekhyun mengelilingi taman hiburan yang sangat luas itu, padahal Chanyeol hanya meninggalkan Baekhyun sebentar karena dia ingin pergi ke toilet, Chanyeol menemukan Baekhyun saat itu disebuah toko suvenir, Baekhyun terlihat sedang membeli sebuah cincin couple untuk mereka berdua dan membeli sebuah boneka gajah, katanya boneka gajah itu mirip Chanyeol karena sama memiliki telinga yang lebar. \"Yeol~ ayo kita naik bianglala, antriannya tidak terlalu panjang.\" Ucap Baekhyun antusias, dia menarik tangan Chanyeol menuju antrian untuk menaiki bianglala. Chanyeol hanya pasrah saja dengan perlakuan Baekhyun, dia tidak bisa menolak jika kekasih manis dan cerewetnya itu sudah memaksa. \"Wooaaahhh yeol ini keren sekali, aku bisa melihat taman bunga dan itu indah, aku bisa mellihat semuanya dari atas ini keren yeol..!\" mata Baekhyun tampak berbinar melihat keindahan kota yang menjadi tempat tinggalnya itu. \"Itu biasa saja Baek, aku bisa melihat hal yang lebih indah dari taman bunga itu\" perkataan Chanyeol membuat Baekhyun mengalihkan perhatiannya yang sedang menatap kebawah, Baekhyun menghadap Chanyeol yang sedang menyenderkan punggungnya itu, Baekhyun penasaran. \"Apa yang lebih indah ?\" Chu~ Chanyeol tiba-tiba memcium bibir tipis dan pink milik Baekhyun, membuat Baekhyun terkejut dan tidak melakukan apa-apa, Baekhyun hanya bisa mengedipkan kedua matanya. Baekhyun seperti merasa jatuh cinta untuk pertama kalinya, ini bukan pertama kalinya Chanyeol mencium Baekhyun tapi Baekhyun selalu merasa Chanyeol menciumnya untuk yang pertama, rasanya masih sama tidak akan berubah, wajahnya akan merona, jantungnya akan berdegup kencang, dan merasa seperti ada ratusan kupu-kupu berterbangan diperutnya, perasaannya benar-benar bergejolak dan membuncah rasanya seperti akan meledak. \"Dirimu lebih indah\" ucap Chanyeol setelah melepaskan sentuhan bibirnya dengan bibir manis Baekhyun. Chanyeol terkekeh karena melihat Baekhyun yang mematung dengan wajah merah, dia benar-benar terlihat cantik dengan wajah yang merona malu itu dan Chanyeol selalu suka dengan ekspresi Baekhyun setelah dia menciumnya. \"Yeol~ bolehkah cium aku lagi ?\" \"Haa?\" ===Bersambung=== Ini adalah fanfiction yang Blue buat, maaf jika kurang memuaskan karena masih dalam proses belajar.

Ada apa? Tumben kesini?\" sedangkan kedua gadis tadi hanya saling melirik satu sama lain dan saling menyenggol pertanda diantara mereka siapa yang akan memberitahu sang sahabat yang berada didepannya,dan itu sukses membuat dini mengerutkan kening nya bingung. \"Lo berdua kenapa sih?? Dari tadi saling senggol aja. Kalo gak ada yang penting gue pergi mau ketemu dosen pembimbing. Lo tau sendiri akhir-akhir ini gue sibuk buat nyiapin skripsi. Sedangkan Lo berdua udah lulus dan malah udah enak kerja. \" oke sepertinya salah satu gadis tadi mendekat kearah dini,mungkin untuk memberi tahu dini mengapa mereka bisa tersesat di kampus nya. Atau mungkin memang sengaja menghampiri gadis bermata sabit itu. \"Lo tau? \" dini hanya menggeleng tanda tak tahu. \"Lo kan belom ngasih tau gue upil dugong!!.\" gadis yang satunya hanya menepuk dahi nya pelan. Memang bener sih, dia nya aja yang bodoh. \"Oke kali ini serius. Dia kembali. \" gadis itu menatap dini serius, sedangkan dini hanya memandang mereka bingung. 'Dia siapa? ' dalam hatinya. Seolah tau gadis yang menjabat sebagai sahabat nya sedari kecil itu hanya diam tidak mengerti dengan perkataan sahabat nya, gadis yang di sebalah nya ikut menjawab. \"Cinta masa kecil lo bodoh!!\"dini masih mencerna ucapan mira dan mengingat siapa cinta masa kecilnya, karena lumayan banyak. Ehe. Oke abaikan. \"Cinta masa kecil?\" dia masih bingung mengerutkan dahinya dalam, sedang kan kedua gadis itu menepuk dahi nya kesal. Kenapa juga mereka punya sahabat yang kadang Lola dan oon nya itu sudah mendarah daging. \"Rani coba lo jelaskan sama sahabat kita ini yang sedikit Lola dan banyak oon nya. \" dini yang mendengar ucapan mira mendelik kesal, memang nya dia se Lola dan se oon itu apa?? \"Oke tapi sebaiknya kita membahas nya jangan di koridor juga kali, kita cari tempat yang nyaman buat ngobrol. \" dini hanya menurut saja di seret kedua sahabatnya rani dan mira meskipun dia harus bertemu dosen pembimbingnya dalam kurun waktu 2 jam lagi, baru saja dia mendapat pemberitahuan nya. Yaa semoga saja cerita mereka tidak memakan waktu lebih dari 2 jam itu bisa gawat untuk kelangsungan skripsi dini. OLD LOVE \"Jadi dia kembali? \" yah setelah rani dan mira menjelaskan dengan sedikit gemas karena sahabatnya ini memang pelupa, kadang yang terjadi kemarin juga dia lupa dan mengingatnya setelah beberapa waktu kemudian. Tapi untuk urusan cinta di masa lalu atau cinta monyet nya itu dia seperti tidak lupa. \"Iya, dia datang kembali. Kata papa sih dipindah tugaskan disini, Entahlah gue juga gak terlalu banyak tanya, lo tau sendiri hubungan gue sama papa gue setelah dia mutusin buat menikah lagi sama ibunya si iyan gimana? \" mereka berdua hanya mengangguk mengerti. Perjalanan hidup rani memang sedikit berat, setelah papa nya menikah lagi sejak rani berusia 2 tahun dan kepergian ibunya 5 tahun yang lalu membuat dia sedikit lebih tertutup pada orang lain selain dini, mira dan satu lagi raka sahabat mereka juga. Dan yah rani dan iyan adalah saudara tiri, tapi mereka berhubungan baik karena bagi rani yang salah itu orang tua mereka bukan anaknya yang bahkan tidak tau apa-apa. Dini hanya mengangguk mengerti, entah kenapa perasaannya seakan merespon baik kabar datang nya cinta masa kecilnya dulu. Dan iyan adalah cinta pertama dini , atau bisa dibilang cinta monyet seorang bocah SD yang baru mengenal apa itu cinta. Tapi sepertinya bagi dini itu bukan sekedar cinta monyet, karena sampe saat ini rasa itu masih ada di sudut hati dini yang tersembunyi. Tentu dia tidak menyadarinya. \"Lo gak penasaran apa gimana dia sekarang? \" mira nanya dengan hati-hati. \"Entahlah, gue ngerasa dia juga udah lupa sama gue mir. Lo tau sendiri itu udah 11 tahun yang lalu. Gue juga sedikit lupa, tapi sepertinya hati gue menolak untuk melupakannya.\" mira dan rani hanya saling memandang dan tersenyum penuh arti, sedangkan dini dia fokus pada minumannya. Tanpa menyadari perkataan nya baru saja. Hari itu dini pulang agak sore dari biasanya, karena dia harus mengerjakan dan menanyakan beberapa hal dengan dosen nya tentang tugas-tugas nya itu. Dia tinggal dirumah yang sedari kecil dia tinggali, sedangkan orang tua, kakak, serta adik-adiknya pindah ke kampung halaman sang ibu. Entahlah, dini memang tidak mau meninggalkan rumah ini, meskipun dia tinggal di rumah yang lumayan besar dan luas ini seorang diri dan beberapa asisten rumah tangga tentunya. Kadang juga mira, rani serta raka menemani nya. Mereka semua memang bertetangga dari dulu. \"Butuh tumpangan? \" dini menoleh kearah sampingnya dan tersenyum melihat siapa yang menawari nya itu. \"Apa gak ngerepotin lo ka??\" raka tersenyum dan menggeleng. \"Tentu aja enggak din, ayok lah lagian kita kan sekomplek juga apalagi rumah kita bersebrangan. \" dini hanya tersenyum kecil dan mengangguk. Lalu naik keatas motor milik raka. Dalam perjalanan mereka mengobrol tentang apa saja yang menarik, omong-omong raka ini sudah bekerja di bank cabang di kota ini, ini tahun kedua nya bekerja disana. \"Aku dengar iyan kembali? \" dini sedikit mengeratkan pegangan tangannya di jaket kulit hitam milik raka. Seakan memberi tau raka bahwa dia tidak ingin untuk membahas ini. Raka yang merasakannya mengurungkan niatnya untuk menanyakan hal itu lebih jauh lagi, dia tau kalo dini sangat sensitif tentang apa saja yang berhubungan dengan lelaki itu. Walaupun dulu mereka sempat menjalani kisah yang sama tapi itu tak upaya membuat dini bisa berpaling dari laki-laki itu pada raka. Benar dini dan raka pernah menjadi sepasang kekasih selama 1 tahun, tapi entah kenapa raka memutuskan Dini dengan alasan dia Sudah bosan Dan lebih baik menjadi sahabat saja. Padahal sampai saat ini perasaan raka masih tetap sama pada gadis itu, hanya saja dia tidak mau memaksakan kehendak kalo emang dini tak bisa mencintai dia seutuhnya. Masih ada bayang-bayang si pria masa lalu nya, yang sialnya dia adalah sahabat serta sepupu jauh raka. \"Sudah sampai, sana masuk.jangan terlalu sering begadang, apa rani dan mira gak jadi nginep? \" dini menggeleng dan tersenyum. \"Kayak nya sih mereka lembur, gak apa-apa lah gue udah biasa sendirian. Lo juga istirahat ka jangan terlalu di forsir. \" raka mengangguk dan tersenyum seraya mengacak rambut dini pelan. \"Siap nyonya. \" dan setelah mengatakan itu raka pergi kearah rumah nya dengan tawa yang masih terdengar membuat dini mendelik kesal. OLD LOVE \"Gimana? Lo berdua mau kan bantuin gue buat nemuin mereka berdua?\" mira sedang berdiskusi dengan rani dan raka. \"Gue sih ikut aja, gak tau nih si raka. \" mira beralih menatap raka, sedangkan raka mengedikkan bahu nya saja. Dalam hati dia mendengus kesal, tapi apa boleh buat demi kebahagiaan orang yang dia sayangi. \"Oke, berarti setuju yaa!! \" Mereka berdiskusi agar dini dan iyan atau adrian bisa bertemu kembali, ini demi kebaikan mereka karena ada yang belum selesai di antara mereka berdua. Dengan ide gila yang ada di otak rani dan mira, raka? Dia hanya mengikuti saja. \"Lo ngapain sih ka nyeret gue kesini segala!! \" dini ngomel terus di perjalanan nya menuju tempat yang udah mereka, raka, mira dan rani rencanakan untuk mempertemukan iyan dan dini. \"Udah diem aja deh kagak usah bawel, biasanya gue culik juga lu kagak banyak bacot. \" dini mendelik kesal. 'Si raka kalo ngomong emang suka bener.' -ucap dini dalam hati Mereka sampai di cafe yang udah di pesan mira, entahlah gadis itu seakan terobsesi buat nyatuin dini dan iyan, tapi belum tentu juga si iyan mau sama dini kan? Dan lagi gak mungkin juga kalo si iyan masih jomblo kan?? Emang si mira itu doyan shipper-menyipper deh kayak nya. Gatau aja padahal ada cowok yang selama ini selalu bersama mereka yang masih mendem perasaan nya sedari dulu, yahh hanya cowok itu dan tuhan yang tahu. \"Yaudah sana masuk bilang aja atas nama raka, gue mau ke toilet dulu. \" \"Eh tapi, ka--\" belum juga beres dini ngomong raka udah main pergi aja, jadi nya dini langsung masuk aja dan menanyakan tempat duduk yang udah di pesan raka katanya. Setelah mengetahuinya dini berjalan menuju tempat itu, tapi Dia heran. Bukankah tempat itu raka yang pesan tapi kenapa sudah ada yang nempatin, tanpa curiga dia menghampiri orang yang duduk di tempat yang tadi raka bilang. \"Maaf, bukankah ini tempat yang teman saya pesan, kenapa anda bisa duduk disini?\" orang atau bisa di bilang seorang pria yang sibuk dengan ponsel nya itu menoleh kearah sumber suara dan mereka sedikit terkejut tapi dini sebisa mungkin mengatasi keterkejutan nya. \"Ah, sorry. Tadi gue di suruh rani nunggu disini, dan dia bilang lagi ke toilet.\" dini mengangguk datar, pasti ini kerjaan mereka bertiga yang sengaja mempertemukan dini sama cinta lamanya. 'Awas aja mereka, kalo nanti ketemu gue bejek tuh upil anoa.' -batin dini kesal. \"Yaudah, duduk aja. Lo dini kan? Lama gak ketemu ya!! \" dini hanya ngangguk kaku dan menuruti perintah pria didepannya, adrian atau iyan, si cinta masa lalu nya. \"Ya. Sekitar 11 tahun.\" balas dini dengan tersenyum tipis. \"Gimana kabar lo? Katanya lo masih sibuk sama skripsi lo? \" dini ngangguk seraya minum pesanan yang sebelum nya udah dia pesan. \"Ya begitulah, kabar lo sendiri gimana? Katanya lo juga udah kerja gantiin bokap lo, buat menjadi tulang punggung keluarga? \" \"Yaa sekitar 2 tahunan lah gue kerja, iya ngumpulin duit buat masa depan gue kelak. \" iyan terkekeh pelan entah apa yang sedang dia bayangkan. Sedangkan dini hanya diam dengan raut tak terbaca. Sedikit canggung memang. Mereka mengobrol meskipun dini hanya sesekali menimpali nya, iyan memang banyak berubah tapi sikap dan sifat nya masih sama seperti dulu jika dia sedang bersama dini, entahlah dia gak bisa menghilangkan kebiasaan nya yang itu sepertinya. Yang dini tau, dia udah gak tinggal bareng orang tua nya, dan sekarang dia di pindah tugaskan ke kota ini kerjaan nya. Itu sih yang dini tau dari ceritanya barusan. Dini yang sedang mendengarkan cerita iyan tiba-tiba merasakan perasaan yang entahlah, sakit atau perih di hatinya setelah iyan mengangkat telpon entah dari siapa, yang pasti mereka terlihat mesra. Padahal dia dan iyan kan emang tidak punya hubungan apa-apa selain teman masa kecil. Ini hanya perasaan sepihak yang dirasakan dini saja, sedari dulu memang iyan hanya menganggap nya sahabat tidak lebih. \"Sebentar oke, gue mau jawab telpon penting dulu.\" dini hanya mengangguk. \"Halo sayang, iyaa aku... \" entah lah hanya itu yang bisa dini dengar sebelum iyan benar-benar pergi keluar untuk menjawab telpon pentingnya. Dini hanya menghela nafas pelan, ini yang dia takutkan kalo mengharapkan sesuatu yang tidak mungkin lagi bisa dia raih. Harus nya dia gak percaya gitu aja sama sahabatnya, dia baru aja menyembuhkan luka nya, beberapa bulan lalu akibat pacarnya yang ketahuan selingkuh, sekarang dia di hadapkan lagi dengan kenyataan yang pahit. Sungguh hidup dini seakan dilarang untuk merasakan apa kebahagiaan yang sesungguhnya. Apakah tuhan marah padanya? OLD LOVE Seminggu berlalu sejak dini dan iyan bertemu, dini semakin menyibukkan diri dengan skripsi nya yang akan memulai sidang 1 bulan lagi. Mira, rani dan raka bingung dengan dini yang seakan menghindari mereka dengan berbagai alasan. Dan dini juga tidak bercerita tentang pertemuan nya dengan iyan. Di tambah lagi dini semakin Murung, mereka merasa ada sesuatu yang tidak beres dan sekaligus merasa bersalah sama dini. Dini sebenernya adalah gadis yang ceria dan gak bisa diem. Tapi setelah dia terus-menerus di sakiti, dia perlahan berubah. meskipun dari luar dia terlihat baik-baik saja, tapi nyatanya didalam dia sangat rapuh. Dia terlihat baik-baik saja dan berhasil menyembunyikan luka yang telah dia rasakan selama ini. \"Kalian ngerasa ada yang beda gak sama dini?\" raka nanya sama kedua sahabat nya rani dan mira. Mereka mengangguk bersamaan. Saat ini mereka memang sedang berada di rumah besar milik keluarga rani. \"Iya, dia seperti menghindari kita dan menyembunyikan sesuatu lagi seperti biasanya.\" mira menjawab seraya menerawang ke atas langit yang tiba-tiba sendu. \"Dia terlihat baik-baik saja diluar, tapi siapa tahu didalam dia sangat rapuh seperti kaca yang sudah retak dan tak bisa kembali seperti semula.\" raka dan mira mengangguk kompak mendengar penuturan rani. Mereka merasa bersalah pada sahabat yang di sayangi nya seperti saudara nya sendiri itu, dan bertekad untuk meminta maaf nanti. dini sedang berjalan menuju cafe depan untuk membeli sesuatu yang menyegarkan tenggorokannya, dia sangat lelah 2 minggu lagi sidang skripsi nya, dan dia sangat-sangat tidak teratur denganmengistirahatkan dirinya sendiri, bahkan mengisi perutnya sendiiri. Dia sedang menikmati waktu senggang nya dengan tenang, tiba-tiba dia di kejutkan dengan kedatangan orang yang paling di hindari nya belakangan ini. \"lo sendiri din? Boleh gabung?\" dini menoleh karena merasa kenal dengan pemilik suara ini. Dia sedikit menegang, karena orang itu tidak sendiri. Dini hanya tersenyum tipis dan mengangguk pelan. \"Silahkan.\" Pria itu dan gadisnya duduk di seberang tempat dini duduk. \"Tumben lo sendiri, kemana ke tiga kurcaci lo itu? \" \"Gatau, mereka kan udah kerja. Mungkin masih kerja. \" dini melihat sedikit kearah jam tangannya. \"Ah iya, By the way kenalin ini alice cewek gue.\" dini terasa kaku mendengar penuturan iyan, dini sudah menduga nya. 11 tahun bukan waktu yang sebentar bukan? \"Halo, gue dini. Temen kecilnya iyan, eh adrian maksudnya.\" dini keceplosan karena iyan hanya panggilan dari dia saja, sampe ketiga sahabatnya mengikuti memanggilnya iyan. \"Alice.\" dan gadis itu seperti tidak suka dan risih dengan dini, entahlah dini hanya merasa seperti itu. Mereka mengobrol lumayan lama, walau hanya iyan dan alice yang mengobrol dan memamerkan kemesraannya. Rasanya dini ingin segera pergi, tapi itu terkesan tidak sopan karena iyan meminta dini tetap tinggal dulu, tapi nyatanya dari tadi dia hanya sibuk dengan ceweknya yang sedikit centil dan cemburuan itu. \"Dini? Lo ngapain disini. \" entah ini sebuah keberuntungan atau kesialan yang lain, dini melihat raka yang kebetulan mampir ke cafe itu dan menghampiri meja nya bersama adrian serta kekasih nya. \"eh, elo ka. \" itu iyan bukan dini yang nyapa, raka hanya melirik iyan sebentar karena fokus nya tertuju pada dini yang seakan meminta tolong padanya untuk segera membawa dia pergi dari situasi ini, itu yang raka lihat dari tatapan dini padanya. raka yang mengerti menghela nafas pelan dan sedikit mengeraskan rahangnya, itu membuat hatinya ikut sakit melihat dini seperti ini. \"Ayo ikut pulang bareng gue, rani dan mira nyariin lo, mereka khawatir sama elo.\" raka gak sepenuhnya bohong, memang benar rani dan mira sangat khawatir sama dini setelah tau kebenarannya. Rani bertanya langsung sama iyan, dan memang benar iyan sudah mempunyai pacar, dan buktinya sekarang pacarnya ada disini bersama iyan dan juga dini. Raka semakin mengeraskan rahang nya menahan marah. 'sialan!!' batin raka \"Biar dia pulang bareng gue ka, diluar ujan. Lo kan bawa motor.\" Raka hanya menoleh sekilas. \"Gak, dia pulang bareng gue. Gue juga bawa mobil. Mending lo anterin aja cewek lo ini udah malem gak baik anak gadis pulang malem. \" nada suara raka sedikit datar mengundang raut bingung di wajah iyan. gak biasanya raka begini. Batin iyan. Raka menatap iyan dan gadisnya bergantian, seakan tau maksud raka iyan menjawab, \"Dia nginep di apartemen gue, besok dia baru balik ke kota tempat tinggal dia.\" dini yang mendengar sedikit terkejut. Mereka tidur serumah dan mungkin sekamar? Apa mereka sudah melakukan lebih dari sekedar tidur berdua saja? Entahlah, membayangkan nya saja membuat perut dini mual dan kepala dini pusing. \"Lo kenapa din? Sakit? Ayo kita pulang. Makanan sama minuman lo biar gue yang bayar. \" dini hanya mengangguk pasrah di rangkul raka karena dini terlihat sangat lemas dan raka tidak setega itu untuk menarik kasar dini, raka dan dini pergi setelah membayar makanan dini tentunya, dan dengan tanpa pamit sama iyan yang memandang mereka dengan tatapan yang sulit di artikan. Sesampai nya di rumah dini, dia hanya terdiam dengan pandangan kosong nya. Raka menghela nafas pelan, ini yang selalu dia khawatirkan. Dini selalu seperti ini jika sedang merasa tak baik-baik saja. Diam dan tidak bergerak dengan pandangan kosong. Raka meraih kedua bahu dini agar menghadap kearah nya dan langsung memeluk tubuh dini pelan, menguatkan tubuh yang sangat rapuh itu. Dini membalas pelukan raka dengan erat, hanya ini yang dia butuhkan. Sandaran dan tumpuan di saat dia tak kuat lagi hanya untuk sekedar bersuara. Setelah sedikit tenang, raka melepaskan pelukannya dan menangkup kedua pipi dini lalu mencium kening nya dalam sampai dini menutupkan kedua matanya merasakan ciuman lembut pada kening nya yang dia rasa itu isi hati dari raka. Sungguh raka sangat menyayangi gadis yang berstatus sahabatnya ini. \"Sana masuk, istirahat gak usah di pikirin lagi. Yang harus lo pikirin adalah sidang lo 2 minggu lagi. Maafin kita yang udah buat lo masuk ke zona gak nyaman lo lagi. Gue, rani, dan mira sayang sama lo.\" 'Dan gue masih sangat mencintai lo, dari dulu. Gue ingin egois tapi itu akan menyakiti lo, jadi gue harap lo bisa bahagia walau gak sama gue.' lanjut raka dalam hatinya. Dini ngangguk dan keluar dari mobil raka tanpa se patah kata pun terlontar dari bibir nya cherry nya. Raka memandang sendu punggung dini yang perlahan menghilang di balik pintu rumah besarnya. OLD LOVE Beberapa bulan kemudian... \"Dini tolong bawakan saya berkas kemarin dari bagian personalia.\" dini hanya mengangguk meng iya kan perintah atasan nya. Yang entah kebetulan atau tidak dia adalah iyan, orang yang 2 bulan ini sudah di hindari, tapi takdir berkata lain mereka bertemu di perusahaan yang sama bahkan iyan menjabat sebagai atasan dini selama 2 bulan ini. Benar, setelah lulus dini memutuskan bekerja. Untung saja dia langsung di terima di perusahaan yang saat ini dia lakoni karena yah, dini memang cerdas walaupun sedikit lola dan oon. \"Ini pak berkas nya, apa ada lagi yang bapak butuhkan?\" pria itu menghela nafas pelan, dia sudah berkali-kali menyuruh dini agar tidak memanggilnya bapak, tapi sepertinya kekeras kepalanya gadis itu tidak pernah hilang. \"Gue butuh lo nemenin gue disini!!\" \"Tapi pak, saya--\" \"Tak ada penolakan.\" dini menghela nafas kesal dan berjalan gontai ke arah kursi di depan meja kerja atasan nya. Dini niatnya ingin menghindari iyan, tapi sepertinya pria itu sengaja membuat dini agar dekat-dekat dengannya, dan itu sangat menyebalkan bagi dini. Iyan yang diam-diam melirik pun hanya tersenyum senang. Entahlah setelah kembali kesini perasaan nya sedikit berubah. Dia sering memikirkan gadis yang sudah menjungkir balikkan hatinya sejak dulu. Bahkan sampai saat ini. Dan itu tanpa gadis itu serta sahabat-sahabat nya sadari, karena iyan cukup pintar menyembunyikan perasaan nya. Bagaimana dengan alice? kekasihnya? Entahlah, iyan sudah putus dengan mantan kekasihnya itu. Dia baru mengetahui bahwa perempuan itu hanya mempermainkan nya saja, padahal dia sungguh-sungguh bahkan telah merencanakan akan melamarnya. Tapi untung saja dia lebih cepat tau bagaimana busuk nya perempuan itu. Sungguh-sungguh? Sepertinya hanya pelarian saja, dan iyan tidak menyadari itu semua. Dia kembali melirik dini yang sibuk dengan berkas yang tadi iyan berikan agar dia tidak bosan. Wajah nya masih sama seperti 11 tahun yang lalu, hanya saja saat ini terlihat lebih dewasa dan semakin cantik. \"Halo ka!! \" Iyan tersentak dari lamunan nya ketika dini menjawab telpon yang dia tau dari raka, sahabat serta sepupu jauh nya. \"Lo pulang sendiri dulu ya? Gue gak bisa jemput ada urusan keluarga, biasa. \" Dini terkekeh pelan mendengar nada frustasi raka yang tidak bisa menjemputnya. Dan itu tidak luput dari tatapan tajam milik iyan. \"Astaga ka, gue kira kenapa. Iyaa santai aja, lagian masih banyak taxi kok jam segini.\" jawabnya seraya melirik kearah alroji yang melingkar di pergelangan tangannya. Sedangkan raka hanya menghembuskan nafas lega dan segera menutup telpon nya. Padahal disini jarang ada taxi lewat. Dini menghembuskan nafas nya pelan seraya berjalan ke arah halte di depan kantor tempatnya bekerja. Tin.. Tin... Suara klakson mobil menyadarkan dini dari lamunan nya, melihat siapa tersangka nya dan dengan cepat dia hanya merotasikan kedua matanya malas. 'sial, kenapa harus dia lagi sih?' itu yang gadis bermata sabit itu pikirkan. \"masuk, gue anter pulang udah malem juga biasanya jarang ada taxi jam segini.\" Dini masih diam, benar juga. Tapi, hatinya menolak segala sesuatu tentang pria di depannya yang entah sejak kapan telah berada dihadapan nya dan menyeret nya masuk kedalam mobil mewah milik nya. 'jantung sialan!!' maki gadis itu dalam hati. _ ","Summary":" cast : Oh Sehun - Adrian/Iyan Kim Sejeong - Dini Zhang Yixing - Raka Park Sora - Rani Park Sooyoung"},{"Movie":"Falling in Love","Title":"Lukesse Forever (Lukesse)","Author":"JusthereforMCSM","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13120654","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"Hey! No fair!\" Jesse shouted as she was hit by a stick. A boy with blonde hair and ocean blue eyes sniggered as he kept running. \"Tag is for 'it' to get the other person, not to throw sticks, Lukas!\" Jesse cried out as she slumped next to a tree. Lukas noticed that she was upset, and sat next to her as she put her face between her knees, trying not to look at Lukas. \"I'm sorry Jess,\" Lukas muttered quietly, \"Do you know what my mom does when we are hurt?\" Jesse was intrigued by this, she lifted her head to look at him. \"What?\" She wondered aloud. She was surprised to see that he had kissed her on the cheek, and he smiled, not knowing what effect he had just given Jesse‚Ä¶ *Lukas' POV* Lukas snapped back to Earth as Radar was constantly yelling his name. \"Sorry Radar, I was lost in thought.\" \"That's alright, I have some changes to BeaconTown I want to tell you about!\" Radar launched into a full explaination about the parts of town that were in the progress of repairment. Lukas stopped listnening. He was still yet thinking of Jesse, but it was impossible to talk to her now, she was thousands of blocks out from our town with Petra, and she vowed she would return by next week. I sighed and continued to listen to Radar talk. \"And lastly, Jesse sent me a letter last night saying she was coming home early and I could've sworn I saw someone coming out of what used to be Champion City‚Ä¶\" \"Hey guys!\" The familiar face of Jesse popped in form the entrance of the treehouse. She hasn't changed, she was still beautiful with her perfect raven hair, and her emerald green eyes were still sparkling. \"Jesse!\" I ran to hug her and she hugge me back. There was a sound of a flash, and I turned to the trapdoor of the treehouse- Petra had taken a picture of us hugging. She had told me forever ago that she shipped us together and will do anything to get us to kiss. My cheeks grew rosy from embarrassment. \"Hey guys.\" Petra said slyly. I pretended she never took a photo and hugged her, too. Radar, on the other hand, looked as though he was going to explode. \"Jesse! Petra!\" Olivia came emerging from her room when she got a text from Petra of the pic of us hugging. Axel, hearing all the noise, came bursting from his bedroom to greet the two friends. It was a good reunion, but pretty soon it got late. Axel, Radar, and Olivia has all gone to bed, and Jesse, Petra and I were still talking and laughing in the Living Room. *Petra's POV* I suddenly realized after talking to the two, Lukas and Jesse, I was third-wheeling the two lovebirds. I pretended to yawn, even though I wasn't tired. \"I'm gonna have to hit the hay now, byeeee.\" I walked away from the two people I call Lukesse, then I realized that Olivia was hiding behind a wall, waiting for a moment once she heard I was going to bed. I alredy knew she shipped the two, and I sat down with her. \"Looks like mission Lukesse is a go!\" Olivia whispered to me excitedly. I grinned and nodded in agreement, then put a finger to my lips as I watched the two people in the Room. *Jesse's POV* Lukas and I talked for a while, but I was growing tired, but I didn't go because Lukas looked like he was bursting to say something. After a while, Lukas sighed and muttered something to himself about telling something. He straightened up and asked me, \"Do you wanna go for a walk?\" I smiled and agreed, despite my aching tiredness.[Chapter 2] * Lukas' POV* As we left the treehouse, I lead Jesse on a walk. She yawned a few times, but obviously tried to pass it off as a laugh or cough. We sat down on a small steep hill after a while and I nervously started off another conversation, this time about our childhood. We laughed uneasily as I recounted the events that took place during tag, then I stopped when I got to the cheek-kissing part. I quickly changed the subject. Jesse stood up and walked to the edge of the hill, playing casually with a stick. She threw it down the hill, then looked over to see how far she threw. I got up and looked over, too, but suddenly Jesse lost her footing and slipped. She grabbed my outstretched hand at the last moment as I blushed a little. I pulled Jesse up, and she regained her foot hold; then acted as though nothing had happened. \"Thanks for the hand, Lukas,\" Jesse said. \"We should be getting back now.\" I trudged alongside Jesse as she walked through the dark oak trees. Out of nowhere, we heard a noise of a twig snapping. In shock, Jesse grabbed my hand and leaned back in fear. I heard a snap, like a photo being taken. Petra and Olivia. A/N right now in the story, there isn't a lot of Lukesse going on. There will be more, cuz rn is the beginning of the story. NO LEMONS. Most heated activity is kissing.

Man h√§tte heulen k√∂nnen. Aber egal wie langweilig - es musste ja sein. Heute war Donnerstag, was bedeutet wir hatten Mittagsschule. Es war schon etwas sp√§ter also hatten wir nur noch zwei Stunden Sport, die wir √ºberstehen mussten. Um genauer zu sein Basketball. Ich war weder besonders gut noch besonders schlecht darin, aber ich gab immer mein bestes. In den Umkleiden roch es nie sonderlich gut, was ja auch ziemlich normal ist, aber es hatten so viele schon wieder ihr Deo vergessen, dass es fast unertr√§glich war. Ich wollte nicht l√§nger hier drin bleiben, wollte nicht den Gestank ertragen, also gab ich allen, die kein eigenes hatten, mein Deo, was f√ºr alle eine Entlastung war. Mir gegen√ºber waren immer alle h√∂flich und keiner war irgendwann gemein oder unfair zu mir. Es gab niemanden den ich nicht mochte und ich hatte fast nie Streit mit irgendwem, was eigentlich ein bisschen untypisch f√ºr 16 j√§hrige M√§dchen ist. Zumindest mal meiner Erfahrung nach. \"KAAAAAAAAAAEE!\" Rief mich pl√∂tzlich Hanna aus meiner Parallel-klasse und riss mich aus meinen Gedanken. \"Kyaaah! Erschreck mich nicht so! ... Was ist los?\" \"Wollen wir gleich zusammen in ein Team?\" Antwortete sie mit einem dummen Grinsen. \"J-ja klar!\" Dass ich das von Hanna gefragt wurde war schon eine Ehre, denn sie war eine totale Sportskanone und ziemlich beliebt. Ich war zwar auch beliebt aber eine total sch√ºchterne Person - das komplette Gegenteil von Hanna. Ich ging mit ihr zusammen in den Abstellraum, wir holten uns Basketb√§lle und fingen an das nachzumachen was unsere Lehrerin uns zeigte. Es waren keine besonders schweren √úbungen und wir hatten eine Menge Spa√ü. Wir hatten gerade etwa eine Stunde ge√ºbt und ich ging kurz um etwas zu trinken. Ich holte meine Flasche die leider schon leer war 'Mmh... Dann nehm ich halt das Ekel-Leitungswasser ..' dachte ich, denn das Wasser in unserer Schule war echt √§tzend. Ich lie√ü das kalte Wasser auf meine H√§nde laufen. Es war angenehm k√ºhl. Dann wusch ich schnell mein Gesicht ab und trank etwas. Ich musste ganz pl√∂tzlich an meinen Bruder denken.. ob er schon einen Termin beim Psychologen hatte? Er hatte masochistische Gedanken und soziale Probleme... Ich wollte ihn nicht so leiden sehen, aber meine Eltern haben absolut gar nichts bemerkt. Jedes mal wenn ich Mama darum gebeten hatte, dass sie mit Sato zum Arzt geht hat sie immer nur geantwortet: \"Ihm geht es gut, er braucht keine Hilfe\" aber vor ein paar Tagen habe ich es nicht mehr ausgehalten und meine Eltern angeschrien, sie sollen doch endlich ihrem Sohn helfen. Das hatte ich noch nie gemacht und es fiel mir auch sehr schwer. Aber jetzt haben sie es endlich eingesehen. Ich hoffe jetzt √§ndert sich etwas. Ein weiterer Schwung kaltes Wasser in mein Gesicht riss mich aus meinen Gedanken. Ich f√ºllte meine Flasche auf und brachte sie zur√ºck zu meinen Sachen in die Umkleidekabine. Aber als ich in die Kabine kam konnte ich mich vor Schreck nicht bewegen. Da stand jemand. Ein Mann. Und er kramte in unseren Sachen - \"Ei..E.. Ein.. Einbrecher!\" Stotterte ich heiser. Er drehte sich um und sah mich total ruhig an. Bevor ich mich bewegen oder seinen Bewegungen folgen konnte, stand er direkt vor mir. Ich hatte Angst. Mein Herz klopfte wie verr√ºckt. Er war gr√∂√üer als ich und sah mich von oben herab an. Ich zitterte am ganzen K√∂rper. Ich hatte so viel Angst, dass mir gar nicht auffiel, wie h√ºbsch er eigentlich war. Er hatte sch√∂ne blonde Haare und seine leicht gr√ºnen Augen gl√§nzten. Er l√§chelte ein bisschen sp√∂ttisch und dreckig, aber seine Person an sich bet√§ubte meine Sinne. Bevor ich es schaffen konnte mich zu bewegen schubste er mich gegen die Wand hinter mir, sodass es weh tat. Ich wollte ihn gerade von mir fernhalten aber es war schon zu sp√§t - er k√ºsste mich. Ich wollte ihn von mir wegdr√ºcken aber ich hatte meinen eigenen K√∂rper nicht unter Kontrolle. Sein Kuss nahm mir meine komplette Selbstkontrolle. Ich konnte mich nicht wehren, ich war komplett hilflos, was dazu f√ºhrte, dass ich es zulie√ü als er mich mit Zunge k√ºsste. Er nahm mir den Atem und ich hatte Angst zu ersticken. Nach einer gef√ºhlten Ewigkeit lie√ü er von mir ab und ich rang nach Luft. Ich rutschte an der Wand nach unten und sank auf dem Boden auf meine Knie. Das war mir so peinlich, dass ich rot wurde. \"Du hast die Wahl: Entweder du beh√§ltst das alles hier f√ºr dich .. oder du fliegst von der Schule.\" Sagte er lachend. \"W-was? Wieso.. sollte ich von der Schule.. fliegen..?\" Fragte ich mit zittriger Stimme. \"Das siehst du morgen in Kunst!\" Ich verstand nicht was er meinte aber bevor ich weitere Fragen stellen konnte war er schon verschwunden. Ich war hin- und hergerissen. Was sollte ich tun? Der Typ hat mir meinen ersten Kuss gestohlen! Aber ich hatte Angst davor, dass ich vielleicht wirklich von der Schule fliegen w√ºrde, also entschied ich mich zumindest mal jetzt noch nichts zu sagen. \"Kae? Kae! Da bist du ja! Was ist passiert? Alles okay?\" Ayachi kam auf mich zugelaufen, mit einem sehr besorgten Gesichtsausdruck. \"Ah.. es ist alles in Ordnung, Aya. Ich hatte nur kurz ein Blackout.\" Log ich sie an. Ich wollte eigentlich nicht l√ºgen aber ich hatte wirklich Angst davor ihr zu erz√§hlen was wirklich passiert war. \"Oh Gott! Geht's dir gut?!\" Fragte mich Aya panisch. \"E- Es geht schon..\" \".. Du siehst mir gar nicht gut aus ... Und deine Stirn .. Aaah du gl√ºhst ja! Los ab zur Lehrerin! Keine. Widerrede!!\" \"In.. in Ordnung..\" ich wollte nicht mit der Lehrerin reden ... Ich f√ºhlte mich schlecht und ich wollte niemanden anl√ºgen. Aber irgendwie schaffte ich es doch noch den Rest des Tages hinter mich zu bringen und ich lag gerade in meinem Bett als ich wieder an ihn dachte. Wer war er? Und was meinte er mit 'Das siehst du morgen in Kunst!' .. ich war komplett verwirrt. In dieser Nacht schlief ich nicht wirklich gut. Am n√§chsten Tag kam ich m√ºde nach unten zum Fr√ºhst√ºck und eine halbe Stunde sp√§ter sa√ü ich im Bus. Ich wurde immer von allen eingeladen neben ihnen zu sitzen und so sa√ü ich heute neben Hinako, einem lieben und f√ºrsorglichen M√§dchen. Aber ich sprach die ganze Fahrt kaum mit ihr, denn meine Gedanken waren immer noch bei dem Typen von gestern. In der Schule angekommen schaute ich auf den Stundenplan - Mathe in den ersten beiden Stunden. Kunst hatten wir erst in der letzten Doppelstunde. Die ersten vier Stunden verliefen ganz normal. Dieselben dummen Unterrichtswitze und derselbe langweilige Unterrichtsstoff. Aber nachdem die zweite Pause aus war hatten wir Kunst. Wir gingen in den Kunstraum und setzten uns auf unsere Pl√§tze. Zwei aus meiner Klasse, Lo√πi und Hiko, stritten sich um einen Fensterplatz und die M√§dchen sprachen √ºber irgendwelche tollen Jungs. Also alles wie immer. Aber ich wollte trotzdem nicht mitsprechen. Ich war zu sehr darauf gespannt was jetzt passieren w√ºrde. Nach einer gef√ºhlten Ewigkeit ging die T√ºr auf und es kamen zwei Leute herein - unser Kunstlehrer Herr Saizawa und .. er ... Er kam einfach in den Klassenraum als w√§re nie irgendetwas passiert. Ich sa√ü mit offenem Mund da. Was machte er hier?! Und als Herr Saizawa anfing zu sprechen fiel ich fast in Ohnmacht. \"Das hier, liebe Sch√ºlerinnen und Sch√ºler, ist Maru Dadoki. Euer neuer Lehrer in Kunst. Er ist kurzfristig hergekommen, denn ich werde in Vaterzeit gehen.\" Die Klasse klatschte und einige kommentierten mit \"Aaaaww! Ist es ein M√§dchen oder ein Junge?\" \"Viel Gl√ºck!\" \"Ich w√ºnsche ihnen alles Gute!\" \"Herr Dadoki ist ein sehr guter Lehrer und er ist sogar bei den TLDJ auf dem ersten Platz!\" F√ºgte Herr Saizawa mit einem stolzen Grinsen hinzu. Alle applaudierten. Die TLDJ waren die Top-Lehrer-Des-Jahres. So bl√∂d das auch klingt das ist tats√§chlich ziemlich cool. Die ersten drei bekommen auch Auszeichnungen und Preise. Alle anderen freuten sich dar√ºber aber ich r√ºhrte mich keinen Zentimeter. Ich wusste was das bedeutete. Der Typ war ein Lehrer von mir. Wenn ich irgendwem etwas sagen w√ºrde oder zur Polizei gehen w√ºrde, k√∂nnte ich nichts beweisen und er k√∂nnte daf√ºr sorgen, dass ich von der Schule verwiesen werde. Ich sa√ü wie erfroren da und das hatte er anscheinend bemerkt, denn er grinste wieder so ... Dreckig. Der Unterricht war echt anstrengend, denn ich konnte mich √ºberhaupt nicht konzentrieren. Nach dem Unterricht atmete ich auf und freute mich, dass ich jetzt nach Hause gehen konnte und ihn wenigstens √ºber das Wochenende nicht sehen musste. Aber bevor ich rausgehen konnte rief er meinen Namen auf und ich erstarrte. Was wollte er von mir? \"J-ja?\" Ich drehte mich um und er sagte mit seinem Grinsen \"Wir sollten mal ein Gespr√§ch f√ºhren.. setz dich!\" Er wies mir einen Stuhl zu. \"O..Kay.\" die anderen M√§dchen standen an der T√ºr und fragten ob sie warten sollten, was ich verneinte. Sie sollten nicht ihren Bus verpassen nur weil ich ein Gespr√§ch f√ºhren musste. \"Ich denke jetzt verstehst du was ich gestern gemeint habe, oder?\" Fragte er mich entspannt l√§chelnd. Ich schaute auf den Boden. \"J.. ja... Herr Dadoki.\" Mir stiegen Tr√§nen in die Augen. Ich wollte nicht nichts tun, ich wollte es jemandem sagen, um Hilfe bitten, aber ich konnte es niemandem erz√§hlen. Pl√∂tzlich hob er mit seinem Zeigefinger mein Gesicht an und schaute mir direkt in die Augen. Was sollte das? Was wollte er? Aber bevor ich etwas dagegen tun konnte k√ºsste er mich schon wieder. Ich wollte mich aus dem Kuss l√∂sen aber ich kam nicht gegen ihn an. Mein K√∂rper gehorchte mir nicht. Er hatte komplett die Oberhand. Nach einer Weile h√∂rte er auf und ich konnte endlich wieder selbst √ºber meinen K√∂rper entscheiden. \"W-was soll das.. ? I-ich bin doch ihre Sch√ºlerin!\" \"Na und? Glaubst du das st√∂rt mich? Denkst du, dass das so ein gro√üer Altersunterschied ist oder wie? Ich bin gerade mal 23! Oder meinst du das weil Lehrer-Sch√ºler-Verh√§ltnisse verboten sind? Du bist doch eh bald aus der Schule raus.. dann ist es legal. Und solange du keine Beweise hast... Bist du ganz einfach gesagt komplett unter meiner Kontrolle.\" Antwortete er. Ich wusste nicht was ich sagen sollte. Ich hatte einfach nur Angst. Bevor ich es bemerkte hockte er hinter mir. Er hatte seine Hand an meinem Hals und er wanderte langsam damit in mein Gesicht. Ich bekam kaum Luft weswegen ich meinen Mund √∂ffnete. Immerhin schaffte ich es jetzt einen normalen Atemzug zu machen. \"Du solltest langsam verstehen, dass du dich nicht widersetzen solltest...\" Fl√ºsterte er w√§hrend er langsam zwei seiner Finger in meinen Mund f√ºhrte. \"Aaah... Haa..!\" Ich wollte mich wehren aber er legte mir blitzschnell meinen Arm auf den R√ºcken und dr√ºckte ihn immer weiter hoch, sodass es weh tat. Ich dachte daran, dass ich ihn bei√üen k√∂nnte aber wenn ich das machen w√ºrde, k√∂nnte er mir den Arm auskugeln oder brechen, so stark wie er war. Ich hatte Angst. Was wird er tun? Wird er mir den Arm brechen? W√ºrde er mich verletzen? Ich w√ºrde es ihm zutrauen. Er nahm seine Hand von meinem Gesicht und ich st√∂hnte kurz leise auf, da ich wieder besser atmen konnte. Aber anstatt mich loszulassen legte er die Hand auf meinen Oberschenkel. \"Aah! H-hilfee!\" Rief ich. Aber mich konnte sowieso keiner h√∂ren, denn wir waren im letzten Raum, auf der einen Seite des Schulgeb√§udes, der noch nicht saniert wurde. Er fuhr mit seiner Hand immer weiter nach oben und ich konnte mich nicht wehren. \"Sei nicht so frech! Dir kann niemand helfen... hier ist keiner!\" Als er meinen Rock langsam anhob wimmerte ich nur noch leise \"b...bitte.. n-nicht\". \"Verstehst du denn nicht, dass ich mit dir alles tun kann, was ich will? Du geh√∂rst ganz allein mir!\" \"Aah.. aber.. d-das ist illegal..\" \"Wird ja keiner erfahren. Wenn du etwas sagst, glauben die Leute zwar zuerst dir, aber vertrau mir: ich kann sehr √ºberzeugend sein!\" Ich konnte mich nicht dagegen wehren als er mir meinen Slip auszog. Ich zitterte. \"B..bitte nicht... Herr... Herr Dadoki!\" \"Ahahaha.. nein. Deine Bitten sind sowas von sinn- und wertlos.\" Sagte er und fuhr mit seiner Hand wieder aufw√§rts an meinem Oberschenkel. Ich wimmerte leise. Was sollte ich tun? Ich konnte nicht weg und keiner w√ºrde mir helfen. Am Freitag hatte niemand Mittagsschule und die Lehrer waren alle im Hauptgeb√§ude. Ich st√∂hnte leise als er mit einem Finger in mich eindrang. Es folgte ein zweiter. \"Aah... Ah.. auf.. h√∂.. ren...\" St√∂hnte ich. Er lachte nur leise. Ich wollte das nicht. Er sollte aufh√∂ren! Ich nahm mit meiner freien Hand seinen Arm und versuchte ihn wegzudr√ºcken aber er war viel zu stark. Als ich es ein zweites Mal versuchte dr√ºckte er meinen Arm noch weiter nach oben. Ich schrie kurz vor Schmerz auf. Es tat so weh. Ich wollte, dass er aufh√∂rte. \"B.. bi...tte... Bitte a... a.. aufh√∂ren!\" schluchzte ich leise. Ich versuchte mich mit meinen Beinen zu wehren aber dadurch dr√ºckte er nur meinen Arm immer weiter hoch. Ich hatte Angst er k√∂nnte ihn mir brechen. Er bewegte seine Finger in mir, zog sie raus und lie√ü sie wieder hineingleiten. Er spielte mit mir, wie mit einer Puppe. \"Ah.. aah!\" Ich konnte das St√∂hnen nicht unterdr√ºcken. Er lachte leicht in meinen Nacken woraufhin sich meine Nackenhaare aufstellten. Ich wollte weg, ich hatte Angst. Angst vor ihm. Er wurde allm√§hlich schneller und ich k√§mpfte krampfhaft um wenigstens nicht zu st√∂hnen, aber ich konnte es nicht verhindern. Er hatte anscheinend eine Menge Spa√ü daran, w√§hrend ich nichts lieber wollte als wegzurennen. Er bewegte seine Finger immer schneller und mir wurde langsam schwindelig. Ich wollte ihn bitten aufzuh√∂ren, aber es h√§tte ja doch nichts gebracht. Also lie√ü ich es bleiben. Nach einer Zeit konnte ich es nicht mehr zur√ºckhalten und ich kam. \"Aaah.. ah .. hhh...\" Ich st√∂hnte etwas lauter als davor auf was er anscheinend ziemlich lustig fand. \"W..warum..? Warum ich?\" Mir kamen wieder die Tr√§nen. \"Weil du sowas von einfach zu kontrollieren bist. Du hast nie eine andere Erfahrung gemacht, als dass Respektpersonen gutm√ºtig und gerecht sind. Sie w√ºrden doch niemals ihre Position ausnutzen.. oder doch? Hahahaha...\" Er lachte auf eine fiese Art und Weise. \"Du kannst dich nicht wehren, bist nicht viel zu jung und ziemlich s√º√ü. Und ich kann das hier machen, also warum sollte ich es nicht tun?\" Wisperte er w√§hrend er mit seiner Hand wieder an meinem Hals war. Ich biss meine Z√§hne zusammen. Ich wollte mich nicht einfach so kontrollieren lassen. Obwohl ich Angst vor ihm hatte widersetzte ich mich ihm. Er griff meinen Hals. \"Aah! Hhh! Hhhah!\" Ich rang nach Luft. Er lachte. \"Hab ich dir nicht gesagt, dass du gar nicht erst versuchen musst dich zu widersetzen? Lass es sein! Ich hab dich so oder so voll und ganz unter Kontrolle.\" \"Ahh! D-das stimmt nicht! Ich muss nur versuchen meinen Eltern zu erkl√§ren, dass ich die Schule wechseln will!\" \"Glaubst du wirklich das ist mein einziges Druckmittel?\" \"W... W-was?\" Ich zitterte vor Angst. Was k√∂nnte er meinen? \"Hier! Schau Mal!\" Er zeigte mir ein Bild. Auf dem Bild war ich zu sehen wie ich mir ein Tattoo stechen lie√ü. Es war ein kleiner r√∂tlicher Kolibri auf meinem Oberarm. \"W-wie? D... Da... Das k√∂nnen Sie nicht wissen!\" \"Und was wenn doch?\" Meine Eltern hatten strikt etwas gegen Tattoos. Wenn sie rausbekommen w√ºrden, dass ich mir eins hatte stechen lassen, w√ºrden sie mich nicht mehr als Tochter ansehen. Das w√§re das Letzte was ich wollen w√ºrde. \"Und ich hab sogar noch viel mehr.\" Er zeigte mir Bilder mit denen er alles erreichen konnte was er wollte... Wieso hatte er das alles.. ? \"Verstehst du es jetzt endlich?\" Er l√§chelte wieder so dreckig wie immer. Ich weinte. Ich konnte meine Tr√§nen nicht mehr zur√ºckhalten. \"Ich.. ah... bitte .. n-nicht...\" Sagte ich mit tr√§nen√ºberstr√∂mtem Gesicht. Er lie√ü seine Finger wieder in meinen Mund gleiten und spielte mit meiner Zunge. \"Ah... hhhah... Hhh... Hnnnnh. ..\" als er seine Finger wieder aus meinem Gesicht nahm sagte ich mit zittriger Stimme \"j... Ja ... Herr Dadoki... Ich habe verstanden... \" \"Gut als erstes: du nennst mich ab jetzt 'Meister', klar?\" Ich erstarrte. Was? Wieso? \"W-W-Was?\" \"Du hast mich schon verstanden. Oder willst du lieber, dass ich die Fotos der Schulleitung und deinen Eltern zeige?\" \"Ah! Hhhnh... B-bitte niicht..., M... M... Meis..ter!\" \"Schon besser..\" er lachte √ºber mich. Es war mir alles so peinlich. Aber er durfte die Fotos niemandem zeigen. Niemals! Ich musste sein Spiel mitspielen, ich hatte keine Wahl. \"...Es w√ºrde sowieso niemanden k√ºmmern ob ich da bin oder nicht...\" \"Ach wirklich?\" Ah! Ich hatte das laut ausgesprochen. \"Ah! N-nein! D... Das hab ich nur so gesagt!\" Versuchte ich mich zu erkl√§ren. \"Hahaha! Jetzt r√ºckst du ja schon selber deine Geheimnisse raus!\" \"N-nein!\" \"Du brauchst gar nicht erst versuchen es abzustreiten!\" \"B... Bi... Bitte n...icht!\" \"Mir ist komplett egal was du willst! Ich werde dich niemals gehen lassen! Du bleibst f√ºr immer meine kleine Sklavin.\" \"W-wie?! Was soll da...\" Er hielt mir den Mund zu \"Werd blo√ü nicht frech!\" \"Ahh... Hnnnnh... Hh.. aah..\" ich st√∂hnte auf vor Schmerzen, da er meinen Arm nun wohl gebrochen oder ausgekugelt hatte. Und dennoch dr√ºckte er ihn immer weiter hoch. \"Hnnnnh .. ghaah...b-bitte .. ver... verzeiht m-mir!... Ich ... Ich mach was immer ... I-ihr wollt... A-aber bitte ... Bitte... L-lasst meinen Arm l-los... !\" Ich weinte und schluchzte. Es tat so weh, ich wusste nicht mal mehr ob ich noch irgendetwas in dem Arm sp√ºrte, au√üer Schmerz. \"Dein Arm ist nur ausgekugelt, und ich denke ihn wieder ein, wenn du mir ein Versprechen gibst.\" Fl√ºsterte er mir ins Ohr. \"W-Was muss ich versprechen?\" Fragte ich z√∂gerlich \"Du musst mir deinen K√∂rper und Geist und alles andere an dir komplett √ºberlassen.\" Ich wusste nicht was ich sagen sollte. Ein Teil von mir schrie mich an ich sollte das nat√ºrlich sofort abschlagen und ihn irgendwie melden, aber ein anderer Teil fing langsam an seine Art und Person zu... M√∂gen?! Nein! Nein! Nein! Das konnte gar nicht sein! Ich sch√ºttelte den Kopf. \"Wenn du mir das Versprechen nicht gibst garantiere ich nicht daf√ºr, dass du noch sehr lange lebst.\" Ich zitterte. Ich zitterte am ganzen K√∂rper so stark, dass ich mich nicht bewegen konnte. Was hatte er da gesagt?! Aber.. das w√ºrde er doch nicht tun. In dem Moment zog er meinen Kopf an den Haaren nach oben. Er grinste auf eine kranke Art. \"Mal sehen wie du das verneinen willst. Entweder du musst f√ºr immer alles tun was ich dir befehle, oder du stirbst.\" \"B-bitte... Ich... Ich will nicht sterben!\" \"Dann geh√∂rst du ab jetzt mir!\" \"J... J-ja.. Meister...\" \"Und wei√üt du was du als erstes tun wirst? Du wirst irgendwie daf√ºr sorgen, dass deine Eltern dich ausziehen lassen.\" \"W... Was? A-aber ich will das ni...!\" Aber bevor ich den Satz beenden konnte zog er an meinen Arm, sodass ich vor Schmerzen aufschrie. \"Es ist ganz einfach! Du sorgst daf√ºr, dass sie dich ausziehen lassen und dann ziehst du zu mir.\" \"N-nein! Ich .. bitte... Ich will das nicht!\" \"Du kapierst es immer noch nicht oder?\" Er packte mich am Hals. Ich rang nach Luft. Es m√ºsste doch irgendwie m√∂glich sein aus dieser Zwickm√ºhle rauszukommen. Bitte! Das konnte es doch nicht sein! Wieso bedrohte er mich die ganze Zeit? Ich wollte nicht zu ihm ziehen! Niemals! Ich bekam keine Luft und langsam w√ºrde mir schwindelig. \"B...i... tte... L-Lu...ft!\" \"Wenn du mir gehorchst muss ich dich auch nicht st√§ndig bestrafen..\" \"...verzeiht... Mir... B...itte! ... B-bitte... Lass...t ...mi...ch ... L..os!\" Er dr√ºckte noch einmal etwas fester zu und lie√ü mich dann los. Ich hustete und mir liefen Tr√§nen √ºbers Gesicht. Ich sank vom Stuhl auf den Boden und schob mich so weit wie m√∂glich von ihm weg. Als ich mich ein paar Meter weit weg geschoben hatte stie√ü ich an eine Wand. Er kam immer n√§her. Ich wollte aufstehen und rennen aber als ich es versuchte stolperte ich und fiel auf den Boden. Ich rappelte mich wieder auf und rannte so schnell es ging in Richtung T√ºr. Ich r√ºttelte an der Klinke aber sie lie√ü sich nicht √∂ffnen. Er kam n√§her. Immer n√§her. Er lie√ü sich Zeit. Er schien komplett gelassen.[Chapter 2] Er machte sich nicht die M√ºhe mir hinterherzurennen. Wenn ich es nicht schnell schaffte eine Fluchtm√∂glichkeit zu finden, w√ºrde er mich ganz einfach einholen. Er kam immer n√§her. Ich stolperte √ºber einen Malerkittel den jemand liegen gelassen hatte. Ich versuchte so schnell es ging wieder aufzustehen und schaffte es tats√§chlich. Ich rannte weiter und stie√ü an ein Regal. Mein Arm brannte vor Schmerz und mir stiegen Tr√§nen in die Augen. Es m√ºsste doch m√∂glich sein, hier raus zu kommen! Ich dachte einen Moment dar√ºber nach, zum Fenster zu rennen und irgendwie raus zu springen aber wir waren im 4. Stock und ich w√ºrde sowieso viel zu lange daf√ºr brauchen das Fenster zu √∂ffnen, also rannte ich weiter und versuchte ihn irgendwie aufzuhalten, was nicht funktionierte. Ich war langsam v√∂llig au√üer Atem und ich konnte nicht mehr weiter rennen. Meine Lungen brannten und jeder Atemzug war schwerer. Mir wurde schwindelig und ich sackte an der Wand auf den Boden. Er kam mit einem L√§cheln auf mich zu, ging in die Hocke und sa√ü einfach nur still da. Einen Moment lang dachte ich er w√ºrde mir nichts tun aber pl√∂tzlich stand er auf und packte mich am Hals. Er zog mich hoch und presste mich gegen die Wand. Noch stand ich auf meinen F√º√üen aber er hob mich immer weiter an. Er lachte leise, w√§hrend er mich so weit hoch hob, dass ich mit meinen F√º√üen den Boden nicht mehr ber√ºhren konnte. Ich war schon etwa 15 Zentimeter √ºber dem Boden und versuchte auf irgendeine Art und Weise Luft zu bekommen. Aber es half nichts. Ich versuchte seinen Griff zu lockern oder ihn wegzudr√ºcken aber ich war ganz einfach zu schwach. \"Hnnnnh... Hhh... Hhhahh... Bi...bitte... I-ich ... Aah .. bitte.. aufh√∂ren...! ... Ich... Ich ... √úber... zeu... ge... meine... Aah... Eltern...!\" Er h√∂rte nicht auf. \"B...bitte!\" Er dr√ºckte mich weiterhin gegen die Wand. Er sagte kein Wort und schaute mich einfach nur ruhig und gelassen an. \"Hhhnh... M.. Mei...ster! ... B..itte!\" Ich bekam keine Luft. Ich musste irgendetwas tun. Wenn ich nicht bald Luft bekam, k√∂nnte ich sterben. Mir wurde schwindelig. \"Wenn du dich so sehr wehrst muss ich dir wohl erst mal klar machen, dass du das nicht brauchst. Ich verfolge schlie√ülich auch ein Ziel. Aber das verstehst du noch nicht.\" Er beugte sich nach vorne und fing an mich zu k√ºssen. Er... Er sollte aufh√∂ren! Ich bekam doch keine Luft! Ich sah nur noch verschwommen. Vielleicht wegen der Tr√§nen in meinen Augen... Vielleicht auch wegen meinem Schwindelgef√ºhl. Er nahm mir meinen letzten Rest an Atem. Ich konnte mich nicht wehren und er nutzte das voll aus. \"Mmmmh! Hnnh... Ghh... Hhhnh...\" Mit meinem letzten bisschen Kraft versuchte ich ihm zu verdeutlichen, dass ich keine Luft mehr hatte und dringend Sauerstoff brauchte. \"Mmh! Lecker..\" sagte er und lie√ü mich los. Ich brach auf dem Boden zusammen. Ich konnte nicht normal atmen und hustete die ganze Zeit. Er stand triumphierend √ºber mir und grinste auf mich herab. \"...i...ich ... Ich √ºberzeuge .. meine... Eltern...\" Keuchte ich. \"Besser ist das.. du scheinst es langsam zu verstehen.\" \"...j-ja... Meister..\" wieso wehrte ich mich nicht? Warum sagte ich mir es sei alles in Ordnung? Das ist doch nicht okay! Ich sollte etwas tun, es irgendwem sagen! Aber... Ich konnte nichts tun.. \"Da das jetzt gekl√§rt ist kannst du gehen.. aber glaub mir: wenn du versuchst abzuhauen oder es nicht auf die Reihe bekommst deine Eltern zu √ºberzeugen, hat das Konsequenzen!\" \"J...ja, Meister.\" Ich verlie√ü den Raum und wischte mir die Tr√§nen aus dem Gesicht. Keiner durfte es erfahren. Ich ging zur Bushaltestelle und erwischte gerade noch einen Bus der etwas sp√§ter als die normalen Busse fuhr. Als ich Zuhause ankam versuchte ich normal zu wirken und es gelang mir ganz gut. Gegen Abend setzte ich mich zu meiner Mutter und redete mit ihr. Ich versuchte so freundlich wie m√∂glich darum zu bitten, mich ausziehen zu lassen. Und sie hatte anscheinend nicht wirklich etwas dagegen. Zwar war sie am Anfang ziemlich skeptisch aber sie sah auch, dass es ein selbstbewusster Schritt von mir war. Sie versicherte mir, dass sie meinen Vater auch √ºberzeugen k√∂nnte und w√ºnschte mir viel Gl√ºck. Ich verstand nur nicht warum sie sich gar nicht daf√ºr interessierte wo ich hingehen wollte. Aber ich hatte es wahrscheinlich so gut formuliert, dass es ihr egal war, denn sie vertraute mir. Ich f√ºhlte mich schlecht. Ich wollte das doch nicht... Aber irgendwie ... Ich wei√ü nicht... Ein Teil von mir fand es gut. Die n√§chsten Tage ging es nur noch um meinen Auszug. Am n√§chsten Samstag brachte mich Herr Dadoki zu seinem Haus. Es war ein sehr sch√∂nes Haus, mitten im Wald. Das einzige, was mir Angst machte war, dass es √ºberhaupt niemanden in der N√§he gab. Das haus stand v√∂llig einsam mitten in einem riesigen Waldgebiet. Wenn er mir hier etwas antun w√ºrde, w√ºrde mir keiner helfen. \"Na? Gef√§llts dir?\" Fragte mich Herr Dadoki, w√§hrend er seine Arme von hinten um mich schlang. \"E-Es ist wundersch√∂n, Meister.\" \"Ach √ºbrigens: dieses Haus hat einen wundersch√∂nen Keller... Mit wundersch√∂nen Dingen, die darin herumstehen, also tu dir selbst einen Gefallen und versuch mir nicht auf die Nerven zu gehen..\" \"aah! ...w...w...was? .. i-ich... Ich werde es versuchen...\" Mein Herz klopfte fast schon zu schnell. Was meinte er damit? Hatte er etwa Folterger√§te im Keller?! Nein... Das glaube ich nicht. Aber sicher ist sicher. Also werde ich ihm so gut es geht gehorchen. Es war schon abends und wir sa√üen auf der ausgezogenen Couch in seinem Wohnzimmer und schauten einen Film. Ich hatte \"Nachts im Museum\" zwar schon oft gesehen aber es war trotzdem witzig. Ich wusste nicht was ich von ihm halten sollte. Einerseits setzte er mich unter Druck und zwang mich Dinge zu tun die ich nicht wollte und andererseits mochte ich ihn irgendwie daf√ºr, dass er auch eine lustige Art hatte. Oder mochte ich vielleicht sogar beide Seiten von ihm...? Was? Nein! Nein! Nein! Was hatte ich da gedacht? Nein! Niemals! Pl√∂tzlich riss er mich aus meinen Gedanken indem er seine Arme von hinten um mich legte und mir ins Ohr hauchte \"Komm doch mal ein bisschen n√§her zu mir..\" ich tat wie er es mir befohlen hatte und rutschte etwas nach hinten zu ihm, sodass ich jetzt in seinem Scho√ü sa√ü. Ich wurde etwas rot, da ich noch nie einer Person so nah gewesen war. Er holte ein kleines lilanes Teil aus einer Schublade der kleinen Komode die neben der Couch stand. Zu dem kleinen Teil geh√∂rte anscheinend eine Fernbedienung. \"Was ist das?\" Fragte ich z√∂gerlich. \"Das siehst du gleich.\" Antwortete er mit einem L√§cheln und hielt mich mit einem Arm fest. Was wollte er? Ich verstand nicht was er tat aber ich durfte mich sowieso nicht wehren, also lie√ü ich es gleich sein. Er nahm das kleine Ding und hob meinen Rock an. \"Ahh!\" \"Shh! Sh, Sh, Sh, shh!\" Er hob meinen Slip an und packte das kleine Teil in den Slip. Dann lie√ü er ihn wieder zur√ºckschnellen und dr√ºckte einen Knopf auf der Fernbedienung. Daraufhin fing das kleine Ding an zu vibrieren. \"Mmmmh! Hnnnnh! Aaah!\" Ich wollte, dass es aufh√∂rt. Er hielt mich fest und hinderte mich daran das Teil wieder rauszuholen. \"Hhhnnnhhaa...b... Bitte... A... Ah!\" Er zog mir meine Sweatjacke aus und fuhr dann mit seinen H√§nden unter mein Top und strich √ºber meine Br√ºste. \"Ahhah... Hhhnh.. aah!\" \"Hey... Bleib ruhig... Es ist doch alles in Ordnung...!\" Seine Ber√ºhrung war mir zwar sehr peinlich, aber er ber√ºhrte total sanft und weich. Aber das Ding in meinem Slip vibrierte immer weiter und ich wollte ihn anflehen, dass er es ausschaltet aber ich konnte nicht richtig sprechen. Ich versuchte irgendwie meine Beine so zu bewegen, dass das Teil so weit weg wie m√∂glich war aber es funktionierte nicht. Wieso tat er das? Warum machte er das mit mir, obwohl er doch wusste, dass ich ungewollt kommen w√ºrde? \"Nnnh... Bitte... Meister! ... Ah ... A... A... Aufh√∂ren! Ich... Ich will n-nicht!\" \"Kae... Alles ist gut ... Du musst dich nicht daf√ºr sch√§men. Au√üerdem solltest du besser tun was ich von dir verlange.. \" \"J...J-Ja, Meister..\" es dauerte nicht lange bis ich kam. Es f√ºhlte sich so erniedrigend an, dass er mich die ganze Zeit ansah. Er ... Er sollte mich nicht sehen! Er sollte wegschauen! Er .. er sollte aufh√∂ren! Aber ich durfte mich nicht wehren. Ich dachte jetzt, da ich sowieso schon gekommen, und dadurch genug erniedrigt worden bin, w√§re es vorbei und er w√ºrde mich in Ruhe lassen aber...das tat er nicht. Er schaltete den Vibrator nicht ab. \"Ah... Aah! M... Meister! I-ich ... bin doch schon.. gek...\" Er f√ºhrte mir zwei Finger in den Mund und fl√ºsterte in meinen Nacken \"Glaubst du einmal reicht mir? Ich sage wann Schluss ist... Nicht du!\" Und so lie√ü er mich noch ein zweites Mal kommen. Ich f√ºhlte mich so erb√§rmlich, dass ich nichts tun konnte und meinen eigenen K√∂rper nicht unter Kontrolle hatte. Ich flehte ihn an, dass er jetzt bitte aufh√∂ren sollte aber es war ihm komplett egal. Und so lie√ü er mich auch noch ein drittes Mal kommen. Ich war v√∂llig au√üer Atem. Er hatte immer noch seinen Arm um mich gelegt. Aber jetzt stoppte er den Vibrator und holte ihn aus meinem durchn√§ssten Slip. Er fing an zu lachen. Er lachte mich aus. Und das obwohl ich sowieso schon komplett erniedrigt war. Er zog mir den Slip aus und hob meinen Rock an. Dann f√ºhrte er langsam zwei seiner Finger in meinen Eingang. \"Aaah... Hhhnnnhhaa... Hhhngh!\" Ich st√∂hnte auf. \"Sag Mal Kae... Ich hab geh√∂rt, dass du ganz gerne Videos vom FSQ schaust... Stimmt das?\" Fragte er gelassen, w√§hrend er mit seinen Fingern komplett in mich eindrang. \".. Hhhnh... J-Ja... Meis...ter...!\" \"Und wen magst du am meisten von den vier?\" Fragte er w√§hrend er seine Finger in mir bewegte. \"W..w...wa...warum wollt i-ihr da...das wissen?\" Fragte ich. Er verschnellerte seine Fingerbewegungen und fragte mich die selbe Frage nochmal. Ich antwortete schnell \"Aaahhah... Mmmhm... M... M .. Maudado u-und GermanLetsPlay...\" \"Braves M√§dchen... Du scheinst zu begreifen, dass du lieber schnell deine Antwort gibst... Und warum magst du die beiden so gerne?\" \"W-weil .. Ma... Maudado ... Lustige Videos macht und ich mag ... S... Seinen Charakter.. er ist ... Nett und..s-so... und GermanLetsPlay h... Hat .. so eine komische, witzige ... A-art...!\" Er wurde immer schneller in mir und ich kam mit dem Atmen nicht mehr hinterher. Aber zu meinem Gl√ºck zog er seine Finger wieder aus mir heraus und lie√ü mich kurz entspannen. Als ich meinen Atem wieder einigerma√üen unter Kontrolle hatte verwickelte er mich in einen langen Zungenkuss. Bevor er mich loslie√ü holte er etwas hinter seinem R√ºcken hervor und schnallte es mir schnell um den Hals. Es war ein Halsband. Warum gab er mir das? \"M... Meister...\" Er zog mich an dem Halsband zu sich und k√ºsste mich nochmal. Es schien mir als w√§re eine Ewigkeit vergangen bevor er mich loslie√ü. Er drehte mich um und zog mich auf seinen Scho√ü, sodass er mir genau in die Augen schaute. Er √∂ffnete seine Hose und bevor ich es realisierte hatte er sein Glied schon in mich hineingef√ºhrt. \"Aaah! Hhhnnh! Hhh.. hhaaah!\" Es tat gleichzeitig weh und war total sanft. Er bewegte sich in mir und wurde immer schneller. \"Aah! M-Meiste... Aaah ... Hnnnnh .. hhh... Ahh\" \"Und wenn du dich auf einen der beiden beschr√§nken musst? Wer ist dann dein Lieblingsyoutuber?\" Fragte er w√§hrend er weiterhin schneller wurde. Mir wurde schwindelig, das Gef√ºhl nahm mir meinen ganzen Atem. Bevor ich antworten konnte k√ºsste er mich erneut. Er wurde immer schneller und sein Kuss immer verlangender. \"Aah.. Hh... I-ich ... Ich... m...m..a.. ma...ma... maudado!.. A...A-aber wieso wollt ihr das wissen?\" Keuchte ich nachdem er von mir ablie√ü. \"Hahahah... Das wirst du schon noch erfahren..\" Irgendwie fing ich an seine Art zu m√∂gen. Er hatte etwas sehr... Beeindruckendes an sich. Auch wenn er gerade etwas mit mir machte was ich vielleicht nicht wollte. Ich wusste schon gar nicht mehr ob ich es wollte oder nicht. Ich mochte ihn immer mehr, je l√§nger ich bei ihm war. War ich verr√ºckt geworden? Vielleicht.. er hielt mich an meinen Armen fest, sodass ich mich nicht wehren k√∂nnte. Auf irgendeine Weise mochte ich diese dominante Art... warum? Warum bin ich so bl√∂d? Es k√∂nnte auch einfach sein, dass er mich umbringt wenn er mit mir fertig ist... Es k√∂nnte sein, dass er nicht mal ansatzweise Interesse an mir hat. Warum bin ich so naiv? Wollte ich das oder nicht? Ich wusste es nicht. \"A-Ah! Hhhnh.. Aaahhah..\" ich hatte Angst vor ihm. Aber irgendwie fand ich genau das an ihm so gut. \"Hhh... Ah!\" St√∂hnte er auf. Ich versuchte mich irgendwie mit meinem Knien hochzudr√ºcken und schaffte es ein kleines St√ºck. Aber als ich es geschafft hatte und versuchte ganz aufzustehen verst√§rkte er seinen Griff um meine Hand, sodass es weh tat. \"Aah! Hhhah! A-A-Aufh√∂ren! B-Bitte!\" Keuchte ich. Er zog mich wieder nach unten und stie√ü so erneut in mich. \"Aaaah! Hhhnnnhhaa! A-Ah! Ghhha\" \"Nicht abhauen!\" Er sah mich mit einem kalten und belustigen Blick an. Ich verlor mich komplett in seinen Augen und sah ihn mit ver√§ngstigtem und trotzdem neugierigem Blick an. Er kam mir mit seinem Gesicht immer n√§her und - k√ºsste mich mit Zunge. Ich konnte mich nicht wehren, und ich glaube .. ich wollte es auch gar nicht mehr. Ich gab nach und ergab mich ihm v√∂llig. Anscheinend hatte er das bemerkt und nutzte es jetzt voll und ganz aus. Ich bewegte mich langsam mit ihm und st√∂hnte dabei. Nach kurzer Zeit kam er in mir und ich kam fast gleichzeitig. Was war mit mir los gewesen? Ich hatte ihm nachgegeben? Das wollte ich doch gar nicht! Es k√∂nnte niemals sein dass ich etwas f√ºr ihn empfinden k√∂nnte oder so. Er hatte Dinge getan die ich nicht wollte! Oder nicht? Wir lagen noch ziemlich lange nebeneinander auf der Couch und ich bekam langsam wieder meinen Atem in den Griff. \"Kae! Komm mal mit!\" Riss er mich aus meinen Gedanken. Wir gingen √ºber eine sch√∂ne Wendeltreppe nach oben und den Flur entlang. Er brachte mich in einen Raum der aussah wie ein normales Arbeitszimmer. An der Wand stand ein Schreibtisch mit einem PC, und es lagen Unterlagen oder so auf dem Tisch. Es gab sogar ein Bett. Ich wusste nicht was er mir zeigen wollte. Aber als ich das Bett noch einmal genauer ansah bemerkte ich ein Schneckchenkissen was darauf lag. 'Ist er ein Maudado-fan?' dachte ich bei mir. Aber wenn ich nocheinmal nachdachte fiel mir auf, dass er maudado sogar ziemlich √§hnlich sah. 'Aber wieso? Ist er so ein gro√üer Fan?' ich konnte mir das nicht erkl√§ren. \"Verstehst du es jetzt oder soll ich dir noch helfen?\" \"Ich... Ich verstehe nicht...\" Er bewegte die Maus die an den PC angeschlossen war. Der PC war nicht ausgeschalten, sondern nur im Energiesparmodus gewesen. Er √∂ffnete YouTube und ging auf seinen Kanal. Ich fiel vor Schreck fast in Ohnmacht. Ich konnte mich nicht von der Stelle bewegen. Er war maudado. Ich konnte nichts sagen und stotterte nur einzelne Buchstaben vor mich hin. Wie konnte das sein? \"D-D-Das i-ist ... Doch nicht... M-M√∂glich!\" Der echte maudado war mein Lehrer und hatte mit mir geschlafen? Das konnte doch gar nicht sein! Das... Das war nicht real. Er kam auf mich zu und dr√ºckte mich gegen die T√ºr hinter mir. Er kam mit seinem Gesicht ganz nah an mich heran und ich konnte seinen Atem auf meiner Haut sp√ºren. Er vereinte unsere Lippen und ich konnte mich nicht widersetzen. Er k√ºsste so sanft. Ich wusste nicht was ich tun sollte. Warum sollte sich maudado ausgerechnet mir zeigen? Er fuhr langsam mit seiner Hand wieder unter mein Top und ich konnte meinen K√∂rper nicht dazu bewegen seine Hand wegzudr√ºcken. Hilfe! Ich wollte Hilfe! Das konnte alles nicht sein. Warum sollte er ausgerechnet mich mitnehmen? \"W-warum...? ...warum.. bin ich hier...? ... Aah! ..w...wollt ihr mich.. b-benutzen? Warum ich?\" \"Ich will dich nicht benutzen. Ich h√§tte kein anderes M√§dchen nehmen wollen. Als ich dich gesehen hab hab ich mich in dich verliebt. Ich wollte nur dich und keine andere.\" Bitte was?! Was hatte er da gesagt? \"A-aber ... Wieso...? Wieso sagt ihr mir das nicht sondern zwingt mich dazu euch zu geh√∂ren...?\" Fragte ich mit zittriger Stimme. \"Weil ich ganz genau wei√ü, dass dir das gef√§llt..\" hauchte er mit einem dreckigen L√§cheln. \"Das... Das stimmt n-nicht!\" \"Sei doch mal ehrlich zu dir selbst! Du magst dominante Menschen. Und ich wei√ü, dass du das vorhin gut fandest. Ich bin ja nicht blind! Du hast irgendwann unterbewusst begriffen, dass es dir gef√§llt.\" Ich lie√ü meinen Kopf h√§ngen. Er hatte Recht. Er hatte Recht und ich wollte es nicht wahrhaben. \"I...ich ... J-ja... Ihr habt Recht.. a-aber das... Das ist falsch! Das d√ºrfte nicht so sein! ...\" \"Kae... Es ist nicht falsch so zu lieben wie man will ...\" Sagte er und k√ºsste mich erneut. Ich mochte seine K√ºsse und er wusste das bestimmt. Er l√§chelte w√§hrend er mich k√ºsste und ich widersetzte mich ihm nicht. Ich erwiderte den Kuss leicht und er schaute mich verwundert an. Aber er nutzte es sofort aus und k√ºsste mich immer und immer wieder. Ich erwiderte die K√ºsse immer mehr und schnappte zwischendurch nach Luft. Die K√ºsse wurden immer st√§rker und... Verlangender. Ich st√∂hnte auf als er f√ºr kurze Zeit von mir ablie√ü bevor er mich wieder k√ºsste. Es war ein berauschendes Gef√ºhl. Er legte eine Hand an meinen Nacken und hielt mich fest. Seine K√ºsse wurden immer l√§nger, intensiver und st√§rker. Ich f√ºhlte mich gleichzeitig eingeengt und liebevoll ber√ºhrt. Ich war komplett eingenommen von dem Gef√ºhl. Mein Wahrnehmungsverm√∂gen war benebelt, weswegen ich meine Augen schloss. Ich gab mich ihm hin und √ºberlie√ü ihm alles an mir. Eine einzelne Tr√§ne bahnte sich langsam ihren Weg √ºber mein Gesicht. Ob vor Freude oder aus Angst wei√ü ich nicht mehr. Zwischen uns gab es keinen Abstand mehr. Mit seiner freien Hand nahm er meine, verschr√§nkte unsere Finger und dr√ºckte meine Hand an die Wand. Ich konnte mich nicht bewegen er war so... √úberw√§ltigend. In diesem Moment verstand ich, dass ich ihn liebte. 'Aber das geht doch nicht so schnell! Das kann nicht sein! Aber... Es stimmt.. ich liebe ihn' dachte ich. Ich wollte nicht, dass er mich losl√§sst. Aber das tat er auch nicht. Er lie√ü nicht von mir ab und es gefiel mir was er mit mir machte. Vielleicht war ich dumm, dass ich ihm gehorchte. Vielleicht war es dumm so naiv zu sein um sich ihm komplett hinzugeben und das zu tun, was er verlangte. Aber es war mir egal. Ich wollte bei der Ehrlichkeit bleiben und es mir eingestehen. Meine Liebe zu ihm. Er hatte mir schon etwas l√§nger keine Atempause mehr gelassen. Ich bekam keine Luft und hatte Angst zu ersticken. \"Mmmmh..Nnnh!\" Ich versuchte ihm meine Atemnot zu zeigen aber er ignorierte es wieder. Ich wusste, dass es komisch war aber das mochte ich auch an ihm. Ich mochte die Angst die er mir machte. Ich mochte es, dass er die Oberhand hatte und √ºber mich bestimmte. Kurz bevor ich noch ein zweites mal versuchte ihm zu signalisieren, dass ich Luft brauchte, lie√ü er kurz von mir ab. \"Ich brauche ... Pause... \" keuchte ich. Er kam mir wieder n√§her und sagte \"Sag: 'Bitte bitte, Meister!'\" Bevor er mich wieder k√ºsste. Ich kann das Gef√ºhl nicht beschreiben. Es f√ºhlte sich zwar falsch an, aber ich f√ºhlte mich auch... Frei. Als er mir eine Pause von wenigen Sekunden g√∂nnte dachte ich daran ihn zu bitten aufzuh√∂ren, aber ich wollte mehr. Das fiel ihm anscheinend auf denn er l√§chelte in den Kuss. Nach einer Zeit lie√ü er von mir ab und ich konnte nicht mehr als bat ich ihn aufzuh√∂ren. Ich wusste, dass es bestimmt nicht richtig war, aber ich liebte ihn. ","Summary":" Es war so ein extrem langweiliger und normaler Tag ... Man h√§tte heulen k√∂nnen. Aber egal wie langw"},{"Movie":"Magic Mike","Title":"Magic Mike takes to the streets","Author":"Chef Jim","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8809100","Passage":"[Chapter 1] This is the very interesting story of how Cujo, the fun loving puppy, got the dreaded disease of rabies. Once upon a time, there was an evil snail with teeth, like on the movie Flushed Away (which by the way is pretty cool). It was living in the sewers, and it contracted rabies. Meanwhile, Cujo was running from his home at the mechanics, to play with a young boy. On the way, he stopped to play with a friendly bat, who had a run in with a diseased slug a mere five minutes earlier. The bat actually bit him on the nose, which passed on the dreaded disease to the poor and helpless St Bernard. Unfortunately Cujo's brain was swelled up inside his head, and no-one knew to take him to a vet. So, Cujo went crazy and started terrorising the town. After the movie had finished with a cliff-hanger where Cujo tried to kill a young family of two in a red car, Cujo calmly walked off to hair and makeup, to get ready for his performance at the baseball park. It was there that Cujo suffered the most traumatic experience of his life, his monumental tasering, all for no reason at all; really just for stealing a coke from the vending machine. So Cujo was detained in a hair salon for three years, which is where he gained his accreditation as a qualified hairdresser. He decided to get a perm, as they were very in style that fortnight and he believed he looked rather fabulous indeed. His friend, Paul Wong of Paul's Buttermilk, congratulated him on his stylish choice and offered a glass of his delicious, creamy, low fat, and now drug free buttermilk. Cujo decided to turn over a new leaf, and immediately went out to Best and Less, and bought a red poncho so that he would look damn fabulous when he went to his first Murderous Dogs Anonymous meeting. Cujo thought best to order a pizza to go with this mediocre yet joyous occasion, and so they rang Dominos and ordered the humanitarian pizza, complete with body parts (but no toes, please). Unfortunately the pizza man was both legless and armless after a terrible encounter with some evil children who lived in a corn field, and therefore unable to drive the pizza car and deliver the pizza. Cujo and Paul died of starvation, due to the missing pizza. His close friends, Alison and Caitlin, went into a depression and sued the pizza shop. That received 1002034879521235409874567823 2 chocolate lava cakes in compensation. Their depression magically lifted, and the evil snail with teeth from the sewers sang It's Raining Men at Cujo's funeral, which Harry Potter and Hermione Granger attended, along with their redheaded peasant. While Alison and Caitlin were dividing up his belongings, which only consisted of his best poncho, one thousand pizza tables, a video diary documenting his life, and a young falcon. Caitlin and Alison ate the falcon and set about watching the video. Cujo's Diary: Day 1 Cujo was doing his best to re-enact his favourite movie, Magic Mike. He wanted to perform in front of an audience, so he took it to the streets. Unfortunately he was arrested for indecent exposure and tasered, which led to him frothing at the mouth. It was yet another scarring experience for both Cujo and the onlookers. Day 2 Cujo decided to have his bar mitzvah, but no one showed except the Rabbi as the invitations were never delivered, as Cujo had accidently eaten the mail man the previous day. Cujo was devastated. Unfortunately, he accidentally wrote bat mitzvah, and when he invited all his bat friends, they were annoyed because he had neglected him during the course of his illness. They thought he blamed them for his disease, and created unnecessary prejudice against their species. Cujo was so enraged by this fact, and angry at himself for eating the Post Master General, and not thinking to hand deliver them himself, he grabbed a pair of Holy Scissors, and cut off the Holy Rabbi's Holy Curls, on the side of his head. The Rabbi, not a violent man, simply bent down and switched off the tracking bracelet around his ankle (issued for aggravated assault of a minor) and splashed Cujo with some Holy water. This brought Cujo out of his rage, and calmed him down immediately. Unfortunately, the damage was already done, and the Rabbi left in a huff to go and vent his anger on his wife. And so, Cujo was alone on his Bar mitzvah, and for the rest of the day, drinking the Ribena in silence. Day 3 Cujo awoke from his slumber early to make a fine English breakfast with his housekeeper (she migrated a few years ago, but was a bit chewy). He had clients coming at 11, so he hurried to clean the house before their arrival. His first client was a policewoman, coming in for her Mohawk to be re-dyed pink. She ignored the sign on the door explaining his anxieties about Tasers and wore her belt into the house. Cujo had an episode, and tackled her, crushing her. Her cup of Pepsi was spilled, which she had helped herself to from the fridge. The liquid leaked into her radio and sent a call for help. This is how Cujo got impounded for killing a policewoman. After this, it was decided Cujo need to go to therapy. Day 4 Cujo did the policewoman's hair for her funeral, and then returned to the Pound, extremely disheartened. After lunch, which was a boring steak with BBQ sauce, he casually broke out of the cage and sauntered over to his grandmother's house. Together they drove away in her Cadillac, stopping at McDonalds for a thickshake, made from their new organic menu, devised by Paul Wong. Unfortunately, it was at that moment a deranged man ran onto the road and collided with the car. Cujo then fainted when he saw a dog who had arrived with the crowd to see what had happened. Day 5 Cujo awoke to beeping, and faints again after seeing Channing Tatum in the bed next to him. It turns out he was trying to rescue his ex girlfriend, and ran into the car. Cujo's Grandmother drove him to the hospital after Cujo saw the most attractive dog in the world, Old Yeller. After seeing his therapist, they ascertained that the only reason he liked Old Yeller instead of Channing Tatum was because of the Rabies (Old Yeller had Rabies too). Acting on the advice of his therapist, Jeannine, he joined Murderous Dogs Anonymous. On his first day, they played Ping Pong with a small child, and the group leader explained to them why it was wrong. Unfortunately Cujo missed out on much of the first session as he was too busy eating the said child. Cujo was advised to come back next week by the distressed group leader. Day 6 Cujo is sitting on his bed, howling at the moon. All day. For like, 14 hours straight. Only once does he pause, but keeps going after a few seconds of quiet contemplation. Day 7 Cujo is feeling a little unwell after gorging on the child, then howling for too long. So, he puts on his red poncho and goes out to the dentist. The dentist will not treat him as, he told him repeatedly, he is not a doctor, he only looks at teeth. Cujo does not believe him, and drills his receptionists face with one of the dentist tools, then put an earring in her face. She was incredibly grateful, as she had been meaning to get an eyebrow piercing for a while, even though it made the dentist really mad. Cujo started feeling better after this act of violence, and goes to Plaza to buy a Burrito patterned sweater and a pet falcon that he would store for the winter. Day 8 In Which The Day Cujo Finally Gets His Wish (granted from the Make A Wish Foundation), and Gets To Perform a Modern Interpretation of the Day Television went Live, Starring Graeme Goodie Gumdrops and Lady Gaga, (who is as fabulous as the legends describe) Today Cujo is scheduled to audition at the Rabid Animals Workshop for Performing Arts, for play based on his short life so far. Unfortunately, he lost the part to a small beagle, as the producer said he wasn't ferocious enough. Disheartened, but still wishing for a place to splurge some of his creative juices, Cujo also signs up for any other part available in the theatre. Less than 3 seconds later, Cujo gets a call on his pager, saying they want him for the part. He plays the part of a lovely young lady, who enjoys knitting, until one day she drops a stitch, and must fix it. It also stars Lady Gaga. Day 8 Cujo travelled across town to a Renaissance Fair. Once it came to lunchtime, Cujo gets himself a pie, and gets himself a pass-out. Cujo thought he saw Barak Obama, so he ran after him, but it just turned out to be Morgan Freeman so he left him alone. On the way back to where his skateboard was stashed in a bush, Cujo fell over and skinned his nose. Incredibility disheartened with his day, Cujo decided to go home and sit in his wardrobe to cry. And that was where he discovered a wonderful land called Narnia, where he ate the beaver family because quite frankly, they were annoying and tasted like chicken. Day 8 Cujo meets a new counsellor at his Murderous Dogs Anonymous (MDA) meetings, named Maddison. Maddison was a simple person who happened to have a ghost in a wheel chair living out the front of her house. After Cujo was deemed a new, better person at his MDA meetings, Maddison proceeded to teach Cujo his ABC's, but not his DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWYXZ's. She was a Buddhist in her spare time and scolded Cujo in a typical Buddha way (hitting him over the head with a live salmon) when he stepped on an ant on the sidewalk, as Buddhists do not believe in harming living creatures. She was fast becoming Cujo's most treasured companion, but tragedy struck when Cujo devoured her after she tried to make him eat his sprouts at dinner. Day 9 Whilst working at an iced pineapple stand outside Madison Square Garden, Cujo is approached by a swishy-haired youth who is suffering from food poisoning from the said pineapple that he ate the previous day. After much argument, the anonymous swishy-haired boy collapsed from exhaustion from the poisoning, and Cujo was left baffled that his iced pineapple could cause such things. After much consideration, he decided to steal and put on the boy's clothes, as his pay from the pineapple stand was incredibly small and he liked the colour of the clothes (white and purple). But, alas, after changing into the said clothes, Cujo found himself pulled inside the building and pushed onto a stage, where young girls and middle age women were clapping and seemed to be shouting, \"WHEN I SAY JUSTIN, YOU SAY BIEBER!\" Cujo skipped around the stage, ecstatic that he was finally getting the attention he deserved, even if they had mistaken \"Cujo Weatherbee\" for \"Justin Bieber\". Since the names sounded so similar, Cujo decided to forgive the crowd for their mistake and only ate half of them instead of all. He made a hasty exit when security guards ran at him with tazors, disheartened that he was now again an unknown anonymous who sold iced pineapple. Day 10 Although Cujo had made and lost a lot of friends in the past (mainly due to his sudden cravings), he was sure that his friendship with a russet wolf called Jacob would be everlasting. That was, until, he decided to find Jacob to show him the BFF bracelets he had made them when he trotted in on him and some girl with blonde hair called Rachel. Jealous that this girl was taking his everlasting friend away, he mauled her and the result was a scarred face and now dog-like tendencies due to the rabies that Cujo passed on. Jacob, being none too impressed about the mauling of the love of his life of that week, ended the friendship and moved onto a pale stick-figure called Bella Swan. Cujo stuck around to try and win back Jacob's affection by baking rock cakes and making insect and swan jokes. Cujo decided to give up when Jacob fell in love with Bella's newborn child, deciding he couldn't possibly be connected to Jacob now he had paedophilia tendencies towards babies. Day 11 Cujo was having dinner with his closest friends who he had not managed to devour yet ‚Äì Paul Wong. He had invited Caitlin and Alison, but after much consideration, they had declined, saying that they were both busy saving their drowning goldfish. Cujo did not blame them at all, as the goldfish death toll was on the rise (presumably from him eating them) and he wouldn't want to be the reason for anymore causalities amongst the fish population. Paul didn't own any goldfish at all, saying that they didn't produce buttermilk, so what was the point in them at all? Cujo argued they produced gold and sunshine and puppies, but Paul asked who in their right mind would prefer gold and sunshine and puppies over buttermilk? Cujo politely agreed, and the rest of the evening was spent in quiet contemplation whilst Paul ate his pasta and Cujo ate the waitress who had delivered the pasta. Day 11 Cujo hopped in his clown car and started driving to his MDA meetings, where he had been sent back to after eating that Buddhist counsellor who Cujo couldn't remember the name of, though he was sure her name had been Phillip. Upon arriving, he got a text from his close friend, Caitlin, telling him he missed out on a hilarious moment. Angry that he always misses moments, Cujo ate his steering wheel and went out to create his own moment that would make Caitlin jealous. Pulling on his parka and flipping his perm, he announced proudly to the street that: bitch, he was fabulous, and went in the general direction of a wedding party taking pictures. He quickly devoured the best man and stole the suit, posing as Barney Stinson. The bride, who was a big fan of Mr Stinson, launched herself at Cujo. Cujo, misjudging the bride's actions, ate her. He was scared off by the mob with flaming pitchforks and went home to go cry in Narnia and to eat that annoying goat-thing, Mr Tumas. Finding Narnia 'locked', Cujo went into a rage and ordered a thousand pizzas, and when the Pizza Man arrived they had a nice conversation before the Pizza Man left to go deliver pizzas to a bundle of lunatic children in a cornfield. Cujo ate all he pizzas and then made a tower with the thousand pizza tables that rivalled the Leaning Tower of Pisa. *back to distressed friends, Caitlin & Alison* Caitlin began sobbing into the poncho and Alison curled into a fetal position, although they both agreed that Cujo had had a wonderful and fulfilling life that any savage dog would be proud of. They decided to publish the last few moments of his life on a well-deserved audience on ! The End.

When he asked her what was wrong, all she could say was, \"its Adam.\" Now, here she was, in the hospital corridor waiting for news about her brother. Apparently, he'd been found in his apartment completely passed out. He was not responding and an ambulance had been called. They'd pumped his stomach upon arriving in the hospital but he still had not woken up. Doctors didn't actually know what he had taken. She leaned forward and sighed remembering how she found him the exact same way six months ago in Mike's apartment. She knew he was spiraling out of control and she did nothing. She let him go to Miami, allowed him to live his life so she could finally live hers, when she really should have tied him to her couch and never let him out of her sight. Her baby brother was lying in a hospital bed in a different city then the one they lived in. She'd gotten the call earlier that morning. The sun hadn't even fully risen when the phone rang. Three and a half hours later, she and Mike had walked into the hospital and found Dallas standing in the hallway. She was grateful that Mike was with her; otherwise she'd have attacked the flamboyant man with the tight jeans and long sleeve shirt. She felt a tap on the shoulder and looked up to find Mike hovering over her with two cups of coffee in his hands. \"How you holding up?\" She shook her head. She wasn't holding up. She was breaking apart. He wrapped his arm around her and she sighed into his neck. \"He almost died.\" She mumbled against his skin. \"But he didn't.\" Mike rubbed her arm soothingly. \"It's my fault.\" She started. \"Adam is twenty years old, Brooke‚Ä¶\" Mike started. \"He makes his own decisions now. This wasn't your fault. If it's anyone's fault, it's mine.\" He straightened up when she pulled away. \"I left him behind. I knew where I was leaving him and that he was about to self-destruct and all I cared about was getting myself out.\" \"Adam wasn't your responsibility‚Ä¶\" she shook her head. \"He became my responsibility when I promised you that I'd take care of him.\" She leaned into him and kissed him softly. \"Thank you‚Ä¶\" she whispered. \"For being here. You're the only thing keeping me upright‚Ä¶\" He smiled and kissed her again. \"Anytime.\" \"Miss Riley?\" They both turned toward the man in scrubs standing over them and stood up. \"How is he?\" \"Your brother is doing fine.\" He said. \"I'm Dr. Evans‚Ä¶ your brother was very lucky. Another hour or two and the conversation we'd be having would have been different.\" Brooke nodded in understanding. She knew how close it had come to that. They'd explained that to her already. \"Do you know what it is that he took?\" Dr. Evans asked. Brooke shook her head. \"We live in Tampa. I haven't seen or spoken to Adam in six months.\" Dr. Evans nodded. \"He's awake now, if you want to see him.\" Brooke smiled softly in appreciation. \"Thank you‚Ä¶\" Dr. Evans smiled in return as he turned to lead them down the hall toward a small room. \"He has a private room?\" she asked. \"His boss paid for the hospital bill.\" Dr. Evans nodded. \"Asked that he'd be placed in a private room once he was out of the E.R.\" She smiled again appreciatively before entering the hospital room bathed in the late morning sunlight. She stood numbly by the door when she saw how small he looked on the bed. He was looking out the window unaware that she and Mike had entered the room. \"Adam‚Ä¶\" she called out softly to him. He turned toward the door and smiled softly. \"Hey sis‚Ä¶\" he said in a soft voice. She smiled hearing him call her what he used to when he was younger. \"Hey brother bear‚Ä¶\" she replied and walked further into the room. She took a seat next to the bed and took his limp hand in hers. She noticed the I.V injecting fluids into his system and loosened her grip slightly. He didn't really need the added pressure. Adam looked up toward the doorway and smiled. \"Hey, Mike‚Ä¶\" \"Hey Kid‚Ä¶\" Mike smiled and walked in closing the door behind him. \"You really scared us this time, dude.\" \"I'm sorry‚Ä¶\" he said looking back at Brooke. \"I didn't want you to see me like this.\" \"Adam, what happened?\" she asked. \"You can tell me‚Ä¶\" \"I don't know‚Ä¶\" he shook his head. \"I remember going out last night with Nora‚Ä¶ it was Valentine's Day‚Ä¶ we took something new‚Ä¶ How's Nora?\" Brooke looked up in alarm and turned toward Mike. She didn't know he had been with Nora. Mike shook his head slightly and she closed her eyes. \"Hey buddy‚Ä¶\" Mike started as he leaned over Brooke toward Adam. \"I'm sorry man‚Ä¶ but Nora‚Ä¶ she didn't make it‚Ä¶\" Adam's eyes widened. He shook his head and gasped before choking on tears. \"It's my fault‚Ä¶ it's all my fault‚Ä¶\" Brooke choked back a sob and held on to his hand a little tighter. \"Adam‚Ä¶ you have to calm down‚Ä¶\" she tried soothing him. \"You'll rip out your I.V.\" \"I killed her‚Ä¶ it was my fault‚Ä¶ I should have been taking care of her‚Ä¶ I-\" \"Hey‚Ä¶ Adam‚Ä¶ listen to your sister‚Ä¶ you need to relax, man‚Ä¶\" \"No no no no no no‚Ä¶.\" He shook his head thrashing against the bed and lifted the palm of his hands to his eyes trying to stop the tears from flowing out. \"It's my fault‚Ä¶ my fault‚Ä¶ I killed her‚Ä¶\" \"Mike‚Ä¶\" Brooke stood up‚Ä¶ \"Please do something‚Ä¶\" The door behind them opened and the same Dr. Evans walked in holding a syringe in his hand. \"Adam, I'm going to give you something to calm down, okay?\" \"It's all my fault‚Ä¶ I did this‚Ä¶ My‚Ä¶ fault‚Ä¶\" he dropped his hands to his side almost instantly and the tension in his body left as his eyes drooped closed. \"What did you give him?\" Brooke asked. \"Just a mild sedative.\" Dr. Evans replied. \"He'll sleep it off. You should let him rest.\" \"I'm going to stay right here‚Ä¶\" she argued. \"I don't want him to wake up alone.\" Dr. Evans nodded. \"I'll have the nurse bring you a spare cot.\" \"Brooke?\" She awoke with a startle and found her brother's alert eyes looking back at her. \"Hey‚Ä¶ how'd you sleep?\" she asked with a small smile. \"It wasn't a dream‚Ä¶\" She shook her head slowly. \"I'm sorry.\" He nodded. \"Thank you. For being here.\" \"Where else would I be?\" \"You should be mad at me‚Ä¶\" he said softly. \"Adam, you're my brother. No matter what. I couldn't stay mad at you if I tried.\" He tried to smile but she realized that he couldn't. And to be honest, he really had nothing to smile about. \"I want out.\" She looked up in alarm. \"Out?\" \"Out.\" He nodded. \"Like Mike.\" She smiled and nodded. \"Okay‚Ä¶ as soon as you're released you're coming back to Tampa with us‚Ä¶\" \"What about Dallas?\" he asked. \"Let me handle Dallas.\" She said. She tightened her jaw and promised herself that she would help him get his life on track. She would help him turn his life around. This was her brother. The only family she had left. She may not be able to tie him to her couch and keep an eye on him every minute of every day. But she could take care of him. She could protect him. And she would. Regardless of who tried to hurt him. They'd have to go through her first. She felt a hand softly graze her shoulder and looked up to find Mike looking down on her with a small smile. He'd heard Adam. She let herself really smile for the first time in months. Anyone that wanted to get to her brother would have to go through her and Mike first.

She hated this job more than anything. The minimum wage wasn't worth the hassle she had to bust around the place. Plus not getting extra payment for overtime was just ridiculous. It's not that it was the hardest job exactly, one would think that working at a smoothie bar would be easy. The fact that Katie had to deal with an inconsiderate, unorganized and highly unintelligent boss; she thought about quitting myriads of times. Unfortunately, living in Tampa, Florida wasn't really the cheapest place to live. She was afraid of quitting her dumb minimum wage job, afraid of not being able to find another job. So she remained at Orange Julius for the past three years, putting up with her boss' shit. When she wasn't working at Orange Julius, she kept herself busy working for Doctor Lawrence Bishop D.M.D. as his dental assistant. Katie was never interested in dental science, but there was a free program that she enrolled in during her senior year of high school. At the end of that year, she got her Dental Assisting credentials. The pay was considerably a bit better than minimum wage, plus she got medical benefits; overall, it wasn't a bad career, but it's not something she'd like to do for the rest of her life. Her two jobs salary equaled enough money to split rent with her best friend, car insurance, utilities, gas, food, etc. Even though it kept her extremely busy, she was semi-comfortable with her lifestyle. Customers began to line up, making her pause in her cleaning. Immediately, she dropped the fruit-stained rag and stepped in her usual spot in front of the register, putting on her best Hello-How-May-I-Help-You bullshit smile. Making the customer's drinks became such a breeze to her, she didn't even think about it as she added the correct amount of scoops of fruit syrups, powders, ice, yogurt, etc. The time was reaching around 8:30-ish, so Katie began her usual list of Things-To-Do before closing. Sweeping the floors. Mopping the floors. Wiping down all counters. Cleaning the soda machine tabs. Doing the dishes. And so much more tasks that needed to be done. When closing time reached, she did her typical counting the drawers money and the profits that were made that day. There was always one person working the closing shift and that person was pretty much always Katie, as much as she despised it. After locking up Orange Julius, Katie drove home. . . . Taylor Atkins practiced the shadow boxing method in front of the floor length mirror of the Y.M.C.A. studio. Martial arts was one of her favorite hobbies to do when she wasn't working as a part-time receptionist at Best Western Hotel. Sweat glistened her tanned skin, her blonde hair swept up in a messy bun, her blue eyes narrowed in determination as her body moved fluently through the techniques she's trained for several years. Her father used to teach her as a little girl about martial arts, much to the dismay of her mother who thought that Taylor should be learning of ballet and choreography; not something violent like kickboxing. Taylor didn't care what her mother wanted, and instead enrolled in classes to learn how to properly fight. Growing up as a tomboy, she was always made fun of throughout her years. But she didn't care about what others thought, she'd rather wear jeans then wear a dress any day of the week. \"You better lose yourself in the music, the moment you own it, you better never let it go, go. You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow. This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo,\" the lyrics of a popular Eminem song blasted through the speakers. One of her favorite songs pumped the adrenaline flow inside, encouraging her to move her body in quick, powerful stances. She wouldn't consider herself a professional yet, but years of experience helped her to grow considerably better. She could easily take down a woman her size. Although she wanted to take it to the next level and fight against a man much bigger than her; unfortunately, her trainer won't allow her to do such a thing. How incredibly stupid. Yes, she could get hurt from a male opponent, but it would boost her confidence and stamina if she knew she could face off a one-on-one against a man. Her body began to numb after a few more movements so she decided to take a small break. Taylor hydrated herself with a bottle of water and checked her phone for any messages or updates. The time was close to 9:00, the 27 year-old decided she would go home in thirty minutes. . . . By the time Katie got to the apartment and unlocked the door, she was greeted enthusiastically by her black-colored Newfoundland dog. \"Holy shit,\" she squeaked, easily overpowered from her large dog who was practically twice the size of her. Katie was a woman of 5'7, her body skinny yet healthy. Her dog towered over her while standing up. \"Sasquatch, get your monkey-ass down before someone sees you,\" Katie half whispered-yelled to the excited monster who was hugging her, it's paws resting on her shoulders. She tightly closed her eyes as Sasquatch slobbered all over her face in wet, loving kisses. \"Oh, I love you too, Sasquatch,\" Katie made the mistake of opening her mouth and not a second later, the dog took the opportunity to thrust his huge tongue in her mouth. Katie widened her eyes in panic and ripped herself away from Sasquatch, pushing him back inside the house and shutting the door on him, trapping her on the outside. Katie sputtered in disgust as she tried to regain her breath from being French-kissed by her own freaking dog. Jesus Christ, that was disgusting. \"Fuck, I hope nobody saw that,\" Katie said to herself, wiping her tongue, trying to get the slobber particles out of her mouth. \"I saw that,\" one of her annoying neighbors said from down the hall. Katie turned her head and saw Archie Hepshaw, a ridiculously good-looking guy close to her own age. Blonde hair, blue eyes, great body, he was quite the package and all the ladies loved him; everyone except Katie. \"Of course you saw that,\" Katie groaned, turning her head away as she noticed that Archie wasn't wearing a shirt. Stupid show-off thinks he can strut around without a shirt. The nerve of him. Archie smirked, leaning against the doorway, his arms crossed; looking absolutely mesmerizing with his pectorals all chiseled and hot-looking. Ignore him, Katie, ignore him! \"You do realize there's a no-dog policy here, don't you?\" he asked haughtily. Fuck, Katie cursed in her head. He was gonna snitch on her unless if she did something for him, what an ass-hat! \"Yeah. I guess so, although I wasn't aware that there's an open-door policy for assholes here either,\" Katie smiled innocently at him, fluttering her eyelashes in a coquettish manner. This insult only seemed to amuse Archie as he smirked devilishly at her. \"Katie, Kitty, baby,\" he grinned, resting his arm against the doorway, almost posing like a model. Katie fought the urge to roll her eyes. What a fucking poser. \"Why don't you come inside and we'll settle this like adults,\" Archie suggested in a seductive manner, biting his lip and smoldering his eyes at her. Katie tapped her chin thoughtfully. \"No, how about, if you harass me again, I'll just have my roommate go Karate-Kid on your ass, and maybe Sasquatch can join in on the fun. How does that sound?\" The glint in his eyes were gone and replaced with an angry scowl. \"You're a real bitch, you know that?\" \"Yes, I am a bitch,\" Katie smirked before whispering in a flirtatious tone. \"Just not yours.\" Archie stared intently at her before a small smirk lifted the corners of his mouth. \"I always get what I want,\" Archie said confidently. \"Soon, you'll know what it feels like to be with a real man.\" \"That's funny,\" Katie laughed before saying in a deadpan tone. \"You're giving my middle finger a boner.\" She flipped him off. Archie glared at her. Katie blew him a mocking kiss before going into her apartment. As soon as she closed the door, Sasquatch immediately tackled her against the door, his huge head greeting his owner with happy, loving kisses. \"I'm getting more action from my own dog than a guy,\" Katie sighed. \"This is depressing.\" . . . Taylor decided to get McDonalds before going home because she knew her best friend would be craving a double-cheeseburger this late at night. It's funny, people always looked at her strange; her beings dressed in workout clothes while clutching a bag of McD's. She didn't give a single flying fuck. She ate whatever she damn well pleased. That's another thing her mom tried to force her to do when she was younger; become a vegan. Yeah, like that's ever gonna happen. Her mom was always considered about her big-boned body. It's not that Taylor was fat, in fact she was in great shape. But she was just born with a bigger-toned body and blessed with great breasts. Taylor used to be ashamed of her body. The dark times of her teenage years when she went the bulimia route. Her best friend saved her from undergoing weight loss and self-harm. That's when Taylor knew that she couldn't live without Katie by her side. Taylor arrived home around 10:40, quietly going in, not wanting to be attacked by the monster Katie called Sasquatch. Shutting the door softly, Taylor dropped her Nike duffel bag and purse on the floor, still clutching the scrumptious cheeseburger bag. She also made sure to get a few plain hamburgers for Sasquatch too, after all he was part of their little family. Inside the living room was dark, Taylor wondered if Katie went to bed in her room. Without even knocking, Taylor opened her door. Katie shrieked in surprise, causing her to drop her unfortunate most-prized possession onto the floor. \"Ahhh! My bong!\" Katie yelped, billowing out the last of the smoke into the air before jumping off her bed and inspecting the damage on her floor. \"What the fuck, Katie,\" Taylor snapped, dropping the McDonald's bag and helping her friend on the floor. \"You can't smoke up in here, we're renting the damn place!\" \"Well, sorry, I didn't want to smoke on the porch, knowing that fuck-boy Archie was gonna be out there stalking me!\" Katie argued, picking up the glass tube that split in half. The water was all over the floor and the reek of weed clouded through the air. \"Fuck! I paid $300 for this baby!\" Katie pouted, hugging her broken 3-foot pink glass-stained bong against her chest. \"Why the hell did you barge in like that? I thought you weren't gonna be home until ten.\" \"It's past ten, Katie,\" Taylor corrected. Katie narrowed her red eyes in confusion. \"Holy shit, is it really?\" \"God, you're already high as a kite,\" Taylor rolled her eyes at her best friend. \"Actually I'm not, this was some stepped-on shit my dealer got me. I need good premium quality shit, not stepped-on shit.\" Katie looked around for her bag of weed. \"Where is my stepped-on shit?\" she asked confused. Both girls suddenly looked at each other. Then they looked accusingly at Sasquatch. The dog was happily sitting in front of the door, Katie's dime bag empty in front of its paws. \"Sasquatch,\" Taylor scolded. \"My dog ate my weed,\" Katie said calmly. \"He ate my weed.\" Then she started giggling as if it was the funniest thing in the world. Taylor only sighed. \"At least we have McDonalds,\" Taylor said before noticing the empty, crumpled McDonald's bag next to Sasquatch. \"I'm gonna kill that dog,\" Taylor said quietly. Katie placed her hand on the blonde girl's shoulder. \"Um, please don't.\" Taylor rolled her eyes. \"It's just a figure of speech, I'm not gonna actually‚Äîoh why the hell do I even bother?\" Taylor got up and exited out of Katie's room. \"Looks like it's just you and me, Sasquatch.\" Katie crawled next to her big dog and wrapped an arm around him. \"You know what they say, 'Couples who smoke together, stay together.' Well I say, best friends who smoke together, stay best friends. You're a good boy,\" Katie scratched his head lovingly. \"Don't listen to the evil bitch Taylor, she's not gonna kill you.\" \"I heard that,\" Taylor shouted from across the hall. \"That's not what your mom said last night,\" Katie shouted back. \"What?\" \"Oh wait‚Äîsorry, I just remembered that, uh, only works for guys... I'm not a guy...\" \"Wow, really, Katie... I had no idea,\" Taylor responded sarcastically. \"She must be on her period,\" Katie whispered to Sasquatch who in return licked her face. \"That bitch owes me a new bong... I liked that bong.\" \"You're a fucking dental assistant, Katie. You shouldn't even be smoking in the first place.\" \"There's a lot of things I shouldn't be doing in the first place.\" \"Go to bed, Katie.\" . . . It was Thursday morning, Taylor and Katie were meeting friends at an IHOP. The circle of friends sat in a large booth, Taylor and Katie sitting on one side, their two friends Liv and Anna on the opposite. Liv was a beautiful dark-skinned girl around their age with matching dark eyes rimmed with liner. Anna was the complete opposite of Liv with fair skin, coils of strawberry blonde hair, and blue eyes; she was the image of innocence. Everyone already ordered what they wanted from the menu and began conversing enthusiastically. \"Ah, I'm so stoked for Coachella coming up next week,\" Anna gushed, excitement brimming her angelic voice. To be honest, Katie could never stand Anna with her annoying child-like voice and face; she wanted to strangle her. But she played it cool, knowing that Anna was a very good friend of Taylor's and Liv's. \"Literally, I'm so excited, like you don't even know,\" Anna continued, oblivious to Katie's annoyance. \"Aren't you excited, Liv?\" she asked. \"Fuck yeah, are you kidding me? I've been listening to Coachella Girl by Gentleman's Vibe fucking non stop since we got tickets last year!\" Liv boasted enthusiastically. \"I'll bet,\" Katie commented, a twinge of jealousy staining her voice. Taylor, obviously the closest with Katie, could distinguish the venom in her tone. \"How's the Master's Degree coming along?\" Taylor purposely changed the subject, aiming her question towards Anna who was working extensively to earn her degree in Science. \"Very well, thank you,\" Anna bragged, making Taylor wince on the inside; she probably could've picked a better question that didn't involve Anna bragging about herself. \"You know, the great thing about earning this degree is that it could be used in a wide variety of science, health, and even social science professions. The major focus is to research which is also designed through a few courses that have a combination of research-based courses and class-based courses,\" Anna explained. This information flew right over Katie and Taylor's heads. \"Who are you, Dr. Phil?\" asked Katie with obvious confusion. \"Katie,\" Taylor warned. \"Oh, I'm sorry,\" Anna apologized sweetly. \"I didn't mean to go on and on about myself, how inconsiderate of me. How are things progressing in your life, Katelyn?\" Katie absolutely despised when people used her full name. \"Things are progressing awesomely,\" Katie straightened herself almost in a defensive manner. \"Mm, interesting choice of words,\" Anna pursed her lips. Katie flashed her a fake smile. \"Only from the best,\" she practically snarled. \"Oh boy,\" Taylor muttered, rubbing her temple. \"What about you, girl? Been kicking any major ass lately,\" Liv directed the question toward Taylor. \"Not really,\" Taylor said. \"Oh, don't listen to her,\" Katie beamed proudly, shrugging an arm around her sheepish friend's shoulder. \"She's been going Black Widow on everyone's ass. It's so awesome.\" \"Black Widow?\" asked Anna. \"Marvel,\" Katie answered. \"Marvel?\" Anna inquired. \"Marvel,\" Katie confirmed. \"I'm afraid I don't know‚Äî\" \"Oh, wow, have you been living under a rock?\" Katie interrupted her, her tone mocking. \"Katie,\" Taylor warned. \"What? She doesn't know what Marvel is! That should be a crime!\" Katie argued. \"Oh, help me Lord,\" Taylor sighed. \"I love Marvel,\" Liv added, as if that would help ease the situation. \"Well, while you're busy gloating about Black Widow or Marvel of whatever you speak of, we'll happily be on our way to Coachella,\" Anna gleamed her pearly white smile. Katie stared at her, steam practically blaring out of her ears. \"Yeah, well, you're not the only ones going to Coachella,\" she said confidently. \"Come again?\" Anna's smile dropped. \"Yeah,\" Taylor agreed. \"Come again?\" She stared at her best friend in confusion. \"You think you're so much better than me, bragging about your stupid Bachelor's degree,\" Katie snarled. \"Master's,\" Anna corrected hotly. \"Like it matters,\" Katie rolled her eyes. \"Whoa, whoa, chill, Katie,\" Liv said, raising her hands in defense. \"What's up with the hostile shit, girl?\" \"Yeah, I agree. This is so stupid, you're acting like you're in highschool again,\" Taylor reprimanded. Katie ignored her best friend, her brown eyes solely focused on her enemy across from her. \"If I see you at Coachella, I'll make sure to get a picture with you.\" \"Doubtful, highly doubtful,\" Anna's smirk widened. \"If you think I'm gonna fall for that, you seriously might wanna get your brain checked from a professional.\" \"We got tickets last minute actually,\" Katie lied smoothly. \"One of my co-workers got sick and offered them to me.\" \"Really,\" Anna said doubtfully. \"Really,\" Katie confirmed so confidently and effortlessly, Taylor almost believed her. \"All right,\" Anna smiled charmingly. \"Let's make this interesting.\" Taylor and Liv glanced at each other worriedly, wondering what Anna was scheming. \"I'm all ears,\" Katie narrowed her eyes at the seemingly perfect strawberry blonde. \"I wanna play a game,\" Anna grinned. \"If it involves torture devices, I'm out,\" Katie responded. \"No. It involves a cross-country scavenger hunt. And VIP tickets.\" \"Keep talking.\" ‚Äî This first chapter is a bit all over the place, apologies about that. If you're wondering, I imagine Nina Dobrev as Katie and Kate Upton as Taylor. This is my first Magic Mike fic so please give it some love. I've read a couple of them and decided I wanted to write my own and make it different. I advise everyone not to take this story seriously, there will be a few silly parts although I'll try to make it realistic and appealing to everyone.

I thank everyone for having the patience to read this awfully long and bittersweet message‚Ä¶ P.S. I'm not permanently finished with fan fiction.

Hope you like it, reviews and comments are welcomed. Chapter 1 Today was like any other day in New York, Sunny and bright. The record high this afternoon would be one hundred degrees. It was still morning hours as I looked out the kitchen window of Hollow Brook Boarding House while I washed the dishes and watch the birds singing on the little ledge below the window. I couldn't help but think of my past while looking at my mothers small green porcelain vase with Dandilions all around the exterior to give it a nice spring feeling. My mother gave it to me when I was eight years old. God Bless her, she wasn't the best mother mind you, but she taught me the basics in life before she died and left me to rot in the hell whole of an orphanage when I was ten. I was basically an orphan ever since I was born. My father died in the war when I was just a bay so my mother had to raise me herself. She was a terrible mother to me because she never paid attention to me and she never told me she loved me. She had died just a few months after my tenth birthday by being hit by a drunk driver in her car. My day dreaming had been broken by my bosses voice calling me. \"Amelia, what do you think your doing? Standing in this kitchen doing nothing, repulsive! Get back to work right now young lady\" Miss Schreck called out to me from the kitchen door. she was a middle aged lady in the late forties and single. She is plain looking with dark brown curly hair up in a bun and she had on a short sleeve maroon dress with white lacing. She also has a nice plump full figure. \" Yes, Miss Schreck\" I said facing her trying to cover up my flower in my mother's vase. \" What's behind your back? Amelia what are you hiding?\" She asked in the most stern voice. I did not answer her so she pushed me aside, revealing the small green vase from behind me. \" What do we have here? A vase with a Carnation, how dare you have flowers around the food!\" She glared at me with dark stormy eyes, then she threw my mother's vase on the ground and the vase broke in a million pieces and my flower was crushed. She started walking away without a care in the world. \" My vase, my flower! You broke them! How dare you! How dare you break my mother's vase!\" I screamed, crying hysterically now. \" Oh never mind about that vase, your mom was a low life anyways! Now straighten up and clean everything and get back to work before I send you back to the orphanage!\" She threatened as she left. i sticker out my tongue and made a face and picked up my now broken vase. I honestly didn't know if I should try to glue the vase back together or just throw it away. After I finished picking up up all the pieces and put them in a box I grabbed the food for the breakfast on my tray and headed out to the dining room where all of the guests were at. They consisted of five rich people and four middle class people. The Wayburns: Eugene, his wife Clair, and their teenage daughter Angela. The Dirmeyers: Mrs Ruby and her adult daughter Sarah, were the rich. Mr. Gagliardi, Mr. Jaszi, Mr. Evanstad, and Miss Johnson were the middle class. The dining room looked the same as what a high school cafeteria would look. The rich sat together and everyone else sat together at their own table. All of them were stuck up and had their noses up their butts, but not Mr Gagliardi. Mr Gagliardi was a sales rep for Sears. Every time I did him a favor he would give me some money, and tell me thanks. I have told him he didn't have to give me any money but he insisted. Making my way to the tables I handed everyone their coffee, juice, water, and whatever they ordered to eat. None of them said thank you, not one. And they never said good morning either when I entered the room. Now for Mr Gagliardi, it was different, he said good morning and he said thank you, he even asked me how I was. I told him that I was having a horrible day. I said everything what Miss Schreck did, I told him that she broke my mother's vase and never felt sorry for doing it. I was a little surprised that he felt sympathetic towards me. He asked if there was anything he could do, I told him there wasn't, so he just smiled and patted my back. To tell you the truth, he was quit handsome, he was wearing a light brown suit with a white undershirt and a white tie. His hair was jet black and slicked back, his eyes were so blue and so crystal clear. He looked like a movie star sitting there smiling at me and I couldn't help but smile back. I turned on my heels, grabbed my tray and headed out to Miss Schreck's office. While leaving the dining room I got dirty looks and I was called, not so nice names. I was called some pretty horrible names by just being nice,if you think that's bad and was the first time I got dirty looks and called names, your wrong. Slowly entering, not to distract Miss Schreck, I tiptoed to her kitchen table and put her order down. She had her back to me sitting by the fire as she read a book on Mythology. Leaving quitley so I wouldn't get yelled at I headed back to the kitchen and I sat down to eat my breakfast. Being a housemaid, not only did I have to do all of the work, but I have to eat last. Day dreaming again I thought about all of the mean people in the works and all of the mean people I have met, all stick up just like the rest of them. No one offered to help me out or anything, I started all the fires, I gave everyone their bucket of water, I did all the dishes, I did all the laundry, I did everything, and I didn't get one thing in return! I am sick of this place and I'm sick of life! I want to leave but I don't know where I would go! I don't want to go back to the orphanage! I wish to go away! I couldn't help myself, I had to cry, I had to let all of those tears out! I hung my head and felt so ashamed! My crying had stopped when I head a weird knock at the door. I wondered who it could be, so I got up and started walking ever so slowly to the door. I took a deep breath and opened the door. The stranger was shadowed from the sun, so he bent down so I could see his face clearly. My eyes went wide at the sight of him. He was the most handsome man I have ever seen in my life! His has was dark brown and was a little thinned out at the top. His smile was wide and beautiful. His eyes were the most gorgeous brown I cou,d ever imagine! He was only a few inches taller then me but he seemed to have a good stance. He had on charcoal grey pants, with a white belt. His shirt was a button up royal blue shirt and he had on a matching grey jacket. He had all the right curves in all the right places and he glowed like an angel, he has got to be my guardian angel! \" Hiya Sweet'art! 'Ow are ya?\" The stranger asked \"Okay, how may I help you sir?\" I asked him almost whispering \"Ya got a room?\" His voice boomed and I could have just died right then and there \" Sure come in please\" I said bending down to take his suit case \" Oh No! No, inform kt sweet'art\" he winked at me and stepped inside. I was shocked, he took his suitcase and I didn't have to carry it. TO BE CONTINUED! ","Summary":" This a love story about Harpo Marx.

Outside, three shadowy figures walked along the sidewalk. The time was well past midnight . One was chewing on a cigar and the smoke made the Italian gentleman want to cough, but the little girl felt fine as she was completely used to it. The two men were talking business. \"Don't you know what duplicates are?\" asked the man with the cigar. \"Sure,\" said the Italian, shrugging his shoulders. \"There's five kids up in Canada.\" \"Well, I haven't been to Canada in five years.\" This gentleman's name was Herschel K. Snowsell. He always carried a cigar with him, everywhere he went. He was smart in the worst of ways and was easily able to compliment you and insult you at the same time. Herschel was whimsically cunning and obnoxious, with a black greasepaint moustache and brows thickly painted on his upper lip and both eyebrows. He had glasses and dark brown hair. Some may call it, 'fluffy.' Herschel K. Snowsell's companion, and newly discovered business partner, was Icilio. He always carried an elaborate scheme with him, everywhere he went. He had a case of untreated labyrinthitis, so he had trouble hearing people and at times became too dizzy to stand up by himself. Icilio was affable and humorously annoying. Barely anyone has seen his thick hair because it's frequently under a funny-looking hat. Love him like a brother or hate him like the bug on the windshield of your life. A small hand tugged at the bottom of Herschel's jacket. The hand belonged to an eight-year-old girl named Padme. She always carried an old, tattered blue blanket with her, everywhere she went. She was quiet and pathetically shy, and had an, 'issue,' (as her father called it) where she never slept at night but fell asleep randomly throughout the day. She was unbelievably cute and inquisitive, with very light brown hair messily put up in a ponytail. Her green eyes were in a perpetual state of shock. Padme constantly left you wondering just what it was she was seeing that you didn't which was so fascinating. Again, it was happening. Padme clutched at her father's hand and opened her mouth, but before any words could come out, she fainted dead away into his awaiting arms. Herschel sighed. He hoisted her into the air and held her sideways, her head naturally resting against his chest. He wrapped the girl up in her beloved blanket, making a, 'Padme Taco,' as she liked to call it. He glanced at Icilio, who was scratching his head in confusion, and then glanced back down at his daughter. He immediately sat down on the curb, the girl in his lap. Soon Icilio was sitting uncomfortably beside him on the cold ground. \"Now we just have to put this bag of jello here until she comes to...\" he mumbled more to himself than his companion, brushing some hair out of Padme's face and behind her ear. She didn't even flinch. Her, 'issue,' was getting worse and worse by the day. Herschel was forever having to stop whatever he was doing to hold her up and snuggle her for between five minutes to two hours until she was awake enough to move around again. It was becoming increasingly difficult and Herschel felt guilty going to bed at night knowing his little girl was wide awake in the other room. Why could HE sleep when he wanted to but SHE couldn't? It happened when they both least expected it. It had happened when Padme was brushing her teeth, doing her homework, eating, driving with Herschel at the wheel, drinking milk, walking, reading a book, listening to the baseball game on the radio, playing her and her father's guitar, or doing the dishes. Recently, Herschel was realizing she was beginning to have a couple seconds of notice before she actually fell asleep. Just a couple, but it made a difference. At least he had time to catch her, whereas before she landed either flat on her face or flat on her back, or into whatever she was eating. Icilio cocked his head to the side. \"Whatsa matter for her?\" Herschel said nothing and bounced Padme up and down, desperately wishing she would awaken. Although Herschel would never admit it since it was silly, but sometimes he worried she would sleep for days at once and he wouldn't be able to leave her. Her breathing was steady and even, and he could tell she was in for a long session. Herschel cradled her as if she was two years old again, when her mother was still alive. Slightly frustrated that his life centered around Padme's episodes, he said to Icilio, \"Wouldn't it be simpler if I just had her stuffed?\" Icilio firmly shook his head no. He frowned. \"She's-a no olive.\" A warm July breeze blew past them. Herschel, a lawyer, had been hired by Icilio to represent him in a case involving some lemonade, a fat cop, a dog, and some peanuts. The details escaped Herschel's mind at the moment. When Icilio was explaining the situation he was busy doing one of the following: eating, smoking, or drinking. Given that the details were so hazy he was probably doing the latter. More likely, though, all three. \"Well, olives are olives, aren't they? Still, on the other hand, water is water. And east is east and west is west, and if you take cranberries and stew them like applesauce, they taste much more like prunes than rhubarb does. Now, uh...\" Herschel nodded in Icilio's direction. \"Now you tell me what you know.\" The sky was as dark as charcoal. Icilio seemed transfixed with it. His head was tilted all the way back as he stared, fascinated. There were no stars. Herschel always told Padme that was because there just as many stars as there were lights, so your eyes got confused and couldn't tell the difference and you would get so dizzy it all basically turned black. Icilio at long last tore his gaze away from the sky and gave Herschel his full attention. \"Well, let-a me see. I know nothing, all I know is that-a mustard's-a no good without-a roast beef.\" \"Yes, yes, that's true,\" Herschel agreed. \"Eh?\" He nudged the girl, who didn't budge. \"Yeah...\" Herschel squeezed Padme, hugging her as hard as possible without breaking her ribs. He wanted so much more for her than she had. He wanted her to get better. ","Summary":" The warm night air had a weight to it as it hung over the City of Lights.

This case started with a confusedrndame. But she wasn't the only confused one because I had no clue what a damernwas. I was in my office, toying with a new deck of cards. I have no cluernexactly how to toy around with a deckrnof cards but, believe me---I was. She came in sobbing and looked around myrnjoint. \"Hey,\" I said, \"If you take a picture it'll last longer\". She looked up,rnblushing. She said, \"Oh. Can you help me?\" I sensed that she was not exactlyrnthe brightest sun in the solar system so I decided to toy with her for awhile.rnYou know, to give the cards a rest. I said, \"Probably. But first, choose a cardrnany card\" as I started to fan out the deck. The stranger reached a small,rndelicate hand out of her crocodile purse. She quietly selected a card from thernbicycle deck. She was a pro at these magic tricks, so she looked at her card,rnmemorizing it. \"I said go ahead. Keep it. I've got fifty one left.\" She looked at me like I was some sortrnof bizarre monkey. Come on , I thoughtrnto myself, it took you that long tornrealize that, but I didn't say it. That's how I lost a couple clients. Sornsucking in my gut and keeping my wits to myself, I finally said, \"So, whatrnbrings you here doll-face\" She nodded and said, \"Well, these two Frenchrnpickpockets stole a Tiffany from me. Oh how I lovedrnthat Tiffany. Whoa is me\" Looks like someone had too many drama lessons. \"Andrnis Tiffany your daughter?\" I asked. \"No you twit,\" she snapped, \"It's arnnecklace. God, some people can be so stupid\" Oh great. It's a client with anrnattitude. \"And do you remember what these pickpockets looked like,\" I said,rntrying to make a point that the wise cracks didn't phase me. \"Yes,\" she said. Something told mernthat she was about to tell me but I missed my cue. \"One had black, oily hairrnand a strong Italian accent\" Wait just a cotton picking minute. Didn't she sayrnthey were French? \"And the other didn't speak but had an enormous red blob ofrncurly hair\" That's when it hit her that I knew about the Italian-Frenchrnidentity crisis. \"So, I said, \"Where were you whenrnthis necklace was stolen?\" Meanwhile, she wasn't listening to a word a was saying. She started to cry when she was talking aboutrnthe Tiffany. Now, she was trying to wipe off the tears without messing up herrnmakeup. Hmm.., I thought to myself, didn't I have an Italian brother and onernwith curly hair. Come to think of it, he didn't talk too much. \"Wait arnsecond,\" I called out abruptly, \"I have brothers that match that description\" Irnwas interrupted by an ugly, croak of a voice. It was my client. \"Nobody caresrnabout your family tree,\" she said. Well, I think she said it. It sounded morernlike cat being strangled by a parrot. Or maybe the other way around, I'm not surernwhich. \"Are you going to help me or not?\"rnthe lady demanded. \"How can I with out knowing your name?\" I'm always quick tornget the last word. She said suavely, \"It's Dumont.rnMargaret Dumont.\" Why does the girl always steal the guy's lines in parodies?rnAs it turned out, and it did turnrnout, she lost it in France.rnIf you didn't have to think twice about the French pickpockets living in France ,rnthen go buy yourself a new deck of cards. That way you can toy around withrnthem. Next thing I know I'm in France.rnPeople can do wonders with these frequent flier mile things. Whether I like itrnor not with Ms. Dumont, as pretty as she is, she is a pain in the rear quartersrnas well. Being polite about things makes up for the gentleman you lost as a child.rnUnfortunately, I never had any gentleman as a child. Now that you feel bad forrnbe how about buying a cappuccino for me? If you said you wouldn't then don'trneven bother reading the other half. If you said you would you're a man after myrnown heart. But, a deal's a deal‚Ä¶ pay up or get lost, chump! Lucky for me the in flight movie was,rn\"Animal Crackers\" Although I hate to say it, I love that movie more than I lovernthe mystery business. Who am I kidding? I love to say it! But laughter was the lastrnthing I had on my mind. The first thing I won't get into talking about. It'srnnot important. But important things were my business. Well, sometimes. Afterrnseveral laughing fits from the movie and getting emotionally constipated fromrnMs. Dumont's soapbox speech, I think I finally learned the definition of pain.rnIf you think you know what pain is, you obviously haven't read my dictionary. Finally landing in a French airport,rnmy eyes and feet told me that it was time to retire. Not from detecting, mindrnyou, from Ms. Dumont. \"No one likes it when you narrate the story in yourrnmind,\" she snapped. Great , I thought myself, nowrnshe's a mind reader . Keeping my steps in line with my attitude and keepingrnmy eyes fixed on Ms. Dumont, I couldn't help noticing something. If she has arncrocodile purse she must be pretty wealthy. Why doesn't she just buy another Tiffany? These thoughtsrncircled around my head faster than cheetah doing the electric slide. But I hadrnno time for feline dance grooves. I just had a case, Ms. Dumont, and I. People say that there is no time likernthe present. But if the present is a living nightmare and you're stuck with thernscariest looking beast you've ever seen, and then give me all the presents yourncan afford. But getting back to the Tiffany case, what was so special about arnstupid little chain with a heart on it. Besides, the one I gave my girlfriendrnwas the kind in a 25 cents machine. I don't know what I've been told, but thisrnwhole joke of a case was pretty old. And Ms. Dumont smells like mold. Soundrnoff. Ms. Dumont stomped her foot, wakingrnmy up from my narration. We got into her limo and sped off into the night. \"Andrnso,\" Ms. Dumont spat out, \"That is how I became a millionaire\" And then thernwhale of a lady named, Ms. Dumont opened the window. She began shouting to onernof her comrades on the street, \"Macaroni! Hold the cheese! Crunchatize mernCaptain!\" What the heck is she saying , I thought to myself.rnAs I got to the hotel where my residence would spend the night, I figured outrnwhat she was saying. Well, not exactly figure out, mind you again, but it hadrnto have been some kind of code she made up. Maybe there was more that meets therneye about Ms. Dumont. And maybe cheese-fries do the hokey-pokey. Ms. Dumont wasrnan ugly lug. I can tell you that much. The other much is taking a vacation. He's sleeping so don't disturb him.rnThank you for your courtesy. I was tossing and turning all nightrnfaster than you can say, \"Captain Spaulding\" (this Animal Crackers thing wasrnreally getting to me) after getting lost several times in the hotel lobby, Irndecided to sleep outside. Actually I couldn't find my room, so I decided tornsleep outside. But we can keep that between ourselves. After all, I had arnhunger for mystery and a taste for danger. And from around the corner, sleeprnlurked up behind me and slapped me in the side of my head. Or it could havernbeen a criminal mastermind who finally found the right moment to catch me.rnSometimes I can't tell which. My bet was on the second answer. Is that your final answer? As luck would have it, the criminalrnmastermind was just who I suspected. The only problem was I had no one to suspect. I could use a lead right about now , I thought to myself. Nothingrnhappened. Excuse me but that is your cue. Aw, skip it. Hold yer horses ya old coot, I thought again to myself. And in onernconfusing blur of thought, I figured out the case. Well, most of it anyway. Why did Ms. Dumont come to me, a detective,rnif she knew what the pickpockets looked like? She could have gone to the Cops. Andrnall at once I knew Margaret M. Dumont. The \"M.\" probably stands for monster.rnNow I had a double shot of espresso, a hard-as-rock mattress on my bed, and arncriminal mastermind all wrapped up in a zesty soft, doughy taco shell. I knew Ms. Dumont was one toughrncookie but this oatmeal raisin business was getting ridiculous! I didn't knowrnwhen to make my move, by exposing her, I mean. She had me all wrapped up in herrnspider web tighter then thong on a hot summer morning. I decided to play alongrnwith her little game of charades for a wee bit longer. At times like this I askrnmyself one question, \" Since when do I sayrn'wee'\" The morning arrived like a glass ofrnPepto-Bismol. Brisk and unwelcome. I stepped out sidernthe hotel for a breath of fresh morning air. It was one of the best gulps ofrnoxygen I have ever had. That's including coming out of a bar filled withrnsmokers. Sure I had a cigar but hey? Who doesn't? The fresh morning breezernstopped the moment I heard a familiar voice. Ms. Dumont's chilly, heartlessrncroak, I mean voice, echoed down my spine. That does not say much for JamesrnEarl Jones's belting pipes. Ah, to heck with the whole, \"play along with herrngame thing\" \"Aha!\" I blurted out, unexpectedly, \"You fiend! You never lost yourrnnecklace! You faked it\" \"The jig is up,\" Margaret Dumont said, her voice filledrnsorrow. \"This is the ABC Family channel's show, \"Faking It\" I was trying to seernhow long you could be fooled. I could have won a million dollars\" \"But yournalready have a million dollars,\" saidrnmatter-of-factly. \"That was part of the role I was playing\" I insecurely said,rn\"Oh‚Ä¶I knew that\" And that is the case of Ms. Dumont.

Whadda you say to that, holy mackeral? \"Itsa gelato, andnI-a accept as-a long as I can-a bring-a my partner.\" \"Can he operate?\" \"Sure-a he can. Hey,npartner! Show the Doc whadda you do.\" Silent Bob nods andnpulls a rather large stethoscope out of his pocket. He takes thenstethoscope and hits Holigelato on the knee. Then he pulls an x-raynout of his other pocket and points from the crack on the x-rayed kneento Wishtison's head. Wishtison looks at thenbroken knee and says, \"No wonder my foot is throbbing. It's in mynhead.\" He looks at Silent Bob and asks, \"You haven't got a CATnscan in there, do you?\" Silent Bob nods againnand pulls a cat out of his coat pocket. The tag on the collar saysn\"Scan.\" Holigelato laughs andnsays, \"Eh, thatsa whadda you call 'cross section.'\" While Silent Bob andnHoligelato are talking to themselves, Frank takes Dr. Wishtison tonthe car and they get inside. \"You ought to benmore careful, sir,\" says Frank. \"There's a rumor going aroundnthat your old rival Gunther Ransem is trying to get men on theninside.\" Wishtison looksnoutraged and says, \"How dare he try to put his men on my inside! Ifnhe really wanted to spy on me, he'd put them in the inside!nThe nerve of some people!\" Meanwhile, at a smallnoffice all the way across town, Gunther Ransem, the rival innquestion, is busy on the phone with someone. \"Now, now, then,\"nhe says with a hint of malice in his voice. \"It's only fair thatnyou do this one favor for me, my dear. After all, you owe me.\" \"I don't owe you anthing, you hear me?\" yells the woman on the other end. This womannhas curly blond hair and is wearing a black dress. \"I'm not yourngirl anymore, Gunther Ransem! You're a corrupt, evil, backstabbingncrook, and I'm not doing anything for you!\" Ransem just smiles andnreplies, \"Au contraire, my dear. You will do what I want, and donyou know why?\" Without waiting for an answer, he continues,n\"Because I have your records, and if you don't want thenauthorities to come banging on your doorstep, you will do as I say!\" The woman looks anlittle pale, but replies, \"Fine! But what do you want me to do?\" \"Well, Anna, I wantnyou to join the offices of Dr. Everett Q. Wishtison as a secretary.nGet close to him. And when the time comes, steal everything he ownsnand bring it to me! And if you fail, not only will I show your recordnto the police, I will personally rip you apart! Do you understand?\" Anna looks terrified,nbut says, \"Yes.\" Meanwhile, back innWishtison's car, Frank and Wishtison are discussing hiring newnemployees. \"Now, as I wasnsaying, sir, we are going to need to hire a bush load of doctors.\" \"Bush load? It mightnas well be a shrub load. We need foliage more than we need doctors.\" \"But you need ansecretary. Who's going to dictate your letters?\" Wishtison puts on anvery dramatic voice and says, \"What's wrong with you today,nFrank? Don't you know that I dictate the letters and they writenthem?\" \"Of course, mynapologies, Dr. Wishtison.\" \"I'll take two,\"nhe says, lighting a cigar. \"Now then, what about hiring a wholenteam of surgeons for the second floor? By the hours I'm working,nI'll have a broken backbone every night.\" Frank pulls a piece ofnpaper out of his pocket and says, \"But it says here that younalready booked the veterinarians to that floor.\" \"Well, close thenbook and put it in the attic. Say, that's a good idea. Do we havenan attic for the vets?\" \"No,\" says Frank,n\"but we could put them in the large room above the top floor.\" Wishtison stares atnFrank's ears for a few seconds and says, \"I'm trying to findnthe little men shoving earwax in there.\" The driver calls back,n\"Dr. Wishtison, we're arriving at your complex.\" Wishtison calls up,n\"Which one? A mother complex or a father complex? I like girls withnfather complexes. After all, I am a father.\" Frank looks atnWishtison and says, \"I didn't know you had a son.\" \"I don't.\" \"Then how comenyou're a father?\" Wishtison rolls hisneyes, looks at the viewer, and says, \"Susan B. Anthony, you workednin vain.\" Then he turns to Frank and says, \"I have a daughter,nAnthony‚Ä¶ Frank.\" \"Oh,\" says Franknin surprise. \"I didn't know that.\" \"Of course youndon't,\" retorts Wishtison. \"There's a lot of things that youndon't know, Frank. Take the Civil War. Who was the guy who statednthe Proclamation of Decimation‚Ä¶ Emancipation?\" \"Oh, that's easy.nLinc‚Ä¶\" \"Good try. Give up?nIt was Lincoln. Now I'll give you an easy one. If two fish matenwith two wildebeests, would they be acquatic-based or land-based? Ornwould they be third-based and not make it home?\" \"Hmm‚Ä¶ I don'tnknow,\" admits Frank. \"I don't knowneither,\" admits Wishtison, \"but I can tell you that things arenbound to get worse.\" Just then, Holigelatonand Silent Bob pull up in a motorbike with a passenger seat.nHoligelato says, \"Hey there, Cap! We've-a come for-a the job!\" Wishtison groans andnsays, \"What did I tell you?\" Chapter Two: ThenFacility- Wishtison shows Holigelato and Silent Bob the entirenbuilding, and Frank meets Wishtison's daughter Polly for the firstntime.

Of cours"},{"Movie":"Marx Brothers","Title":"Murder!","Author":"LilStripedTomato","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2402766","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Author's Note: Hi there! Lil here! Wow, believe it or not I actually started a Marx Brothers fic! Huzzah! I've written many fanfic stories before, but never one with my favorite mischief-making brothers. This is a first, so please be kind. And I must say that there's not much of Zeppo in this first chapter, sorry SPAZ fans, but there'll be more of him in later chapters. This is based off of the game that the brothers, especially Harpo, liked to play, called Murder. It's very fun and if you haven't tried it I highly recommend it! It is where many people get together and they all get a paper and whoever gets the paper with 'Killer' on it gets to be the murderer and 'kill' victims, while the others try to solve who did it. It's also loosely based off of the movie Clue, which I haven't seen in years. I do own the board game, however, and love it! If you all would be so kind as to leave a review, it would make me very happy. Reviews make me smile! And now for that pesky disclaimer! That Pesky Disclaimer: I own no one you recognize. I don't own the brothers, though I wish I did, nor do I own Siegfried Rumann or Margaret Dumont. Sadly, all I own are the maid and the two random women, who are there because I needed an even amount of people. I also own the cook, who isn't even in this chapter but who will probably snuff it in a later one. I wish I owned Harpo, anyone care to pitch in and buy him for me for my upcoming birthday? Murder! Chapter 1 Meetings and Tootsie Frootsies Our story begins in front of a large and spooky mansion sitting back quite a distance from the road. Coincidentally, there is a thunderstorm raging outside which adds greatly to the eerie atmosphere, how convenient. Upon entering the front door we notice a rather portly man with a two-pointed beard and curled moustache bustling about and giving orders to a scantily-clad maid with blonde hair who is speaking French. Our attention, however, is drawn to a handsome figure in a black suit who is leaning against a door frame and watching the goings on with a rather dashing air. He seems to be expecting something. Just then a car pulls noisily into the drive outside and the man smiles. \"Ah,\" he says, \"Our first guest has arrived! Do show them into the lounge, will you, Guttley? I will be there shortly, I have some business to attend to first.\" The bearded man nods and watches the younger fellow walk away down the hall before heading toward the door. At this moment a very loud and annoying knock echoes through the house. Guttley opens the door to reveal a man in a bright, blaring yellow suit with a matching cane and safari hat. He has round glasses, a large black moustache, and is smoking a cigar. \"Velcome, sir.\" the portly butler says in what sounds like a German accent, bowing to the side to let the newcomer in. \"Ve haff been expecting you, please come in.\" \"Expecting me, eh?\" the guest asks suspiciously. \"What is this, an ambush?\" He looks around, eyes darting from side to side in search of who knows what. \"What kind of plot is this?\" he asks, outraged. \"You must be working for the monkeys! You sure enough look like a monkey! I thought I lost them after I crossed the Swanee River, but I guess I was wrong. Was I not invited here with open arms? And now ya wanna close those arms around my neck and kill me! Some hospitality!\" \"Sir, remember zhat you are our guest!\" Guttley tells him. \"Ve vouldn't vant to kill our guests, vould ve? Ve just vant to murder you, not kill you. And I can assure you zhat zhere are no monkeys here, at least not to my knowledge.\" This seems to reassure the odd man and, though still a bit paraniod, he allows himself to be led inside the mansion, shaking the rain from his hat. After all, he doesn't mind being murdered. It's the killing that he wouldn't like too much. The stranger enters with an oddly crouched walk and looks around. \"Say,\" he says, cigar wiggling around in the air, \"Nice place ya got here. It's no Cocoanut Manor, but it's better than some of the joints I've been in.\" \"Please allow me to take your hat,\" offers the bearded man, reaching for the aforementioned chappeau. He is immediately slapped by the strange guest, who clamps a hand tightly over his head and brandishes his cane at the butler with the other hand. \"What's the big idea?\" he asks, eyeing Guttley even more suspiciously than before. \"I payed two bucks for this hat! Go out and buy your own! Besides, yellow isn't your color anyway.\" The larger man sighs and doesn't bother trying to explain it to him. After all, he's just the butler, what does he care if his boss's guests are lunatics? Turning around, he says, \"If you'll follow me, please, Mister Kadaver vould like me to take you into zhe lounge.\" He leads the crouching man down the hall and through a doorway. The maid is in there behind the bar, getting things ready to serve drinks to the guests. \"Haff a seat and make yourself comfortable,\" the German man continues. \"Zhe ozher guests should be arriving shortly.\" The man in yellow makes himself cozy in an armchair and asks the maid for a pi√±a colada. Just then a doorbell chimes in an upbeat and chipper tune that plays throughout the mansion. \"Zhat's odd,\" remarks Guttley, \"Ve don't haff a doorbell!\" He heads out the door to answer the call nonetheless. This time, believe it or not, an even stranger sight greets him than before. A man with a purple top had covering a head of red curls greets him with a wave and a startling 'honk!' of a taxi horn in his hand. He is dressed in various shades of violet with a matching raincoat, but oddly seems not to need it as, despite the downpour, he is completely dry. \"Ah, velcome.\" says the fellow with the forked facial hair, bowing once more. \"Please come in. May I take your coat and hat?\" The guest walks in and whistles appreciatively. He does not take off his coat, but he removes his hat and plops it onto Guttley's head. The butler, not knowing what the guest is trying to do, just stands there looking ridiculous. The redhead walks around him and looks at his head from all angles, examining it carefully. Then, with a sigh and a shake of his head, he takes the top hat from the other man's head and places it rakishly back onto his own. We quite agree, it looks much better on him. Puzzled, the butler stares at him for a moment before bowing again and saying, \"Please allow me to show you to zhe lounge, Mister Kadaver would like you to wait there for him. Valk zhis vay.\" He leads the skipping mute down the hall and into the same doorway that he took the first guest. \"Zhe ozhers should be here soon,\" he says. \"Until zhen, feel free to make yourself at home and help yourself to whatever you like.\" He indicates the bar, where the maid is pouring a drink for the man in yellow. Our purple friend, taking the man's words to heart, grins impishly before jumping over the bar and grabbing the maid, making her scream in terror. \"No, no, no!\" shouts Guttley exasperatedly. \"I meant to help yourself vith vhat's in the bar, not vhat's tending it! Let her go!\" As fate would have it, however, there is another knock at the door which forces the bearded butler to answer it. As he goes out the door into the hallway we see the first guest laugh as he checks his drink for poison and monkey hair while watching the second guest chase the maid around, honking happily. The butler, nervously approaching the front door, is more than a little afraid at what he may find when he gets there. But upon opening the aforementioned door, he is happy to see three normal-looking people this time. In the middle is a gentleman with a tan complexion and curly dark hair, dressed in a green suit with an odd, conical green hat to match. On each of his arms is a rather attractive woman, each holding an umbrella. One has short black hair and is wearing a red dress, the other with long brown hair and a white dress. \"Hello! Please come in,\" says Guttley, smiling and bowing, relieved to have normal people arrive. The trio enters and he takes the women's wraps, umbrellas, and the man's overcoat, hanging them in the hall closet. Against his better judgment, he asks the man, \"May I take your hat, sir?\" The fellow takes off his hat and looks at it, then looks at Guttley's head. He looks back at the hat and then says, \"Nah, it wouldn't fit you!\" He then puts the hat back onto his own head. The butler again is at a loss of words for this, are these men just stupid or insane? He can't decide which yet and feels it safer to just completely avoid the conversation of hats the next time another guest arrives. \"Velcome.\" the portly man says, still looking strangely at the man. \"I did not know zhat you three already knew each ozher. I thought zhat all of Mister Kadaver's guests today vere supposed to be strangers. Zhis might be a problem.\" \"Oh, we don't-a know each otha. \"says the man in green in a strange Italian accent. \"You see, my car, she-a break-a down a ways down-a the road. These ladies, they was-a nice enough to pick-a me up and give-a me a ride. And I must say, if-a it means to be-a picked up by two-a beautiful ladies like-a this then I hope-a my care breaks-a down more often!\" After he charmingly says this, the lady in red giggles and scoots closer to him. The other woman just smiles and turns to Guttley. \"Yes, we jut met him a few minutes ago.\" she explains in an English accent. \"And I had just met the other lady shortly before that when she offered to share a cab with me at the train station. It turns out we were all three coming here, isn't that nice?\" \"Yes, how convenient.\" says the butler. \"Now if you vill all follow me, I vill show you into zhe lounge vhere zhe ozher guests are vaiting. Ve haff another person that should be arriving, but after zhat ve should be able to get started.\" The Italian slyly wraps his arms around the ladies' waists and all three follow the bearded man down the hall to meet the others. Upon entering the lounge, however, a chaotic sight greets them. Everything is topsy-turvy! Cushions are thrown about with feathers floating everywhere, books are off the shelves and scattered across the floor, chairs are overturned, picture frames are askew, and amidst this mess sits the man in yellow, dumping out a wastepaper basket and rifling through its contents suspiciously. An outraged Guttley looks around and turns as red as an angry lobster with a sunburn. \"Vhat on earth happened in here?\" he bellows! \"Vhat did you do? Vhy did you tear zhis room apart? Stop zhat, you're making it vorse! Vhere is Chantefleurie? I'll get her to clean zhis up, it has to be straightened up before Mister Kadaver sees it like zhis or ve'll lose our jobs!\" He looks frantically around at the horrible mess and begins pulling out bits of his beard in anger. The safari-hatted guest looks up at the lobster-like man innocently. \"Well ya see,\" he begins, \"I heard a noise that sounded threatening and naturally I figured it was the monkeys after me again. You know, they've been closer than I'd like after that Timbuktu incident. So, of course I had to search the room just in case there was a chimp or gorilla hidden. Oh, and if you're looking for the maid, I'm not sure where she got to. Last I saw of her she was still tryin' ta get away from that honking Cassanova.\" He looks around the room and says, \"Sorry about the mess. But the good news is that there weren't any sinister animals lurking around here.\" Just then, however, a strange noise emits from the closet by the bar. Turning around as quickly as lightning, the lemon-esque man jumps up and dashes to the closet door. \"Aha! I've got you now, you hoodlum primate!\" he cries, grabbing a large bottle from the bar top and raising it over his head, ready to strike his would-be-killer. Flinging open the door, however, he is dismayed to see a flustered maid and a smiling purple suited fellow topple out. \"Well, it looks like there was some sinister animal lurking around here after all.\" he says, eyeing the lipstick marks all over the man's face and the state of disarray of the woman's uniform. The red haired man stands and helps the lady to her feet. She straightens her dress and looks at the butler, beginning to apologize. He cuts her off with, \"I don't even vant to know! Just let's get zhis place cleaned up before Mister Kadaver sees it or ve'll both be fired!\" Everyone else volunteers to help, even the paranoid man who caused the mess, and soon the room looks almost normal. It would've been cleaned up much faster if they had all taken a little more interest in the job, however. As it turns out, the Italian man kept trying to sweet talk his two female companions, the man with the top hat kept 'distracting' the giggling maid, and the safari fellow kept obsessively knocking on the walls and floors to look for hiding spots in which monkeys might've been lurking sinisterly. Still, the room no longer looks as if a hurricane had just blown through, so that's a good thing. Once more, right on schedule, just after the last of the pillows is straightened and the final picture frame hung, a knock sounds at the front door. \"Oh, zhat must be our last guest!\" Guttley says. \"I'll go and get zhe door. Chantefleurie, vould you please go and tell zhe cook to get zhings ready for dinner? And everyone else, please don't do anything terrible while I'm gone!\" With that he rushes out, sending one last glare at the fellow in yellow. The maid gives her red headed romeo one last smooch before leaving to go to the kitchen. He watches her go and whistles coyly after her. The man in green comes over to him and chuckles, saying, \"Hey, at's-a good! She seems-a real nice. You sure gotta da way with-a the ladies, eh?\" The first man nods eagerly and raises his eyebrows, then honks his taxi horn a few times. \"Yeah,\" the other man says. \"Maybe you should-a take her out for tootsie-frootsie ice-a cream some time. Hey, we can-a both go and have a triple-a date!\" The violet-clothed man holds up four fingers, then two, and honks questioningly. \"Nah,\" the tan guest replies, \"It wouldn't-a be a double-a date, I wouldn't-a be able to pick-a just one!\" He indicates the two ladies sitting on the sofa and talking amiably. \"I like-a dem both, it wouldn't-a be fair.\" \"Hey, I gotta anotha idea!\" he says enthusiastically. \"You could bring-a anotha girl, too! Then we can-a have-a the quadriplet-a date!\" A shake of the head and a low whistle shoots down this idea, however. The violet man pats his hands over his heart and then stretches his arms out towards the door, declaring his love for the French woman who had just exited. \"Aw, at's-a too bad. There's-a no otha woman ya wanna go with? Don't-a you like-a anybody else?\" the Italian asks him. At this the silent man nods enthusiastically and reaches into his raincoat, pulling out a picture of a chestnut colored horse. He shows it to his friend and then kisses it before returning it to his interior pocket. \"No, at's-a no good!\" says the emerald suited gentleman shaking his head. \"Everybody knows that horses don't-a like tootsie-frootsie ice-a cream!\" But their interesting conversation is brought to a halt before it can get any stranger, thanks to the appearance of Guttley in the doorway, followed closely by a stately woman dressed in dark blue. She is obviously very wealthy, as she has large and sparkly jewelry encrusted with diamonds and sapphires around her neck and arms. This does not go unnoticed by the bright yellow guest as he grins wickedly and crouches over to the chair where she has just seated herself elegantly. \"Please make yourself comfortable vhilst I go and see vhat has become of Mister Kadaver.\" Guttley says as he once more goes out the door and down the hall. \"How do ya do, toots?\" the lemon colored man asks the lady as he perches on the arm of her chair. \"Say, where have you been all my life? On second thought, maybe ya better go back to whatever rock you crawled out from under. Feel free to leave your money at the door!\" After her shocked 'Oh my!', he remembers to add, \"And don't forget to tell 'em Groucho sent ya!\" \"What on earth are you talking about, you strange little man?\" the blue woman asks him. \"Whatever it is, I find you very rude and wish you to leave this instant!\" She attempts to push him off of the arm of her chair, but to no avail. He's stuck like bubblegum to the bottom of a shoe. He takes her hand and holds it dramatically. \"Oh, please don't tell me to go!\" he begs her. \"I must stay here by your side! I love you! I know we've just met, but don't you believe in love at first sight?\" She smiles, flattered, not noticing that the sight he's looking at is her glittering jewels. He goes on, \"You're beautiful, radiant, wonderful! You've got the eyes of Bette Davis, the lips of Greta Garbo, the body of King Kong! You're a sight for sore eyes! In fact, I think you're the sight that makes the eyes sore in the first place!\" At this she realizes that she's been insulted and tries to pull her hand away from him with an outraged gasp. He won't let her go, however, and so she settles for turning to look in the opposite direction of the brightly colored man. \"Wait,\" he says, \"Don't be offended! What I meant was that maybe your sparkling necklace, er‚Ä¶ I mean your sparkling personality is blinding! Yeah, that's a good save, we'll go with that.\" She still refuses to acknowledge him. This, however, presents him with a good opportunity and a bad idea. While she is turned away from him, he slyly attempts to remove her necklace. Unfortunately, she feels this and assumes that he's trying to put his arms around her. \"Oh, Captain!\" she says. \"I suppose I can forgive you. After all, you mean well and seem to be rather sweet. And you are irresistibly attractive.\" We notice that she must be very nearsighted, as the man has a face that only a mother could love. And that's only if the mother were blind in one eye and had an eye patch over the other eye. Still, she smiles and turns back towards him, forcing him to stop his attempts at thievery and really place his arm around her shoulder. She smiles and leans into him, but before he can continue to mutter strange sweet nothings in her ear, the lounge door opens. In walks the dashing man with the nice black suit that we saw in the beginning of our picture, I mean the beginning of our story. He smiles at them all and says, \"Welcome, everyone, to my humble home! I'm Mister Kadaver. I'm very pleased to see all of you here this evening. Now, if you will accompany me to the dining room, we can have dinner before the first of us is murdered. Come on, now.\" The group follows him out the door and heads down the hall to the dining room, eagerly awaiting the events that are to take place after they eat. Remember to please leave a nice review on your way out! For now I must be going, but the next chapter should be written soon and posted sooner. 'Til next time! ","Summary":" Author's Note: Hi there! Lil here! Wow, believe it or not I actually started a Marx Brothers fic! H"},{"Movie":"Marx Brothers","Title":"Banana Oil","Author":"Soha","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1269458","Passage":"[Chapter 1] In a meeting hall full of people, two men in particular stand out. The first notable is the head of the Thieves' Guild, a surprisingly respectable man, dressed flawlessly and with a bit of high class snobbery in his manner. The second is a mere member of the guild, and though neatly dressed is as different in manner from the Chairman as it is possible to be. He has his feet propped up on the polished oaken table, and as he leans back in his chair he pops a cigar into his mouth. His thick mustache and eyebrows seem more a caricature of facial hair than an actual part of him - mainly because they actually are painted on. This is Maxwell Quincy, a black sheep among thieves. The Chairman gets to his feet with a slow, self-important deliberation that draws all eyes (except Quincy's) to him. In a rumbling baritone, he announces, \"This meeting of the Thieves' Guild is called to order.\" \"Two orders of french-fried potatoes, coming right up,\" Quincy calls out, giving his cigar a tap with his forefinger. Ash from the stogie tumbles onto the polished table, drawing aghast stares from neighboring thieves. Glancing reproachfully at Quincy, the Chairman tugs his coat lapels huffily and draws himself up to begin again. \"As I say, the meeting is called to order. Mr. Secretary, may we have a report on the next assignment?\" \"Sure, but it'll cost you more,\" says Quincy. \"Certainly, sir.\" The Secretary's response follows and he, too, shoots a reproachful glare at Quincy. He then clears his throat and, getting to his feet, lifts a piece of paper up to his nose. He begins to read from it in a high, grating voice. \"The best thieves have been summoned here tonight to discuss and make plans for the retrieval of a certain very large diamond in the possession of a Mr. Roy Dupris. In the home of Dupris--\" \"And the land of da Brave.\" \"Mr. Quincy, please!\" the Chairman snaps. \"You're right, I had it backwards. Well, next time I'll put it foreword, and I'll even write an introduction.\" Leaning forward, he takes his feet off the table and begins to gesture with his cigar. \"That'll have five words instead of four words, or maybe it was towards I was thinking of. That's right, two Wards and a Macy's right across the street. Ah, they have a wonderful selection of attire. Speaking of which, I'm a-tiring of this nonsense, let's get it on with.\" \"Well, I never!\" the Secretary exclaims, peering over the rims of his glasses in astonishment at Quincy's behavior. \"Don't be shy, I've never done this before either,\" says Quincy, bouncing his eyebrows and smiling in a mock-shy manner. The Secretary hems and haws, flustered. The Chairman soon rescues him. \"Mr. Secretary,\" he says with commendable aplomb, \"please continue the report.\" Nodding respectfully to the Chairman, the Secretary lifts the piece of paper again and recommences reading from it. \"In the home of Mr. Dupris, as I was saying, there is a rather large showroom in which we believe the diamond is being kept. Entry to the room is possible through the skylight, however, as the ceiling is very high indeed, in order to reach the floor our operative will require a parachute.\" \"A single-shoot will do just fine if you want to get rid of the poor man, but how about getting that diamond?\" Quincy interjects. The thieves begin to mutter amongst themselves, shooting sideways glances at Quincy and the increasingly brick-faced Chairman. The Chairman grits his teeth. \"Mr. Quincy, will you please remain silent until the end of the discussion?\" \"What discussion? Pardon me, I thought this was a corn-growers convention.\" \"It most certainly is not. Now, if you will please be quiet?\" \"I'm all ears.\" \"Thank you. Mr. Secretary?\" \"Yes, sir? Oh, yes, sir. To continue, at nighttime there is a--\" Thump. \"As I say, there is at night a--\" Thump. The Secretary glances up from his paper briefly before continuing his read. \"A system--\" Thump-thump-thump. Pushing his glasses up on his nose, the Secretary turns his attention to Quincy, who is dribbling a small rubber ball idly on the table. \"I say!\" Thump. \"Mr. Quincy!\" the Chairman explodes, clenching his hands into fists. \"I thought you understood that you are to be absolutely silent as this is a very important discussion.\" \"You call this nonsense important? No wonder you fellows steal for a living -- can't hold down an honest job.\" \"If you think it's so trivial, let's see you get that diamond,\" the Secretary says snidely. \"All right, I'll do that.\" \"You can't just waltz in there and take the diamond!\" \"You're right, a rumba would add more class.\" The Secretary huffs up for a reply when the Chairman holds up a hand to stop him. \"If Mr. Quincy believes he can get the diamond, then let him try. We, meanwhile, will continue our meeting -- and if Mr. Quincy's attempt should fail, let him suffer the consequences. Alone.\" The other thieves fall silent, as deeply awed as if the Chairman had just pronounced a death sentence. For his part, Quincy seems oblivious to the shock of those around him: he tips his hat mildly, gets up, and heads to the door. As his hand is on the doorknob, however, he turns back around. \"If I never see you boys again,\" he says, \"my only regret is that I might still hear from you.\" With that he steps outside, carelessly slamming the door on a room full of baffled burglars. On the street outside, cars are rushing past quickly. Quincy, watching the flow of traffic, leans over the curb and waves his arm. He whistles. \"Hey! Taxi!\" A taxi pulls up next to him. \"Isn't that nice -- he knows his name.\" Patting the roof of the taxi, Quincy steps inside. ***** Quincy steps out of the cab at 5th Avenue where he finds himself facing the illustrious Dupris mansion. After looking at it for a moment, he turns to you, the reader. \"Folks, what stands before me is a giant mansion. Standing next to him are his little womansion and their wee little kidsion. That's where they do all their cooking, the kitchen -- and I hear they've got one in the oven. So much for impregnable fortresses.\" Rolling his eyes, his pops a cigar in his mouth and strides -- with crouching steps -- to the mansion. Reaching the door, he grabs the knocker. It's bent in a low, sweeping curve with a hollow middle like an open gutter. Inspecting it for a moment, he taps cigar ash into the hollow then raps on the door with his knuckles. A butler answers the door with surprising promptness. \"Yes?\" he asks. \"May I assist you?\" \"You may, but I'd have to get to know you first.\" The butler frowns. \"Sir, what have you come here for?\" \"I've come to avenge the death of my father. En garde, you cowardly cur!\" Whipping an imaginary sword out from nowhere, Quincy begins dodging around, making jabbing and slicing motions with his empty sword-hand. The butler spluttered at this madness. \"But I've never killed anyone!\" \"Why, then you've got nothing to worry about -- you've got beginner's luck on your side. Of course, so have I. Well, may the best man win, and may he also run slower than the worst man, unless that best man is me. And as the best man, I'd like to say a few kind words about the bridegroom. I'd like to, but I can't, and believe me I've tried. O, how I've tried! I've tried the salmon, the steak, and your patience, and I don't recommend any of them. Even the service was awful; it was underdone. I'd like to speak to your manager, and not for the scintillating conversation.\" The butler gapes at Quincy, completely befuddled. After a few moments, however, he wipes his expression blank and regains his composure with a prim tug on his lapels. \"You cannot see Mr. Dupris unless you state your business here. Do you have an introductory card?\" \"Sure, I've got fifty-two of 'em!\" Quincy snatches a card deck from his pocket and holds them out in front of him, splayed. \"Here, pick a card.\" Surprised and puzzled, the butler takes a card. \"Go on, take another . . . Yes, that's right.\" \"What do I do with these cards?\" \"Keep 'em, I've got no use for 'em.\" Quincy snaps the cards back into a neat stack and stuffs them in his pocket. \"Oh, really, now! I must insist you tell me who you are.\" \"You first.\" \"Why, I'm the butler.\" \"And you did it in the ball room with the candlestick, isn't that right?\" The butler is baffled. \"Here, take a card.\" They reappear from Quincy's pocket. Distracted, the butler automatically complies. Perceiving suddenly that Quincy is making a fool out of him, the butler gets red in the face and angrily throws all the cards in his hand on the ground. \"Now that the carding business is all over,\" Quincy says, sliding the deck out of sight, \"how about you let me in for a little drink?\" \"I'm sorry, you cannot come in unless you state your business.\" \"Who, me? I'm the reporter who called last week. I've come for a tour of the mansion.\" \"I don't remember speaking to any reporters.\" \"You probably have a selective memory.\" The butler eyes Quincy appraisingly. \"Possi- bly , sir. Come right this way.\" He steps back to allow Quincy entrance to the mansion. Quincy follows him around, peering at the elaborately decorated walls and gilded trimmings as he does so. \"Nice place you got here. If you scratch the little gold foil off, are there lottery numbers underneath?\" \"Lottery numbers?\" booms an unfamiliar voice from the next room. A tall, broad-shouldered man saunters into the room. He wears breeches, a plaid shirt, and a rakishly tilted cowboy hat. \"Hoo-wee!\" he booms. \"Damned if you ain't the kidder! Hey, Georgey-boy, who's this here feller?\" Unfazed, George the butler replies evenly, \"He is a journalist, sir, who has come to tour the mansion.\" \"That so!\" exclaims Mr. Dupris, slapping his hand on his knee. \"Well, he's a lucky man, 'cause he's just been granted an interview with the mansion-owner himself!\" \"I haven't felt this elated since 1929,\" Quincy says, but the beaming Roy Dupris doesn't pay him any heed. \"Here, have a seat,\" Dupris tells Quincy after the butler slips soundlessly out of the room. \"You know, I wasn't always this well off. No sirree. Why I started out without a dime in my pocket -- no, not one.\" Quincy opens his mouth; before he can speak, Dupris throws up a hand. \"Now, don't you say anything -- I'm not looking for pity. I worked myself up to where I am today because I didn't look for anyone's pity.\" \"Too busy looking for their wallets.\" Dupris ignores him. He begins to pace in front of Quincy. \"Now, I could certainly tell you stories, mind. Stories that would chill your bones. But I didn't give up -- that's not my way. I didn't give up or ask for handouts. I worked my way to the top with these, my own two hands.\" Dupris holds his two hands out for inspection. \"They don't look like your hands. They look like the pair I lost last week in the barber shop.\" After only a slight pause, Dupris recommences his narrative. \"I got to the top, though, all on my own. Nobody helped me -- I'm a purely self-made man, my friend; the idol of American literature. I am living proof of the system's success. I embody America. I stand for opportunity, I stand for freedom -- I stand for the American dream!\" \"Well, sit down and shut up.\" \"George!\" bellows Dupris, his face red with fury. The butler appears immediately. \"Help him finish his tour of the house and then see him out.\" \"Certainly, sir,\" George answers obediently. \"This way, sir,\" he said, now addressing Quincy. \"Nice meeting you,\" Quincy says to Dupris in passing. The millionaire clenches his jaw. Adjoining the small parlor where Dupris had been \"interviewed\" is the showroom. Here, lined up along the wall, are a score of pedestals displaying everything from Grecian urns to chipped Babylonian statues. In the very center of the room sits a large display with a red satin pillow perched on top of it. Nestled down in the pillow is a large, sparkling diamond. \"This is the Mr. Dupris's showroom,\" the butler drones. \"His collection is one of the finest in New York, esteemed both for the value of the items as well as their variety.\" With Quincy a step behind him, the butler moves across the room, pointing at the various items to direct Quincy's attention that way. When he nears the diamond, he stops in front of it. \"The diamond you see at the middle of the room is one of the largest, finest diamonds in the world.\" \"What, this puny thing?\" Quincy says, picking it up off the pillow. The butler's eyes widen. \"Sir, that diamond is one of Mr. Dupris's prized possessions!\" he splutters, gesturing wildly with his hands towards the pillow. \"One of? Well, since he's got so many, he probably won't mind if I borrow this one.\" He starts to walk away. The butler interposes himself between Quincy and the door. \"Pardon me, sir, but that diamond cannot leave the room.\" \"That so?\" Yet he makes no move to replace it. \"You can't leave the room with it, sir. It's in your hand.\" Quincy looks. \"Why, so it is! Fancy a little slip up like that.\" Giving the diamond a small toss into the air, Quincy catches it again and pockets it. He heads for the door. \"Sir, you still have the diamond.\" Quincy turns back to the butler and shakes his hand, suddenly congratulatory and enthusiastic. \"Right again! You, my friend, have an eye for detail -- me, I have an I for resale; come back tomorrow and I'll give you J, K, and L for half-price. You don't have to worry about tricky deals with me, I follow the letter of the law -- mainly because if I catch that letter I can sell it again for a bundle. Did you know you can use these letters to blackmail rich countesses? Go ahead and count my S's, C if I care. Speaking of eye care, have you seen my optometrist? I've been looking for him.\" He steps around the butler and heads towards the door again. This time the butler doesn't move to stop him; he just stands there staring, his jaw agape. ***** Upon exiting the cab, Quincy strides quickly towards the door to the meeting hall where the Thieves' Guild is still having their session. Flinging open the doors, he calls \"I'm baaaack!\" to the gathered burglars. He continues his long-paced, crouching walk and returns to his seat at the table. A ripple of reaction passes through the crowd. The startled Chairman gets to his feet, leaning his hands on the table. The Secretary, still reading from a sheaf of papers in his hands, pauses and peers over his spectacles, dumbfounded. In Quincy's hand is the giant diamond previously in the possession of Mr. Roy Dupris. \"But . . . but . . .\" the Secretary splutters, pointing at it. \"But but? No need to butter me up, I've already got the diamond.\" Quincy pockets the diamond. \"So,\" he says casually. \"Did you miss me?\" \"No,\" the Chairman responds grumpily. \"Well, I missed you. I missed you and you should be grateful, since I was throwing a tomato at the time.\" With a groan, the Chairman sank into his chair and hid his face in his hands. The Secretary threw his plans for the theft down on the ground and stamped on them angrily. Raising his brows as he watches their reactions, Quincy puts a cigar in his mouth and casually starts to smoke. \"And just wait till they find out the diamond was a fake,\" he remarks to his neighbor.

THWACK! My machete cut cleanly through the thick rainforestnunderbrush. Where was it? I've been out here for a week searching for thenramblings of an old man! \"Ouch!\" I exclaimed in confusion. I looked at my phantom and it wasnjust a broken vine. In frustration I aimed at it and slashed it with mynmachete. A wall of green fell down to the ground and I saw a small clearnpool surrounded by rocks. I approached warily and saw a glint of gold. Ingasped as I looked at the two-and-a-half foot high object. \"So it's true,\" I said aloud, \"It's really true,\" I rubbed my eyesnand looked again to make sure it was still there. The Golden Wishing Harp!n Sheathing my machete I climbed down to the pool and waded across. Indid not seem to be able to get there fast enough, but finally I pullednmyself onto the rock slab the harp was sitting upon, gasping to get oxygennback into my lungs. Once my breathing regulared, I turned onto my side tonlook at the harp. It had a mystical glow that took in everything within anfoot. I slowly sat up and pondered whether or not I should touch it. Itnlooked so fragile, like a card house. I gradually gathered my courage andnreached out to touch it. When my fingertips barely touched the top I heardnsoft singing. I immediately withdrew my fingers and the singing stopped. \"What is this magic?\" I asked. Something took me over and the small harp was in my lap and I wasnfingering a strange song, heavenly voices joined in an exquisite chorus. Itnseemed like a lovely lifetime before the music ceased and the harp was, asnbefore, sitting next to me on the stone slab. I breathed laboriously and angreediness took me over. I carefully wrapped the harp into my bedroll andnstrapped in to my pack. I waded across the pool with new exhilaration. Inwalked quickly all the way back to my camp and immediately madenpreparations to go back home. * * * \"What a beautiful harp!\" exclaimed Mr. Chandler, \"Where ever did you getnit?\" \"I bought it at an auction when I was in New York,\" I lied, chewingnthe end of my black cigar. \"Is that real gold?\" asked Mrs. Rittenhouse. \"To be sure!\" I said feigning resentment. The mute music Professor walked over and made hand signs to Mr.nRavelli, \"He wants-a to know if he can-a play the harp,\" he said in hisnthick Italian accent. \"No!\" I said excitedly, \"No, it doesn't play it's just an artisticnstatue,\" I lied, chewing my black mustache. I was asked more ignorant questions throughout the evening as thenparty continued. I was glad when everyone bade me farewell and left forntheir own houses. I finally was able to be alone with my treasure. I walking into the sitting room and sat down in an armchair, the harpnappeared in my lap and I started playing, as before. I played, and thensupernatural voices crooned. Then, I was sitting in the chair and the harpnwas where it had been before I picked it up. I thought it curious that Innever remembered either picking it up or setting it down. I walked over to the harp and examined everything about it. It wasnperfect. then I noticed a flaw. This flaw was so small it was hard to seenwith the naked eye. It was thin as a hair and an inch long. A crack! I rubbed the crack with my thumb. I did not hear the unearthly voicesnbut a screech like an awful violinist playing on an out of tune violin. Inremoved my thumb and I saw the crack was bigger and I no longer had tontouch the harp to hear the screeching noise. I rubbed rapidly andnfuriously; the noise kept increasing in volume. All at once the harp flew into fifteen shards and six-inch high,nwinged creatures came flying out. Moving two and fro like autumn leaves innan enraged wind. Then a larger one of these beings came from the shards andnlooked at me with a piercing stare. It advanced and the screech wasnunbearable. It opened its mouth and all noise stopped until it spoke. It spoke like the notes of a softly playing piccolo, \"Why have youndisturbed the Golden Harp?\" \"I-I-I was t-told it was a w-w-w-ishing harp,\" I stuttered. \"What is your wish?\" asked the dark being. \"To be famous around the world,\" I answered confidently. \"Your wish is granted,\" said the being in a sly tone and it vanishedninto dark purple smoke. The screeching stared again and my throat felt like candle wax. Inlooked down at my fingers and they were melting, just like a candle. Incried out as my heart burst and I slipped into unconsciousness. * * * \"This is baffling!\" cried out the policeman. \"He was-a just fine-a yesterday!\" said Mr. Ravelli, \"I was-a at his-anparty!\" The Professor shook his head and let out a sympathetic whistle. \"I just don't know what to do!\" exclaimed the policeman, \"He'snmelted, just like a candle!\" They all looked down and the pile of flesh-wax. the only thingnremaining of Captain Geoffrey T.

She was laughing it up with her fianc√©e. God, it was wonderful to associate him with that word‚Ä¶he grinned cheekily as he sipped his beer. Yes, he sipped it. But she didn't mind, because she respected him, knew he could handle himself; come to think of it he could handle just about everything. The restaurant's milieu only added to his natural charm and she gazed at the metal band on that oh-so-special finger. No, not the middle one‚Ä¶although that had its uses as well. \"Hey babe, so how about we tackle that trail by the waterside tomorrow? I've got half the day off thanks to Joel.\" \"Who's he again? The buff cute guy, or the buff hot guy?\" \"Duh, it's the one you're having an affair with.\" He winked at her just then, thinking he was joking. Her guilt began the slow ascent in her stomach. There was no awkward silence, not like the first time he'd made a similar joke. Luckily she'd been quick enough to laugh it off that first time, and now it was just second nature to pass over those comments, to hope he had no idea. A hand running through her hair, a laugh offered up, the usual suppression techniques. They worked just fine‚Ä¶as usual. It wasn't like she didn't care about his feelings. He meant a lot to her, but sometimes there were some‚Ä¶.needs that required fulfillment. She drank some wine. The liquid sloshed smoothly down the back of her throat before kicking its way back up when she felt a hand on her shoulder. \"Hey, what're you doing here?\" Oh. My. God. No, please don't be- Yes it was. He stood there, all goofy smile and unknowing eyes. He caught sight of her fianc√©e. God, she hated associating him with that word‚Ä¶now it was a confused grin plastered across that charming face. She introduced Mike and then her fianc√©e introduced himself. No, please don't let your face fall like that‚Ä¶.please keep smiling‚Ä¶.please, Mike‚Ä¶. Her fianc√©e left. And now it was just the two of them. The sex-buddies. The call-you-up-for-you-know-what-ers. The closeted-when-it-mattered bisexual and the male stripper. The‚Ä¶.acquaintances? Friends? Lovers? No, lover was saved for her and her fianc√©e. Mike did not cross that boundary. They talked briefly. Actually, they didn't talk. She disappointed as he tried to hide under that grimace of macho-ality. It wasn't supposed to be like this. Glasses clinked, the warm ambiance of the place intensified the heat of couples at neighboring tables, neo-jazz-funk infiltrated the pores of every listener. And here she was \"breaking up\" with a guy who had no right to make her feel guilty, no right to play with her emotions like this. He knew it too. When did this become so complicated? Oh yeah. Sheila slept at her side, Latina curves and all. Ha! She remembered her name this time‚Ä¶probably because she was cuter than usual‚Ä¶Mike did a good job picking her. He was really getting in tune with her wants, and she with his. Red-lighted numbers flashed in her periphery, and lazy eyes found the time: 5:28 a.m. Hm. She could either lie in bed with a complete stranger for the next hour and a half or snoop around his place. The latter was definitely more interesting. She rolled out of bed, threw on a loosely buttoned dress-shirt and panties, slipped into the corridors of his domain. No family pictures on a table in the foyer or hanging on walls or anywhere, really. But there was a lot of junk. Not the kind strewn about carelessly, but the kind where everything had its rightful place for use in the future. She found an apple on the counter. Took a bite, sat on a barstool, took in the room. It was beachy, but with a modernist perspective. Funny, Mike didn't seem like the kind of guy to really pay attention to that stuff‚Ä¶. \"Hey, what's up?\" She pretended her heart didn't just leap into her throat from surprise. Turned casually. \"Oh, just checking out what I can fit into my car‚Ä¶I think I'll take this stool for starters, then make off with the Xbox.\" \"You're funny.\" Deadpan followed by a slight curl in the lips. Classic Mike. \"I try. Sometimes.\" \"Yeah well, you should try more often.\" Oh boy. Were they actually establishing a viable conversation that could be recalled at later dates as a fun-filled hour of bonding? She couldn't let it happen. She had commitments. \"Uh, I think I'll actually head out now. Can I take this apple?\" She stood. He walked over. \"What, no round two with‚Ä¶...Goddamn‚Ä¶\" \"Sheila.\" \"Right. Yeah. Sheila.\" \"I'll pass‚Ä¶..where did you throw my pants?\" \"I think Sheila was the one who‚Ä¶.no, wait‚Ä¶.yeah, it was Sheila who threw them off the loft.\" \"I'm just gonna fetch those then‚Ä¶\" \"Are you sure you don't want anything to drink? I can make smoothies or something‚Ä¶\" Shoot, he was actually trying to force her into a conversation of some sort. And breakfast? This guy was acting as if he was really new to the booty-call concept. She declined to accept his smoothie offer, opting to search for her pants instead. They were crumpled beneath a side table, and she slipped them on. She felt him watching her. And then it became that awkward moment when she couldn't put her pants on correctly without hopping around like a toddler. \"You need some help, Jo?\" \"Sure, how about you smack my patootie as I walk out, ensuring that everything's on all snug?\" \"Ouch, girl, why so sassy? And patootie...wow.\" He was still smiling. This kid's optimism, while refreshing, was the probable cause of her \"sass.\" \"Well, normally what happens is I call you or you call me, we have sex, and then I leave. But for some reason, your little pebble of a brain wants to take this set-up further, possibly to the point where we're staying up after the sex and chatting like tweens at a sleepover. So now I'm wondering, do you need a refresher of the ground rules?\" \"Well, Joel said you were chatty, and I figured it would be nice to actually get to know who I'm banging‚Ä¶.you know, find out if you have STD's or if you're a serial killer or something.\" Humorous. She'd give him that. \"Alright. Fine. I'll let you slide this once-\" She found her shoes. \"-but next time, if you try to start a conversation I'll just leave.\" \"A'ight. I got you.\" He held the door open as she grabbed the remnants of the apple and strode out. He did a quick salute-wave combo. \"See you soon.\" She had to laugh at that comment and his waving maneuver. \"Ha‚Ä¶.Bye.\" Maybe it wasn't too bad to talk a bit, if only to keep herself entertained the morning after. Watching him walk out of the restaurant was more than a little sad. In fact, she was a little scared he'd do something stupid‚Ä¶there was just this look he had when he turned away‚Ä¶ Her fianc√©e returned, all charm. \"What was that about, babe?\" \"Just a friend‚Ä¶.I guess I forgot to tell him about the engagement‚Ä¶\" He didn't know she knew about his job. It was after their sixth \"session\" that her friends convinced her to go to this club on 6th avenue where they would all have a \"rockin' time.\"‚Ä¶she really needed new friends. The entrance was cheesy as hell, but she gave her friends the benefit of the doubt and stepped into a room of booming music and sweaty bodies. Everyone was screaming and it didn't take long for her to realize why. A guy was stripping on a low stage, tearing clothes off while simultaneously humping the ground. Just the sight began the quick cycle of horniness. The stripper moved perfectly with the music, swaying his hips, sweat glistening on perfect shoulders, pecs flexing, cash falling from his underwear band. While Jo put on a mask of disapproval, she had to admit, it did turn her on a bit. She wasn't that high-brow where she couldn't enjoy herself a couple strippers. Heck, she'd hired some for her roommate in college. Of course, they were female strippers back then‚Ä¶this male stripping thing was completely new to her. The announcer called out another name. Jo immediately froze. A hoodied white boy sauntered on stage, nodding his head to the beat‚Ä¶..and then he ripped everything off as his body went crazy. Smooth. Very smooth. Just like at his place‚Ä¶. God he was sexy. She fumbled through her purse, searching for her phone. The routine ended, and immediately she called the number. He picked up, breathless. \"Hello?\" \"Hi, Mike‚Ä¶.how about my place in thirty?\" \"Uh, actually, I'm working‚Ä¶.I can do in three hours though.\" Too long. She was horny now. \"How about I meet you somewhere on your break?\" Please say yes. Images of his pelvis and his perfectly rotund backside flashed before her eyes. \"You know what, I'll just meet you at your place now. I can get someone to cover for me.\" That night she enjoyed him all to herself, not even bothering to call‚Ä¶..whats-her-face‚Ä¶.Damn she forgot the name... The next morning, she didn't mind staying a little longer, trying to figure out more about this easygoing guy who commanded the stage. Yep. We'll see if I feel like continuing. Reviews/criticism are always welcome (especially criticism, please) :][Chapter 2] Thanks to those who reviewed, I'm starting to get a bit more interested in the characters now that I've had more time to sort my thoughts on this story... He spotted Jo sidling over. \"Hey, I didn't expect to see you here.\" He was surprised and, he admitted to himself, glad she was there to liven up the party. He introduced her to Brooke but kept his relationship to both women under wraps‚Ä¶..didn't know why he did that. Oh wait, it was because he didn't want to seem like the tool who used women for sex. Didn't want to explain that it was mutual. Or that he enjoyed far more than the sex. He went to get some beers, leaving the two women behind. The breeze was nice, offsetting the humidity. No one else was really around the coolers, too busy prepping the pontoon. But then there was a tap on his shoulder, breaking the solitude. \"You didn't think you could leave that quickly, did you?\" Okay. That was just a little unexpected. But she didn't have to know that. *grin* \"Naw, course not. What's up?\" \"I was just thinking of doing something tomorrow‚Ä¶your place?\" That was a little too quick. \"You know, normally a conversation starts with 'I'm doing fine, and you?' and then we talk about the states of our lives, and then about something controversial like politics, and then about how much we hate the people here, and then food, and then we settle on sleeping with each other. At least, that's how I talk to my bros.\" Followed by a wink, he knew he could get a reaction out of her. A slight frown. \"Something wrong? You seem a little on edge, even though you look like you should be completely relaxed.\" \"What do you mean by look? I'm good.\" What in the hell was she talking about‚Ä¶? Maybe he shouldn't have gotten her worked up‚Ä¶ \"Well look at you. You're at a party with a girl, who is very cute I gotta say, you're wearing beach-y swim trunks, you've got two beers, and you're surrounded by cool people, aka me. But for some reason, you jump on me when I ask about our mutual craving.\" \"Hey, I'm not a sex demon if that's what you're saying‚Ä¶..and you noticed the trunks? I picked them out myself.\" \"Did you know your defense mechanism is humor?\" \"Yes.\" \"And that it's infuriating?\" \"I hope so.\" Damn the way that sarong hugged her hips. She may not be as naked as the other girls there, but she definitely had an edge over them‚Ä¶.she allowed more for the imagination. Distracting. She paused for a good ten seconds. He looked over to where Brooke sat. He had to admit, Jo was right about his craving for sex‚Ä¶.but not to the point where he couldn't have a decent conversation without bringing it up. \"God, you would think I could deal with you‚Ä¶.\" She shook her fedora-ed head and chuckled half-heartedly at the ground. \"Maybe if we started this day over you could invent a way to handle me. Hi Jo! I didn't expect to see you here.\" She smiled then. And it was gorgeous. \"Hey Mike‚Ä¶So how about that presidential campaign?\" The little things made her different. Not just the forever-reprimanding tone, the non-legginess, the unstyled medium-length hair, or even the insistence to always be on top. Granted, not all her differences were positive‚Ä¶but a good amount were. He watched lazily as she got dressed. Ironically, this was his favorite part of the post-session ritual. Not the too-short conversations, or the mini-meals in the kitchen, or the goodbyes with promises of more to come. The way a girl put on her clothes showed her character more than anything else. This was ironic seeing as how Mike took his off for a living‚Ä¶.but that showed his character as well‚Ä¶.and lots of it ;) There were the girls who would shamefully sneak into the bathroom when they thought he was asleep, either new to the one-night stands or uncomfortable with their bodies once off the sex-high. Others slinkily slipped into tight jeans and tanks, more than hinting they wanted more. And still others threw on whatever they could find on the floor and skipped out like it was all in a day's work. Jo was basically the embodiment of the latter. Only when he stopped her with conversation or forced her to eat some fruit did she stay longer than necessary. He didn't get it. She was the most constant \"buddy\" he'd had since‚Ä¶ever‚Ä¶and yet he knew practically nothing about her. And it wasn't like he didn't try. He tried like it was his job. Because her droll sense of humor was refreshing from the screaming fangirls. Because while not drop-dead stunning she had an attitude to smack him around whenever she felt like it. Because she was, no matter how she opposed it, his friend. \"I haven't seen Vanessa around in a while.\" She looked up from putting on sandals, blowing hair out of her face. \"You didn't know she got herself a man?\" \"Seriously? Bro, no one ever tells me anything 'bout their relationships.\" \"Hmph. Do I look like a bro to you?\" A skeptical smile as she sat on the edge of the bed. He was still nude, \"airing out.\" She unbuttoned her collared shirt to expose herself. \"Do these look like they'd belong to a bro? I'm offended.\" She buttoned back up, grinned, and proceeded to the kitchen. He called out as she opened the fridge. \"Not your boobs, girl‚Ä¶it was the grunting that threw me off-\" He heard her scoff, then continued \"-How'd you find out about Vanessa anyway?\" \"I called and her husband answered.\" \"Damn that was quick...makes you wonder about your own relationships.\" Oops. He covered his face with both hands, trying to wipe away the drowsiness, prepping for the barrage of \"ground rules\" to be repeated yet again. Second time that month. He was getting worse at watching what he said around her. At getting too close. Movement ceased in the kitchen. He heard her set a bowl, probably filled with cereal (no milk), down on the counter. She stepped in, stopped at the doorframe and leaned against it, one hand on her hip. Laid her head on the frame. Sighed. \"Mike, you know we don't talk about that stuff.\" \"Yeah yeah‚Ä¶.I gotchu.\" He stood and put on a pair of briefs. She Jerked her thumb in the direction of the front door. \"I think I'm just gonna go. I'll see you around, alright?\" \"Wait, hold up. You've still got cereal sitting there. And you know I don't eat that stuff. It's for all guests only.\" Oh boy. Now she was really going to lay in on him, he could see it in the way she positioned herself, now both hands on the hips, legs shoulder-length apart, eyebrows set low. \"Tell me something, Mike. If it's for all guests, how come I'm the only one who eats it?‚Ä¶Why is it my favorite brand of cereal? Why is it in the cabinet for your stuff only?\" \"I'm impressed you know that's my personal cabinet. You must swing by here often.\" Try to put her at ease. Calm her down. \"Stop it.\" That's it. She had no right, especially in his Goddamn house. \"No, you stop. You're a great person, but I can't stand this. I know we have rules, but can't we just be friends? You've got to admit you like visiting my place for more than the sex. My boyish good looks mixed with my charisma have gotta work on you somehow, or else you would've found another boy toy by now, considering all the mistakes I've made and all the lines I've crossed.\" The silence after was more than a little awkward. She sized him up then, taking in his steady gaze. He inwardly commended her for keeping eye contact as opposed to letting her eyes wander. He commended himself for doing the same. \"Fine.\" Woah. That was a first. She took powerful strides over to him and pushed him back onto the bed. \"But let's make this last time good, 'cause I'm going to miss this body once we become real friends.\" \"Huh?-\" She kissed him angrily, found the band of his briefs with her thumb. Climbed on top of him. \"Wait-\" \"What? Don't you want to be 'friends'?\" His briefs were slipping off. \"Hey, stop.\" He shoved her off, rolled on top of her, pinned her down. \"Let me clarify‚Ä¶..friends with benefits. This won't be our 'last time'.\" She was breathing heavily‚Ä¶.and then a smile at his phrase-change, a raised eyebrow. \"As you wish.\" She glanced down his body length. \"Someone else likes our little understanding too.\" He gave her the signature grin combined with the almost-squinted eyes (his smolder). This time he was the one to take the clothes off. Let me know when cheesiness starts to be an issue...and til then, please review and critique![Chapter 3] Troubled emotions are always fun to write...Enjoy. Jo read the text again as she pulled into the driveway. 'We need to talk.' The screen glowed just enough for her to discern the message without turning on the car's lights. She was impressed Mike didn't resort to shorthand when texting‚Ä¶she would've assumed he had a limited plan‚Ä¶but then again, his income was substantial enough to-God, why was she even analyzing his texting technique/phone-plan status? ‚Ä¶she was guilty and nervous as hell. She shouldn't have even agreed to meet at his place‚Ä¶it gave him too much power, no matter how many times she'd been there. And she'd been there a lot. She turned off the car. Sat for a while. Readied herself for the inevitably terrible confrontation and explanation. No number of years in school could prep her for hurting Mike like she was about to hurt him. She was the one training to help people deal with pain in their lives, for God's sake. But wait. It was his fault, remember? They'd established at the very beginning how their relationship was supposed to go. No emotions. Maybe a sarcastic comment here and there, but no bonding‚Ä¶..at least until they became friends. Then there was the good, long \"session\" right after‚Ä¶ Shake it off. Look at the ring. The beautiful rock-on-silver. Reassurance achieved. Confidence back. She was in control. She reminded herself that he brought it all upon himself, making her open up, exposing his own thoughts‚Ä¶. He opened the door she'd unlocked especially for him, walked through the house until he found her in the living room. She stood as he approached. \"That was qui-\" He cut her off with a look and she halted. Something was up. \"Mike? What's wrong.\" \"Nothing, let's just get at it.\" He ripped off his tie and started fumbling with the buttons at his collar. But then he changed his mind and went to her instead, crushing her mouth in a painful lip-lock. Her mind went into panic mode. This was not what she'd called for, and right now this was not consensual. At all. Mike was a big guy‚Ä¶..she couldn't possibly push him off‚Ä¶ He sensed her anxiety. Stopped. She pushed him away as forcefully as she could. \"Hey, you wanna do this or what!?\" \"No, not if you're going to be an ass.\" He shook his head, frustrated, disgusted. \"I don't know what you're talking about‚Ä¶..fine, y'know what? I'm outta here.\" He reached for his tie. Wait, his tie‚Ä¶.oh no‚Ä¶she should've realized‚Ä¶ \"Mike‚Ä¶.hold on.\" She reached out to him even as her mind screamed not to get involved. He took a deep breath and leveled his dull gaze with her insistent one. \"Do you‚Ä¶want to talk‚Ä¶?\" He shook his head in resignation and turned away. Shoot, that wasn't the right thing to say. He'd probably heard that already from everyone else that day. \"Sorry, let me rephrase. Sit your butt down.\" He faced her again, but was still so angry. God, what happened at the bank? \"Hey, if you thought you could come into my house and just expect to have your way with me, you thought wrong. Now look, here's a comfy couch you hardass‚Ä¶.sit.\" Like a dog he obeyed, slumping into the cushions, eventually leaning forward with his elbows on his knees, staring at nothing. She sighed and went to the kitchen, filled two glasses with water. She assumed he'd already had his fair share of alcohol‚Ä¶or drugs‚Ä¶or both. Made her way back to the living room with the two glasses. This was not what she'd had in mind when she texted him to come over. She set the glasses on the coffee table and curled up opposite him on the armchair. \"Jo, I'm not gonna waste any more of your time. I've got Joel and Sheila on speed-dial if you want me to call them up.\" How she wanted him to call those numbers and get out of her house, but‚Ä¶ \"‚Ä¶.No. Tell me what happened at the bank.\" She hoped this was the right choice. He picked up a glass and stared into the water, struggling with what he wanted to say. \"Naw it's not just that‚Ä¶it's‚Ä¶The Kid and Brooke and‚Ä¶.God, life is just kicking me in the balls.\" Shoot. Of course he had to choose now to feel sorry for himself. What Mike didn't know was that she had texted him to come over so they could have their last fling before she told him about her all-too-new engagement. Of course now she couldn't tell him. \"Well‚Ä¶it's gonna take a bigger kick to get those balls to respond...trust me, I know.\" Hopefully a response‚Ä¶ He downed the glass of water. Sat up straight. \"Yeah well...I guess you weren't really expecting this, huh?\" Gave her a sorry smile, like a sad puppy. She was going to do it. She had to. Or else \"friends\" would just be a title, and she couldn't deal with that. \"It's‚Ä¶fine. Really, it is. Talk to me.\" He did. Shared his story of the day, of the prim woman who had to tell him, yet again, that the kickstart to his dream was \"not quite ready yet.\" Shared his story of his career, how he got into dancing as a kid and how that eventually turned into stripping once Dallas got mixed in. Shared his story of The Kid, how he felt like he'd messed up a life, been too quick to judge the potential in The Kid's character. And Jo sat and listened, eventually moseying over to the couch and sitting next to him‚Ä¶comforting when necessary‚Ä¶inserting biting remarks here and there‚Ä¶it was two hours of what would normally be twenty seconds of a rom-com. And then he asked her a few questions. She steeled herself for it, but after two hours of breaking down her defenses, he had her where he wanted her. She answered questions, tersely at first‚Ä¶and then with ease. Another hour. He stood, knew it was time to go. They didn't know what to do then. A handshake? A pat on the back? A hug? He half-saluted with a grin. She threw his tie at him. He walked out the door. She watched him leave. They were sober the entire time. And she had broken so many rules. Now it was complicated. She knocked on the door, hoped he wouldn't answer. \"It's unlocked!\" Found him in the kitchen pouring juice. She hated juice. Just another thing to hate about the situation. He didn't look up as he sipped it. Yes. He sipped it. How ironic. \"So‚Ä¶how long you two been engaged? It should be common knowledge, but you know, no one ever tells me 'bout their relationships.\" \"Maybe around three to four months‚Ä¶.\" He looked perplexed for an instant before concluding, \"And we've been seeing each other for about a year‚Ä¶including the past three to four months.\" \"I'm surprised you kept track.\" His look hardened, not the response she was looking for. \"I'm surprised you didn't tell me a couple months ago.\" Exasperation now, combined with wanting to get the whole thing over with. \"Mike, you were upset about not getting a loan and-\" \"Hey, I didn't ask for pity or excuses. I want to get some truth out of this.\" Annoyance. \"Well if you keep interrupting me we're not going anywhere.\" And so they stood. Glare versus fiery glare. He broke first, closing his eyes and tilting his head up to the ceiling, sighing. \"Geez, Jo, why didn't you just tell me. That was months ago. We've seen each other dozens of times since then.\" \"Well, I reasoned that‚Ä¶that‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶\" Why didn't she? Where was the speech she'd so prudently prepared? Oh yeah, that went out the window once Mike took control of the conversation first. \"Come on, girl, you can do it.\" Amusingly, it was she who played the part of the pet in need of coaxing as opposed to him playing the loyal dog. Interesting switch-eroo. \"No, please, insult me more. That'll definitely make me want to talk to you.\" The reprimand affected him slightly, just enough to make him feel an ounce of shame. But then he banished that new feeling with conviction as he stated, \"But Jo, shouldn't I be the one reluctant to talk to you, considering you lied to me , and broke my only rule? Which is, by the way, in case you forgot, I don't bang anyone who's in a real relationship .\" Yeah‚Ä¶.about that‚Ä¶.she should leave. Just turn around and go. Should've just deleted him off her contacts the moment he found her in the restaurant‚Ä¶Well, she was never going to see him ever again anyways, might as well get her act together and spit everything out‚Ä¶ I wanted to have more of a chapter dedicated to the next part of their conversation as well as fill in another hole or two in their story...so sorry for cutting this off so short. Reviews are appreciated (mainly about sentence fragmenting...I'm trying out this style of picking up the pace of stories with intentionally short sentences...feedback?) ","Summary":" While I'm not normally one to write present-day stories, Joanna seemed like too cool of a character"},{"Movie":"Marx Brothers","Title":"The Marx Brothers","Author":"Miss Mello","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7152287","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The Marx Brothers.. Legends among comedy and true comedians. I resently reread Harpo's book Harpo Speaks! and I got myself into a whole Marx Brothers obsession. That and too much homework, is the reason I haven't been updating on my Harry Potter story for a while, but don't you worry, few fans! I'm working on the next chapter on that one too. Well here is a Marx Brother fanfic, perfectly readable without any knowledge of the Marx Brothers (even though in my opinion everyone should know and love the Marx Brothers) and I hope even slightly humorish (: Next to that it might be good to know that the Marx Brothers are with the five of them; Harpo (from who's point of view it's written - with his autobiography as standard and example), origionally called Adolph (even though he changed his name to Arthur during the Great War, because it sounded too German), Chico, first Leonard, Groucho, or Julius, Gummo, Milton and last but not least Zeppo, or Herbert. Harpo said in his book that those stagenames were more their names than those given with birth, so they call themselves that. And so do I now. Oh and important for those who don't know them; The Marx Brothers were them brothers (Harpo Marx, Chico Marx, Groucho Marx, Gummo Marx, Zeppo Marx) and they were very famous in those times (thirties). Gummo and Zeppo never liked showbizz so Gummo never even joined them on Broadway, before the movies and Zeppo quit with the movies as soon as his Paramount contract ran out, but the remaining three stayed shining years after. They were all wellknown for being funny and stuff blabla, just read okay? Next to that; Enjoy! *EDIT* I don't think this was clear enough: Molly Padlock, the girl that drops in, so it won't just be a Marx Brothers biography (because that way you'd better read the real ones; they're hilarious.. It makes me wish for a life like that), is thought up by me! SHE ISN'T REAL AND PROBABLY NEVER LIVED! okay.. Chapter 1 As long as I can remember Molly Padlock was our friend. I know we all just met her when she was about thirteen and myself only just turned twelve, but for some reason she always felt as part of the family. I was born in the lower east side of New York, a neighbourhood with a lot of different nationalities. We ourselves were German Jews, with our own little street that was our territory, but you also had nationalities that had territories a lot larger than our own, which was only our own because we lived there. Molly lived in the Irish part of the neighbourhood, along with the Italian the biggest around. Chico knew how to get through, like he always did. He was a master of imitation and just pretended to be an Italian by imitating the accent, when he wanted to pass to another part of town or use one of their poolrooms. I didn't have such luck. I always had half decent tennis balls with me or rings made out of horsehair, because you could sell those for a nickel and were therefor worth money. When you were caught by an enemy gang you could exchange those for your freedom, without getting beaten up too much. It was also with Chico when I first met Molly. We were on our way to a friend of Chico's because Chico wanted to collect some dough the bloke still owned him from a game of pinochle earlier the month. Suddenly we were surrounded. Big kids, with pale skins and a lot of freckles had come out of apartment buildings, some holding baseball bats but all of them looking tough. I moved a little closer to Chico, standing straight and Chico put up a sure face, which wasn't so hard, because that was what he always looked like. 'Hey-a, you!' Apparently the leader of the group of about half a dozen said. He was even bigger and meaner-looking than the others and had short, messy red hair. 'So, you two think you can just invade without us noticing, heah?' He asked Chico, not even bothering to look at me, as I was hovering behind him. Chico slipped into his role perfectly. 'Invade you say?' he said in a flawless Irish accent. The leader of the Irish gang that surrounded us frowned. ' You are Irish?' He asked Chico. Chico frowned back at him. 'What made you think we weren't?' The redheaded boy ignored it and said to his pals; 'Never mind. We'll have to wait for others.' They all groaned and turned around, disappointed that they couldn't beat a few nickels out of us. The leader sighed, looking after his fellows and then looked at us. 'Are you really Irish?' He asked, biting his bottom lip. Chico smiled pleasantly. 'I wouldn't say no.' For a few seconds the leader looked at Chico blankly but then he started laughing. Like laughing really loud . It was also that moment that I noticed a lot smaller girl standing behind the boy. She was just a little taller than I was, probably about the same height as Chico and she was staring at him with narrowed eyes. I looked at Chico, about to nudge him, to make him aware of her staring at her, but I saw that he had already noticed her, as he was looking at her with raised eyebrows. The gang leader seemed to notice our concentration lapse, because he looked around him and saw the girl standing. 'Molle!' ‚Äì he yelled. Chico and I both bit our lips, because we both agreed on the idea that it wasn't very elegant to be called a mole. The mole didn't pay any attention to the leader, whose face was getting pretty red, but stayed looking at the two of us, some kind of weird fascination in her eyes. She was pretty enough I guess, as far as thirteen year old girls can be really pretty, as she had red hair, that was braided into one long braid. She wore saggy clothes, quite clear hand-me-downs and it were all men clothes. Only her skirt, Scottish print and socks, white-ish with lace on top, appeared to be sort of new and real girls clothing. I noticed Chico throwing a sideways glance at me and I answered his confused face by raising my shoulders. 'Molly!' The gang leader yelled again, this time catching her attention, as her head snapped up towards him. I suddenly saw how much they looked alike. Both red hair and a slim and lean build and their nose bridge covered in freckles. 'What?' She asked, already looking bored, her hands in the pockets of the far too large men's jacket. The boy looked really angry. 'I told you not to follow me anymore. You're too little for stuff like this ‚Äì you'll get yourself hurt. Just stay home with ma and nobody will touch you.' On the moment he said that, I knew he couldn't have said something worse. The face of the girl first didn't change at all, then she narrowed her eyes and got her hands, balled into fists, out of her pockets and just stood there, looking up to the leader of the gang, the gang that was fighting over a few cigarettes down the street. 'Patrick, houd je mond dicht, als je niet weet wat je er mee moet.' She said and even though I didn't understand a word of it, I knew it was something pretty bad, because her brother (I just decided it had to be her brother) went to sit on his knees in front of her and grab both her arms tightly, shaking her. They apparently had completely forgot about us. 'I told you! I don't want to hear that wretched language anymore! We live in New York! They speak English here!' I was a bit confused by that, because didn't they also in Ireland? That moment Chico pulled my sleeve and made it clear to me it was better to leave now, before problems could be shoved upon us. Chico was silent while walking, what was unusual for him, but I had thoughts to worry about for myself, so I didn't question him. 'Leonard?' I asked, because that was his name before he became Chico. 'Mmh?' He answered. I was silent for a few seconds, not wanting to sound stupid, but always sounding stupid towards Chico. 'Do they talk English in Ireland?' Chico began to chuckle. 'Of course they do, zit-face. They just aren't Irish. That's why that guy was being so paranoid. He wants to be the leader of an Irish gang, but isn't Irish himself; if his fellows find out, he's dead. He lied pretty bad.' 'Oh..' I said. It was silent again, until we reached the house of the friend of Chico. We knocked the door, but there was no answer. Chico backed up a bit, looking up to the building. He put his hands around his mouth and screamed; 'ROY, GET THE HELL OUTTA THERE!' Up at the top floor a curtain moved and not ten seconds later the bolts were taken off the door and two untrusting eyes peaked through. When he saw it was really Chico he opened it a bit wider, but still not all the way. 'Good to see you, Marx.' He said to Chico. He looked at me. 'Little brother?' He asked me and I nodded. Chico ignored it. 'Forget him,' he said, shoving me aside. 'you owe me money, Roy. You said by the end of the month, so here I am.' Roy tried to close the door, but Chico put his foot between the door, before it could lock. 'Oh no, Roy!' he said, pushing against the door and forcing Roy to open it all the way. 'I won't leave without my twenty bucks.' Roy gave up and opened the door, leaning against it. 'I'm sorry Leonard, I don't have it. This Italian gang robbed me last week. Robbed me from every cent I had.' He said. Chico looked at him with narrowed eyes, not sure if to believe him or not. 'An Italian gang..?' He asked, as if to taste the words. Roy nodded infuriated. 'Yes! They even got my shoes.' He said, showing him his bare feet. Chico frowned. 'Well, since you can't pay me with money, I guess you'll just have to pay me otherwise, heah?' Roy stood up straight, a puzzled look on his features. Chico looked about the room. It was a dark and small room, one window, but blinded and a very big closet, made of wood. Chico walked in the house, towards the closet and opened its doors. Roy protested. 'Hey, you can't just come in! I didn't! Wait, this is all highly inappropriate!' Chico shushed him and took a big hat with feathers out of the closet. 'What do you think, Adolph?' he said, addressing me, because I was named Adolph when I was a kid. 'Is this worth a couple of tens?' Before I could say anything, Chico had thrown it back in, muttering; 'Nah, don't think so.' After rummaging through the entire structure, he found a cupper coloured watch. He looked at it, made sure it was still working, inspected it on flaws and then pocketed it satisfied. He came to stand next to me again, clapping Roy on the shoulder. 'I don't think I'll get a full twenty for it, but I'll just say your debt is paid. You already had enough pain caused by those scary Italian folks.' Roy made a last weak attempt to save the watch. 'It's my dads and I don't think he'll appreciate it if you..' He trailed of when he saw Chico's patronizing look. 'Goodbye Roy; I'll hope you'll get yourself a new pair of shoes soon. Try looking through dumpsters ‚Äì you find plenty of shoes in there.' Chico said, while walking away, me jogging after him. The door banged closed and Chico began to laugh loudly. I let him laugh, but, just before we came home I needed to ask him the question. 'Leonard..?' I asked. 'Mmh?' He answered. 'Why did you take the watch when he had such a hard time.. We know what he's going through..' Chico stopped and I stopped too. He put his hand on my head, ruffling my hair, smiling happily. 'Adolph, you're far too good.' Was the only thing he said to me, before he ran up the stairs to be greeted by Gummo screaming to Zeppo and Groucho muttering about \"all the bloody noise we all made\". It wasn't till years later when he finally told me that he knew that Roy had lied, because it wasn't the Italian gang that had stolen his shoes along with his money, but that it was himself, while playing their game of pinochle. Apparently Roy had fallen asleep during the game, so Chico and the other players had re-shuffled the cards and Chico had stolen his shoes, before they woke him up. The first meeting with Molly was a very brief one, but one that couldn't leave me alone. Every time when I went to sleep, I thought about the intense way she looked at you, two sparkling grey eyes that punched you in the face. At dinner I noticed myself drifting away from conversation, hearing her speak in that foreign, kind of aggressive sounding, language and I caught myself dreaming about the country she could be from and imagining it to be the island where Robinson Crusoe stranded, in the book we read at school, years ago, before I left. But still. As much as it fascinated me, it seemed like Chico was obsessed with it. At night, when only the two of us were still awake and I was starting to fall asleep too, he would nudge me in the ribs. 'Adolph?' He asked. I would murmur some kind of incoherent answer, something that could mean either \"yes\" or \"no\", but it didn't seem to matter for him, since he would proceed anyway. 'That language she spoke.. It really seems familiar to me. I could swear I heard it before, but where !' He would curse a lot and then call me crazy when I was still listening. Chico once slipped up while eating dinner, a rare occasion for Chico. It was a night with a lot of Relatives staying over for dinner. Relatives didn't mean they were related to us in any way; it just meant that they knew Mum and Dad well enough to know Dad was an amazing cook and that no one of us, even when we barely had enough food for ourselves, minded people sitting in. Dad, named Samuel, but called Frenchie for most of the time, had made a soup. I didn't know how he did it, because the only edible things in the house as far as I knew were a couple of onions, the cabbages Groucho got from Mr Hammond as thanks for bringing his dog back (even though Gummo had stolen it ‚Äì but Mr Hammond didn't knew that) and one very old bread, that no one dared to touch when Chico said he was hungry and Mum said we could have the bread. However, there was soup and everybody was asking for seconds, even though there was nothing left. Zeppo, the youngest of us had already disappeared from the tables sight. Gummo was biting his nails, while intently looking at Dad talking to one of the Relatives. Groucho was busy with pretending he understood everything the grownups said, nodding every now and then and laughing when one of them laughed. Chico however, was listening to the conversation of Grandpa to one of the Relatives. And I say to deliberately. Grandpa lives with us, but only because he couldn't provide for himself anymore in Germany. We were all born here in New York, but Mum and Dad both moved here. They learned English and talked English, except with the German people in the street. Grandpa didn't though. He talked Plattdeutsch with and to everyone, not really caring if someone understood it or not. The only reason I'm able to understand it is because when I stopped school when I was eight, I had a lot of time on my hands, so I started hanging out with Grandpa for long periods of times. I soon learned it was no use trying to learn him English so instead just began learning German. I don't remember what he was talking about, but I did remember Chico's look of immense concentration while listening to it. Suddenly he sprang up. Normally no one would have noticed, since there was always a lot of noise around the table, with people laughing, yelling and for some maybe, too much movement, but Chico knocked his bowl from the table, spilling the last bits of cabbage that he had still left. He looked down at his feet, where the pieces of cabbage lay and then up again. 'Leonard, for God's sake boy, can't you sit still for one second?' Mum said, standing up herself, hurrying for the kitchen to get something to wipe it up. Leonard sat down again, folding his legs underneath him, so Mum could reach the cabbage better with the wet towel she brought. 'Such a waste.' One of the Relatives said. 'It really tasted great.' Conversation flared up again and no one paid any attention to Chico again and Chico did nothing to gain it, what was a miracle on itself, but I didn't lost sight of him till bedtime, even when Dad found Zeppo sleeping underneath the table and everyone started to compliment him on his cute little boy so loudly Zeppo woke up and started yelling. We were already in bed when I finally got the chance to ask Chico about what was wrong. All of us brothers slept in the same bed and it was fighting for your place. Chico had his part of the bed, because he was the oldest and the biggest. I most of the time made sure I had a spot too, but was (and still am) a big softy and really unable to act up when Groucho, Gummo or Zeppo would push me away. 'Leonard?' I asked. I knew the others already slept, but Leonard was mostly unable to sleep till deep in the night. 'What is it?' He answered, sitting upright, kicking the blankets away. I kept laying down. 'What was that during dinner? You were just listening to Grandpa and out of nowhere you freaked out.' Even though it was dark, I knew Chico raised his eyebrows. 'I did not freak out.' He said defensively. I kept silent, hoping he would proceed by himself, but he didn't. 'But what was it then?' I asked after a while. Chico let himself fall down again, making me and the others wobble on the bed. I heard Groucho roll over, squashing Gummo in the process, but they were both so vast asleep that they didn't notice. 'You know that I recognized the language that girl was speaking, right?' I didn't tell him that it was impossible to not know, since he speculated about it every night, but just nodded. 'Well, I now know where I recognized it from.' He said, triumph shining through his tone of words. 'You do?' I asked. 'So what language is it?' I could see his teeth shine in the little light that shone through the windows, when he bit his lip. 'I don't know. I just know it sounds like German.' I couldn't help than to be a bit disappointed by that conclusion. 'So you still don't know what language she was speaking?' He made an annoyed noise. 'It could be German.' I shook my head. 'We would have understood German.' He chuckled. 'Not necessarily. Grandpa speaks a whole other dialect of German than them Germans do in down in Yorkville. It could just as well be German, but another kind of German.' He said. 'Okay, that's true I guess.' I said, hesitantly. It was silent for a long time and I slowly felt myself losing my sight of reality, so I'm not sure if Chico really whispered; 'I just wish I could see her again.' We did see her again. Not two weeks after that night, Chico came home covered in bruises, grinning like a madman. Mum was unfazed about it. She washed him up, not asking what happened, because it was hardly the first time Chico got into a fight. She slapped him on the back of the head when he left the living room and his grin widened. He took me aside that afternoon, when everyone was minding their own business. 'Adolph, I saw her again!' He said. It took me a few seconds to realize he talked about Molly. 'You did?' I asked him. 'The Mole you mean?' He snickered and I felt strangely proud to make my big brother laugh. 'Yes, \"The Mole\".' He answered, emphasizing his words. 'She's called Molly though. I saw her walk into this apartment building, so I asked one of the gals in the street about her. She was happy to help me fortunately. She's called Molly Padlock, she's thirteen or fourteen and moved here with her family from Europe a few months ago.' I frowned. 'And that girl could tell you all this?' Chico shrugged. 'She goes to the same school.' I nodded. 'But why did she tell you all this? I mean, you're kind of a stranger, aren't you?' Chico looked the other way. 'Let's just say I already knew her.' I began to get curious. 'You did? From where?' Chico seemed hesitant to answer, looking at me as if to size me up and I unconsciously sat up straighter, wanting to make a good impression on him. Apparently I passed the test, because he leaned back and said; 'We got together once at the poolroom behind Mr Gookie's cigar shop and she hoped to go over the, uhm, experience again.' My first reaction was; 'Ew, girls are gross!' Chico smiled. 'Yes, Adolph, they are and I take every advantage of it that I can possibly take.' He was long gone before I got that one. That night, when we were ordered to bed by Mum, Chico lightened a candle and told all of us a little ghost story, while sitting in the bed. None of us wanted to know about the ghost story though. 'But Leonard!' Gummo said, yanking at Chico's sleeve, almost making him drop the candle. 'Tell us about your fight. You fought didn't you? Don't lie, I know you fought!' he said and he began to hop up and down excitedly. 'A gorilla could tell he had a fight.' Groucho said, eyeing Chico's bruises and black eye. 'Or maybe see him as a possible mating conquest, as you look like one right now. I bet you are quite an attractive gorilla, Leonard!' A few snickers went through the circle, but it became quiet soon again. We all watched Chico expectantly. Chico took the liberty of testing our patience and only when Zeppo looked like he was about to burst of curiosity, he said, in a soft and whispery voice; 'This afternoon, just before I came home, I was talking to this girl at Lexington Avenue.' I immediately knew he was talking about the girl who told him about Molly. 'She was telling me about this other girl, when one of the brothers of the girl she was telling me about walked by. He heard us and wanted to know what we were talking about.' Zeppo looked like he was about to bite his tongue off, looking up to Chico with wide eyes. Gummo's face I couldn't see, but I saw his tense shoulders, ready to cheer when Chico would throw a hit and Groucho was smiling with his mouth opened. The little nine year old bookworm might thought poker and pinochle and other games of chance that Chico liked were childish, but he loved hearing about Chico's fights. I can't say I was any different. 'I told him that he should stick to his own business, but he got mad and whistled and suddenly five other hulky guys, that looked just like him, were by his side. What-a you think? The girl we were talking about had six brothers! And they were all mad at me!' So the Mole had six brothers. I could easily imagine six big and broad guys, with red mops of hair on top of their heads and hundreds of freckles covering their noses. 'I'm not going to lie ‚Äì I tried to run like a girl, but one of them caught me by the arm and pushed me against the wall. I kicked him in the stomach and he had to drop me, but two more of them were waiting for me.' Zeppo squeaked. 'One of them hit me in the face and the other one square in the chest. Damn me if that didn't hurt!' He winced for dramatic effect. 'Well I told them they were a bunch of girls for beating up a fourteen year old, but that only made one of them hit me in the face again. Then they let me go, but I spat the one closest to me in the face. I got the hell outta there of course, but it wasn't like they didn't try to catch me. They followed me all the way down to Yorkville before I lost them. On my way home I almost bumped into them again, at the beginning of 93rd street.' We all laughed, because it was a funny story ‚Äì not as spectacular as some other stories Chico came home with, but still good enough to make us all fall asleep with a smile on our faces. enjoyed it? Please review and tell me what you think of it.. I tried very hard to keep true to reality. And evidentally it's not about the movies, but about their own life. Disclaimer; They are their own[Chapter 2] Here is my second chapter on my Marx Brothers fanfic! I got more reviews on this than I expected! Good to know there are still fans of them around. It's weird how they are 'forgotten' like this. Charlie Chaplin isn't forgotten, Laurel and Hardy, but they. They were AT LEAST as famous back then and till deep in the seventies Groucho couldn't go on the streets wihtout being recognized. Well I'll just begin. Chico Marx = Leonard (the chicken chaser and oldest of brothers) Harpo Marx = Adolph (the storyteller - it's supposedly his autobiography of the sort - is the second son) Groucho Marx = Julius (the third son and quite a bookworm and quite a wit too) Gummo Marx = Milton (never went into either Broadway or film - the fourth son) Zeppo Marx = Herbert (got out of showbusiness as soon as he could, after his contract ran out with Paramount - fifth son) Oh, by the way! I have a hard time mimicking Groucho. Groucho was such an incredible wit, that I find it very hard to make the jokes Groucho-standard, but I try - PLEASE don't judge me on it though! Chapter 2 Before telling you more about the story involving Molly I'm just going to tell you a bit more about me and my family. The Marxes were poor, very poor and till I was about eight we didn't live in one place. We moved around a lot, never out of the neighbourhood, but still, fleeing from money-hungry landlords, we couldn't pay. However when we settled down, we settled down at 179 East 93rd Street, a little Jewish neighbourhood, squashed in between the Irish in the north and the Germans in the south, in Yorkville. I went to school till my eighth. I've always been quite small and when you also tend to be quiet and have a squeaky voice when you speak, you always have some bullies watching over you. Chico never had that problem, even though we looked so much alike at that age, that people took us as twins. However Chico was always sure of himself and there were little people who knew how to outtalk or outsmart him in any way. My bullies were two Irishers. They were big and ugly, like all bullies ought to be and now and then, when Miss Flatto, the condescending teacher, left the room they would throw me out of the window. It was an eight foot fall, so not even close to deadly, but when it was done to you quite a few times you would get sore in the bones. Every time that would happen, I would stretch my arms and legs, dust myself off and then calmly walk back into the school. Miss Flatto thought I was mentally instable. I didn't do all too well in school, because I would dream my way through the day and when I would come back from the 'bathroom' without asking her for permission to go in the first place (I knew I would be even worse off if I would snitch on one of the big, ugly classmates), she would like to predict my future in front of the class. I would never make it in life, I would be a complete failure. She would waggle her finger beneath my nose and say; ' Someday you will realize, young man, you will realize .' Mum was far too busy with keeping Chico out of the poolroom, to keep me in the schoolroom, so she sent someone else. My cousin Polly lived with us and she had a boyfriend who was a herring peddler. He used to stand in the streets, with wooden buckets full of fish surrounding him, calling out to people; 'Hey, best here! Best here! Best here in the verld!' ‚Äì since he was German. You could always smell him from a block away, so when he one day showed up in my classroom, with buckets, smell and all, Miss Flatto pinched her nose and commanded him to leave the school immediately. Cousin Polly was so embarrassed by him that she broke off with him and began something with a tailor, whom she later on married. She congratulated herself on escaping the herring peddler before it was too late. Interesting is that the herring peddler succeeded in a number of businesses years later and died a very wealthy man. However I knew I was done when he showed up at school. The two Irish kids now took every chance they could get to throw me out of the school window. I was thrown out with such regularity and Miss Flatto was beginning to get so convinced of her own predictions of my future, that one sunny day, when I was heaved out again, I just dusted myself off and then turned my back on Public School 86 and walked straight home. That was the end of my formal education. Not the end of my education though. My first real teacher, because I never really counted my Second Grade teacher, Miss Flatto, was Grandpa. He taught me German, by refusing to learn English himself and magic tricks, because he used to be a magician back in Germany. Grandpa was not a Relative. He was Family. A Relative was anyone who was named either Marx, like Dad or Schoenberg, like Mum, or who spoke Plattdeutsch, who turned up in our flat at dinnertime and made sure all of us could eat even less. A lot of strange people became Relatives, but no one was ever rejected. Grandpa wasn't a Relative though. He and Grandma were Mum's parents and even though Grandma died shortly after we moved to East 93rd street, Grandpa stayed around till 1919, when he was exactly a hundred years old. He was Family. When I quit school before even the end of Second Grade, I didn't know what to do with myself, except keep myself as far away from P.S. 86 as I could. School was fine for Groucho, who was knocking off 100's in the First Grade and for Chico who was in the Fifth Grade and a mathematic genius, but it was soon clear that I didn't like it one bit. Mum and Dad accepted the fact that I wasn't going back without questions. Mum was busy with the career of her brother Al Schoenberg, who later changed it to Al Shean, trying to make him into a successful Broadway actor, which she succeeded in and furthermore only made sure Chico didn't spent too much time in the chance games. She thought she had done her duty anyway, by sending over Polly's boyfriend, to make sure I was okay. Mum only had one major goal in her life. She wanted to put her kid brother (Uncle Al) and her five sons on stage and make them successful. A nut job, especially since only Uncle Al and Groucho wanted to be on the stage in the first place and after Groucho got a taste of the stage, he wanted to be a writer. Our sights of the future were simple. Gummo wanted to be an inventor, Zeppo a prize-fighter, Chico a professional gambler and myself wanted to be a piano player on a ferryboat. However Minnie Schoenberg Marx had her mind set on something and she would get it her way. Back to Grandpa. Grandpa had his own little room in the front of the flat, so from the window you could see the clock tower, the only way for us to tell the time, since we didn't have any watches for ourselves. But on the other hand. It wasn't like we needed one; we weren't expected anywhere anyway. Once, with my Bar Mitzvah on my thirteenth birthday, I got a watch. The present was quite a relief actually, since I already got a pair of gloves of Cousin Polly and another pair of gloves from Aunt Hannah and another one from either Dad or Grandpa or both, so when I got the shiny two dollar watch from Mum, I was quite pleased with it. However Chico had a nose for money. Every time I would make a few quarters and would hide it somewhere, he would find it and use it as his own. Once I even hid the dime Uncle Al gave me behind the wallpaper ‚Äì I had found a little tear in it, but the next morning when I woke up, the tear had widened, the dime had gone missing and Chico had gone missing too, even though he normally sleeps in till noon. Every somewhat valuable item ever possessed by me when I was younger, was taken away by Chico, so he could get some money for it in the hockshops. That was the most probable thing that could happen with my watch, but I was set on not letting him have it. When I got it I already saw his eyes glister and I knew even my Bar Mitzvah presents weren't save from his Older Brother hands. He waited a few days in respect, but then would slip it off my wrist when I was sleeping. It was a good thing it was the first and last time I outsmarted Chico. I had taken the hands out of the watch, which made it impossible to read the time. Chico never wanted it, because how much could you get for a watch that can't tell the time? And if I wanted to know the time I would smile at my watch and look at the clock tower. My second real teacher was undoubtedly Chico. Even though he was not two years older than me, he was far advanced in the ways of the world. He was a mathematic genius, so much was sure and he used that in the most practical way; gambling. He learned how to bet on horse and dog races, how to play pinochle, poker, bridge and every possible other way that could make you rich and poor in an instant. He was the one who learned me to never shoot dice on a blanket, how to detect loaded dice, how to handle the pool que, how to play the cards and to never ever go against the odds. Chico had an uncanny talent in getting people to do things the way he wanted them. He was the one who got us to London, who got us into Broadway, who got us into A Rate Films and with that a certain percentage of the profit made ‚Äì as first of all Hollywood movie stars in history! As far as I know the first real big time project he did was the Marx Cuckoo Clock Corporation. Uncle Al was quite an actor now on Broadway and every time he'd visit he would give us all a dime. Normally, when I'd hustle a quarter from somewhere, I'd feel guilty if I didn't kick in a part in the family kitty, but not with the occasional dime we got from Uncle Al! That was given to us. It was pure spending money! We were all dazed! We didn't know what to do with a fortune like that, except for Chico. Chico said to me he would invest his and my dime into the cuckoo clocks they sold down the block. I wanted to know how much he could make with it. He bought one clock for twenty cents and sold it to one of the hockshops for fifty. A thirty cents profit! I gave him my dime and he bought more clocks. He said business was now too good for me to stay a silent partner, so he sent me off with the command to sell those clocks for more than twenty cents. It turned out that at every hockshop I dropped by, Chico had already sold a clock and the owner would think I was the same kid, because we used to look so much alike, who tried to make fun of him in some way and order me out of his shop. Chico told me he would take care of all the hockshops and I should work on all the people through the neighbourhood. I walked into the store of an ice worker. 'Cuckoo clocks! Cuckoo clocks, the best around, guaranteed!' I don't know where the guaranteed came from, I probably felt on high spirits because of Chico's confidence in the business, but the ice worker asked me how long it would run, before he had to give it a pull. 'Eight hours!' I answered him, sweating nervously. 'Okay.' He said, leaning against his counter. 'Stay here and hold the clock. If it's still running eight hours from now, I'll buy it.' A long day started. Clients came in and went out and I was scared the clock would suddenly stop, because I had no idea how long it was supposed to run, so every time the man turned around, I would give the string a little pull, just to make it go just a little longer. Unfortunately he caught me in the act once and he kicked me on the street, with the clock, laughing like he hadn't laughed so much in years. When I got back to Chico, it turned out Chico sold all his clocks. He had earned more than eleven dollars! I was too ashamed to ask for anything than my original dime, but Chico insisted I would take half the share. I told him he should try to double it in pinochle and damned if he didn't do just that, that same night. The Marx Cuckoo Clock Corporation was now worth 29,90$. I had never seen such a fabulous pile of cash before. However I still felt lousy about the ice works fiasco, so I told Chico to redouble it. The next day he lost everything in a pinochle game. Chico said that should be a lesson to me. 'It was against the odds, Adolph and I said it already; Never go against the odds!' Chico always has been a master in hustling his way through life. He could imitate about every accent and he used it every time he got himself in the scrap. He also had a photographic, slightly selective memory. If you would ask him now what cards he was holding, what cards the others were holding and in what order the remaining cards lay in the deck, in the bridge game he played more than thirty years ago, he could tell you without hesitation. However I doubt if he can tell you the name of his First Grade teacher. When I quit school I didn't see much of Chico, because Chico never came straight home. He stopped with school too on his own accord (unlike the others who were pulled out by Mum), about two or three years later than me, when he was twelve. He decided he knew enough about math to put out a good game and he was knowledgeable enough to mingle in the action. When he was younger it was soon evident that he had a knack for arithmetical figures, but when he became older it also was quite evident that he had a talent for the non-arithmetical figures too. Girls loved Chico and Chico loved girls. I barely saw him with the same girl twice and he never brought any of them home, but if you would visit him in the poolroom all the focus of every girl in the room was on Chico. Chico once, when we were both a little older, set me up with a gal, on a double date. He came with another girl and I, a nervous young lad, who didn't knew the first thing about taking a girl out, started to stammer a story about Grandpa's pipe. While I was telling my story Chico was having a pretty good time with his girl. I was still talking when he started to have a pretty good time with my girl also. I wasn't even half through with my story when Chico and both the girls were long gone, doing I-don't-know-what, leaving me sitting alone, not sure of what to do, until I just took my hat and walked home. The only girl Chico ever brought home was Molly. And that wasn't the way he wanted it all. ... I was sitting on the stoop, in front of the flat we lived in and Gummo and Zeppo were playing next to me. I was just bouncing a tennis ball on the street, letting it bounce a few times, before catching it again. I could hear Dad sing while cooking dinner, upstairs. Next to me Groucho sat down, a grumpy look on his face and a book in his hand. I wasn't quick enough a reader to read the title, before he laid it upside down beside him. 'Dad is making too much noise.' He said. I said nothing and just continued to bounce the ball. Because I quit school at my eighth I didn't learn to read right away. I taught myself by looking at street signs and the like. Stuff like All you can eat signs, Don't walk on the grass signs and This is a private area and therefor prohibited signs learned me how to read and I'm glad to say I can read well enough to read without moving my lips. 'The house is always so full.' Groucho continued. 'It's never just quiet.' I shrugged. 'Well, that's life I guess. I like it.' I answered Groucho. Groucho nodded. 'I guess so. I do too, but it's hard just reading a book.' For a few moments he was silent and I bounced my ball. 'Did you know Mum wants to put me and Milton and that Lou Levy kid on stage?' Groucho suddenly said. I didn't had time to answer him before Zeppo yelled; 'LEONARD!' I looked to my left and saw Zeppo running towards an uncharacteristically annoyed looking Chico. I knew why immediately. Besides him walked Molly. She had a smug look on her face. Chico caught Zeppo when he was about to bump into him. 'Hey little fella!' He said upbeat, wiping the grouchy look from his face. Groucho made a sound I couldn't quite place. 'Who's that ?' He asked and I assumed he was talking about Molly. I shrugged. 'I don't really know. I met her a few times. Leonard knows her.' Groucho snorted. 'Well of course Leonard knows her. Is there a girl he doesn't \"know\"?' I couldn't help but to laugh myself too. 'Perhaps.' I said, making a face. Chico slapped me on the back of my head. 'Hey, brothers, are you gossiping about me? You're like a couple of old ladies.' I protested and Groucho said; 'A bit of respect to the old ladies, please!' Molly came to stand next to Chico. 'Hi, Adolph!' She said. I noticed she pronounced my name like the Germans did, with an A like in car . Then I realized she knew my name and I blushed. 'Uhm, hello..' I stammered and Chico rolled his eyes. That made me feel even stupider. Molly smiled at Groucho, who was pretty red in the face too. 'And which brother are you?' She asked politely, to which Groucho answered with 'The other one.' Mum was delighted to have Molly there and kept complimenting her on the beautiful colour of her hair and the material of her cotton dress and I heard Chico murmuring annoyed remarks more than once. She stayed for dinner and therefor became a Relative, what was exactly the thing Chico didn't want to have happened. Mum and Dad kept track of their Relatives. Asked how they were, invited them for dinner and made sure they were comfortable. Mum and Dad were both very unselfish. Chico didn't like that, because that way he couldn't just break off with her if he started something with her. I know Chico liked her, but Mum and Dad making her a Relative made him unable to begin anything with her. However Molly kept track with the family pretty good. Not much Relatives had showed up that evening, so in the end it were only Mum, Dad, Grandpa, Cousin Polly, Zeppo, Gummo, Groucho, Chico and myself and of course Molly. Aunt Hannah dropped by at the beginning but excused herself again later on, hurrying of again. 'So..' Dad began. 'Where do you live?' Molly first didn't answer, swallowing the leftover soup from the day before, that Dad had updated with new ingredients. 'Wow, this is really good, Mr Marx!' She said, shoving in another gulp with the wooden spoon. Dad waved it off. 'Just call me Frenchie, girl, just like everyone else does!' Molly didn't answer, busy with her soup. When she swallowed she said; 'I live just up north. In the Irish part.' Dad looked surprised. 'The Irish? Are you Irish? You sure don't sound Irish.' I suddenly realized how right he was. She didn't sound Irish at all. More British, but somehow so completely New Yorks, that it was, now I noticed, outstandingly weird. I saw Chico's head snap up, probably curious as hell. However Molly didn't seem too eager in answering. 'Well, my mother is Danish.. maybe that's it.' She said vaguely. Chico frowned, but besides that nobody looked very fazed by the answer. It was a nice dinner, primarily because it was the first dinner in weeks that we ate without all the Relatives. Okay, Molly was there, but she was, for some reason, part of the family as soon as she set foot into the house. It seemed cosy and intimate and Chico cracked some jokes and Groucho sang a song (he used to have a nice soprano voice) and we played a few rounds of cards, where Zeppo played along with Dad and Gummo with Chico. In the end won Chico, but just, as Dad and Molly had cards that almost matched his. Zeppo and Gummo were put to bed, which was a lot harder than you might think as they were yelling at each other about the card game (Gummo: ' HAHA, I WON! ' Zeppo: ' NO YOU DIDN ' T! YOU KNOW LEONARD ALWAYS CHEATS! '). Groucho had talked his way out of going to bed, claiming he still had to do a homework assignment and even though Mum didn't belief a thing of it, she let him sit with us. I was just glad that I was already twelve and considered big enough to be able to stay up till ten. It was a rare sight, us sitting at the table like that. First of all, because Dad normally went off to his pinochle game after dinner, so wouldn't be around now. Next to that Chico was barely ever home, except for dinner and sometimes for sleeping. Also there was a strange girl, none of us knew, sitting at the table, a cup of tea between her hands. We talked a lot, more than we had in a long time and Mum and Dad talked about when they were young in Germany. Molly nodded a lot and Mum asked how she felt about moving from Europe to New York. Molly just shrugged. 'Every nationality you find in Europe, you'll find here, it sometimes seems.' She said. 'You have the Irish, the Germans, the Italians, the Dutch.. Just like home. The only big difference, I think, is that back home we didn't have to fight for it, because we already have our country, but here everyone needs to show it and make sure no one crosses their territory. It all feels rather pointless.' She said. She shrugged. 'But well..' It's maybe good to mention that at this point neither the First or the Second World War has happened yet. When it was ten thirty and Groucho was sleeping with his eyes open, Dad thought it would be a good idea for Chico to drop Molly of at her home. 'You don't let a lady walk the streets alone at this time at night.' Chico rolled his eyes but nodded, grabbing his coat. Molly shook Dad's hand and kissed Mum three times on the cheeks, like they do in Europe and then walked into the hallway, saying she would just look for her gloves and she would be ready to go after that. Mum was slowly prying the book from between Groucho's fingers, trying not to wake him up, when Chico murmured he would just help her look for her gloves, before they would be waiting for her all night. Dad sat down at the table, laying out the cards at the table and starting a little game of vist against himself and I was watching the game unfold, when I saw a pair of black leather gloves laying on the table. I didn't think any of us had a pair of women's gloves, black and of leather or not, so I assumed they were Molly's. I snatched them off the table and walked into the hallway. I was greeted by a shocking sight. I guess that even at that age I knew my big brother was a chicken chaser like you would say in those times, but I never, till that time, saw any other proof of it, than girls always hanging around him and always touching him unnecessarily, on the arm or shoulder or sometimes his hair and it seemed a bit weird for me as a little boy, but now it became all clear to me. On the hallway I was greeted with the sight of Chico kissing Molly. He had pushed her up against the wall and his arms were around her waist and her hands were in his hair and I was so completely thrown off by this image that I dropped the gloves and sprinted out of there. I heard Chico calling; 'Who was that! Adolph? Come back here, you little..!' But I jumped in bed, waking up Gummo who began to groan. A bit of noise was heard from the living/dining room. 'What's wrong?' I heard the faraway voice of Mum say. Chico answered grumpily. 'Adolph. He apparently found her gloves, but just threw them on the floor.' I huffed a bit annoyed, but I've always been unable to stay mad at anyone for more than a few seconds, so soon I was listening for more noises from outside the bedroom. I heard the door slam shut, when Chico and Molly left and I soon began to wonder if they would pick up where they left off, when they got outside and away from the watching eyes of Mum and Dad. I wouldn't know why not, but what did I know about it? I couldn't fall asleep for what seemed like hours, so when Chico finally got home again, I thought about what took him so long. Mum and Dad didn't comment on the time it took him. I heard chairs scraping the floor and Mum putting down the tea kettle on the table. 'So..' Mum suddenly said. I tried to listen harder, because it was all very soft, there was a wall between it after all. 'So?' Chico asked. Dad snorted. 'Well, who is she? How did you meet her? Is that your girlfriend?' He answered. 'I like her.' Mum said. 'She reminds me of me, in a way.' Chico made a noise of disgust. 'Thanks Mum, now that makes me hot for her!' Mum giggled, a very girly, Non-Minnie-Marx kind of giggle and Dad laughed loudly and from the sound of it, he slapped Chico on the back. 'You picked out a good one.' He continued. 'She's a very pretty gal and she seems intelligent also. And most important; she likes my cooking!' Chico chuckled, but then said; 'Don't you get all wound up, guys, because she's not my girlfriend. Maybe someday, but most certainly not now.' He said. I frowned. Why did he lie like that? You couldn't kiss a girl like that, without her being your girlfriend, could you? Dad sounded disappointed when he said; 'Well, don't let the nice ones slip away, son.' Mum agreed. 'She's the kind of girl I wouldn't mind you getting married to, someday in the future.' Dad laughed loudly again and answered her; 'See that face! Don't frighten him like that, Minnie, or he'll die a heart attack, before he even gets old enough to marry!' After that there wasn't much noise and a little after I fell asleep. review it please! Disclaimer: The Marx Brothers and several people and places used are their own!

I had set myself on a chair in the garden in a bikini two hours ago and barely moved since that, but slowly I realized that it got too hot outsight. I quickly pulled the thin white dressing grown on and walked through the open door into the house. I now lived with my brother since three weeks. But his home was also in contrast to my old apartment, it was like a villa. The douche bag had a large garden with a pool and terrace, a giant house and plenty of rooms. Since I jad already lost my badly paid teachinf job, I couldn't pay my apartment and had to move out. Dallas had not received me with open arms, but with some persuasion, I had managed it yet. \"Jo? Joliet? Want to earn a little money \"? Shouted my brother from somewhere. \"I'm not your maid! Cavities your shit away yourself. And stop constantly offering. \" \"Actually, I wanted to offer to work behind the counter in Xquisite today, because an operator has called sick, but you seem to have no interest.\" Direct I jumped over the couch and ran to the bathroom, where I pounded on the door. Before I could go out there I just had to take a shower and style myself. \"Dallas, open up the damn door! I want to work behind the counter, but I have to make myself ready. I want to take a shower! \" \"No time, we have to leave in ten minutes.\" \"Are you fucking kidding me?! I sat two hours in the bright sun and I sweated, that's disgusting. People can't see me like this.\" \"The boys will be sweaty, too. And maybe there are a few lesbians, which will give an extra tip.\" Totally annoyed, I went to the guest room, which was my room and changed my clothes. I took a knee-length jeans and a thight white t-shirt. From the table I tool my small toilet bag with my make-up and threw it into my bag. I knew there was a shower in the strip club and if I had a few minutes, I would also use it. Half an hour later I helped the supplier to transport the drinks. In three hours Dallas would open the club and until then I had a lot of work to do. He had asked me if I would stand behind the bar and not if I was able to prepare the whole club. Now I practically jumped in a triangle and wanted to punsh my brother in his damn face, because he was nowhere to be found. After all the glasses were again stored in the cabinets, I finally had a break. I went back to the room of the guys and through the another door I came into the small bathroom with the shower and the toilet. I laid my clothes so that they didn't ger wet and stood under the warm beam. I quickly showered me off and pulled my clothes back on. Mike's view: Only a half hour to go until the show started. I just arrived from another club, where I invited a few women into the Xquisite, and had to get ready. I heard the shower running, but saw Ken, Tito, Richie and Tarzan in the room and preparing themself for the show. \"Who's in the shower?\" \"I do not know who, it was already running when we came, have thought it was you.\" Replied Ken. I knocked on the door but got no answer. Even stronger knocking brought nothing. I searched for Dallas, maybe he knew who blocked the bathroom. It was not easy to find him, as he checked the water line behind the bar. \"Hey Dallas, if you're already paying women for us, then at least make sure that they take us in in the shower.\" \"What are you talking about, Mike?\" \"Someone occupied the bathroom, but it's no one of us. Nobody has responded as I knocked.\" \"This clever bitch.\" He threw the wet rag into the sink and came around the counter. I followed him as he walked into the locker room and pounded on the door. \"Jo! Hey Jo! I don't pay you for wasting my water! \" The door opened and a grinning Joliet with wet hair came out of the bathroom. She was without makeup and the white T-shirt was wet in some places, so you could easily see through. Without letting herself be swayed she walked in front of one of the mirrors and began to put some make up on. \"If you don't let me shower at yours, then you have to expect that this happens. I certainly don't work the whole night sweaty. And look how much better I look now. So if you excuse me, I'm here to work.\" With With made yelashes and red lips, she went back and left a confused Dallas. The guys, including myself, had to hold back a laugh. \"I didn't know that Jo is back in Tampa. How long has she worked for you? \"I asked. \"She doesn't really, she wants to earn a few bucks, she lives with me for three weeks. The little witch robbed me last nerve. Get ready, the show starts soon.\"[Chapter 2] Chapter 1. Joliet's view: The club was really damn full and I had a lot of work to do, so I couldn't see the performances and shows. All the women went mad about the guys and they were even swarmed by them. \"Excuse me, but you know the dancers in person, right?\" I got asked by someone. \"Yeah, why?\" I answered while I was drying a glass. \"How are they in private? It is certainly hot to hang out with them.\" \"Well, they aren't that hot. Married, can't get his life together, total emotionally blunted, like a ten year old, doesn't speak much and the worst one is the owner, he is the total slave driver.\" While I enumerated only the bad things about Ken, Mike, Tarzan, Tito, Richie and Dallas I waited grinning of the reaction of the two women. \"Maybe you should sit down again, the show goes on. Here your drinks and have fun.\" Surprised they took the cocktails and went back. The work here wasn't as boring as I thought. Again and again, women came and gave orders which I did as fast as I could. When the show was over the real rush began, because now they celebrated in club, but fortunately only one hour. Dallas came to me and instructed me to take some drinks to the guys, as if they couldn't get something by themselves. Nevertheless, I took a tray and put five beers on it. I meandered through the crowd and then walked through the door into the backstage area. \"God, Mike, get yourself a shirt!\" I laughed. The addressee just grinned and took the tray down to stop it. Actually, I thought he just wanted to relieve me, but I just lay in his arms. Mike and I knew each other already for a few years and always had a good relationship even though I had hoped for more. When I worked in Houston as a teacher, we had no contact at all. It was the first time in months that we saw each other. \"Cool that you're back in Tampa. The shining sun is good for you.\" \"That's why I come again and again over here. I tank a bit of sun and then I cut it off again, but this time you will not get rid of me so quickly. Dallas, of course, is very pleased. \" With a bottle I opened the beer bottles and handed each one. But unfortunately I had to go back behind the bar very soon and said goodbye for now. Time passed quickly and finally all the guests were out. Dallas made the settlement and we sat down together. \"And what was it like in Houston?\" Ken asked. \"My apartment was small and expensive, the school where I taught was shit, the children were little snobs and the parents assholes. So it was ok. But I am happy to be back here, even if my brother cann't be more bothered of me. \" \"How did you get it? Just because I ask you every day if you've already found a new job, that doesn't mean that I want to be rid of you.\" \"No, of course not, you only care about me. And while we're at my life, I gave my best today, so give me my bucks. \" Reluctantly Dallas gave me the money and then everyone else. Everything was cleaned already so far and my brother wanted to finish the club. I heard that Mike, Tito and Richie still wanted to go in any other club and there to turn the night into a day. Mike came to me and asked me if I wanted to come, too. \"Sorry I've already other plans. I wanted to steal a bottle of wine from Dallas, lounging naked and cozy in front of the fireplace. Wanna join? \"I winked. I laughed and waited for his reaction, but made him then directly clear that it was a joke. \"Sure I'll come with. Shall we go now?\" I packed everything in my purse and Mike and I walked to his car. He drove behind Tito and we arrived at a club in the middle of Tampa. We quickly came in quickly, because Mike knew the bouncer. It didn't take long and Richie gave the first round. Techno wasn't really my genre, but with a little alcohol I made it. I grabbed Mike and pulled him onto the dance floor. Directly we began to dance and I enjoyed spending time with him. Directly I noticed the tension between us and I wanted something to happen. His arms pulled me closer to him and I felt his chest against my back. Skillfully I swung my hips from left to right and moved to the music. I always had a little thing for Mike, but both he and I were more of the type of casual and short relationships and never really for something serious, but with Mike, I knew that it could be something serious. I put my hands on his and took them a little higher on my waist. Eventually he understood the wink. As best I could, I tried to whip him and used my whole body. The only thing it gave me was that he still held me. It was like this every damn time. Annoyed, I left him and joined to Richie at the bar, Tito danced with another woman. It was by 5 am and I just wanted to sleep. I felt a hand on my shoulder and when I turned around I saw Mike. \"Everything OK?\" \"I'm tired, can you give me a ride to Dallas?\" He just nodded and said goodbye to his colleagues, just like me and then led me outside. In his car, he drove me back right away. Neither of us said a word, but I saw how he looked at me again and again while I looked out of the window. I wanted to start a final attempt when I got out. Mike drove on Dallas driveway and stopped right in front of the house. \"Dallas is asleep, maybe you still want to come in? Maybe I still could do my plan with the wine.\" \"Jo, I'm really happy that you're here again, but you're way too important to draw our whole relationship for a ridiculous one-night stand in the mud.\" \"I'm important to you? That's why you called me when I was in Houston. Who are you kidding, Mike?! You didn't care about me when I was gone, and now you're saying that I'm important to you? Out of sight, out of mind, or what? You know what, Mike? Fuck you, ok? Honestly.\" I slammed the door of the car and walked quickly to the front door. I closed it and disappeared inside and ran upstairs in the guest room. There I threw my purse angry on the bed. This stupid asshole, he wanted me to just hold out if he didn't had anyone? What did he want to achieve with it? He constantly kept me out, gave me hope, but in the end nothing happend. I just threw myself on the bed and fell asleep in my clothes. The next morning I had to take of my make up first. I was still mad at Mike and my mood was even more down when I got a message from him. -please don't be angry. Are you working today again? - And if I was mad. Without answering him, I went into the kitchen and began to make breakfast, Dallas had the rule that guests make breakfast. And because his favorite breakfast was fruits with yogurt, I cut the bananas, apples and kiwis into small pieces. He put a lot of emphasis on healthy eating and fitness. Since today was Saturday, Dallas was about to come back from his Saturday Run. I ate some and went to wash my hair, because I could not wash it last night and had tied it together in a bun. When I went back down Dallas was eating. \"Good morning, my bartender seems to be sick until at least next week. So if you want to earn more, you are welcome. \" \"A little bit of money is always good. Let's go like yesterday? \" \"Yes, and be ready on time. Your outfit of yesterday was good, revealing and sexy but not too candid. Get dressed again today like that. \" \"All right, boss.\" I rolled my eyes and went upstairs. It was afternoon, I had slept through the whole morning. I pulled on a black skirt and a red top. My makeup was the same as yesterday, inked eyelashes and red lips, but this time pumps and I left my hair open. Just in time for departure I was done. It was the same procedure as yesterday, I helped to stow the drinks and conceded all the glasses. Today there were two other operations there, both could mix drinks, which I could not. It was only half an hour until Dallas opened the doors and I stowed the last things. \"Hey, can you give me a Coke?\" I looked up and saw the asshole. Without saying a word I took a bottle from the refrigerator, opened it, and set it down in front of him. Finished I turned demonstratively my back to him and put two bottles of vodka on the shelf. \"Come on, Jo. Don't be mad, I'm sorry if I hurt you, but it's the truth.\" \"Hey Tito, what can I get you?\" I asked extra-friendly when the Mexicans arrived the bar. Mike realized that I was pissed and went away. I had resolved not to talk with him, because it would lead to nothing anyway. During the show it was easy to avoid Mike, but the bad side was the view of his body and the whole gaping women. I tried my best to focus on the job, which wasn't easy because the music was damn loud. After the last showact was over, finally, I only had to survive another hour. Today was more to do than yesterday and we had some difficulties to work with all the women. I didn't made it to bring the beer to the boys, a pity but, instead, Dallas himself went. Relieved, I saw that the club was emptying, and finally there was no one except the staff. I wiped the counter clean and waited for my brother to drive back to his house. If I had survived the evening then it was one week without Mike. Together with the other two, I cleared everything away again and made the bar ready. When we were finished we sat down at a table and waited for our payment. We didn't need to wait that long for Dallas and we got our money. Done I stood at the exit, but Dallas still had to turn off the lights so he asked me to wait in the car. I went out and stood in front of his car, without a jacket I noticed how cold it was. \"Jo, you really don't want to talk to me or is it just your wounded pride? Don't ignore me. I really don't know where your problem is. If you don't want to talk to me please, I go now.\" With a neutral expression I saw how he went to his car and drove away, only a little later Dallas came out and we went home. I just wanted to get out of the fucking clothes and take a bath, but the love Dallas had everything but not a bathtub. How could you buy a house with no tub? Instead, I really stole a bottle of wine, took a blanket and sat outside on the terrace. I should have stayed in Houston no matter how annoying it would be there or I should went to Chandler, but not to Tampa. Chandler was my elder and Dallas younger brother. He lived in New York, where he worked at a large bank, with him I would have had it better. Somehow Chandler was the complete opposite of Dallas and me, he was married for years, had children and seemed thus to be satisfied. Maybe I should have quickly found a new job in New York and a better paid. But now I worked in a strip club, that was really a descent, I was a teacher. My mother always said \"Teachers are always needed\", apparently no. As a primary school teacher, I had it not easy, but I liked the job, only in the last school it had been no joy. The other teachers believed themselves to be better, just like the parents and the kids were just like their parents. The warped beasts had nothing to do with me being thrown out, although I would have liked to punish one of the children with not quite unconventional methods. I needed a real job, at least I didn't want to live forever in Dallas' guest room. But I didn't want to end up in Tampa forever, in no case and in the area was nothing free. I even looked after tutor points, but even their it didn't look good. I actually managed to avoid Mike for one week until Thursday. On Wednesday I had heard Dallas talking angrily into his phone, as it turned out it was the bartender for which I had stepped in. She told Dallas that she couldn't work no longer, because she was pregnant. For Dallas of course that wasn't good news, because he had now to replace her. Just five minutes later, he came to me and offered me the post of permanent representative, but only for a month. I said yes, because I needed the money and could make good use it. For now I had every Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays to work next to Mike, every evening. But I accept the bad side of the job gladly, although I didn't need any rent or costs to pay, would be even nicer to pay for living at my brothers', but didn't I want Dallas to live here forever, although it would certainly not have ripped him a hole in his wallet. In a ragged, narrow bright jeans and a loose top which slid always easy down on one shoulder, I stepped my third night into the Xquisite. My hair was easily put back, so it didn't fall into my face and my usual make-up. Last week I had found out that sandals and high heels were not ideal to work in, which is why I now wore black boots. I knew from Ken that Thursday was not as busy as Friday and Saturday, but the store would anyway fill well.[Chapter 3] Chapter. 2 The club has been prepared for the show and I did my part as I stowed the alcohol bottles. The boss wasn't disturbed by the preparatory work and was on stage. In a safe distance I watched as he fiddled with the torch and spat fire. This was probably against at least five rules of fire control, but it didn't seem to bother him and as long as he didn't put the club on fire I didn't care, too. The superstar of the Xquisite came in and next to him an unknown guy. They went directly to my brother and talked to him. Together, the two went to the locker room. \"Jo, bring the guys something to drink.\" Ordered Dallas. I quickly made a tray ready and went to the back. I wasn't allowed to give the guys any alcohol before the show, but what they brought with themselves was their own cause. With the elbow I opened the door and could hear how Mike presented his colleagues. Direct all eyes were on me. \"You're all acting like you've never seen a woman before, carry on, guys.\" \"And who is she?\" Asked the stranger. \"She, my dear friend, is totally off limit. If Dallas knows that you flirt with his sister than you're out again. Her name is Joliet, nicely 27 years old and apparently has no problem to see us naked.\" \"You don't need to tell him my whole life story directly. I'm Jo, if you need anything tell me and don't believe anything the five monkeys here tell you. You're?\" \"That's Kid.\" Replied Mike. \"But I didn't ask you.\" \"I'm Adam.\" \"Ok, Adam, I have to got to the bar again. Here, something to drink. Boys, don't fool him or crush him, he's cute. And quit the joint, thei smoke is like everywhere. Behave boys.\" I went back out and got ready for the show. It wasn't long until Dallas opened the show. I watched them starting the show and it showed me once again that I wouldn't get away from Mike. Why was this asshole so hot? It was just his moves and this confidence. And yet I had all the time in my mind how he leaped any women and had a dry-Fuck. I went through as always with the show and served the guests. There was nothing extraordinary, everything went as usual. Quite to the end came Tarzan single appearance. Dallas drummed and announced him, but there was no Tarzan. I excused myself and went briefly back to see if everything was ok. When I came in Tarzan was on the ground and Ken sat right next to him. \"Shit, what happened? Why is he down?\" Apart from Mike all had no pants on, but that didn't bothered me at all. I quickly crouched beside the big guy and felt his pulse. Thankfully everything was ok, apparently he had taken too much of all that shit. \"That's why you shall not drink before the show, you idiots! Probably you all drank that mixture of Tobias again. What do you think is Dallas going to say?! He makes the show here, and if one fails, he is mad as hell!\" At the moment Dallas came through the door and knew just what happend. He was looking directly for a replacement, but none of the dancers had a number he could make. Mike found a solution and shoved Kid on stage. \"You can't shove him onto the stage like this! He has no experience at all! \"I hissed at him quietly, because we were close to the stage. \"Each of us has started small.\" Shortly I looked at him with an angry look, but then went right back. I stood next to Tobias, watching the poor Kid on stage. He looked totally awkward and undressed himself as if he were at home, but he took off his clothes. Clapping I tried to motivate him and Dallas beside me seemed satisfied. Before the hot chair came I went back behind the bar. When the evening was over, saying the guests were gone, I breathed. But this time a few women stayed after the closing time. I had all my work done and sat at a table and waited again for my brother, but now I waited long. Mike made the billing and Dallas stood beside. Kid seemed to go well with the other and also the women liked him. I listened as the chair was pulled back beside me and someone sat on it. Sighing, I realized that it was Mike. \"What do I need to do to make you talking back to me? You're already mad for a week, usually it would be alright by now, but you're always angry. I am sorry! What should I do? Is it because I didn't want sex with you? Because then I grab you right now, shove you into the shower and we fuck. Everything just you're talking to me again. \" \"You don't get it. You're an ass, okay? You have three jobs, one of them as a stripper. God Mike you're already 30 years old! When will you get a grip on your life finally? Will you dance until you're coming to the nursing home? And then you fuck everything, as long as they're naive and I can't stand this any longer. I don't want to wait and hope that something happens until I come to the nursing home! Go to your whole fuckbuddies and just leave me alone. Come on, go and celebrate your success, Magic Mike and show the women how cool you are.\" \"Jo, you know that I'm not like that.\" \"But you are, Mike. First it was only the role of Magic Mike, but now you're just like on stage. Everything is fine as long as you has someone to fuck with. I hope you'll be happy with this.\" I got up and went to the toilet. I just couldn't stand to sit next to him. He was an ass and didn't even realized how much I was hurt and it was not just because of him fucking around. Mikes view: Actually, I was hoping that the conversation with Jo would have gone better, but it was apparently more going on than the fact me saying no to her. I didn't call her when she was in Houston, but she didn't contacted me as well. Although I knew that I had changed but I didn't become so careless and easy. \"Hey, man, all right? Is there something between you and Joliet? Looked as if you had a relationship fight.\" Asked Kid as I walked to the other. \"No, we're good friends, or were. She's mad at me, but is a long story.\" \"She is hot.\" \"Don't burn yourself, she is also pretty lively and could cost you your big chance. But let's have a fucked up party right now.\" It didn't take us so long and we were high and drunk. Still in Xquisite I started to make out with the little brunette and dazzled in my condition I forgot everything around me. Only when it was morning, I had a halfway clear head again, so clearly that I jumped into the deep end of a bridge. I brought Kid home to his sister Brooke. They lived together in a small apartment, which is why I noticed the chair directly. \"How do you know my brother?\" \"He is in my Roofing Crew. I am an entrepreneur, I have a few companies.\" With false enthusiasm she went to the refrigerator and took a drink for herself out. I launched an attempt to invite her for breakfast, but she refused it. Since she already looked annoyed anyway, I disappeared and decided to go to Dallas or more to Jo. I wanted the thing finally to go out of the world and the faster the better. With my black new car I drove to Dallas house, this afternoon was still training on, so I had to hurry. I parked right in front of the front door and looked up to the guest room. The window was open. I got out and stood directly under the window. \"Joliet, Joliet, let down your hair.\" I voiced swollen and laughed. In fact, she came to the window but she was anything but laugh. I saw from here that she was wearing a tight purple fitness top and the hair was tied back in a braid. \"Piss off, Mike.\" Ok, I didn't expect that. Interrogative I looked at her and wanted to speak when she beat me to it. \"Go to your brunettes. I'm going anyway.\" Crap. She had seen me making out with the brunette in the club. And that confirmed her allegations of yesterday, I was really a jerk. Apparently I had developed myself into an all fucking idiot without realizing it. The door opened and Jo jogged up to me to past me without a glance. Somehow I had to get her to talk to me and I had an idea. Joliet's view: What did Mike fancy anyway? He calls me and I come? Definitely not! Just for the fact that he dared to show up here I could have beat him up with my nightstand. I woke up this morning with a fury in my belly, which was really not pleasant. After I made clear to him what he had become, an ass, he did absolutely nothing to prove that I was wrong, no, he even made out in front of my eyes with a girl. So Mike actually died for me, I still worked in the Xquisite, but privately I didn't want to have anything to do with him anymore. I was just going jogging without a plan where to go. It was only the fourth time that I was jogging here since I was back into Tampa. In Houston I had been jogging often, simply because they all annoyed me and I needed something to clear my head. Jogging was always a good way, besides, I had discovered yoga for me. After my jog I put my mat on the terrace and went several times through sun salutations, then I made a lot of exercises which require concentration, so that I could think of nothing else. But after a fruit smoothie it was done with my relaxation, because I got a message from the great Magic Mike. - Get Go with Kid to buy him outfits for the show might need your female opinion - Just because I was mad at Mike, I could not let \"suffer\" the new one. With the risk to beat Mike if he said a false word, I texted him back that he should pick me up. I quickly put on my shorts and a blue light blouse and pulled Ballerinas on. A little later Mike was outside the front door and I climbed into the backseat. Kid sat in front in the passenger seat and grinned at me. \"Hey, thank you for coming. What Mike thinks is good is one thing, but what you women like another. It's good to hear two opinions.\" \"No problem, I offered my help. I've never been in such a shop before, so it is will be interesting.\" And whether it was interesting. Mike seemed to know perfectly about everything and he also adressed the saleswoman directly by her name. The clothes were ... short, in my opinion, there really was missing a lot of stuff, but clothes for the job. \"Ok, ok, ok, our Kid is storming the stage. Hello Beartice. And you're ready? Dallas has given me the green light to equip yourself. Are you ready? Why the anxious glance?\" \"I can tell you what the fearful look is up to. These are things even I wouldn't put on.\" I said while I stretched a red leather thong. \"Maybe you should put on some, just to try you know. But Kid has already lost his innocence, now he only has to be good. We buy you an american flag- \" \"But there is some fabric missing.\" Interrupted him Kid. \"Yes that's a Tanga.\" Said Mike. \"Show what you've got, kid.\" I laughed and easy slapped his butt. We started to look around and it was just amazing what they sold here. Who wanted to wear something like this?! Adam discovered an elephant thong, where the trunk even squeaked. \"Stay away from elephants, that's something for Dallas and you don't want to look like him on your first evening.\" \"What's Dallas like? Is he in a good mood? \"Asked the youngster. \"Yes, Dallas is .. Dallas.\" \"I think it's great that he let me in.\" \"Dallas is doing everything in order to make more profit, don't think to much of it.\" \"You seem to be fascinated by your brother.\" Said Kid firmly. \"Yes, I like Chandler.\" \"Wait a minute, you say Dallas, Joliet and Chandler?\" \"I know my parents were very resourceful. My dad was born in Dallas, my mom in Chandler and they met in Joliet. Why naming the children after famous people, if you can give them names of towns? I am glad that they have not met in Mississippi. \" \"And you live at Dallas' and work for him?\" \"Both only temporary. Until a few weeks ago, I was a teacher in Houton, but was released, so I went to Dallas. I'm already looking for a new job. Just to be a bartender is very unpleasant. The entire industry Dallas is thing and not mine.\" \"But you seem to go well with the boys.\" \"Why shouldn't I? They are only strippers on stage, if they are assholes in private I don't want to anything to do with them, but Ken, Tito, Richie and Tarzan are really more than okay.\" \"Ouch.\" I heard Mike saying. \"If you'd have been my teacher earlier, I would certainly have preferred to go to school.\" Grinned Kid. \"Are you flirting with me, Adam?\" \"I'm trying.\" He laughed. \"Then I'll take the compliment, but apparently it didn't help with my past pupils, because they found me still corrosive. You know, I'd like to see you in this boxer jacket withthe matching string. It would look really hot.\" I laughed now. \"Actually not a bad idea.\" Mike spoke up. After an hour, we finally had enough things that have been found by Mike and me and were finally able to leave the store. Unfortunately Kids apartment was closer and Mike drove him home first. \"Say your sister some greetings and tell her I've still not had breakfast yet.\" I sighed and rolled my eyes and refused to go into the front. Instead, I opened the message that I had received from Kid. I had just given him my number in case he needed help again. Mike dropped me off without unnecessary words and drove away. But since it was already late, I could prepare myself for the work directly.[Chapter 4] Chapter. 3 Kid was already a part of the show today and how I had noticed also in the group number. I did my work and waited for the show to start. The tables were full and Kid was joyfully received. Apparently not all found his performance good, because right in front of the bar stood a woman with arms folded and a serious expression. I saw Mike walking to her and he discussed something with her. It looked like the two knew each other, while she looked totally repellent, he did the best to begin a conversation with her. Unfortunately, I was approached by a customer and when I looked again Mike was gone. I should stop to watch what he does, probably she was the next in his bed, but what did I mind? Not at all! Ok, that was a bad lie. Although Mike said Kid shouldn't do the Dallas look, the cowboy number and the outfits were quite similar from the beginning of his, but he seemed to enjoy. Dallas took the stage and announced his golden boy. Although I had seen the appearance of Mike twice already, it would not let me cold even the third time. Why did he have to be so damn hot ?! It would still be better if he was a dancer, then he would not have to at every show so many wives but bespringen I doubted that it bothered him. The woman with whom he had spoken disappeared and I no longer saw the whole evening. Today the payroll and tidying went faster than the last time, and Dallas and I have half an hour more at home. I wrote a little with Kid, who wanted to know what he could improve (he wanted to appear as soon as possible to develop good Stripper), but also went to bed early. - Good morning beautiful lady x - Didn't every girl want to read such a message when she look at her cell phone in the morning? I smiled and replied Adam and got directly a new message. - Want to do something? - - Sure, I wasn't inline skating in a while ;) - Only two hours later Adam and I were on the pier, in inline skates. He was still a little shaky but did well. He told me that the last time he did this was about five years ago. My last time was two months ago. As best I could, I went backward and pulled him forward with my hands. \"Well you see, you're doing hella fine.\" I grinned. \"But only because of my hot teacher.\" \"Kid don't flirt with me, I'm nearly ten years older than you, but if I'd be five years younger and you five years older, I'd already be in your bed.\" \"Aha, so you're a such kind of a girl.\" He laughed. \"I have to admit, I was such a. But since I'm here in Tampa I've realized that I'm too old for that. I'll be 28 and I'm not married yet, nor do I have children. I don't even have a job or a flat. I think it's time to grow up.\" \"Funny that Mike doesn't see it this way.\" \"He is a man. As long as he has another woman around his dick every night, it doesn't matter what happens around him.\" \"Seems like he doesn't take it that easily, he thinks about how to make you talk to him for days now,. Actually, he was hoping you'd talk to him yesterday, but his plan didn't work. \" \"Mike is a monkey, I gave him enough opportunities to show me that he has the slightest interest in me and what I want, but he screwed up and I'm so not getting any younger.\" \"I think Mike likes you, he doesn't see it himself, he tries to suppress his feelings with all the women. That would be logical.\" \"It would be logically when he'd die of a heart attack due his many fucks.\" \"It'd be at least a beautiful death.\" \"I'll give you a great death when I push you into the sea.\" I laughed. \"So Mike has now finally screwed it with you?\" \"Yup.\" \"Then you can look out for someone different.\" Grinned Kid and wiggled his eyesbrows. \"I think I need to drown you in the sea for real, but then is Dallas going to kill me. So you can call yourself a lucky man. For now, you will be spared. \" I let go of his hands and tried to let him go on his own, he made it but wobbled a bit. It looked so cute like a deer after birth trying to move forword on wobbly legs. It was finally a day without stress and no hassle. Thanks to Kid I once again had a carefree day. On July 4, Dallas had a sandbank party organized like every year, and I was also there. Everyone from the Xquisite and a few other people were invited. I put on a red bikini and my hair tied into a bun together. My bag was full with everything that I needed, and food and drinks were in the many cooler bags. In the morning we drove off early, so we had the whole day. With Dallas boat we went to the Sandbar, which was, of course, personally controlled by the boss. I recognised Joanna, I knew that she had something with Mike sometimes and the woman, which had spoken with Mike during the show. She was Adam's sister Brooke and felt visibly uncomfortable among all the strangers. It didn't took us long to arrive. Everyone took something and the boat was empty again. We built everything, made ourselves comfortable and the party began. Richie started the grill and the alcohol Station was already well in use. I sat down next to Ken's wife, Mercedes, and we chatted. I haven't seen her in a long time, but I kept her positive in memory. Grinning, I watched as Joanne destroyed Mike's chance to flirt with Brooke today. \"So to be honest, are they real?\" \"What?!\" irritated I turned to the voice. I didn't catch that kid had sat down beside me and was therefore already irritated, but the question caught me off guard as well. I could imagine what he meant, but at the same time I couldn't imagine that he was so naughty. \"Adam, are you looking at my breasts?\" I asked indignantly played and pushed him away slightly. \"Hey watch out, I got you a beer.\" He laughed. \"Oh thank you. And do you like it? \" \"Yes, it's really cool. I never thought that such opportunities come with the job. Only my sister is not quite so enthusiastic. \" \"She's your sister, what do you expect? You're jumping in thongs on the stage, which isn't accustomed for her little Adam. \" \"What was it like with Dallas?\" \"Dallas also danced earlier, I thought it obliquely somehow. He was never a prig, but that he'd become a stripper, I'd have never imagined. Our parents have invested a lot of time in our education. Chandler and me seemed to be effected by it, at least as children. But Dallas was always at the director's and has also been arrested a couple of times, which told me Chandler. I was too young to be able to still remember. When he asked me for money to open up the club I thought he was totally crazy, but it works fine. Even if he himself is no longer dancing, he likes to stand on stage and present hilmself. I don't want the money back, but he shouldn't be so stingy all the time.\" \"But he helps. He helps us all, with the jobs I mean.\" \"Yeah, right, anyway you shouldn't put too much trust into him. Come we'll sit down with the others. And to answer your question from earlier: Yes, they are. \" I pulled him to the small group consisting of Dallas, Richie, Tobias, Mike and Brooke. Since there was only one empty chair left, we both started running. I had a head start, but he was fast, so we were both at the same time there and let us fall to the chair. Laughing we sat above the other, until I slipped a piece away from him and sat down beside him. The conversation was about parenting and I just could roll my eyes about how my brother wanted to educate my nieces and nephews. Total bullshit, I was indeed a teacher but also knew not the perfect upbringing, but that what he uttered was really stupid. Brooke seemed to see it the same way and finally fled. The good old Mike went behind her and walked with her along the water. Annoyed, I remained seated while Kid brought us something from the grill. Meanwhile, he and I were having a very good relationship, because instead of me simply giving me the sausage he pulled it away again. \"Adaaaam! I'm hungry, \" I groused, laughing. Also laughing he relented and handed me my plate. I spent the rest of the time mainly with Adam. Mike didn't care to talk to me. That he wanted to appease, he seemed to have forgotten very quickly thanks to Brooke. Unfortunately we couldn't stay here forever, because there was still a show. At home, I took a quick shower, pulled fresh clothes on and made my way. Today there would be many cocktails in the colors of the national flag, so I had to distribute the special cards on the tables. I just finished the last, when someone covered my eyes from behind. \"Mhh who is so stupid and covers my eyes? That can only be Kid. \" \"How do you know?\" I turned around and hugged him, laughing. He had come back with Mike, because he stood at the bar and watched the two of us hugging. \"Who else would do such a thing except our Kiddie Boy? Come on, off to the locker room, the show doesn't wait for you. \" \"You bring the drinks?\" \"Sure, I do come before every show.\" \"Wow, you're cuming before the show starts? Is it the anticipation about the hot bodies? \" \"Get out before I call your babysitter.\" He disappeared actually, but still with a thick grin because of his joke. I cleaned the tables and washed the dishes, the rest was already done. While quite a few guests entered the club I took the tray for the boys and went to the back. As usual without knocking, I went in, but with my back first, waiting for the outraged sounds that told me that I should cover the eyes, but since no came they were all dressed. I put down the tray on the table and handed each a glass, I just didn't do it friendly with Mike. \"Good luck and lots of fun.\" I hugged Kid again before I went out again, and behind the bar. Mikes view: This morning Jo and Kid constantly hung together already and even now you could see how well they got along. For my taste a little too good, Kid was 19 and Jo was 27. It hadn't been that long since Jo and I laughed like this together, but she was still mad at me and I just couldn't find a way to change that. I remembered Brooke, it wasn't so complicated with her today, in fact we had get along very well. Jo and Brooke were very similar, both were self-confident women who weren't afraid to open their mouths, Jo was just a little more open up and not such a prude. But neither of the two were woman you could simply fuck and then never see again. Jo had once been so herself, but since she came back from Houston she had changed. And until now it hadn't been so positive for me. The bad thing about the two women was that I had no chance to go them out of the way. With Jo, I worked more or less and I saw Brooke mostly when I drove Kid. Maybe I should just continue to talk to Jo, she was in a good mood because of Kid. To homage the 4th of July we made a show in the military style and Dallas as Uncle Sam. As always, I focused on the show and made my thing. It was my job for which I was also very well paid, why should I give it up? As long as things didn't go with my furniture business, I could still make charcoal. But why did it bothered me so that Jo said it? It was important to me what she was thinking and I didn't want that she thought so badly of me. But at the same moment I didn't see any way how I could change her mind, maybe I had to prove her I simply was not only Magic Mike, but the Mike I liked to be and she liked. Of course I had Jo's approchement attempts always noticed and at the beginning I'd have maybe received it if she wasn't Dallas sister, but with the time I had realized that she was more important to me and I couldn't bare her in my life. But she saw it differently and now she hated me almost. How should I re-grade her trust, but the question was much more: Did I wanted it again, at least so that we would come back to our old relationship, or maybe something more. Brooke appeared more often in my head and I didn't know what the right thing was. Even though I had now spent more time with Kid's sister I still couldn't tell what was the right thing. Should I fight for Jo's and my friendship, so that it may be become more and simply leave Brooke or start experiments with Brooke and hope that Jo and I'd rebuild a normal friendship? ","Summary":" The hot sun was shining down into the garden. I had set myself on a chair in the garden in a bikini"},{"Movie":"Marx Brothers","Title":"Whistle in the Dark","Author":"MissFeral","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12304223","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The Marx Brothers decided to take a vacation one day. They went to England to visit the Dungeons of Warwick Castle. This castle was one of the biggest tourist-traps of dungeons. The four men took a wrong turn however. Instead of Warwick, they ended up in the Pontefract Castle. This castle was not a place for tourists. It was a place for suffering, pain, and torment. When they entered, the brothers were immediately seized by guards and taken to an enormous torture chamber. There were traces of blood on the floors and graffiti on the walls. Sections of human bones could be seen in the corners. Gray light came in through the small barred windows. Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo were all tied down to the racks. Because there were only three racks, there was no room for Groucho, so he was placed inside an iron maiden with only his head protruding. Luckily, he was so thin that the spikes inside couldn't reach him. But Groucho had to remain perfectly still in order to keep from being stabbed by them. Then a man in a black robe entered the room. His face was hidden by a hood. The brothers shook with fear as they awaited their fates. Harpo began to whistle frantically in an attempt to communicate with the torturer. \"Hey, you! This is all a big misunderstanding,\" Groucho tried to explain. \"We don't belong here. We haven't done anything wrong. We're taxpaying citizens! Isn't that right, Chico?\" \"Not exactly,\" Chico replied, \"We don't even live in this a country‚Ä¶\" \"My point exactly!\" Groucho exclaimed, \"If we don't live in this country, how could we possibly be in any trouble?\" The torturer just laughed and walked over to the racks. He grabbed the crank on Chico's rack and began to turn it slowly. \"Wait! You can't a do this to me! Don't I get a lawyer or a phone call or something?!\" Chico cried. \"He's right. We haven't done anything wrong. You must let us go,\" Zeppo said, calmly. Harpo just whistled noisily. The torturer put his hands over his ears. \"Will you stop that infernal chirping! It's getting on my nerves!\" With that, he grabbed a cloth and rolled it into a ball. He then stuffed it into Harpo's mouth to gag him. \"Don't hurt us,\" Chico pleaded, \"We can't stand pain!\" \"If you release us now, we won't press charges,\" Zeppo said. The torturer was silent for a moment. He seemed to be thinking. Harpo made muffled noises through his gag. \"I have an idea,\" said the torturer. \"I'll be right back. You gents stay right where you are‚Ä¶don't go away.\" With that, he walked out of the room with a dark chuckle. The brothers were alone again, but were scared stiff. Three of them strapped down to racks, one of them trapped inside an iron maiden. There was no way out and no one to help them. \"This looks bad‚Ä¶this looks a really bad,\" Chico lamented. \"I wish he would let me of this iron sarcophagus,\" Groucho said, glumly. \"I'm getting a terrible cramp‚Ä¶it started in my lower back and now it's headed straight down to my underpants area.\" \"Fellas, listen, we have to figure out a way to escape,\" Zeppo told them. Innocent, angel-faced Harpo could only look around helplessly at his panicking brothers. With a gag in his mouth, he couldn't give them any advice even if he got an idea. Then the torturer came back into the room, bringing in three goats on leashes. He put the goats in the middle of the room, and then walked over to Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo. He removed their shoes and socks. \"Hey, what's with the goats?\" Groucho asked from the iron maiden, \"What are you gonna do to my brothers?\" The torturer held up a bucket. \"See this bucket? It's full of salt water and the goats love to eat it. I'm going to pour it all over your bare feet and the goats will have a banquet.\" Groucho watched as the torturer poured a generous amount of salty liquid on his brothers' bare feet. When all was ready, the torturer released the goats and let them wander over to the helpless men. The thirsty goats sniffed the air and followed the tantalizing smell of the salt-drenched feet. Chico giggled and twitched as a goat began to nuzzle at his naked soles. \"Hehehe, no, stop it, hehe, go away‚Ä¶\" \"What do you expect to accomplish by doing this?\" Groucho asked the torturer. \"The goats have very rough tongues,\" the torturer replied, \"If they lick flesh long enough, it will eventually wear down until there is nothing left. Your brothers' feet will be licked right down to the bone.\" Groucho's eyes widened. \"Why, this is the wickedest thing I ever heard!\" The torturer chuckled darkly and sat down to watch the fun. The goat began to savagely lick Chico's soles, causing him to burst into hysterical laughter. \"NO STOP! THAT TICKLES! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA IT TICKLES SO BAD HEEHEEHEEHEEHEEHEEHEE!\" \"Good,\" said the torturer. \"But after a while the tickles will end and you'll be crying out in agony as the flesh is ripped right from your soles. Another goat came up to Zeppo and began to lick his soles. The youngest of the group held his breath and bit down on his lip. But soon he was laughing just as hysterically as Chico. \"HEEHEEHEEHEEHEEHEEHEHEHEHEHE NOOOO THIS IS INHUMAN! HAHAHAHAHAHAAAHAAHAHAHAHAHA PLEASE!\" Harpo could only produce muffled screams when a goat started licking his feet. Within seconds, tears were falling down his cheeks. The three men squirmed and struggled to free themselves but the racks held them securely. Their heads whipped from side to side, banging against the hard wooden board beneath them in the process. It wasn't long before all three of them had tears pouring down their cheeks. The goats dragged their long tongues up and down their soles and even licked between their toes. \"AAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! OOOOOHH PLEASE MAKE THEM STOOOP! HEEHEEHEEHEEHEEHEEHEE I CAN'T STAND IT! I'M TICKLISH! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAVE MERCY!\" Chico screamed, fighting against his restraints. \"THEY'RE GONNA KILL US! HAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA! HEEHEEHEHEHEHEHEHEHHEHEE! WE'RE GONNA DIE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH LAUGHING!\" Zeppo shrieked. Harpo's face turned a darker shade of red than the others. With the gag crammed into his mouth, he was unable to let the laughs out and it drove him mad. It was getting terribly hard to breath. Tears streamed down his face in rivers. Half an hour passed before the ticklish threesome was finally given a break. The goats started to lose interest in their feet when the salt solution ran out. So, the torturer grabbed the bucket and applied more salt water to their feet. He noticed that their soles had turned bright pink from all the licking. The goats resumed licking and the dungeon was filled with howls of laughter once again. The torturer knew that after another hour or two, the poor saps would be screaming in agony instead of laughter. He grinned sadistically at the thought. It made him so happy to see people in pain. Groucho was understandably disturbed to see his brothers suffering this way. He wanted to cover his ears but he couldn't reach them. \"Hey, can you let them rest? Everything echoes in this iron chamber!\" The torturer didn't reply. Groucho wasn't sure if it was because he didn't hear him or because he was just ignoring him. Either way, Groucho knew that neither he nor his brothers were getting out of there anytime soon.[Chapter 2] Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo were eventually released from their torture devices, only to be led by guards to another room. This room was similar to the first one they had been in. There were many creative devices and tools placed around the room ‚Äì each one designed to cause pain to prisoners. Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo were still barefoot. The soles of their feet had been licked raw by goats. Simply taking a step was an extremely painful experience for the poor guys. Groucho was relieved to get out of the iron maiden but he wondered what kind of anguish they would be put through next. There were several sets of iron handcuffs lined up against the wall. The cuffs were attached to chains so that the victims wouldn't be able to escape. Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo were chained to the wall with their hands over their heads. They were stretched out so they could only stand on their tiptoes. Groucho expected to be chained up as well but he was left alone. \"It's time for the second session of your torture,\" said the torturer. \"No more tickling!\" Chico begged, \"Our poor feet can't stand anymore.\" \"Mine hurt like the dickens,\" Zeppo whimpered. Harpo tried to whistle his protests but he still had the gag in his mouth. The torturer pulled out a knife and walked over to the defenseless men. They cried out in fear as they thought he would kill them, but instead, he cut their shirts right off their bodies. Now bare-chested, the brothers wondered what the torturer had planned for them. Then the torturer walked over to Groucho and whispered in his ear, \"Tickle the shit out of them.\" \"What?! Are you crazy?\" \"Do it or I'll slit their throats,\" said the torturer as he waved the knife. Groucho didn't have a choice. He walked up to Chico, who was looking at him with confused eyes. \"What did he tell you to do?\" Chico asked. \"He, uh, told me to tickle the shit out of you. Sorry, old pal.\" \"NO! You can't!\" Chico cried. Groucho leaned close to him and whispered, \"Look, he says he'll kill you if I don't. Just try to hold out, okay?\" \"Okay,\" Chico said, meekly. Groucho brought his hands close to Chico's bare waist, causing him to flinch away in horror. \"No, wait! I changed my mind!\" Chico blurted out. Groucho grabbed his brother's stomach with gentle hands and began to squeeze it. Chico burst into squeals of laughter. He struggled and squirmed, rattling his chains as he tried in vain to pull his arms down. \"AAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA STOP PLEASE! DON'T TICKLE ME AHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHA! HEEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEE!\" Groucho ignored his pleas, though it pained him to do so. He scribbled his fingers all over Chico's naked belly and ribs. Chico threw his head back as he howled with laughter. He tried to kick but the guards had tied his legs together to limit movement. \"I hate to do this,\" Groucho told him, \"but I trust you'll forgive me.\" \"Don't forget his belly button,\" said the torturer. Groucho stuck his index finger inside Chico's belly button and wiggled it around, causing Chico to nearly jump out of his chains. \"AAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA! NOT THERE! NOOOOOO PLEEEEASE STOOOOP! HEEEHEEHEEHEEHEEHEEHEEHEE! IT TICKLES SO MUCH HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\" Chico screamed, tears flowing freely down his cheeks. Groucho continued scratching the inside of his brother's naval with his finger. He cringed at his brother's shrieking laughter and pleas for relief. He wanted to show mercy but how could he? The evil torturer wouldn't allow it. Groucho had no choice but to tickle torture Chico until he was given permission to stop. \"Hey, can I stop now?\" Groucho asked, \"I think he needs a break.\" \"You'll stop when I say you can stop!\" barked the torturer. The tickling went on for ten minutes, which seemed like a thousand years to poor Chico. \"Now if you're satisfied, I would like to take my brothers and leave this crummy castle,\" Groucho said, \"We would like to go to a restaurant now. I have an appetite for something large‚Ä¶\" \"You want something large? That can be arranged.\" With that, the torturer reached into his cloak and pulled out a stiff brown feather more than twelve inches long. He gave the feather to Groucho and told him to get started on his kid brother Zeppo. \"Why?!\" Zeppo cried, twitching away as the feather teased at his bare stomach. \"Because you all trespassed on this property,\" explained the torturer. \"This is the penalty for trespassers. Now enjoy your suffering!\" \"No, Groucho, please‚Ä¶\" \"The bastard says he'll cut your throat if I don't tickle you,\" Groucho whispered. Zeppo took a deep breath and closed his eyes. \"Fine, just‚Ä¶just get it over with.\" Groucho started swirling the feather in big circles on Zeppo's belly. He let the tip of the feather slip into his belly button and also used it to brush along his ribcage. Within seconds, Zeppo was laughing hysterically and blubbering for mercy. \"NOOOOO AAAAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHA! STOP STOOOOP! HOOOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO THIS IS TORTURE! PLEASE AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\" Groucho rolled his eyes. How much longer must this madness go on? He had to figure out a way to escape but he couldn't think clearly, not with his baby brother laughing his head off and crying to him for mercy. It upset Groucho very much. \"Get his armpits! I want to see those tears!\" barked the torturer. \"Whatever you say, your majesty,\" said Groucho, sarcastically. \"Your wish is my command‚Ä¶\" \"NONONO NOT THERE! PLEEEEEASE AAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH STOOOOP! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA NOOOO MOOORE!\" Zeppo wailed as Groucho tickled his underarms with the huge feather. \"Laugh till you pee, junior,\" chuckled the torturer. \"Shut up, Grim Reaper,\" mumbled Groucho. The tickle torture of Zeppo lasted for ten minutes. Then the torturer looked over at Harpo and said, \"Last but not least‚Ä¶\" \"No, not Harpo!\" Groucho protested. \"Yes! Yes, Harpo! Get to it!\" \"I can't do this anymore,\" Groucho lamented, \"Haven't you got a heart somewhere in that cold, wicked body of yours?\" The torturer yanked out his knife and put the blade against Harpo's throat. \"I said GET TO IT!\" \"You have a special place in Hell waiting for you,\" Groucho said, angrily. The torturer laughed. \"I know. I've seen it.\" Groucho walked over to Harpo with despair in his heart. Why Harpo? Why sweet, innocent Harpo? With a heavy heart, Groucho dug his fingers into Harpo's belly and squeezed it mercilessly. He wiggled his index finger around in his belly button and scribbled on his ribs and in his armpits. Harpo had a gag in his mouth and all that could be heard was muffled laughter and screaming. He had tears running down his face within seconds. He bucked and squirmed and writhed. \"This is so fun!\" chuckled the torturer, \"I think I'll have to keep you gents here for a long time to come!\" After Harpo had his turn being tickled, the guards came in and dragged the four brothers to another part of the dungeon. The men were thrown into separate cells, where it was pitch black and dirty and lonely. Here they would stay until the next session of torture. Harpo was finally able to take his gag off. He tried to cheer himself up by whistling a happy tune.[Chapter 3] The guys were released from their cells the following day and brought into a room. It took a moment for their eyes to get adjusted to the light after being in the dark for so long. There were four sets of stocks in the room. Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo were stripped of their shoes and socks and placed into the stocks. Their wrists and ankles were locked in tightly. Their toes were tied back with string to limit movement. The men were all trembling with fear except for Groucho, who just sat there with a look on his face that said, I'm getting tired of this game! Then the torturer walked into the room. He was an odd character, the torturer. The guys never saw his face because he always wore a black hood over his head. But just seeing that black figure moving towards them was enough to strike terror into the hearts of the Marx brothers. The guys had been through so much abuse already at the hands of this fiend. \"Good morning, gents!\" he quipped. \"Guards, bring them some bread and water. We have to keep them well nourished so they'll be in good shape for session three of their torture.\" The burly guard nodded and left the room for a moment. He returned carrying a sack of bread and a water jug. He strolled over to the brothers and crammed some moldy bread into their mouths. He grabbed their chins in his big hand and poured water down their throats. He would slap their faces if they let any bread or water spill out of their mouths. It wasn't the best breakfast the brothers had ever eaten, but they were starving. \"That will do,\" said the torturer, coming forward. The guard nodded and returned to his post. The torturer looked at the soles of their feet to see if they had healed from the goat tongue torture. \"Looks good down here,\" he told them. \"Your feet are almost back to normal. That's good.\" \"Why do you care?\" Chico asked, grimly. \"You no care what kind of pain we go through.\" \"No, I don't care,\" said the torturer. \"But I'm glad your tootsies are replenished because now they are all ready to be tortured again!\" \"Not more goat licking!\" Zeppo protested. The torturer shook his head. \"No, this time I'm going to get very hands-on. I'm going to have the enjoyment of tickling you myself‚Ä¶and I'm very good at it, believe me.\" \"Have you no mercy?!\" Chico cried. \"None,\" replied the torturer. \"Hey, is there something we can call you?\" Groucho asked out of the blue. \"I mean, since we've been spending so much time together, we should be able to call you something.\" \"What would you like to call me?\"asked the torturer. Groucho did his trademark eyebrow waggle. \"Oh, what a loaded question...Well, there are lots of things I would love to call you, but I can't say any of them in front of my kid brother Zeppo.\" \"Just call me Mr. Death.\" \"Death, eh? Where did you ever get such a jolly surname?\" \"Never mind!\" \"Well, Death, let's get down to business. So, what kind of inhuman torture are you going to inflict on us today? Scaphism, rats, choke pear, or bamboo shoots under our toenails?\" \"Take a guess,\" chuckled Death. \"Do anything you want to us, just don't tickle us anymore!\" Zeppo begged. \"We can't stand another second,\" Chico added. \"Well, that's too bad!\" Death sneered, \"Because you're going to be tickled anyway!\" \"But we apologized for trespassing in your castle,\" Chico reminded him, \"We no deserve to be punished anymore.\" Death glanced at Harpo. \"I noticed you haven't said very much.\" \"He's a mute. He no talk to anybody,\" said Chico. \"Do you want to get out of here?\" Death asked Harpo. Harpo nodded with great vigor. \"Open your mouth.\" Harpo opened his mouth and Death stuffed a ball gag into it. \"Hey, hey, why are you always gagging him?\" Groucho inquired, \"The poor soul doesn't talk.\" \"Maybe not, but he whistles and it drives me crazy,\" replied Death. \"You were crazy before you ever met my brother,\" Groucho retorted. Death came over and grabbed his throat. \"You will be the first one I torture!\" \"Oh, don't say that‚Ä¶you'll scare me,\" Groucho mocked him. Death growled and ran over to Groucho's stocked feet. He chuckled evilly as he rubbed his hands together and sat on a small stool. He ran his index fingers lightly up and down his exposed soles. Groucho didn't even react. Death began tickling faster, until he was scribbling his fingers all over Groucho's soles. No reaction. \"It's no fun having a victim that doesn't laugh, am I right?\" Groucho asked, smirking. Death began tickling Groucho's feet furiously, trying very hard to get a ticklish reaction out of him. \"Give up, sucker,\" said Groucho. Death stood up and shook his fist at the smug prisoner. \"I guess I'll just have to get out the thumbscrews for you!\" \"Oh goody, can I have a side of fries with that? That breakfast you gave us wasn't very filling.\" \"Shut up!\" \"Ooh, with lots of ketchup.\" \"Silence!\" Death raised a hand to smack him. \"Don't waste your time with him, boss. Torture the other prisoners,\" said the guard. \"I think I will. Put the thumbscrews on this one!\" \"Yes, boss.\" The guard got out four thumbscrews‚Ä¶two for his thumbs and two for his big toes. \"Uh oh‚Ä¶I think this is gonna be the most painful thing I've ever felt,\" Groucho said, nervously. Meanwhile, Death was about to get started with his three ticklish victims. He pulled out a huge red feather and began to tickle Chico's bare feet. \"AAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I NO CAN STAND IT! PLEASE STOP! HAHAHAHAAAAAHAHAAHA! STOP TICKLING MY FEEHEEHEEHEEHEET!\" Chico screeched. \"Coochie coochie coo,\" Death teased happily. He let the feather glide slowly along Chico's soles. \"PLEASE HAAAHAHAHAHAAAAAAHAHHAHAHAHAHA! HELP, HELP! HEEHEEHEEHEHEHEHEHEEE!\" Death dragged the feather back and forth between his toes and also tickled the undersides of them. \"This little piggy went to market. This little piggy stayed home‚Ä¶\" Chico threw back his head and screamed with laughter. His toes were his weakest spot. He bucked wildly in his seat as he tried in vain to pull his feet away. His face turned beet red and huge tears ran down his cheeks. Death tickled him nonstop for thirty minutes. Then he strolled over to Harpo and sat down beside his restrained bare feet. Harpo panicked and tried to pull his feet away but the stocks held his ankles firmly in place. Death laughed at him. \"Nervous, silent boy? You should be!\" With that, he glided the feather up and down Harpo's naked soles, causing him to explode with muffled screams and cry tears of mirth. \"Tickle tickle tickle!\" Death said, chuckling. Harpo's face turned beet red as he struggled frantically. All that could be heard was his muffled squeals. Death tickled him relentlessly for thirty minutes. He then moved over to Zeppo, who was cringing and whimpering with fear. \"No‚Ä¶please,\" Zeppo whined. \"I hope you enjoy your suffering, junior,\" Death taunted as he stroked the feather along Zeppo's soles. The young man was too weak to fight it. He burst into cackling laughter immediately. He threw his head back and bucked in his seat, but there was no escaping the tickle torture. \"AAAAAAH HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! NOOOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO! STOOOOP I CAN'T TAKE IT! PLEEEEASE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\" Zeppo screamed. \"You really do seem to be enjoying this!\" Death said, laughing. \"NOOOO HAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA NO MOOORE! HEEHEEHEHEEHHEHEEHEHEHE ANYTHING BUT THIS!\" Death dragged the feather back and forth between his toes, while he used his fingers to scratch his heels and arches. He kept this up for thirty minutes. \"Well, I trust you all had fun during this third session of torture,\" said Death, when he was finally done. \"You‚Ä¶you can't do this to us!\" Zeppo sobbed. \"I can and I am.\" \"You won't get away with this. OW! You'll be hearing from my lawyer. OW!\" said Groucho, who was getting his thumbs and big toes pinched rather painfully by the thumbscrews. Death laughed as he walked out of the room. \"Guards, throw them back in their cells! Be sure to give them plenty of food and water. I don't want them to die until I've finished having fun with them. Tomorrow will be session four of their torture. Mwahaha!\" ","Summary":" The Marx Brothers decided to take a vacation one day.

En 2005 los creadores de la Edad de Hielo dieron lugar a una nueva entrega de la compa√±√≠a de Blue Sky Studios llamada Robots, aunque para mi esta ha sido una de mis mejores pel√≠culas de todos los tiempos, posiblemente de toda mi vida. Pero con el paso del tiempo he ido vi√©ndola como una pelicula de culto que deber√≠a haberse tomado en cuenta. Y no solo por la expectaci√≥n que ten√≠a, sino mas bien porque su protagonista Rodney Hojalata, es uno de mis mayores h√©roes de todos los tiempos, el primero que valore desde mi infancia. Pero ahora que han pasado mas 10 a√±os, nadie le ha vuelto a prestar atenci√≥n, ni siquiera como para que uno haya pensado en hacer alg√∫na secuela, aunque para mi, tengo mis propias ideas. Y he aqu√≠, una lista de 10 cosas que quiero volver a ver en una secuela de Robots, la secuela que jamas llegaremos a ver por muchas ansias que tengamos. 10¬∑El resto de la familia de Rodney Hojalata: Al principio de la pelicula original se muestra como Rodney crece junto a sus padres: Herb y Lydia Hojalata, y a pesar de estar ellos dos solos, se mencionan a unos cuantos familiares que nunca aparecen, como el primo Jeffrey o la prima Monica que le regala una de sus actualizaciones, quisiera ver en alg√∫n momento si aparecen todos los familiares juntos en un mismo lugar para as√≠ saber bien como influenci√≥ ahora Rodney Hojalata en la vida de los dem√°s al ser ahora el futuro sucesor de Gran Soldador. Aunque tambi√©n esta que se podr√≠a ver al resto de la familia de otros personas, como el de Cappy y saber su apellido, a mi me gusta la idea de Brickster, Brick(ladrillo), porque su padre es heredero de una gran fortuna de empresas que proporcionan la construcci√≥n de la mayor√≠a de los edificios del mundo, hasta la propia mansi√≥n de Gran Soldador fue construida gracias a esa propia compa√±√≠a. 9¬∑El origen de la Chop Shop: Uno de los mayores lugares de toda la pel√≠cula es el Chop Shop de Madame Gasket, el chatarrero palacio-fortaleza que se oculta bajo tierra despedazando a todos los robots de Ciudad Robot. Nunca se supo muy bien como llego a construirse sin enterarse nadie o como hizo Madame Gasket para crearse toda aquella legi√≥n de culto de chatarreros dispuestos a conquistar el mundo. Pero despu√©s de que Rodney venciera a Gasket y a Ratchet, la Chop Shop quedo inutilizada sin saber despu√©s que pudo pasar, podr√≠an haberla cerrado o convertirla en una carcel de m√°xima seguridad para poder meter dentro a todos los presos que hicieron durantes las rebeliones de actualizaciones que provocaba toda la gente desesperada por querer mas actualizaciones que sirviesen. Una de estas dos cosas quiero ver y tambi√©n un expl√≠cito origen que me lo cuente. 8¬∑El robot Disc-jockey: Uno de los mas particulares personajes que aparecen a modo de cameo, es √©l robot disc-jockey con el que se encuentra en un momento Rodney es un robot de cuerda rojo que baila break-dance en el metro y apenas se sabe lo que dice, la ultima vez que lo vimos fue bailando junto con Piper como interes√°ndose. La verdad, me gustar√≠a volver a ver este personaje solamente como por unos minutos como para saber bien si este personaje tiene algo con Piper o no, a mi me gustar√≠a que hubieran estado juntos durante un tiempo pero la relaci√≥n no hubiera funcionado debido a que ambos son incompatibles, y encima Piper todav√≠a sigue encari√±ada con Rodney a pesar de que ahora √©l esta con Cappy y le resultar√≠a imposible mostrar sus sentimientos. 7¬∑El baile pelea sobre una pista de bolas: Uno de los momentos culminantes y desternillantes de la pelicula es cuando Manivela le roba el pie a Rodney y entonces estos se pelean patinando sobre una pistola de bolas pero de una manera que acaba resultando mas un baile que otra cosa y del cual acaba dejando decapitado a Manivela, cada vez que veo me echo de la risa y quisiera volver a ver este hecho de nuevo pero seguramente con otros personajes porque no creo que se vuelva a repetir el mismo suceso aprop√≥sito, a√∫n as√≠ espero que muchos hechos mas ocurridos vuelvan a pasar para hacernos acordar de que hasta el mas m√≠nimo chiste siempre cuenta. 6¬∑La canci√≥n Baby One More Time de Britney Spears: Al igual que se ve un peque√±o gui√±o sin darnos cuenta, otro de los momentos mas desternillantes es √©l baile inesperado de Manivela en el que imita a Britney Spears para acabar con los robots chatarreros. Hay alg√∫nos que se quejan de esto pero para mi es otro momento culminante que quisiera que se volviera a repetir aprop√≥sito, imagemonos a un mont√≥n de soldados robot siendo controlados por la canci√≥n y bailando al ritmo de una bola de discoteca. 5¬∑Alexs Syntek: As√≠ es, el propio Aleks Syntek que creo el tema original \"Un heroe Real\" para Latinoam√©rica acaba teniendo su propio cameo importante como un robot, al igual que se ve en el clip original que aparece como la ilustraci√≥n de transformaci√≥n de un ser humano a robot. Existen muchos cameos pero solamente hay uno mas importante y es el del popular cantante para dar cr√©dito a que todav√≠a existe el pasado del que se creo la pelicula y Aleks Syntek es uno de los momentos importantes en la creaci√≥n de la pelicula y quisiera verlo tocando como un m√∫sico importante en ese mismo lugar. 4¬∑El sistema de transporte por bolas y rampas: Otra de las grandes partes desternillantes de la pelicula es la de cuando Rodney y Manivela est√°n metidos en una bola y acaban siendo lanzados hasta acabar en una especie de monta√±a rusa conectada por varias rampas que hay por toda la ciudad y eso acaba haciendo que llegue hac√≠a donde esta el edificio de Industrias Gran Soldador. Seguramente en un futuro cercano Rodney acabara quitando ese sistema por uno mucho mas f√°cil debido a que la primera vez que se monto no le cayo muy bien. Aunque todo haya cambiado, quiero volver a ver otro de estos intentos de ser lanzados a trav√©s de una bola y pasar por todo tipo de artilugios particulares. 3¬∑El baile del \"Junk\": En la escena final todos terminan cantando a ritmo de Herbert Hojalata escuchandose Get up off that thing de James Brown y luego Manivela acaba diciendo que esto es como una mezcla entre Jazz y Guitarra, eso quiere decir: Cha-tarra (J-unk) y todos acaban bailando de una forma muy particular con todos los personajes. Este tipo de baile casi significa para mi como lo mismo que todo lo dem√°s y quisiera volver a verlo pero tom√°ndoselo como algo personal y muy iconico. Ahora imagin√©monos que todos bailan el mismo baile en los finales de cr√©dito pero con todos los personajes bailando de una forma que parece sacada de un videoclip, esperemos que volvamos a verlo de nuevo y hagamos el Junk. 2¬∑Rodney y Cappy una relaci√≥n juntos: La pareja de Rodney Hojalata y Cappy Brickster ha sido una de mis preferidas de todos los tiempos, pero despu√©s de que se terminara la pelicula jamas supe si aquella relac√≠on fue algo en serio o no porque como ahora sabemos nunca sabremos el futuro de Rodney Hojalata, y quisiera volver a ver estos dos juntos relacionadose como una pareja de verdad para as√≠ aclarar todos los hechos que no entendimos a lo largo de la pelicula. Tambi√©n imagin√©monos como pensar√≠an sus padres al respecto sobre que est√©n juntos, jamas supimos de la familia de Cappy pero esperemos conocerla si es que hay alg√∫n futuro para estos dos. Y se√±oras y se√±ores, llega la ultima cosa que quiero ver y es: 1¬∑Una larga de lista de cameos de todo tipo de famosos en las que aparecen sus nombres haciendo referencias a cosas de mec√°nica o de ciencia-ficc√≠on: Como se vio en la pelicula cuando Manivela muestra su mapa de famosos se ven todo tipo de gui√±os como: Irons Jeremy o Britney Gears, y eso me ha dado una idea para hacer que hayan mas famosos apareciendo y con sus nombres alterados para que parezcan cosas mec√°nicas, como por ejemplo: Irons Jeremy, Britney Gears, Jay Tecno, Bruce Charger, Tom Hardcore, Mark Stronger, Code Stoll, Jack Hack, Lars Cog Trier, Chain Saban, Trans Zimmer, Jennifer Charge, Dominic Tech, Will Flasher, John Static, Clock Williams, Hard Nicholson, Junkie XL 2.0, Daniel Clank, Conan O'Brain, Tom Crusher, Kevin Contact, Katey Bits, Megan Borg, Shifter Labeouf, Scarlett Joystick, James Mecha Jones, Ryan Reyshock, Nexo Lucas, John Botman, Emma Warshot, Terrence Malware, Amanda Shotgun, Emily Browshield, Lightning Neeson, Jason Battlefield, Charlie Dex, Paul USB Anderson, Michael Shockgun, Kellan Lightspeed, John Cash, Katie Hardware, Jake Gyllenhalf, Michael J. Tron, Steven Spielbrast, Jonah Chip, Ron Plasma, John Powers, Damian Slasher, Sam Nitro, James Arnold Stacker, Pierce Brontatic, John Malcrawler, Nicholas Hit, Josh Booster, Dennis Quantum, Colin Blitz, Hugh Jackpot, Oscar Instagram, Josh Hutcherbolt, e invitado especial: El Critico de la Nostalgia alias el Cyborg de la Nostalgia. Pues ah√≠ esta, estas son las diez cosas que quiero ver en una secuela de Robots, esperemos de que todo siga igual como la original y veamos grandes regresos como: Jack Hammer, el Sr. Gunk, y ese hombre de Hojalata del Mago de Oz. Diez a√±os han pasados y esperemos de que nada haya cambiado, por el futuro de Rodney Hojalata. FIN.

UN CUENTO SINIESTRO Y SOCIAL SOBRE LA VIDA DE UN ROBOT QUE ALCANZO SU MAYOR MERITO. Lo alcanzo, alcanzo su mayor √©xito que nunca antes hab√≠a podido so√±ar. Rodney Hojalata consigui√≥ ser el nuevo fundador de Empresas Gran Soldador, su mayor heroe de toda la vida y el hombre que le convirti√≥ a si mismo en su propio heroe. Despu√©s de vencer a Ratchet y a su diab√≥lica madre \"Madame Engranaje\", consigui√≥ recuperar la paz que nunca antes hab√≠a tenido Ciudad Robot, hab√≠an pasado cinco a√±os desde que Gran Soldador recupero su empresa, pero despu√©s de eso sufri√≥ una crisis de engranajes y tuvo que jubilarse, despu√©s de eso tuvo que acudir a su nuevo sucesor, el, que le prometi√≥ ser el heredero de su empresa, lo consigui√≥ y al poco rato se volvi√≥ muy famoso, se convirti√≥ en el robot mas popular del momento, los hombres sent√≠an aclamaci√≥n por el, y las chicas lo adoraban. Pero el ya no lo necesitaba, ya que hace tres a√±os se caso con la mujer a la que le ayudo a poder vencer a la empresa corrupta que hab√≠a inventado Ratchet, Cappy, durante ese tiempo se convirti√≥ en la persona mas especial para el, ademas de su padre claro, que el siempre ser√≠a su heroe mas grandioso. Durante ese tiempo, estuvo trabajando en nuevos tiempo que har√≠an mejorar el mundo a un lugar mas avanzado, hab√≠a inventado tantas cosas que casi podr√≠a superar al mismiso Gran Soldador, pero despu√©s de ese tiempo, las cosas hab√≠an empezado a cambiar mucho. Se pasaba todos los d√≠as en su enorme despacho, en lo alto de la torre, toda una sala blanquzca y plateada que lo refleja como si fuese todo met√°lico, la Empresa se hab√≠a convertido en su nuevo hogar ahora, viv√≠a y trabajaba ah√≠ todos los d√≠as, no hab√≠a ni un dia en que no pudiese volver a casa en su hogar en Ciudad Remache, le encantaba la idea de volver a su tierra natal, pero ahora Ciudad Robot se hab√≠a convertido en su nuevo hogar, y no pod√≠a rechazarlo por nada del mundo. Eran casi las diez de la noche y segu√≠a trabajando en registrar las nuevas visitas de nuevos inventos, estaba en la punta del extremo sur de la mesa que casi cubr√≠a toda las sala, ten√≠a un ordenador port√°til, uno de los inventos que hab√≠an hecho cambiar la ciudad, con solo pulsar una tecla ya parec√≠a que todo se solucionaba, pero a la hora de la verdad era algo tan complicado como aburrido, ya casi ni se acordaba de como era en sus tiempos cuando constru√≠a cosas en su habitaci√≥n, hab√≠a inventado de todo, pero su mayor invento hasta la fecha era su compa√±ero mascota Wonderbot, su mejor amigo despu√©s de Manivela. Despu√©s de un tiempo casi parec√≠a que eran como hermanos, a pesar de que siempre se llevaba la consecuencia de sus desastres, aunque estaba claro de que no siempre se las llevaba todas, ya que el segu√≠a con ese problema de que dec√≠a que todas sus partes se le ca√≠an, hab√≠an pasado cinco a√±os y no cambiaba nada, y eso de que estaba casado con aquella extra√±a mujer que hab√≠a conocido una vez en la Fiesta Anual de Gran Soldador, nunca entendi√≥ que ve√≠a aquella mujer en el ya que siempre se la pasaba siendo un mentiroso, en cambio parec√≠a que hab√≠a encontrado a su media naranja. Se acosto encima del rezago de su asiento reclinable, estaba agotado de tanto trabajar, se pasaba todo el dia haciendo lo mismo, quer√≠a volver a ser quien era, el joven invento que casi no aspiro a nada, que se pasaba todo el tiempo inventando cosas que casi siempre acababan en desastres. Desde todo ese tiempo, se le hab√≠a venido una paranoia, una extra√±a sensaci√≥n que le dec√≠a que ten√≠a que abandonar todo trabajo que hab√≠a hecho. ¬øQue estas haciendo Hojalata? ¬øQe es lo que pretendes? ¬øAcabar con todo tu m√©rito? ¬øTu carrera? ¬øEs eso lo que quieres hacer? ¬øSer borrado y volver a ser un don nadie? Te esta matando el estr√©s amigo. Hasta la voz en su cabeza le reprochaba que no ten√≠a que hacer lo que obviamente iba a hacer, desde hac√≠a un tiempo ten√≠a esa extra√±a voz mental que le obligaba no dejar ser quien era, no entend√≠a que era pero si supo ponerle un nombre como lo hac√≠a con sus cosas: \"Paranoia\" No sab√≠a lo que era Paranoia, pero de todas formas dejo dejarla en su cabeza porque al menos le serv√≠a de algo, le serv√≠a para poder enfrentarse a sus peores miedos, y su peor miedo era darse cuenta de que estaba atrapado en una vida de la que le estaba matando de estr√©s. Se levanto porque ya estaba cansando de estar sentado y estar tocando aquel aburrido ordenador, despu√©s de eso, se giro y fue en direcci√≥n al grupo de ventanas grandes que hab√≠a delante, se quedo delante de la ventana, desde ah√≠ observo toda Ciudad Robot, toda cubierta a oscuras y con las luces prendidas casi formando figuras. Al ver esa imagen se le vino toda una serie de remordimientos que hab√≠a tenido al llegar a la ciudad por primera vez, casi la √∫nica forma de llegar a la Empresa, era con aquel sistema que consist√≠a en un juego de bolas, como un Pinball, pero desde entonces ahora que el ten√≠a las llaves al reino futurista, lo hab√≠a mejorado todo, ahora ya se usaba un sistema ferrocarril de trenes que circulan por un puente v√≠as que colgaban de torres, entonces pens√≥, que si el no hubiese llegado, nada de eso habr√≠a existido hasta ahora. ¬øNo intentes pensar en eso? ¬øSabes acaso lo que has hecho? ¬øHas potenciado al limite la ciudad? ¬øAhora esta todo conectado? ¬øImaginate lo que hubiera hecho Ratchet si lo hubiera transformando todo a su manera? ¬øEstar√≠a la gente orgullosa de el? No. Pero de tu si. As√≠ que no lo destruyas, o te arrepentir√°s por el resto de tu vida. Hasta la voz en su cabeza lo ten√≠a bastante claro, quer√≠a seguir teniendo lo que ten√≠a, pero el no hab√≠a so√±ado con estar trabajando de esa manera, el quer√≠a estar inventando cosas, tener una vida junto a Gran Soldador, pero ahora el ten√≠a a toda una familia y a un mont√≥n de gente que depend√≠a de el, y eso era algo que no pod√≠a dejar atr√°s o se arrepentir√≠a. No te desesperes, sabes lo que estas haciendo, y no puedes arrepentirte de ello. Paranoia ten√≠a raz√≥n, no pod√≠a arrepentirse de esa vida, hab√≠a logrado obtener lo que nadie jamas hab√≠a tenido en mucho tiempo, ten√≠a el puesto de Gran Soldador, y eso lo convert√≠a en el jefe de todo, ahora el ten√≠a para hacer cualquier, hacer que Ciudad Robot fuese un lugar mejor, tanto que ni pod√≠a verlo con sus propios ojos, ten√≠a que verlo con los ojos de todo el mundo, hacer que la gente viese un futuro mejor para todo el mundo, ten√≠a que hacerle ver a la gente como ve√≠a las cosas, hacer que la gente fuese como el, que so√±ase como el, y lo ten√≠a casi conseguido. Dejo de mirar la ventana, ya hab√≠a visto suficiente, ahora decidi√≥ terminar con todo. Era mas de la noche, a esa hora ten√≠a mucho sue√±o, no hab√≠a dormido bien en mucho tiempo, desde que hab√≠a logrado obtener el puesto, se hab√≠a pasado todo el dia trabajando sin descansar, quer√≠a hacerlo bien, tanto que se olvidaba de su propia salud. Entro su ba√±o personal, el que antes sol√≠a ser de Gran Soldador, era como no, un enorme ba√±o enorme y con las esquinas circulares, pero desde que el se hab√≠a o√≠do, ahora estaba todo hecho para que el pudiese ser suyo, segu√≠a pareciendo circular pero ahora ten√≠a un retrete a su medida. Se puso delante del espejo y empez√≥ a lavarse los dientes con su cepillo el√©ctrico, que ademas era un robot que obedec√≠a sus ordenes, pulso el bot√≥n del medio y el cepillo empezo a vibrar, luego se lo puso en boca y empezo a ir movi√©ndolo de lado a lado mientras actuaba la pasta de dientes. Mientras se lavaba, observo delante de su espejo, su rostro, alg√∫nos rasgos faciales de el hab√≠an cambiado con el tiempo, se estaba haciendo cada vez mas adulto, eso significaba que pronto ser√≠a un hombre, pero no un hombre cualquiera, un hombre de hecho y derecho, un robot que se abalanza contra las decisiones con toda seriedad, eso era en lo que se estaba convirtiendo, y en lo que tendr√≠a que ser para el resto del futuro, lo que hay demuestra como el paso del tiempo demuestra el cambio que uno lleva dentro. No tomes esa idea como una excusa para poder hacer lo que pretendes. No lo conseguir√°s aunque no me escuches, en el fondo lo sabes, solo que te estas dejando llevar por tu mal conciencia, recuerda: Tu eres la conciencia, y yo soy la voz de la raz√≥n. Aquello voz le parec√≠a algo frustrante, no entend√≠a que era lo que pretend√≠a excepto ayudarle, pero nunca entendi√≥ como, porque solamente le frenaba de las malas decisiones, quiz√°s era eso lo que pretend√≠a, pero no pod√≠a estar seguro a ciencia cierta. Termino de lavarse los dientes, y luego hizo g√°rgaras, escupi√≥ y luego pulso el bot√≥n que limpiaba el lavabo, casi lo hab√≠a dise√±ado todo por gusto pero casi empezaba a aparecer que todo iba demasiado futurista. Sali√≥ del ba√±o y luego intento de pensar en que hacer, quer√≠a dormir pero algo le dec√≠a que no ten√≠a ganas de acurrucarse en la cama junto a su esposa, le encantaba estar con su mujer, pero a veces sent√≠a que ella no le destinaba ser su esposa, siente hab√≠a sentido que hab√≠a alguien mas que a lo mejor le estaba esperando, pero que ten√≠a que dar ese paso. De repente sinti√≥ una extra√±a sensaci√≥n de agobio que le perforaba la cabeza, algo le estaba haciendo da√±o. Ni te atreves, Cappy ha sido la mejor persona que has conocido y en la que te has destinado vivir a su lado durante el resto de tu vida, no lo desperdicies o tendr√°s malas consecuencias, esta vez, va mas en serio de lo que yo nunca he tenido. Rodney callo a Paranoia de un golpe en el aire, ahora le enfurec√≠a que estuviese esa voz perturb√°ndole en la cabeza de esa forma, ya no la aguantaba, quer√≠a el tener sus propias decisiones, quer√≠a el tener que decidir por si mismo, pero siempre hab√≠a una sensaci√≥n que le deten√≠a. Ya no aguantaba tanto agobio y estr√©s, era como si todo el mundo le estuviese matando, como un castigo por haberle arrebatado de la imagen antigua de la ciudad, pero eso era imposible, todo el mundo odiaba como estaban sucediendo las cosas, los Oxidados estaban siendo eliminados, los empresariales se hac√≠an con todo con tal de actualizarse f√°cilmente, casi hasta acabaron con Gran Soldador porque pensaban que era viejo y que sus ideas estaban pasadas de moda. Pero menos mal que el se hizo el heroe y dio la rebeli√≥n que todo el mundo quer√≠a, gracias a el, el mundo cambi√≥. Suspiro cansado, en serio estaba cansado, decidi√≥ dormir pero a solas, no quer√≠a volver a su dormitorio donde seguramente estar√≠a Cappy durmiendo de agotamiento, decidi√≥ dormirse en el sof√° que hab√≠a en su despacho principal. No renuncies Rodney, no renuncies. Le replicaba Paranoia intentando de hacerle comprender que no pod√≠a dejarse derrumbar f√°cilmente. Entro en su despacho, encendi√≥ la luz que hab√≠a al fondo, despu√©s de eso agarro una silla, decidi√≥ que como ya estaba ah√≠, decidi√≥ mirar un rato la tele, se sent√≥ en la silla negra que hab√≠a en un extremo y luego la giro para poder mirar la tele de pantalla plana que hab√≠a en un costado hueco de un armario que hab√≠a al lado, estaba lleno de libros de mec√°nica y tecnolog√≠a, todo aquello que hab√≠a aprendido a lo largo del preescolar ahora lo ten√≠a ah√≠ para cualquier ocasi√≥n. Agarro el mando a distancia y luego prendi√≥ la tele pulsando el bot√≥n rojo que hab√≠a en el extremo principal del mando. Puso la tele y se quedo mirando lo que estaba puesto, estaban dando las noticias y justo hablando acerca de la industria creada por el Presidente Rodney Hojalata, luego empezaron a decir acerca de la gran popularidad que ten√≠a, que como hab√≠an aumentando los precios en electr√≥nica y en maquinas gracias a que ahora hab√≠an vuelto todo el mundo a tener las ganas de seguir inventando. Miralo Rodney, ese mismo hombre del que hablan eres tu mismo, tu eres el hombre que les has devuelto sus sue√±os, sus ganas de inventar cosas, ahora deber√≠as de ser afortunado porque has conseguido lo que todo el mundo ha perdido, no lo desperdicies, o te arrepentir√°s como ya te he dicho anteriormente. Paranoia ten√≠a la man√≠a de estar teniendo la raz√≥n en todo, era verdad que les hab√≠a devuelto los sue√±os que casi muchos no consiguieron tener durante una gran decada, y en cambio ahora se arrepent√≠a de haber formando parte de ese logro, se estaba volviendo loco, tanto que su cabeza se estaba apretando sola, una extra√±a sensaci√≥n de vac√≠o le corr√≠a por su metal, un silencio extra√±o y desorientado se le ven√≠a cerca sin parar, una sensaci√≥n de presi√≥n se le acercaba hasta hacerle ver como era todo, como era el, como era el mundo, tanto que hasta le dio tanto miedo, que ni pudo soportarlo con firmeza, un murmullo le corr√≠a los pensamientos haciendo un entresijo entre si, cerro los ojos porque no soportaba esa sensaci√≥n, le daba miedo, mucho miedo, tanto que parec√≠a estar teniendo pesadillas con los ojos abiertos, todo era oscuridad, y esa oscuridad le consum√≠a. Se despert√≥, se dio cuenta de que se hab√≠a quedado dormido sin darse cuenta, se quedo tumbado en su silla en vez del sof√° que se encontraba a tan solo unos metros del escritorio, no entendi√≥ lo que paso, se quedo desconcertado de tanta amargura y desolaci√≥n, miro la hora, se fijo bien y se dio cuenta de que hab√≠a pasado como una hora y treinta y cinco minutos desde que se hab√≠a sentado, se hab√≠a dormido durante varios minutos y aquello no le hizo cambiar nada, se puso recto y luego cruzo los brazos sobre la mesa de escritorio, parec√≠a mas que hubiese tenido una siesta que tomarse un momento de relajaci√≥n. Estaba muy cansado, cansado de todo, de la vida, de lo que le sirvi√≥ todo eso, para poder estar agotado y sentirse frustado en sus pensamientos, ahora dedujo que a lo mejor Paranoia le hablaba. ¬øPorque Rodney? ¬øPorque? ¬øPorque toda esa desesperaci√≥n por poder abandonarlo todo a su suerte? ¬øEs que no te das cuenta de la vida que tienes? ¬øDe lo que has ganado? Y tambi√©n de lo que ganaron los otros. Por ejemplo: tu padre por fin se hizo m√∫sico, ahora se ha vuelto muy popular, al igual que tu, el siempre estar√° orgulloso del regalo que le diste cuando le volviste a ver despu√©s de tu batalla en Ciudad Robot. Y segu√≠a teniendo raz√≥n, Paranoia no paraba de hacerle afrontar la verdad, quer√≠a sentirse frustado pero no pod√≠a debido a que siempre le admit√≠a una gran verdad, ten√≠a raz√≥n acerca de que gracias a el le dio a su padre el sue√±o que quer√≠a, ahora por fin pod√≠a descansar en paz cuando llegase su momento, pero de que sentirse orgulloso, cuando tienes una vida que siempre perdura con la misma rutina de siempre, como es tener una vida, que se repite constantemente. Afrontalo, afronta tu destino Rodney Hojalata, este es tu destino. Despu√©s de pasarse varios minutos en su despacho, decidi√≥ salir a tomarse un momento de relajaci√≥n, se encontr√≥ de vuelta en el despacho principal, se notaba que no hab√≠a pasado nadie ah√≠ en ning√∫n momento, todos estaban durmiendo menos el, que se encontraba al borde del derrumbamiento por culpa de que no quer√≠a afrontar su logro, se sent√≠a desdichado de tener que trabajar as√≠, de inventor de esa forma, dedujo que a lo mejor todos los inventores jamas se sintieron as√≠, solamente el porque desconoc√≠a todo lo que hab√≠a creado a partir de ahora, pero no todo eran inventos, hab√≠a creado una familia, y su familia se encontraba en el dormitorio principal. Fue recorriendo todos los pasillos hasta llegar al apartamento que se encontraba a unos pisos mas abajo de la empresa, abri√≥ la puerta, se encontraba todo con las luces apagadas, no hab√≠a nadie que se hubiese quedado despierto a esas horas, entonces pens√≥ que a lo mejor su mujer ya se encontraba dormida a esas horas. Recorri√≥ los pasillos hasta llegar al dormitorio, la puerta estaba casi abierta, la movi√≥ un poco para poder fijarse que hubiese alguien dentro, observo que su mujer Cappy estaba tumbada sobre la cama cubri√©ndose de sabanas blancas, luego se movi√≥ cambiandose de lado, al lado hueco de la cama que era suyo, ni se hab√≠a dado cuenta de que no estaba su marido. Suspiro t√≠midamente, estaba claro que ella no se dar√≠a cuenta, cerro la puerta para que no le entrase la luz de afuera, al ver que ella estaba tranquila, decidi√≥ echarse una cabezada r√°pida en su sof√°. Se sent√≥ en su sof√° y luego agarro una lata de aceite efervescente, abri√≥ la lata oy√©ndose un sonido de crujido de gases, antes de nada, se agarro un vaso y luego puso todo el liquido de la lata, luego lo levanto y empezo a dar peque√±os sorbos del aceite. Se quedo un momento mirando la nada y pregunt√°ndose si todo eso lo merec√≠a, no pod√≠a imagin√°rselo por si mismo, pero entonces se giro a un lado y observo una foto en la que estaban sus padres junto a el, ellos se le aparec√≠an muy felices de estar con el, de estar contentos de haber fabricado un chico tan valiente y orgulloso como el. De pronto se le vino una idea en la cabeza pero no notaba que era exactamente. No lo adivines. Ya lo sabes de sobra lo que estas pensando. Paranoia ten√≠a mas raz√≥n de la que jamas tuvo, hay se dio cuenta, estaba orgulloso de tener todo eso porque sus padres estaban orgullosos de lo que era el, si el no estaba orgulloso de su logro, sus padres no estar√≠an orgullosos de en lo que se hab√≠a convertido hasta ahora, en un luchador, en un admirado inventor, en todo un heroe que siempre se hab√≠a levantado para poder seguir luchando otro dia, se levanto euf√≥ricamente, ahora supo lo que hab√≠a que hacer, ten√≠a que ser el mejor, el √∫nico en quien la gente pudiese confiar, alguien que supiesen que estar√≠a para poder ayudarles, ese era el, y ten√≠a que luchar por eso, o todo acabar√≠a en la ruina. Dejo el vaso con el aceite sobre la mesa y luego decidi√≥ volver adonde pertenec√≠a. Volvi√≥ a su despacho, y se puso de manera firme, y entonces dijo: Soy Rodney Hojalata, y estoy orgulloso de ser el jefe de Empresas Gran Soldador, y nunca voy a remitir sobre mi cargo bajo ning√∫na circunstancia. Bien hecho Rodney, al final has podido encontrar tu destino en tu vida, ahora gracias a eso, yo me ir√© y nunca mas volver√©, estoy agradecido de haberte sido de ayuda durante este tiempo. Adi√≥s. Dijo eso, y Paranoia jamas volvi√≥, se fue para siempre, la voz en su cabeza se hab√≠a ido, ahora solo quedaba la consciencia, una consciencia que se hab√≠a vuelto muy fuerte, y lo seguir√≠a siendo para siempre.

You would call yourself lucky if you got in since not everyone was qualified. After Phineas T. Ratchet took the charge, a new demand was put in place for job applicants: a robot without an upgrade wasn't allowed to the company. Cappy remembered the time she was forced to do the same. She had spent all her spare money on the newest upgrade, just to get the job she desired. She had never looked that shiny in her life but she hadn't been proud of her choice. Yet, Cappy has bought many other upgrades on the way, to the point where she no longer remembered what she used to originally look like. There was a price for her beauty and she wasn't talking about the money. The price was Ratchet, her boss. He has lusted over her from the day one and it was not pleasing. Maybe a bit flattering at first, but not anymore. And Cappy couldn't tell him to back off because Ratchet was the boss and she didn't want to get fired. Today was not any different. \"Sooo... Cappy, do you have any plans for this week? I was thinking you and I could have a dinner together at a fancy restaurant,\" Ratchet smooth-talked and leaned on her desk. Cappy was focused on working and paid no attention to the robot standing beside her. She only gave a brief excuse: \"Sorry, this week is fully booked up.\" \"You said the same last week. I'm sure you can find some room for relaxation and...,\" Cappy felt Ratched's fingertips brushing up her arm,\" for us .\" Cappy resisted the urge to make a disgusted face. She knew she couldn't keep up with excuses forever. Ratched was not giving up with her until she would submit. Cappy always tried to stay passive around her colleagues, not bringing up her opinions about Ratchet or anything else that was going on in the company. Somehow it only made Ratched think she was on his side. \"Uh, I'm not sure if I want to be in those type of restaurants... I'm more casual,\" Cappy answered and gave him a small polite smile. \"Ah, I see... Then how about we do something casual? Like a movie night at my place~?\" Cappy could hear the purr under his breath. She didn't dare to make an eye contact, knowing well what kind of face Ratched was making. \"Hm, perhaps it would be too much...,\" Cappy said and spin the chair and got off. She was done and needed a break. Of course, Ratched didn't get the hint and followed her, like the usual. He would leave her alone when he was needed at somewhere else. If no one was around, he got more flirtatious. Cappy was pretty sure this was called 'workplace harassment' and she has dealt with it over a year. But it wasn't enough to make her leave. If someone wanted her to leave, they would have to try their hardest. \"Okay, okay, I get! You wanna get to know the man first, right?\" Ratched reached to touch Cappy's shoulder as he spoke, \"And I wanna get to know you too, Cappy... If only you let me.\" She stopped walking and turned to him. The whole hallway was empty and Cappy mentally cursed for it. Ratched's smirk wasn't gone but he seemed a little surprised by her sudden act. \"Ratched...\" \"Call me Phineas,\" Ratched flashed his teeth. \"...Phineas, sir, I'm flattered by your words but... You're my boss and I'm your subordinate. We have talked about this before and my opinion hasn't changed. I want to keep romance and work separated.\" Ratched's smirk turned into a frown. He was not happy with the answer. He didn't give a damn about him being her boss because it wasn't a big problem. Workplace affairs were a thing and who would punish him for dating Cappy? No one. And Ratched wasn't accepting rejection. \"Cappy...,\" he spoke gently,\" who cares, honestly? If you're afraid of judgement from others, I'll make sure nothing like that happens. Just let go for once and let's have fun together,\" Ratched smirked again and leaned a bit too close, \"You wouldn't want to upset your own boss, right...\" There was something sinister in his voice as Ratched spoke the last words. Cappy wasn't a fool. Knowing her boss, Ratched would fire anyone who disagreed with him, or in Cappy's case, rejected him. If she gave an honest reason why she didn't want him, she would be outside the company immediately. She had to use her acting skills for emergencies like these which she had learned. Cappy forced a seductive smile and laid her hands on his metallic tie. Ratched's posture tensed and his eyes popped wide. \"Have I ever upset you, sir?\" Cappy asked as she looked into his brown eyes. \"You? Not really, you're one of the best in this company...\" \"If it's true, would you ever fire me?\" She asked and gave a brief yank on his tie. Ratched was clearly struggling with words now. It was strange how a confident robot like him became speechless every time she was acting like this. It was almost giving her boost for self-esteem, almost . \"Now that's a tough question... I'd like to keep you here.\" \"Then we don't have an issue at all. I always do my best and never bring your expectations down...,\" Cappy let her fingertips touch the metal under the tie,\" So if you excuse me, I'd like to go back working to keep you happy.\" With that, she let go and left frozen Ratched behind. That would pay her enough time to make up a better excuse for the next day. Someone would tell her to take an advantage of her beauty more often since it has given her more than she ever wanted in her life. Expect that was not true. Beauty always brought problems within her and she didn't want to meet more robots like Ratchet. ","Summary":" Working for Bigweld Industries was a huge deal in Robot city.

R.I.P Robin Williams, a truly talented man. This is basically just rewrite of the ending of the movie, but I just had to write about Rodney and Cappy. I know some people may feel that her presence was forced, but personally, I like the type of movies where the underdog gets the girl. This movie is so underrated, they are many puns in here which I didn't get when I was younger but now I do. I laughed my ass off at Fender's Britney scene because it was so freaking random and hilarious. The whole town plaza was suddenly filled with music. The lone blaring of the trumpet was now accompanied by an entire band, the beat of the music causing every robot to start dancing. Rodney smiled as he watched his dad fulfill his dream, swaying to the drums and the saxophone. He looked as if he hadn't aged, still that young and freshly oiled bot he once was. Rodney felt a tap on his shoulder blades and turned around, coming face to face with a gently smiling Cappy. She held out her hand, the sunlight glinting off the polished metal. \"Dance with me?\" Rodney took her hand in his, and they started swaying to the music. He felt slightly embarrassed when he spotted his mildly rusted hands in her spotless ones. Since the first time he set foot in the big city, Rodney felt inadequate. There Cappy was, a beautiful robot with the newest parts and him, a robot wearing his cousin's hand-me downs, that had long since felt like a second skin. He twirled her outwards, and she spun back into his arms quickly and gracefully. \"A spare part for your thoughts?\" Cappy asked, as if knowing what he might have been thinking. She held his hands tightly and this time, twirled him; completely changing the rhythm of the dance. Now, she was the one leading, and he had no choice but to follow her movements. Not that he was complaining of course. \"I was just thinking‚Ä¶\" Rodney whispered, his smooth voice barely heard over the loud rambunctious music. Cappy could distantly hear Fender talking, something about Jazz and Funk. She placed a hand on his waist and spun him out before tugging him back in. She laughed when he threw her an amused glare at her actions. \"Thinking about what?\" \"Why me? I mean, a bot like you could have anyone you wanted. Compared to Ratchet, my parts aren't as new or even remotely shiny.\" Rodney jumped when her fingers found the nape of his neck, massaging them lightly while they danced to the beat. Cappy looked at him incredulously, like what he said was so unbelievable, and he could almost feel his face burn with heat. \"You know Rodney, there's a lot more to a robot than just new parts.\" She told him honestly, and this time, made him spin her out before bringing her back into his arms. She placed her cool cheek onto his chest and marveled at the small whirring noises in his chest. Rodney made her feel safe, something not even Ratchet was able to do. He may have had money and newer parts, but ultimately, there was more to a bot than just that. \"Ratchet was horrible, manipulative and not to mention just plain creepy. You on the other hand, Rodney Copperbottom, are brave and kind. You were able to get Bigweld back on his feet and even saved Robot city.\" The music was now winding down; a smooth buttery beat that allowed everyone to gently sway with their respective counterparts. From where he was standing, Rodney could see Bigweld and Aunt Fanny in each other's arms as they danced to the soft flow of peaceful music. Cappy tilted her head up to meet Rodney's loving gaze. She smiled. \"If I was ever made to pick between you and ratchet again, I would pick you every, single, time.\" ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I do not own Robots the movie.

Como anteriormente dije en mi anterior fanfic, Robots es una de mis pel√≠culas favoritas de todos los tiempos junto con Rodney Hojalata mi seg√∫n mejor heroe de toda la lista de h√©roes que tengo. A pesar de que la pelicula se siente mas bien como una mas, yo la considero un cl√°sico de culto por sus memorables giros ir√≥nicos y personajes inolvidables. Han pasado como diez a√±os de todo esto y jamas antes se ha hecho una secuela esperando volver a Rodney Hojalata y a la pandilla de robots oxidados que est√°n siempre de su parte. Puede que jamas llegue una secuela pero ya tengo las suficientes ideas como para hacerme una posible idea de lo que ser√≠a una trama para la secuela. Como por ejemplo: Han pasado cinco a√±os desde que Rodney venci√≥ a la corporaci√≥n corrupta de Phineas T. Ratchet gracias a la ayuda de su despiadada madre que quer√≠a crear una nac√≠on anticulturista donde todos los robots fueron iguales y sin parecer oxidados y discontinuados, metieron a Ratchet entre rejas mientras Gran Soldador volv√≠a a su puesto de l√≠der de Industrias Gran Soldador permitiendo as√≠ obtener a todo el mundo nuevas actualizaciones con las que poder vivir pero sobretodo otorg√°ndole a Rodney Hojalata como su sucesor y futuro jefe de la industria como inventor y desarrollador de un mundo nuevo. Se hizo una familia con sus nuevos amigos y se quedo con Cappy como novia teniendo as√≠ una relaci√≥n que duro el mismo tiempo que todo lo dem√°s, pero al cabo de tres a√±os despu√©s Gran Soldador se quedo viejo y no tuvo otra opci√≥n que jubilarse quedandose a vivir en una residencia con Aunt Fanny, le otorgo el puesto a Rodney ah√≠ entonces comenz√≥ su nuevo mandato haciendo que todo inventor pudiera venir a la industria y crear lo que fuera, aquello hizo que la idea de poder inventar sue√±os se pusiera de moda al igual que convirti√≥ a Rodney en uno de los robots mas populares y queridos del momento. Cada uno consigui√≥ lo que quer√≠a excepto para Piper que todav√≠a segu√≠a queriendo a Rodney a pesar de que estaba con Cappy y no hab√≠a nada que pudiera hacer para demostrarle su amor, y eso de que encima estaba saliendo con el robot bailar√≠n de break dance que hab√≠a aparecido durante el regreso de Rodney a casa, pero aquello relaci√≥n jamas fue duradera. Con el paso del tiempo las cosas fueron bien hasta que de pronto varios inventores famosos empezaron a desaparecer misteriosamente y llego el rumor de que la ciudad se estaba infestado de robots extremistas que a√∫n segu√≠an defendiendo los intereses de Madame Gasket a√∫n estando muerta despu√©s de todo este tiempo. El ultimo de todos ellos fue Jack Hammer, el robot que una vez ten√≠a una tienda en Ciudad Robot pero ahora se hab√≠a convertido en otro de los grandes inventores del momento, fue secuestrado sin que nadie supiera nada de √©l pero tuvo el tiempo suficiente como para enviar un mensaje, una foto de un objeto que solamente Rodney podr√≠a descifrar. Aquella investigaci√≥n estuvo dirigida por el capit√°n del FRI (parodia del FBI) Miles Thrower que se dispuso a encontrarlos a todos pero para eso necesitar√≠a la ayuda de Rodney Hojalata. Rodney estaba viviendo su mejor momento dando nuevas ideas para hacer de ambos lugares un lugar mejor para todos los robots, se dispuso a hacer una nueva exhibici√≥n de un nuevo invento que har√≠a favorecer a todo el mundo, eso ser√≠a dentro de unos d√≠as. Mientras hac√≠a eso paso tiempo con la familia intentando de demostrar a los padres de Cappy que pod√≠a tener una relaci√≥n funcional con ella a pesar de lo que dijeran, pero por culpa de Manivela que ahora se hab√≠a convertido en su mejor amigo para siempre lo estaba chafando todos con sus tonter√≠as provocando as√≠ que los Brickster se enfadaran con √©l y no tuvieran su confianza, intentaba de tener una relaci√≥n duradera con Cappy pero no estaba funcionando y ten√≠a sus dudas al respecto. En ese momento apareci√≥ Miles exigiendo que √©l viniera con √©l para hacer un an√°lisis sobre la foto que hizo Jack Hammer antes de que desapareci√≥ de la faz del planeta, decidi√≥ ir con √©l pero junto con sus amigos ya que jamas los iba a dejar solos. Los llevo a su central donde les explico la lista de inventores secuestrados y aquellos que estaban contrachapados con Gran Soldador, de ah√≠ entonces marcharon a verle pero acabo siendo secuestrado por los hombres de Sprocket, pero antes de todo eso les explico que hab√≠a otro inventor que a√∫n no lo hab√≠an descubierto, fueron a verle y resulto ser el Sr. Gunk, el antiguo jefe de Rodney que lo hab√≠a tratado mal junto con su padre, lo sacaron de ah√≠ justo cuando los mercenarios de Sprocket llegaron para llev√°rselo. De ah√≠ podemos hacernos una idea de que seguramente ir√°n a ver a Ratchet para descubrir porque desea que Sprocket quiero raptar a todos esos inventores, escapara reuni√©ndose con su t√≠o donde ah√≠ empezara su maligno plan de destrucci√≥n masiva. Rodney y los suyos le vencer√°n, Ratchet se escapara dispuesto a cometer un nuevo plan por si solo para vengarse, pero por ahora Rodney cumpl√≠o su promesa de seguir inventando cosas nuevas, acceder√° a casarse con Cappy, Piper se quedara con Vixx al igual que ser√° el nuevo compa√±ero de Miles.

Cappy laughed. He was such a dork, but it was adorable. \"Never mind.\" \"I love you.\" These words took Cappy by surprise. He'd never said it so bluntly before, and it was so random. The look in his eyes was so sincere and honest, which really did sum Rodney Copperbottom up. She wrapped her arms around him, despite the awkward noise he made. \"I love you too,\" she whispered softly. It was just at that moment that Piper walked in, a slight hint of jealousy in her eyes as she saw the pair. Cappy jumped back quickly, avoiding the gaze of the younger yellow robot. Rodney was beyond embarrassed. He chuckled softly, walking away quickly with Cappy following him, trying not to laugh.

Now, most of you either forgot or have never watched the movie Robots. That is understandable since it's been like 10 years since it came out. Heck I only remembered it since I re-watched it a while ago! But I loved it, both back when I was a kid and now, so that inspired me to write this story. I'm still just a beginner at writing so just bear with me if I make any mistakes‚Ä¶ Anyway, this is going to be my first attempt at a reincarnation fanfic, and for once I already know the pairing of the story, unlike the other two I wrote. So I hope you enjoy it! ~‚Ä¶~ All he could remember was the heat from the explosion, surrounded by the screams of bystanders and the flashing lights of fire trucks. It happened too fast for anybody to quickly realize what was going on. Perhaps if somebody noticed that tiny gas leak, then his high school wouldn't be a fiery mess, and he would not have been trapped under a pile of rubble, and most importantly‚Ä¶ He would still be alive‚Ä¶ ~‚Ä¶~ He woke up feeling sore all over his body, which was to be expected after what he went through. It took him a while to fully regain consciousness, as he kept slipping in and out of unconsciousness. When he did though, he started panicking for a short while as he began examining his surroundings, which wasn't much considering he was lying on a bed in a blindingly white room. No more, No less. \"Oww‚Ä¶\" he groaned as he started sitting up, holding his head in an attempt to alleviate his killer headache. He then ran his hand through his dark hair while scanning the room for anything useful, but he gave a sigh as he realized all what was there was two doors and a small cushion. ' Might as well have a look around instead of just doing nothing' he thought as he got up, slowly trying to balance himself on his slightly wobbly feet, and after a brief moment of vertigo, he started walking towards one of the doors, but not before noticing the camera inconspicuously hidden behind the only non-white thing in the room, the cushion. When he opened door one, he was relieved to find that it was simply a small bathroom. He looked at the small mirror and subconsciously began touching his face. His memory was hazy, but even so, the events that occurred were forcibly implanted in his mind. Yet despite all that, his face was surprisingly the same as it always has been. His hazel eyes were examining the rest of his head, as he noticed how messy his dirty blond hair was. He also noticed how he was wearing a white shirt and black track pants, which was a bit surprising since he figured this was a hospital‚Ä¶ Right? Just as he was about to wash up, he heard a knock coming from the other door. Ignoring the alarm bells sounding in the back of his head, he made his way to the door. He placed his hand on the doorknob and hesitated for a while whether or not he should open, but was quickly snapped back to reality by another set of knocks. With a deep sigh, he slowly turned the knob and opened the door. He was a little surprised when he saw that the hall had several other rooms just like his, but what startled him more was the petite woman standing in front of him. He was slightly intimidated by her sophisticated aura. She pulled up her glasses and said: \"Oh good, you're awake. If you would please follow me, we have much to discuss.\" She didn't waste any time walking away, leaving him both stunned and highly confused. When the sound of her heels stopped, he snapped out of his trance and looked at her, finding her impatiently waiting for him to follow. He decided he might as well go with her, as she was currently his only lead on what was going on. As they were walking across the hallway, he took a peek at around. The all was just as white as his room was, and the actual rooms were almost identical. It was slightly creepy if not terrifying. He almost bumped into the woman as she abruptly stopped in front of an office. \"Veronica Bailey\" was placed on the door, and he assumed it was her name. She took out a small key ad unlocked the door. Her office was small, with just a desk and bookshelf on it. The bookshelf had a shit ton of files and folders in it that it seemed it was going to burst. \"Please, have a seat\" 'Veronica' instructed. He sat on the lone chair facing her desk as she pulled out a file and began searching through it, until she pulled out a piece of paper. \"Please read the information here and tell me if anything is amiss.\" He then took the paper and his eyes slightly widened. Victim Profile Name: Jake Wellington Age: 17 Height: 170cm Weight: 75 Kg Cause of Death: Smoke Inhalation Additional Details: Although the state of the body initially indicated that the victim was crushed to death, the autopsy report shows that he had already inhaled a significant amount of smoke beforehand during his attempt to save a fellow classmate. Furthermore, the victim suffered quite a few burns and lacerations all over his body. Jake just couldn't believe what he was reading. It was so bad that he couldn't stop the scream that escaped his mouth. \"AAAAH! WHAT THE HELL IS THIS!?\" he yelled while tossing the paper on the desk. He then started shivering from the shock of it all. \"Mr. Wellington, please settle down.\" Said the woman, unfazed, as though she was used to such reactions. Jake gave her a dirty look. \"Don't tell me to calm down! I-is it true? A-a-am I really dead? But how can I be? I'm right here aren't I?!\" he asked hesitantly, afraid of the response. Sure, he remembered the catastrophic incident, even if it was bits and pieces, but he's up and alive isn't he? Veronica, stoic as ever, said: \"Unfortunately, what you read is the truth. You died during an explosion that happened at your school. I'm sure you have many questions, but I need to ask you this first: Do you remember anything before waking up?\" Jake simply sat there, cowering in fear from what he just heard. How can this be? \"‚Ä¶ I remember lying down on the ground, surrounded by flames. The smoke was too much and something was crushing me. And then I fell unconscious and when I woke up, I was in that room‚Ä¶\" Veronica smirked a satisfied one for a split second before regaining her composure. \"Good. Now you must be wondering where you are. This place is called \"The Void\" . Think of it as a place hidden between the world of the living and the world of the dead.\" Jake just stood there, too astonished to respond. Veronica took it a sign to continue: \"Now as we all know, Humans either go to heaven or hell after death, based on their actions in life. However, for some of them, they get sent here and are given a choice: Either continue on to be judged, or get another chance at life. Reincarnation if you will.\" The last bit grasped his attention, as Jake stared at her with widened eyes. \"R-reincarnation? You mean the whole rebirth thing?\" said Jake, a little unsure of what to think right now. Veronica gave him a nod, before pulling out another paper and presenting it to him. \"Ultimately, the choice is yours. If you truly want a second chance then sign this. It simply asks that you will not blame us for anything that might happen, and that you will take full responsibility for anything you do.\" Jake took the paper from her and scanned through it. He then began debating with himself on what he should do. I mean, this death we're talking about here. Does he really want another chance? He has done his fair share of good deeds in his life, so he could just hope for the best and move one‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ there's that lingering feeling in his heart. It was not fair‚Ä¶ he wasn't ready to let go and move on just yet. But first, there was something he had to know. \"But‚Ä¶ wouldn't I just end up dying again? I mean I'm simply going to be reborn right?\" he asked, disregarding any knowledge he had on the concept of reincarnation. Veronica smirked, and it didn't fade this time. \"Trust me, if you do choose reincarnation, it definitely will NOT be the same.\" She said as she held out a pen for him to sign with. Jake took it from her hand, but he still had worries. He took a deep breath and began thinking it through one last time. He was leaning towards the rebirth choice. He was at the prime of his youth for crying out loud! He has yet to accomplish anything‚Ä¶ And so, with firm determination, he signed on the paper and gave it back to Veronica, who looked a bit too pleased with his choice. \"Well then, Congratulations, Mr. Wellington, and good luck in your new life\" she said, before leaning towards him with a comforting smile‚Ä¶ And that was all he remembered before he blacked out‚Ä¶ ~‚Ä¶~ \"Oh look! He's waking up! Our new son!\" Jake felt slightly groggy, and the voices he heard were not helping with his headache. As he slowly opened his eyes, he froze immediately. There were two towering people hovering over him, and the female looking one was holding him like one would hold a baby. Her face was slightly oval with a yellowish tint to it, and she also had bobbed brown hair fluttering about. \"Isn't he just cute?\" that came from the male looking one next to her. He was bald with a square face with a reddish tint. Oh, and did he mention that they were pretty much fucking ROBOTS?! A horrifying thought raced through his mind, and he slowly raised his arms to confirm it. He nearly fainted when his arm was not only the size of baby's, but was also green and made entirely of metal. He examined the rest of his body, ignoring the \"awws\" of the other two. His entire body was made of metal, and he could feel all the bolts and cogs inside him. He just wanted to scream as loud as he could, but all that came out were small baby cries. \"Oh hush‚Ä¶hush‚Ä¶ don't cry little one!\" He fainted once more, but not before having a single thought in his mind‚Ä¶ ' That bitch tricked me!' ~‚Ä¶~ Author's Note: This was more of a Prologue than anything‚Ä¶ So uhhh‚Ä¶ ya‚Ä¶ I used the clich√©d 'Between Life and Death Room' scenario. Although I will do my best to explain everything, having prior knowledge of the movie would help you understand the story more, however it's not a must. I hope you enjoyed reading this! Reviews are appreciated! Until Next Time![Chapter 2] Chapter 2: Adjustments Author's Note: Long time no see huh‚Ä¶ Been through a lot of crap the past couple of months, but now that it's summer, I can finally have a moment's peace! I literally have no idea where this story is going since I'm just the type of idiot that starts stories on a whim and never actually plans ahead‚Ä¶ I'm developing the plot as I write further. Hopefully I'll be able to produce something decent XD ~‚Ä¶~ Jake stared at the ceiling from the crib he placed in. After blacking out, the two robots, whom he now realized should be considered his new 'Parents', thought he simply fell asleep, rather than have a panic attack. He woke up much later, and spaced out as he began trying to digest all of what happened. ' Ok, I take it this is what she meant by it won't be the same thing.' He thought as he lifted his tiny, robotic arm. No matter how he went about it, he couldn't even begin to understand his current situation. When he agreed to the contract, he assumed he would be revived in a parallel world where the school explosion never happened. He never imagined he would be sent to an alternate universe dominated by robots‚Ä¶ Another puzzling factor was the fact that he was basically an infant. Why couldn't they just place him in a robot closer to his actual age‚Ä¶? Perhaps there was some hidden meaning to it all, but Jake couldn't really see it. He attempted sitting upright, but all he could manage was squirm around his crib. He deduced that his body was developed enough to accomplish anything. As to be expected from a baby. He wondered if Robots aged as slowly as humans did, for if that were the case, it was going to be a long time before he could try and figure out the circumstances of his current situation. On the bright side, being an infant means he has virtually no responsibilities. He supposed he would think of it as something of a break. The room started lighting up, and Jake looked out the window to be greeted by the sunrise. Well, the robot equivalent of a sunrise anyway. Still, the view was somewhat calming. Suddenly, he heard footsteps coming from somewhere, and all of a sudden his 'mother' peaked in on him. With a smile plastered on her robotic face, she leaned in and slowly caressed Jake's cheek. He had a rough time stopping himself from flinching at the sudden contact. As far as he knows, the concept of flinching should be foreign to babies, human or otherwise. She then went away to who knows where, leaving Jake alone again with his thoughts. Jake thought he might as well try to go back to sleep, for there was nothing else he could possibly do. He hoped with every fiber in his being that robots age faster than humans, otherwise, he'd be royally screwed. That didn't really last long since, a few minutes later, his 'mother' came in and picked him up, successfully surprising him. As soon as he saw what she had in her hand, he felt fear's chill running through his spine. There in her hand was something he had not anticipated, a tool of a catastrophic nature that he wished he wouldn't have to face: a baby bottle. Except, it had some sort of dark liquid inside, instead of the usual milk. \"Open wide, little one!\" said Mom-Bot cheerfully, not paying attention to the look of horror plastered over Jake's face. He knew that it should theoretically be the robot equivalent of baby milk, but how did she expect him to willingly drink something that looked like unfiltered poison! There was NO way, there really wasn't‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ ' Avoid Suspicion‚Ä¶ Avoid Suspicion‚Ä¶ AVOID THE FREAKING SUSPICION' Those were the words that echoed through Jake's mind as he slowly, yet reluctantly opened his mouth and allowed Mom-Bot to feed him. He was so glad that he lacked any form of gag reflex, because he could not handle the sharp, metallic taste that filled his mouth, which, judging by the smell, is actually oil. Under normal circumstances, he would never have dreamed of even considering oil as some sort of nutritional beverage. But‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ he doesn't mind it? ' HOLY SHIT! This‚Ä¶ actually tastes ok‚Ä¶ What the hell is going on here?' The fact that he felt a strange sense of rejuvenation after the drink did not help matters one bit. Deciding to side with simplicity, he deduced that it was probably due to the fact he was no longer human‚Ä¶ In reality, this entire event managed to accomplish one thing: finally make Jake accept the fact that he is now a machine. Granted, a fully aware machine surrounded by other sentient machines, but a machine nonetheless. His days as a human being ended the moment that gas leak caused the explosion. In that moment, he felt a sudden wave of sadness engulf him. Had he known he would cease to be human, he would have gladly chosen to move on. Perhaps this is the universe's way of getting back at him for his stubbornness. When Mom-Bot placed him back in the crib, Dad-Bot also passed by. \"How's my little trooper doing?\" he asked, not that he was expecting an answer. Jake looked at him, and when Dad-Bot noticed the unusual sadness and looked at him with worry, Jake faked a yawn and pretended to go back to sleep. He was relieved to see that it was sufficient to alleviate his suspicions. Regardless of his current swirl of emotions, Jake could not afford to have his Robo-Parents worried something's wrong with their child. All babies his current age could and should do is sleep, whine, eat, and release wastes. So for the time being, he will suppress his feelings and try to act as much like a normal baby as he possibly could. ' Maybe‚Ä¶ Just maybe I could figure out a way out of this mess‚Ä¶' With that thought in his mind, he fell asleep, hoping his current life would somehow get better. ~‚Ä¶~ And so from that point, Jake and his parents continued to play his game for the next couple of years. He'd pretend to be a baby as much as he could, while his Robo-Parents stopped noticing the slight discrepancies between an actual baby and a reincarnated one. In all honesty, Jake quite enjoyed all the pampering he was getting. All he had to do was lie there and cry when appropriate. Of course, no plan is ever perfect. It was around the second year after his reincarnation. It was a normal day, Dad-Bot was out at his job. From what Jake could piece together from the times he eavesdropped on his oblivious Robo-Parents, Dad-Bot was a lawyer at Rivet Town's Agency for Attorneys. All his eavesdropping has been most beneficial, since it gave him a rough summary of his surroundings, which he hopped to enlarge once he was physically old enough to learn more. After time has passed, he learned what certain feelings meant. Every time he felt sleepy, he felt a strange whirring sound in the back of his head. It always occurred when he went to sleep, which was involuntary more often than not. He also deduced that when he reached his hunger limit, he would feel a sharp pain in his stomach. That was the signal that he should ask for food. No matter how many times he attempted forming a proper sentence, all he would ever manage were baby cries, which prompted Mom-Bot to rush to him with his oil bottle. He still couldn't get over the fact he enjoyed drinking freaking oil, but that was something he would figure out later. One day, while sitting next to Dad-Bot in their somewhat glamourous living room, he felt the sharp pain and sighed. It was really annoying, having to deal with this every time he felt hungry. He decided to simply get the process over with, uttered the usual words. Except, something was drastically different this time‚Ä¶ \"Dad I-\"started Jake, then immediately halted, realizing with horror what just transpired. He stole a peak from Dad-Bot, who was just as shocked, albeit for a completely different reason. For the first time since his reincarnation, he actually uttered words rather than cries. It was‚Ä¶ strange. His voice was nothing like it actually was. It was slightly high-pitched, which he attributed to his under-developed voice-box. He immediately remembered that when he turned two, his parents brought some type of upgrade, and installed it while he was sleeping. His throat did hurt for a few days, but even then, he'd still cry instead of talk. Dad-Bot, on the other hand, was just glad that his son finally started speaking, and went ahead to get Mom-Bot, who ushered Jake to speak again. Jake just couldn't find it in him to deny them that request when he looked at their pleading eyes. With a heavy sigh, Jake spoke once more. \"Dad‚Ä¶ Mom‚Ä¶\" he said, respectively pointing at each of them. They then started aww-ing, and Mom-Bot when so far as to hug him. It was weird, being able to suddenly talk when he couldn't do so the day before. One thing was abundantly clear however‚Ä¶ In order to comprehend this world, he had to discard most of his knowledge about human development. The difference between Robots and Humans was nothing short of astronomically great‚Ä¶ ~‚Ä¶~ Author's Note: I apologize again for the delay, and I also apologize for the slight shortness of this chapter. To be honest, I just wanted to finish up the baby, and possibly Toddler, stage of Jake's new life. After all, rarely anything happens to children at that age. So, starting next chapter, Jake will have grown into a normal child, and will finally start attending robot school. I am not sure when I will be able to update again, but I really appreciate the good comments that were made on chapter 1! So a major Thank you to everyone who reviewed and/or favorited/followed. Be sure to tune in for the next chapter! ","Summary":" Chapter 1: The Contract Author's Note: Yet another idea popped up‚Ä¶ Reincarnation Stories have alway"},{"Movie":"Marx Brothers","Title":"Off Tropic","Author":"11cleyva","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12762030","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Marvin H. Wink had no money to his name, only the dime he had found outside of his home in the lower side of Manhattan. After the stock crash, the town was back on the rise over the years but his money didn't. He smoked a cigar that he had bought at the Pick a Penny store down the street. That was the fastest dime he'd ever owned but he thought it was a good idea to indulge in a luxury item before he was evicted. He was a lanky man, his black hair parted. His large bushy eyebrows matched his mustache. He was no taller than the tallest lady, which wasn't much but he didn't mind. It made it harder for the cops to get a hold of him. Wink had in his possession a white hat, and the clothes on his back of a black suit, striped pants, red tie and a used to be pressed dress shirt back when he bought it. He waited for the knock on the door of the tenant, if he had clock he could count the seconds but he pawned it just last week. Xxxxxxxxx \"Are you sure?\" a young girl no older than 23 spoke on the phone, \"Oh‚Ä¶ But Aunt Dorothy‚Ä¶ okay, I understand. I will. Goodbye.\" \"Miss Patricia, whadda she say?\" a small Italian man, who wore a green jacket and green felt hat poked his head into the doorway of the lavish apartment. \"Oh, Piccolo, she still wants to marry that dreadful Mr. Bard. She can't see he's here only to steal her money and leave. And at her age she should be able to see a scam artist at first sight.\" she brushed her blonde hair from her eyes and sat down. \"She no see how hard you are a trying to keep her safe. It's a pity‚Ä¶\" Piccolo came to sit on the arm rest of the couch next to her. \"Whadda she needs is another man. Eh, that's it!\" \"What is?\" \"She needs another man to bother the other one out, and I know justa the guy. Let me getta my brother and we take you to him!\" Piccolo jumped off the arm rest leaving a confused woman as he looked for his brother, Poochi. \"Poochi! Poochi!\" he yelled out the door to the hallway, he got a honk in reply and the sound of shoes that didn't fit the person wearing them. A curly red head man in oversized clothes came waddling down the hallway. Xxxxxxxxx Wink sat on the spot his couch once stood. He looked at the broken floor boards. \"I'm so poor even the dust bunnies were repossessed‚Ä¶\" he let his ashes fall to the ground and heard a knock. He straightened at the sound, the tenant was here for him. Wink scrambled to get his hat and began trying to pry the window open but it was stuck from years of never being opened. \"Hey open up!\" the voice yelled on the other side. Wink tried each window and each was stuck. He heard the knob rattle as he scurried to find a place to hide. \"Trust me, he's very good man‚Ä¶\" Piccolo said to Patricia as they waited outside. \"Hey, Wink open up! It's me, Piccolo!\" He stopped at the name, he remembered the name but not but face. He slowly turned to face the door. Piccolo? Do I know a piccolo ? Tip toeing to the door to peek out the small peep hole on the top. He remembered that face. A face only a mother could love, and his stooge by his side. But Wink's eye caught a glimpse of the girl. He moved his eyebrows and unhinged the door. \"Sorry gentlemen, and my lady. I was busy, please do come in. Don't mind the emptiness, I'm just cleaning up.\" he pushed his gold wire glasses higher on his nose. The three came in, Patricia began to think it was a bad thing to come to this man but if her friend Piccolo says he's good, she'll go with it. \"What can I do for you?\" he spoke as he shut the door and locked it. \"Are you Marvin H. Wink?\" \"It depends, are you a repo agent?\" he eyed her. \"Why no.\" \"Then yes, I'm Marvin H. Wink, in the flesh. I'd ask you to sit but I'm having my things moved to a better place. This place has far too many roaches, and I think they're thinking of a mutiny against me.\" he raised a brow. \"I'm so glad, Piccolo tells me you can help me.\" \"For a young lady anything is possible.\" \"well, it's not exactly me that needs help. More of my aunt.\" \"If she's anything like you, I'm sure I can help.\" he grabbed her gloved hands and held them. He could feel the hot breathing of Poochi on his neck. If he wasn't in front of a lady he'd bop him one. \"You see, she's going to get married to a greedy man who wants to take her money from her and leave her for nothing.\" Patricia took a breath and began again, \"I've been trying to tell her for years he's no good. Oh please, you must interfere and stop them from getting married.\" \"Are you sure that I'm not the one she's marrying?\" Wink spoke up, he had no clue why Piccolo even suggested his name to help. \"All a you gotta do is make her fall for you. Then Mr. Bard is a gone and you can leave.\" Piccolo broke in between them. Wink took a drag from his cigar and held it in his fingers. \"Suppose I do make this, ah, aunt fall for me. What do I get?\" he stuffed the cigar back into his mouth. \"She'll flourish you with money if you play your cards right. Oh please say you'll help me.\" \"Im sorry, Miss, but I'm a changed man. I've reformed.\" he stood straight and brushed his hair back. \"You a don't look that deformed to me‚Ä¶\" Piccolo spoke under his breath getting a silent laugh from Poochi who stood behind him. With an eye roll, he came in closer. \"Alright, what's your aunt's name?\" \"Mrs. Dorothy Hornbeck-\" \"Hornbeck!? The rich widow Hornbeck, with all her millions and millions and millions!?\" Wink's eyes widened at the name. This was his chance to get the money he so desperately needed to pay off the loans. \"I suppose I could be of assistance.\" Okay, so this is new to me to write a story like this. If I mess up I apologise. And if anyone asks, I'm going to take care of my other fanfictions as well. I just had this in my head for a while and needed to write it out.[Chapter 2] \"Oh Gerald, you do know how to flatter me.\" \"Dorothy, I'd give you the world, but you already have the world.\" Mr. Bard motioned to the room they sat in. The ornate decorations on the soft pink wall paper, gave the sense of royalty in its golden swirls. Mr. Bard stood a good height and had a good belly on him as well. He had the pointed beard of a demon, but a German accent. His lightening brown hair was combed back as he held the hand of his lover. Mrs. Dorothy Hornbeck, she sat in her rococo chair with her feet on a matching velvet stool. She had her brown hair tightly put into a bun, it helped accent her long diamond earrings. They were a gift from her beau. Her hazel eyes looked out the window of her large almost mansion like home. She did love Gerald, but wished he'd talk of other things other than her money situation. She had millions stashed in the bank but that all he ever wanted to talk about. \"Oh well, I can't have enough.\" she gave a forced giggle at his words. \"Are we still on for the dinner at Le Bellevue at 6?\" \"Oh it slipped my mind, but I promise I will be there. Don't worry my dear. Your Gerald will be there.\" he gave a kiss to her cheek and gave her a Farwell. \"Aunt Dorothy?\" a small voice came from the door, she turned to see a young man. \"Oh Dennis, come in come in. I hope you said hello to Mr. Bard. He'll be a very good uncle for you and your sister one day.\" Hornbeck got out of her chair and came to the man. He stood taller than her. He looked like his sister, only the male version. \"I did, he sped by me very fast.\" Dennis pointed out the door and back to his aunt. \"He's quite a catch.\" \"Yes!\" she laughed and came to sit in her chair again with the young man sitting on the stool. \"What can I help you with?\" \"I came to ask if you'd be interested in coming to the opening of my new bar?\" \"Certainly not! I have a date with Mr. Bard tonight. You know that, Dennis.\" \"Oh‚Ä¶ It slipped my mind I guess‚Ä¶ well, the Little Tropicana wouldn't be here if it weren't for your help.\" he shrugged, he knew his aunt would never come to the likes of the bar. Not her taste in a place,but maybe he could to get her away from that Bard. \"I will eventually. I'll be able to once I get the chance to. Don't worry, my boy.\" she smiled at him but her smile was sad. \"He can't make it to the dinner again?\" Dennis had seen this before. He always saw his aunt with a sad smile on her face more than once. \"How dare you say such a thing, you know Mr. Bard is a very busy man. But‚Ä¶ yes. He'll be late for dinner with me. But I shall wait for him there. It's his favourite restaurant, he wouldn't miss it for the world.\" \"If you say so, Aunt Dorothy. Well, I best get going, Patricia wanted to talk to me today about the Tropicana. I better get going.\" he gave a hug to his aunt. \"Bye Aunt Dorothy.\" \"Goodbye Dennis, say hello to your sister for me.\" XXxxxxxxxxXX \"Dennis, I'm so glad you came!\" Patricia hugged her brother, he smiled but it faded when he saw the group of men with her. He knew the two, one was her friend and house hand and his brother but the other one was too new and suspicious looking. \"Who's that?\" he broke from the hug and came close to Wink, he tried to not show he was Afraid of the taller man getting close. \"That's Mr. Wink-\" \"Marvin H. Wink to you young man.\" he broke in and took a drag from his cigar. \"Miss Patricia called for me-\" \"To try and a take youra aunt away from a Mr. Bard.\" Piccolo cut him off. Wink stared at him with a displeased face but turned his attention back to the man. \"I don't understand.\" \"Dennis, remember how we spoke about trying to get Bard away from our aunt. Well, I have the answer. Mr. wink will get her attention away from Bard and he'll leave before he ruins her.\" \"And then she'll get ruined by me.\" Wink spoke to himself aloud with a move of his eyebrows at it. He was happy no one heard him. Poochi stared at him, Wink hated being stared at by him he tried his best to ignore the man. \"I don't know. We seem like the bad guys when this spoken out loud.\" Dennis said and opened the doors of the Little Tropicana. It was a bar, but it had stage with instruments. The opening of the place was at 6:30 that night. The tables were set with colourful clothes and tropical flowers. Fake coconut trees acted at columns for the second floor cloister with more seats. \"Charming place.\" Wink said looking at the walls painted in vibrant washes. \"Thank you. I guess I'm just alittle stressed about tonight. I wanted aunt Dorothy to be here but she has a date with that Bard and he's going to stand her up again like he always does.\" \"Are you sure, Dennis?\" Patricia asked as they walked behind the stage, Piccolo took notice to the piano. He gave a smile to Poochi and the two went to sit at the black instrument. Wink heard the tinkling of the keys and turned to see the men.Wink came to slam the cover over the keys. \"Hey, whadda the big idea!?\" Piccolo yelled as Poochi whistled his rage. Wink smirked. \"You'd just break the piano.\" \"I no break anything in my life.\" \"oh no? You'd break my ears with that racket. Be gone from this stage!\" \"Eh, come on Poochi. Let's a leave the jealous Mr. Wink. He no can play so he get mad at others.\" \"I don't need to play an instrument, I have talent in other ways.\" he gave a move of his eyebrows and shook his cigar at the two before leaving. The two brothers were left in confusion. \"Mr. Wink, I have an idea for you to help us.\" Patricia came back from talking to her brother. \"Our aunt will be at the Le Bellevue restaurant just 15 minutes away from here. Mr. Bard always comes late or not at all and so what I think is-\" \"Say no more, I shall sweep her off her feet‚Ä¶ I may need help with that, she's a bigger than usual.\" his under breathe was looked over by everyone. \"You will! Oh that's so great. I can't thank you enough.\" \"I haven't done anything yet, thank me later. Now I must be off.\" he rushed away only to come back. \"Um, I don't seem to have any change on me for this restaurant. It sounds glitzy.\" \"Well it is‚Ä¶ I know, I'll give you some money. It's the least I can do at this point.\" \"my dear, you are too kind to a man like me.\" Wink was grateful but he didn't know how to show it. \"I'll need an outfit!\" he grabbed one off the rack behind the stage for the singers.\" \"Hey, that's for the actors for tonight!\" \"Young man, you are about to do something great for your country, the least you can do is let me borrow this.\" Wink held it up to see if it'd fit. \"My country? This is my aunt we're talking about.\" \"She's as big as a country. And I'll be her capital.\" he gave a small eyebrow to the man. \"I don't think I like the way you're talking about my aunt.\" Dennis tensed at his words. Patricia held him back. She shook her head at him Making the man calm down. \"Well, alright then. Just don't make anything worse than they already are.\" \"You have my word. Though it's not worth much to me, maybe it'll be worth something to you.\" XXxxxxxxxXX Dorothy Hornbeck sat at the table waiting for her date, but he was already thirty minutes late. But she didn't want to budge from her chair. Her wine had gone warm waiting and her food hadn't been ordered yet. \"Excuse me, but I have a dinner engagement with Mrs. Hornbeck.\" Wink had shown up at the front of the restaurant sporting the new clothes he'd stolen from the stage of Little Tropicana. \"And your name, sir?\" \"Bard.\" \"But sir, your are not Mr. Gerald Bard, he is a favourite here‚Ä¶\" the French man at the check in desk looked at him with wide eyes. \"Uh, did I say Bard? I meant Mr. Bard's assistant. I have an important message for the date of Mr. Bard.\" \"Oh, well I can give her the letter.\" \"It's a message, not a letter. And it's in my head not in writing. Please.\" Wink grew annoyed at the man but looked around the restaurant for her. He knew what she looked like from the papers. He found her, sitting in the back corner next to a plant. \"Let me get the manager to see if it's alright-\" \"No time! I have to get it to her before I forget it!\" he burst through the man to get to her table. The French man wanted to follow but guests kept him from going after. \"Are you Mrs. Hornbeck?\" Wink asked softly as he reached her table. \"Why yes I am, what do you want?\" she looked through her monocle at him. \"I just want to tell you that‚Ä¶\" he inhaled and sat down at the table, reaching over to her hands. \"I'm madly in love with you. I couldn't hold it in anymore. Oh Dorothy, you bring so many things out of me. Mostly love, you bring so much love out of me.\" \"Let go of me! I've never been so disgusted in all my life!\" she stood up to leave. \"Please don't go, you'd break my heart if you did. My heart beats so strongly for you!\" \"I'm already with someone.\" \"Very well, go‚Ä¶ But answer me this. Does this Mr. Bard tell you he loves you and what you mean to him?\" he pulled a fresh cigar from his inner pocket in the coat. She stopped and looked at him. \"No, but what is it to you?\" \"Please, call me Wink. Marvin H. Wink. And I call myself in love with you. Please sit with me and let me bask in your beauty.\" he gave her a smile that she seemed to have been drawn into. He was something different and he was completely out of the ordinary. She didn't anyone to see her with someone else. She sat back down, the waiter came to the table. \"I'll have the steak, the lady will have?\" he looked at her, she was surprised usually Gerald ordered everything for her. \"The fish please.\" she smiled and Wink smiled back. He looked at her. He knew he had to do this as a favour for the young Patricia but something in him made it difficult to look away from her. \"That'll be all Waiter.\" he shoved the menu into the man's hands and forced a laugh as he held her hands. \"I've said it before, but I think I'm in love with you, Mrs. Hornbeck‚Ä¶\" he was half keeping his character of taking her away from Mr. Bard but half serious. It all happened so quickly, quicker than he wanted.[Chapter 3] \"And that's when I told the Injun he was no red man.\" Marvin told a story between bites of food. Mrs Hornbeck sat listening. \"You really went out west?\" she liked his tall tales but gave him the benefit of the doubt that they could be all true. \"Out west? I've never been there.\" \"But you just told me about the Indian.\" \"No, that was in Cleveland. They had a baseball game going on that day.\" \"Dorothy, what in the world is this?\" Her face changed from a smile to shock seeing Gerald standing there. Wink, however, just looked down at his eaten food and back at the man. \"I believe it was a twelve ounce steak.\" he patted his lips with the napkin and stood. \"and who do you think you are?!\" he was dwarfed by the taller man but he stood his ground. \"I am Gerald Bard, her beloved. And you sir, are stepping into my relationship with Mrs. Hornbeck!\" \"Please not so loud, we are in public.\" Wink spoke and sat back down with Dorothy. She sat frozen in her seat, she knew she shouldn't have let this man sit with her. \"Waiter! Waiter!\" A small man came up to the table looking like every other waiter there. \"sir?\" \"There seems to be a problem here.\" Wink answered. \"this man here is ruining my appetite.\" he pointed his cigar at Mr. Bard. \"would you be as it so kind to kick him out of this establishment.\" he sat back down in his seat. The small waiter gave a worried look at the taller man, \"I'm sorry Mr. Bard, but I have to remove you from the restaurant...\" \"Why I never! \" Bard shouted and turned to leave. Wink gave a snort as he looked at Mrs. Hornbeck, who's face was now white from the event. \"I wouldn't worry about that guy anymore, babe.\" he patted her hand on the table. \"He's my Beau, Mr. Wink.\" \"Oh so that's the crumb you're dating?\" Wink looked at the waiter, who came to stand by him again. \"yes?\" \"A small tip is a suggestion for my services.\" \"that's a nice suggestion.\" He turned away to face his date across the table. \"Well, I must be going.\" \"Oh but Mr. Wink, do you have to?\" she didn't mean to grab at his sleeve, she let go and let him sit back down. \"I must, but do not worry my dear, I'll see you again I'm sure. When a Wink loves, he'll never leave you alone.\" He finally stood and gave a small kiss to her hand and left. XxXxXxXx \"Can you believe the nerve?!\" Bard stormed around in a dressing room, the room had shimmering dresses with brightly-coloured flowers. \"Don't worry, sugar, I'm sure I can help you out.\" a woman's voice came from the other small room, she stepped out. She was tall, almost the same height as Bard. She had red hair, and striking lipstick that matched. She was young and she knew she had the right stuff to make men stare. She gave a kiss to Bard. \"You will help, my sweet?\" He asked her as she put her earrings in. \"As long as I'm still getting half of the money?\" she turned fast and he smiled. \"You are, Vivian. So you will help me get rid of this little man?\" \"I will, but after my show. Those people out there didn't come all the way to this two bit bar for the looks of it. They came for me, sugar. And I'll give them a show.\" she looked herself over in the long mirror. \"Go on and get going, I'll bring that Wink with me and I'll eliminate him.\" \"You can't miss him, big eyebrows, huge mustache and a loud mouth.\" Mr. Bard said as she left the room. XxXxXxXx \"Oh, Mr. Wink, you're back so soon.\" Dennis said as he saw him coming through the doors of the Little Tropicana. Wink didn't pay him much attention, he got stuck looking at the stage. \"Miss Vivian? I knew I did well booking her for my first night open. Did you want me to get you a seat?\" Wink just nodded and puffed on his cigar as Dennis lead him to an area at the bar. Wink had just came in when she was ending her song, but she eyed him from the crowd and gave him a smile and winked at him. He sat straight up in his chair, she gave a small come hither look as the brick red curtain fell. He ordered a small drink but before he could enjoy it Dennis came back to him. \"Mr. Wink, it seems Miss Vivian want to see you.\" Dennis was confused by this, even Marvin was too. But he gave his drink a quick down and stood. \"Lead me to her.\" He said as Dennis took him behind stage as the band played. Dennis lead him to the door and left. His heart was beating fast, he didn't know what to expect being here but he'd play it cool. He gave a knock. \"Just a minute.\" a female's voice spoke from behind it. She clicked the lock and opened it, he was struck by her. She fluttered her eyelashes and pulled him in, locking the door behind him. \"I, um, don't believe we've met.\" He said and came to sit on her small couch in the room. \"That's why I wanted to meet you now. I heard so much about you from Dennis and I knew I had to meet you.\" \"You remind me of someone, but I can't put my finger on it...\" Wink spoke and re-lit his cigar and blew smoke into her face. She coughed at the smoke cloud. \"Oh could you be a dear and get rid of that for me?\" she pointed at the cigar, \"It's bad for my singing voice.\" she tried to sound nice but she hated this man already. \"That's who you remind me of. My mother.\" He continued to smoke his cigar. He didn't care what she told him. She just laughed at his comment as he continued to puff out a white cloud. She got up to get a drink for him, she'd figure she could get him drunk and drop him off somewhere. She handed him a glass and sat in his lap. He shot her a look, he didn't want to be here but he had to pretend. She took a chance and kissed him on the lips when he took the cigar out of his mouth. \"Your mustache is tickling me, sir.\" she giggled trying to act cute. \"Yours too.\" \"What!?\" she got his lap quickly. \"Now that we got that formality out of the way-\" He gave her bouncy eyebrows as she backed away. \"I will not be insulted, you must go now.\" she put a hand on the lock and slammed them open. \"What did you expect for making me coming over here?\" He asked as she came back to him and put her hands on her hips. \"Beat it, mister!\" she shouted. \"Oh so that's your game? Invite me over here, make advances and one comment on your mustache you can't handle it?\" Wink stood up from the couch and walked to the door, \"you should think before you act, Missy.\" She slammed the door in his face. He smiled to himself because he didn't want anyone to come between him and Dorothy.[Chapter 4] \"Did it work? Did the fool take the bait?\" Bard spoke to Vivian on the phone from Mrs. Hornbeck's home. \"What!? A mustache? Why no, Vivian. It's not that noticeable- hello?\" \"Gerald, who are you speaking to at this hour?\" Mrs. Hornbeck came down to the reading room to find him. She always knew he was in this room making his calls. He'll tell her it was just business calls. \"Business call, my dear. I'll have to pass on the trip to your New York estate.\" \"Oh are you sure? I was so looking forward to having there with me‚Ä¶\" She pulled her house coat around her tighter as she sat on the velvet chair. \"I'm afraid so, but I promise we'll go on holiday on my money next time. Good night, darling. I'm very tired, it's been a trying day what with that scoundrel from earlier.\" Bard walked out of the room in his guest room. She stayed in the chair for a moment, to think. Once she knew Bard had gone to his room, she silently went to the phone. \"Hello, Operator. Dennis Hornbeck please. Thank you.\" XxXxXx \"Hello? Why, Aunt- what?\" Dennis answered the phone, at each word his aunt spoke he slumped over more and more. This Wink was all she spoke about and it was becoming annoying. \"I don't know if he's still here, he went to talk to Miss Vivian here at my new place... Who is she? Well, she's a singer here.\" Dennis was hoping this would make his aunt stop talking about him. Dennis looked to his side and saw Wink walk by much to his disappointment. \"Aunt Dorothy, hold on I see him.\" He covered the phone and shouted to him, \"Hey Wink, get over here!\" Marvin, gave a look around and came to him. \"here, it's for you.\" Dennis was getting mad, his aunt didn't talk to him for a while and now she does just to find this man. \"Hello?\" Marvin asked on the phone and stuck his cigar in his mouth for a drag. \"Ah, Mrs. Hornbeck, I was just thinking of you.\" He gave his eyebrows a wiggle, Dennis standing next to him saw it and felt his body get hot from rage. \"Really? Why, I would hate to intrude. Well, if you say so, I can't say no to you Mrs. Hornbeck. I'll be there first thing tomorrow morning, in fact I'll get there so early I'll be there tonight!\" He hung the phone up and stuck the cigar back in his mouth, he looked at Dennis. \"By the way, your aunt said hello.\" \"Why you, \" Dennis came closer to him, \"I don't like you getting close to my aunt. You're getting too fresh with her.\" \"I certainly don't have any money, so I have to show her I have other assets I can offer her.\" He gave his eyebrows a fast wiggle implying much more than he let on, but Dennis knew what he meant. \"Now if you excuse me, I have a date with your aunt.\" Wink squirmed out of the young man's glare and walked out the Tropicana. Sorry for the long time to update, school got into the way. I'll try to get another out soon and a longer one.[Chapter 5] Dennis walked with his arms crossed to the door that led to the outside world of New York City, he couldn't see Wink anymore. He assumed Wink got in a taxi and was on his way to the apartment house of his aunt. It made the young man's blood boil, he hated really anyone getting close to his aunt, it could be the fact that she gives more attention to his sister or any other person besides him. \"Hey Boss.\" Piccolo said his normal greeting as he came through the door with a brown bag and Poochi behind him carrying another bag of bread sticks. \"Hey now, what's all this? Outside food isn't allowed in here, fellas.\" Dennis said as he trailed behind them. \"Yes but the food is a bad here.\" \"I didn't think it was that bad‚Ä¶\" Dennis followed them back to the bouncers room, he was short staffed and let the two of his sister, Patricia, work there. The two men had a table around ready for the feast and laid all the food down, just the spaghetti and meatballs with the bread sticks, now three missing thanks to Poochi. A thought clicked in Dennis' mind as he stared at the food, \"Say Piccolo, do you think you could help me out?\" he motioned for the smaller man to follow him just a few feet away from the food. Piccolo gave a stern look to Poochi who was eyeing the spaghetti on his plate. \"Yes a Mr. Dennis?\" \"You know that Wink, right?\" \"Big black mustache, smoke-a cigar?\" Piccolo described him and Dennis nodded. \"Yeah that's the one, you brought him here a few days ago.\" \"I no know him.\" Piccolo looked over at Poochi who was eating a long white candle instead of the bread stick while waiting for him to come back. \"Well, let's say you do. Now you know my aunt right?\" \"Does she have a big black mustache and smoke-a cigar?\" \"No! She's been going out with that Bard and now Wink is going after her.\" Dennis said and brought him closer. \"I need you and Poochi to go to my Aunt's summer home and drive off Wink. Sound easy?\" Piccolo listened and thought. \"Here's what-a we do. We go to your aunt's summer home and get rid of this Wink.\" he just retold the information from Dennis. \"That sounds good guys. Oh and listen, try to be discreet about it too. I don't want wind of my own doing in this, got it?\" \"You don't have to look-a any further than-a us.\" \"Fantastic fellas, I'll get you some money so you can leave as soon as possible to get there. Remember, be discreet.\" Dennis went out to get some money for the two. Piccolo came back to the table, \"Ah you see Poochi. That was easy, now we just gotta see how it get rid of Wink‚Ä¶ Eh. Poochi, you touch-a my spaghetti?\" A red mouthed and waxy lipped Poochi shook his head at the question but Piccolo knew better. XxXxXxXx \"This has to be the place.\" Wink said out loud as he peered out the window of the taxi cab, the driver leaned back as he patted the seat, telling the man to stop. Without words spoken, Wink gave some of the money that was given to him for the dinner that he skipped on paying. But he knew he'd pay for dinner another time, he had plans to take her to dinner again and again. He gazed up at the size of the apartment building, but his eyes went to the size of the man outside the rotating door. If he looked like he belonged here, the man should let him pass without a problem. He tried to grace by the man, but was stopped. \"Do you need help, sir?\" The burly man asked and looked down at the shorter man. Wink gave a nervous chuckle, \"I have a meeting with a lovely lady in this building‚Ä¶\" He gave a smile, he'd hope that the man wouldn't question this. \"Gigolos are not permitted on the grounds.\" The man blocked the door and crossed his arms. \"A gigolo? You think that am a gigolo? I will have you think twice before you speak that way to me. I'm Marvin H. Wink and Mrs. Hornbeck is expecting me!\" He puffed his chest out as he spoke of her, but the man just huffed. \"Now I know what kind of person this Mrs. Hornbeck is, and to think she has a guy already.\" The man went to block the door more from the man. \"What floor is her room?\" Wink spoke louder to the gorilla of a man. \"Beat it buster. You're making the property value go down with you standing here.\" The man was too big to sneak by, and too mean to get any information out of. Wink gave a huff to the man and walked away down the street to a small shop. It was just a small flower store with an elderly man behind the register. \"You have a phone I could use?\" he asked the old man and got a nod in return, if he couldn't get any information from the apartment guard, he'd call the lovely lady herself. The operator on the other side finally clicked the cords into the right section to connect him to Hornbeck. \"Hornbeck residence\" a small voice answered, one that Wink had never heard before. \"May I speak to Mrs. Dorothy Hornbeck, please?\" \"If you don't mind me asking, sir, but what name can I give her as to who's calling?\" \"Wink.\" He heard the phone get settled to the table on the other end, silence filled the line. Wink, looked around the place and saw a lovely item he thought of buying if this kid would move faster before the old man closed up shop. \"Marvin?\" her voice came onto the phone, making his heart swell. \"Marvin, is that you?\" \"None other.\" \"Is something the matter?\" she seemed worried on the other line. \"I forgot to ask, what number is your apartment?\" he smiled as he asked. She answered and of course it was the sixth floor, his smile fell slightly at that but he perked up when she asked why. \"I just thought I'd drop by now like I said earlier today I would.\" \"Oh heavens, you mustn't. Bard is still here-\" \"What he won't know, won't hurt him. I'll see you in about‚Ä¶\" he looked at his watch, \"45 minutes. Keep your window open.\" He hung up before she could protest about him coming now, but he had to. He didn't know if it was the call of the job to get her away from Bard or if it was his own crazy idea to do this. He gave back the phone and plucked a bouquet of flowers and paid the man. The bunch was filled with roses and little white flowers, Wink had no idea what they were, but he figured she'd love it. He saw that gorilla still standing there, so decided to do the unethical option. He made his way to alleyway in search of a fire escape, and found it. It went all the way up to the roof of the building but he only needed to get to the sixth floor, which was only two floors from the roof. The metal ladder was locked into place, he couldn't pull it down. Wink placed the wrapped stems in his mouth as he tipped a metal garbage can upside down to get a jump to the ladder. He wasn't as young as he used to be but he brought himself to the first step and climbed to rest for a second. Stuffing the flowers under his coat into the inner pocket, he made his way up the cold steps. He saw one window wide open, but it was a little away from the fire escape, but the ledge seemed wide enough for him to shimmy on. He cursed under his breath at that man at the front door, if he just let him in like a normal person, he wouldn't be climbing the fire escape like a Julio. The sixth floor seemed so far away but he made it and now the fun part started, as he placed one shoe onto the cement ledge. Wink was now up 74 feet on the edge, shimmying his way to the open window. The hot summer breeze was harsher the higher he climbed and now it was at times too gusty. But he kept tip toeing his way to her room, as he got closer to the window he saw a figure poke it's head out. A black servant popped his head out and quickly drew it in at the sight of a man climbing the side of the building. Wink was just steps away from getting the window, when Mrs. Hornbeck poked her head out and gave a scream. \"What is the problem, Dorothy?\" Bard came into the room, making Wink stop in his tracks. He pressed himself as close to the building as he heard the voice. \"Oh, dear‚Ä¶ I thought I saw something out my window but it was nothing.\" She still sounded shaken up but she kept her tone as calm as possible. \"Palmer, shut the window, it's letting in too much wind. Dorothy, it's much too late. You should be in bed at this hour.\" His voice was silenced by the window being shut and the young man with wide eyes looking at Wink. The muffled sound of Bard talking finally left the room, Wink felt he could breathe again, as the window sung open with Dorothy looking at him. \"But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" Wink spoke to her, making a smile come on her lips. \"Why, Mr. Wink? You could have been caught or worse you could have fallen.\" Her voice was soft as not to bother Bard again. \"Truth be told, Mrs. Hornbeck. I think I've already fallen, and I fell for you.\" He dug into his coat and pulled out the flowers, \"sorry if they're crushed.\" He said as Palmer helped him through the window and shut it behind him. She smiled as their fingers brushed against each other. \"Palmer, I'd like you to meet Mr. Marvin H. Wink.\" She introduced the skinny man to him. \"Sorry to scare you, boy.\" Wink said to the man. \"It's fine, sir. Not everyday I see a man on a building ledge.\" \"Palmer, one more thing before you can go. Try to find our guest some clean clothes.\" She said and brought the flowers to her bedroom. Wink stayed out and marveled at the apartment of Mrs. Hornbeck. \"Wink?\" He came in to meet her, the room was filled with ornate designs and a small glass chandelier from the ceiling. He felt somewhat wrong being in her room, but she called for him. She put the flowers in a glass vase on a table. \"They're so lovely.\" \"I tried to find flowers to capture you, but no flower can capture your beauty.\" He didn't know why he said that, but he couldn't help it. He wasn't usually this sappy but she loved it. \"Oh Wink.\" She smiled as Palmer walked back in with some clothes in hand. He left without a word and shut the door behind him. \"You'll have to get cleaned up if you wish to stay here for the night. That scaling of the building left you awfully filthy‚Ä¶ and all that just to see me?\" \"I'd climb hundreds of buildings just for you, but right now I need to get cleaned up.\" He looked himself over in the large mirror above the table with the flowers. He had rust on his face from the metal handrails on the way up. His clothing had somewhat a smell from the garbage he tipped over to get here. \"Just show me to the guest room and I'll be right as rain.\" \"Oh no, Marvin. You can't go there, that's where Bard is staying. You'll have to use my bathroom to wash up.\" \"You mean to tell me, your beau doesn't stay in the same room as you ?\" He was surprised by this. Even if they were close, the man didn't want to stay in the room together. Granted it was a large bed for two but Bard could fit if he lost a few pounds. She led him to the bathroom and handed him the sleep clothes Palmer had gotten for him. It was nothing fancy, just a long sleep shirt, plain grey. XxXxXxXx He took his time getting cleaned up to stay in a ritzy place such as this, but he worried about the sleeping arrangements, he didn't see another bed or couch for that matter in the room. A large chair was in the corner he could sleep on for the night he figured. He combed his wild hair down once out of the shower and dressed. Is it right for a spoken for woman to be sharing a room with a random man who's trying to ruin her relationship but it seems already rocky? Wink asked himself but tried not to wrap his brain around it. He felt wrong for doing so, but Bard didn't seem to be into this relationship anyway. He just took his time to try to get his hair to go flat but it would get frizzy and start its curl all over again. He gave up and came out slowly. He saw her sitting on the edge of the bed in deep thought herself. \"Mrs. Hornbeck?\" he asked and came closer to her. She looked up and smiled at him, beside her was a small tray with some food on it. \"Oh Wink, you look so dapper now.\" She said and brought him to the bed for a snack. \"I'm sorry I can't offer much, but I hope this will do.\" She had gathered some small items such as grapes, nuts and a few pieces of bread with butter already spread on them and a bottle of mineral water. \"Why there's enough here to share.\" He said and walked to a chair and grabbed a blanket. He put the throw blanket on the soft carpet by the bed, she watched as he took the tray and put it on the blanket. \"Won't you join me?\" \"What on earth are you doing?\" She looked at him through her monocle. \"Thought we'd have a small indoors picnic, just the two of us. You and me, me and you, you and I‚Ä¶um.\" He felt a little flustered by her being so close to him he began to get his words jumbled. \"Well, it's one of those. Let's just say the 'both of us.\" He opened the cap to the water and filled up two different glasses she had brought in. \"Well, here's to both of us.\" He toasted. ","Summary":" Marvin H. Wink had no money to his name, only the dime he had found outside of his home in the lowe"},{"Movie":"Marx Brothers","Title":"Quackers","Author":"Leftomaniac","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1284374","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The office of Hargrove Stevens was very spacious, with oak paneled walls and a large, wooden desk in the center. Files and papers were arranged in neat little piles on said desk, giving the room an air of almost anal organization. Behind the desk stood Hargrove Stevens himself, owner of the Stevens Private Healthcare clinic, looking very prim in his crisp, dark suit. An impatient scowl was scrawled across his face, directed at the dark haired, middle aged woman in front of him. Her name was Agatha Hermine. She wore a modest but expensive looking black dress with a smallish white shawl, and her face was a mask of concern. \"Madam,\" Mr. Stevens began, \"we've been waiting here nearly two hours and your great neurosurgeon has still not arrived. I'm beginning to seriously doubt whether he intends to come at all. What's more, I'm calling into question the things you've told me about his abilities as a member of the medical profession.\" \"I don't understand...\" Mrs. Hermine flustered, \"Arthur C. Penknife has never been late before.\" Something in her expression and tone suggested this was not only an exaggeration, but a bald-faced lie. \"Mrs. Hermine,\" Hargrove said with a note of sloppy romanticism, \"You know I have nothing but respect for you as an investor, and I'm normally happy to take on your recommendations\" the sweetness in his voice abruptly ended. \"But if I have to wait here even one more second-\" He was suddenly cut off by the sharp banging of a door being flung open. Into the office walked an unusual looking man with a large, dark mustache and a pair of wire spectacles. Following him was a man whose appearance was much less striking, but who wore an expression suggesting looks can be deceiving. \"...Positively the worst hotel I ever stayed at!\" Dr. Penknife said, turning to the other man. \"Not even a swimming pool. And do they call that fossilized Jell-O room service?\" He turned to the other two as if just noticing they were there. \"Are you the manager of this crummy joint?\" He asked Mr. Sevens. Hargrove Stevens looked peeved. He'd probably have been much angrier if his rage hadn't been tempered by confusion. \"I am Hargrove Stevens,\" he said, with the air of a man who is used to his name carrying weight \"and I am the owner of this hospital.\" he finished, putting emphasis on the word 'hospital.' \"Rest assured, you have my deepest sympathies\" replied Dr. Penknife. Mrs.Hermine took this opportunity to speak. \"Mr. Stevens, this is the man I've been telling you about, Dr. Arthur C. Penknife.\" \"Say, just what is it you're implying?\" Dr. Penknife said, turning to Mrs. Hermine. \"Are you accusing me of being Arthur C. Penknife? Why, I once beat a man within an inch of his life for less than that. I also beat a wife within an inch of her man one time.\" Mrs. Stevens opened her mouth to say something, but was cut off. \"I beat her in a game of checkers. She was pretty cross, I can tell her, losing to me right in front of her husband like that. If you want proof, I can show you the checkers.\" He paused to take a cigar out of his coat pocket, putting it in his mouth without lighting it. Mr. Stevens looked outraged. \"This is your world-famous neurosurgeon, Mrs. Hermine?\" He asked in disbelief. Attempting to diffuse the situation, Mrs. Hermine tactfully changed the subject. \"Em, tell me Doctor, who is this gentleman with you?\" She indicated the man who had been standing quietly by the door since entry. \"Him?\" Dr. Penknife turned, \"Why, I've never seen that man before in my life.\" Mrs. Hermine was confused. \"But ... you came in together.\" \"Of course we came in together.\" Dr. Penknife replied, \"That's Harrison, the med student with a heart of gold, and a couple of other organs as well. Speaking of organs, who do I have to call to get this guy removed?\" he gestured to Mr. Stevens with his cigar. Harrison waited patiently for him to finish, then spoke. \"I'm studying under Dr. Penknife.\" he explained. \"Oh,\" Mrs. Hermine said pleasantly. \"You must be learning quite a lot.\" \"Oh yes, more than you'd suspect,\" Harrison grinned. \"Why just the other day-\" \"Not in mixed company, Harrison.\" Dr. Penknife advised. Harrison nodded. Desperately, Mrs. Hermine tried to turn the conversation around. \"Well, Dr. Penknife, as you must already know, the ambassador to Indonesia is dreadfully ill, and in desperate need of your medical expertise.\" \"Well, tell him he can borrow it, but I'll need it back within the week.\" \"The ambassador's health is failing,\" Mrs. Hermine continued in a high, warbling voice, her melodrama a sharp contrast to Dr. Penknife, who had apparently noticed that he had something on his shoe, and was trying to remove it by scraping it off on Mr. Stevens's desk, in a very unbalanced position. \"His life is in your hands. I do not need to tell you how important this man is-\" \"Don't you? Well then why are you telling me? Why am I even here? Tell you what, I'll leave, and you can stay and tell it to the judge. If that dosen't work you can tell it to the marines. I think the marines would have a thing or two to tell you as well. Say, does this look like gum to you?\" As Dr. Penknife spoke, he had given up on the desk and propelled himself away from it, nearly crashing into Mrs. Hermine as he did so. He then held up his foot for her to examine. She tried to ignore it. \"Were you able to cure him,\" she elaborated with an air of impatience, \"You would earn the respect and admiration of the entire medical community. \"Never mind that, how much does it pay?\" asked Dr. Penknife, now trying to scrape his shoe off against the wall, hopping on one foot to do so. Perhaps sobered by Mrs. Hermine's speech, Mr. Stevens's voice lost it's note of anger, which was replaced by a quiet contempt. \"Under the current circumstances, and considering the complexity of a procedure like this, the hospital is prepared to offer you... thirty thousand dollars.\" \"Thirty thous- THIRTY thousand DOLLARS!?\" Dr. Penknife's eyes lit up as he flew away from the wall. He quickly adopted a skeptical expression. \"How about forty?\" \"Excuse me!?\" \"All right, thirty-five, but I'm losing on the deal.\" Mr. Stevens looked dumbstruck. Eager to end the conversation, he noncommittally said \"I will ... consider it.\" Dr. Penknife turned and shook Mrs. Hermine's hand enthusiastically. \"Ladies and gentlemen, you have yourselves a neurosurgeon! Come on Harrison, let's get out of this dump before we're noticed.\" Without anything further he dashed out the door in a crouch, followed closely by Harrison. Mrs. Hermine giggled slightly, while Mr. Stevens rubbed his head and moaned.[Chapter 2] For a short time I considered not continuing this fic. But so many people seemed to like it and there are so few fics in this category. Then, for a while, I *couldn't* continue it, no matter how hard I tried. But then, suddenly, it came to me like a flash- Moths! Moths ate it! ...By which of course, I mean that I thought up this chapter finally. So be happy! Incidentally, I'm not sure if there's a special name for those white coats worn by doctors. I do know, however, that the phrase \"doctor coat\" sounds unbelievably stupid. \"Hur, hur, better put on yer DOCTOR COAT, so's people know yer a DOCTOR!\" Therefore, I apologize for using it. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Quite a bit down the hall from Mr. Stevens's office, a crowd had begun to gather in the waiting room. This collection of curious gawkers was focused on two men, who were causing some considerable trouble with a receptionist. The first man, who had a thick Italian accent, dominated the conversation. His companion remained silent, though not quiet, per se. He instead said his piece through the use of an oversized bicycle horn. At the moment, the Italian man had somehow managed to reel in a doctor who was passing by, and was talking at great length with him. \"Hey mister, I-a wanna know why no one will treat my friend here.\" Much irritated at being grabbed from the hallway in this manner, the passing doctor tried to end the conversation. \"Yes, well I'm sorry, but I'm just on my way to see a patient, and I-\" \"Listen, nurse...\" \"*Doctor.*\" \"No, I'm-a no doctor, but-\" \"No, me?\" \"You?\" \"Yes.\" \"What?\" \"I'm a doctor.\" The Italian man smiled and gave the doctor a friendly punch on the arm. \"Hey, atsa good for you. But listen, this man, he's very sick.\" His companion made a face at that remark. Afraid that he wasn't going to find an easy way out of this, the doctor resigned himself. \"What's his problem?\" \"Show 'im what your problem is, Knock.\" The Italian man replied. Knock smiled and, without any obvious discomfort, lifted his right leg to reveal a small dog was chewing on it with determination. \"Oh my!\" The doctor was clearly much surprised and confused by this. \"But we can't treat that. It isn't a medical condition.\" \"Of course it's-a not a condition, it's a terrier. Whadda you think, I'm stupid?\" The doctor shook his head slightly, as if to rearrange it's contents. This afternoon was not going as he'd hoped it would. He turned and looked down the hallway, hoping for some assistance, but noticed none. He also didn't notice Knock cutting off a few inches of his hair as his head was turned. He tried to adopt an air of professionalism. \"We can't do anything for you.\" \"Aw, come on, Doc. Can't you at least recommend something?\" The doctor's tone became slightly condescending. \"Have you tried *dog biscuts*?\" he asked. \"Yeah, he don't like those.\" Knock shook his head and made a sick face at his companion's words. \"Come on, you gotta help him, Doc.\" \"Well, look...\" the doctor said, hoping yet again for an exit. \"There's another hospital a few miles down the road, maybe they can do something for him\" \"No, its-a no good, Doc. They don' allow pets there.\" That was quite enough for the doctor. He turned and rounded on the Italian man, putting himself between the two men with his back to Knock. This proved to be exceedingly bad judgement, for while he spoke to the other man, Knock stole his clipboard, his wallet and the pens in his pocket, and began cutting around the sleeves of his white doctor coat. \"Now you listen to me! I've had quite enough of this!\" \"That's good, because I've-a had quite enough-a you!\" \"Yeah?\" The doctor loomed over the Italian man, attempting to use his height to intimidate. \"Yeah.\" The Italian man replied, and, glancing at his companion, he bent down. On cue, Knock shoved him hard from behind and grabbed the collar of his doctor coat. As he tumbled over the Italian man's back, the last flaps of fabric holding the coat together tore. It came off, leaving him with a pair of sleeves and no more. The two men ran down the hallway and out of sight. The doctor stood, noticed his sleeves, and made a furious sound through clenched teeth. He grabbed his hair in frustration, but a confused look stole over his face. He felt his head, quickly realizing he had much less hair than usual, and made the sound again, but louder. He looked down at himself and felt his pockets, then he spaced his legs apart, raised his arms and screamed. \"AAARGH!\" His hair was mussed from feeling it, and his eyes were full of rage. This contrasted quite oddly with the amputated sleeves hanging from his arms. \"What are you all staring at?!?!!\" He demanded of the crowd in the waiting room. Down the hall, the two men laughed. The Italian man stopped fairly quickly, but the other one went on and on, childlike. The Italian man paused in walking and turned to his companion. \"But what about-a your leg?\" Knock looked pleased with himself, and pointed to his head. \"Oh, you thought-a something?\" He nodded vigorously, smiling, then held up a large, plastic chew toy, which the dog was attacking with equal ferocity. The Italian man laughed. \"Atsa good. C'mon.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I swear they'll all meet each other next chapter. You'll even get to hear Chico's name![Chapter 3] Even I can't believe I went almost a year without updating. Shame, shame, shame. I notice that my writing on this fic follows a certain pattern: For months and months, I'll be unable to form a single word. Then, for no clear reason, I'll suddenly write the whole thing in just a day or two. It's maddening. But between the kind and oh-so-generous reviews, a few dozen screenings of Room Service, and a very ...wrong... dream involving Harpo, I've managed to pump out this chapter. I hope you enjoy it. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And so, the two men walked through the hospital, trying to look casual while searching for an exit. Meanwhile, in a hallway running perpendicular to the one these two were traveling, Dr. Penknife walked (in an oddly crouched position) while Harrison hurried to keep up. Some otherworldly force must have been timing their pace, because both pairs turned the corner as one, resulting in a collision reminiscent of a human car crash. \"Help!\" Dr. Penknife cried, \"I have whiplash! Trauma! I've fallen and I can't get up!\" Harrison pulled on Penknife's arm and helped him off the ground, which did nothing to silence him. \"You'll be hearing from my lawyer! And my lawyer's lawyer, and my lawyer's lawyer's lawyers! How many lawyers is that?\" he asked Harrison, then continued without waiting. \"Never mind, one is too many.\" He dusted himself off vigorously, giving a slanted eye to Knock, who was joining him in dusting. He took a cigar out of his pocket, which Knock quickly transferred to his own. \"Please, help yourself.\" Penknife smiled with sarcastic friendliness. \"Do you need a light? Ah, I see you have my matches as well.\" He turned his attention to the fourth man. \"Have we met somewhere before?\" he asked. \"No, I don' tink so.\" The Italian man replied, tapping his head. \"I gotta pretty good memory for funny lookin' faces.\" Penknife glanced back at Knock, who was puffing the cigar ferociously with too-wide eyes. A cloud of smoke enveloped him. \"Yes, I can see why.\" He responded. \"Now then, what's the big idea, running blindly down the hallway? Don't you know this is a hospital?\" \"No, you see, it's like-a dis...\" he put one hand on Penknife's shoulder and gestured grandly with the other as he spoke. \"The two of us, we walk up to dis building. An' right in front, there's a big sign, saying 'Stevens Healthcare.'\" He solemnly shook his head. \"An itsa no good. Neither of us is named Steven.\" He gestured to Knock, who nodded assent through the cigar cloud. \"I'm Vorreli and he's Knock, but no Stevens.\" \"Then why'd you come inside?\" \"Well, we figured we'd-a take the chance that Steven wasn't there.\" \"He's not the only one not all there.\" Penknife muttered. \"Please continue, this is fascinating. I'll just be listening from two towns over.\" He gestured to Harrison, who, minus a sleeve, walked up to him. \"C'mon Harrison, we've got thirty-five thousand dollars to spend.\" He turned, looking away from his companions to some unknown point in the distance. \"Back now, that's a lot of money.\" The two of them began to leave. Vorreli seemed to have other ideas. \"Thirty-five thousand dollars?\" He repeated. Knock swallowed the cigar and the two of them chased after Penknife. \"Wait a minute...\" Vorreli called. \"I feel faint! Oh, do I feel faint! I think I hit my head when you ran into me.\" \"Good,\" Penknife replied, \"maybe I knocked a few things back into place.\" \"No, it's just the other way 'round.\" Vorreli's eyes went wide while the others looked on. \"I'm seein' spots!\" he declared. \"Too bad, I hear stripes are in this season.\" Harrison felt around Vorreli's neck and shoulders. \"I don't think any bones are broken.\" \"That won't last.\" Dr. Penknife replied. \"Now I'm seeing nothin'!\" Vorreli declared. \"Everything's gone black!\" \"Well if a paisley shirt appears, give me a call.\" Penknife replied, as Vorreli fainted with dramatic flourish. Harrison caught him and eased him to the ground, fanning him with an open palm. Penknife then turned his attention to Knock, who was not respecting the rules of personal space. \"And what's your problem?\" he asked. Smiling, Knock opened his long overcoat and pulled out the plastic chew toy, which had acquired another dog. The two canines growled at the doctor before Knock slipped them both back in. Dr. Penknife raised an eyebrow. \"You know,\" he said, \"I'm a very brilliant neurosurgeon, and I think I could remove that brain that's been troubling you.\" Knock shook his head, taking a plastic molded brain out of his coat and kissing it. Dr. Penknife shrugged. \"Well, I never was much for models.\" \"But Arthur, what about him?\" Harrison asked, pointing to Vorreli. \"Oh. Call a doctor for the poor man.\" \"But you're a doctor, doctor.\" Harrison protested. \"Don't you remember?\" \"I am? Well in that case, don't call the doctor. I wouldn't trust myself as far as I could throw me.\" \"Wait a minute. You're a doctor?\" Vorreli flew to his feet, (making a fantastic recovery,) and walked up to Penknife. \"In that case, he an' I are both qualified nurses.\" \"Nurses?\" Dr. Penknife smiled sweetly, bobbing his head up and down. \"Oh, well, that's different isn't it? I suppose you know first aid?\" \"Sure we do. First aid, second aid, lemonade, we know everything.\" \"I could kiss you if I had a fatal illness. What else do you know?\" \"Show him what else we know, Knock.\" Eagerly, Knock pulled a functioning harp out of his coat and started to play it. \"Oh no,\" Penknife said, cutting him off. \"There'll be none of that here.\" Knock shrugged and threw the instrument down the hallway. Several crashing noises followed. Penknife rolled his eyes heavenward and ran his fingers through his hair, then smiled and turned to Vorreli. \"I've seen all I need to see, you're hired.\" He said, shaking Vorreli's hand. \"Now go away and never bother me again.\" Penknife dashed down the hall, with Harrison in tow. At the end of the hallway he turned around and yelled back at the other two. \"Stick around and maybe someone'll discover a cure for you!\" Knock stuck another of Penknife's cigars in his mouth.[Chapter 4] This chapter ran a little long, so I had to cut it in half, meaning the scene that begins here will be continued in the next chapter. Also, as long as I'm here, I'd like to post some propaganda for an extremely cool challenge that Qoheleth is hosting. It's called The Great AFI Screen Characters Challenge. Here's what happens- you e-mail Qoheleth and tell him you're interested. Then, he chooses a random name from AFI's list of the 50 greatest heroes and 50 greatest villains in American cinema. You then write a story about whomever he chooses. Sound fun? The challenge, as well as Qoheleth's e-mail, can be seen on his profile. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"I just don't understand it.\" Stephens declared. Near him, Dr. Greensleeves leaned over a man in a light paper gown and muttered. \"I've tried every procedure I know, taken advice from every doctor that's put pen to paper.\" He paused to scratch the back of his head, which had an uneven look, as if someone had taken a scissors to it. \"I've thrown every pill at it, every serum, and I can't get rid of those headaches. I'm through.\" Mr. Stephens wrung his hands impatiently. \"Surely there's something you haven't tried.\" He glanced at the grey-haired gentleman seated on the table. The expression on the man's drawn face showed that he was unaccustomed to the compromise in dignity that hospital gowns afforded. Greensleeves shook his head. \"There's no cause I can see. I've been telling you for weeks that his symptoms are psychosomatic, but you refuse to listen.\" He made no attempt to keep the frustrated anger out of his voice. \"I'm telling you right now, anyone willing to treat this patient any further is either possessing of singular compassion, or complete lunacy!\" The instant Greensleeves had finished his sentence, another loud voice came from down the hall. \"This place has got more dead ends than a game of shoots and ladders.\" Dr. Penknife said, gliding past the door. Stephens managed to keep himself from doing a double take. \"One moment‚Ä¶\" he said to the sick man, moving into the hallway. He grabbed Dr. Penknife by the arm. \"You're just the man I want to see‚Ä¶\" \"Thank you, you're quite a sight yourself.\" \"Here, follow me.\" Stephens replied, pulling him into the room. \"Now hold on here, I've got a house call to make at the nearest bar! What's the idea?\" \"Please, just take a look at this patient.\" \"I'm really in a hurry, can't you send me a photo?\" By this point he had been led next to the patient. He turned and whispered to him. \"Don't look now, but I think you're being talked about.\" \"Come now, doctor, I'd think someone with your skill could discover his problem in moments.\" Stephen's tone was half-sarcastic, and suggested that the matter of Penknife's skill was very much up for debate. \"Of course I can discover his problem. Why, I've cured thousands of people sicker than him- sicker than you, even!\" \"Well!\" Stephens snapped, most offended. \"No, not well at all, that was the problem. They even named a disease after me, called it Arthur-its.\" \"Arthritis.\" Corrected Greensleeves. \"Gesundheit.\" Penknife replied. \"Now where was I? Oh yes. A mighty fine doctor I'd be if I couldn't help this guy, right?\" \"I couldn't have put it better myself.\" Stephens replied. \"Not with that mouth anyway. Yes, a fine doctor I'd be then‚Ä¶\" Penknife turned to the sick man and cleared his throat loudly. \"Now, what's wrong with the man, besides having me for a doctor?\" Mr. Stephens opened his mouth to describe something, but Greensleeves cut him off. \"He's a hypochondriac,\" he said with some satisfaction. \"Funny, I'd have pegged him for a Presbyterian.\" Penknife replied. He cleared his throat again. And again. He continued clearing his throat for quite some time, bouncing gently on his heels as he did so. After several minutes he addressed the patient. \"All right now‚Ä¶ uh, stick out your tongue,\" he said. The sick man obeyed. \"Now put it back in, don't you know that's impolite?\" he cast a hasty glance to the other two men. \"Now raise your right hand.\" He paused while the sick man did so. \"Now your left hand. Now put your right hand in, put your right hand out, put your right hand in and shake it all about.\" It was about this moment that Harrison walked in, having been lost somewhere behind Penknife in the hall. \"Ah, glad you could make it Harrison,\" Penknife replied, \"we're examining a patient, and at the rate you're moving you should be ready in time for the funeral.\" \"Yours or his?\" Harrison whispered to Penknife. \"Keep sassing me like that and we'll make it a hat trick.\" Penknife whispered back. He then returned his attention to the patient and began clearing his throat once more, much to the annoyance of everyone. \"Maybe you should ask him to describe his symptoms.\" Harrison suggested. \"If I need your help, Harrison, I'll ask for it,\" said Penknife. \"Now then, what are your symptoms?\" \"Well,\" the patient began, \"I've been getting the most un bear able headaches lately‚Ä¶\" \"Your head hurts, eh? Well, keep off it.\" Penknife turned to leave. \"There we are, patient's cured‚Ä¶\" Dr. Greensleeves caught him on the way to the door and, with a clashing of voices, Penknife was turned around. \"All right, all right.\" Penknife continued. He turned back to the patient. \"So your head hurts. Well, does it hurt when you go like this?\" He held up two fingers and waggled them in the air. \"No.\" was the patient's reply. \"Good, then you can hail me a taxi because I'm leaving.\" He turned around again, to be stopped again by Stephens and Greensleeves. Their voices were mingled incomprehensibly in an argument, when Vorreli and Knock burst in.[Chapter 5] \"Hey Doc,\" Vorreli said, \"I wanna ask you som- oh.\" He stopped suddenlynwhen he saw Penknife with another doctor and a man in the hospital gown.nApparently, he was putting two, two and two together. His abrupt haltncaused Knock to run into him and, consequently, jump on his back. \"I cannsee you're busy, uh, we come back later.\" Vorreli then turned around and began walking very quickly in the oppositendirection. In response, Greensleeves grabbed Knock's shoulder, pulling bothnof them back into the room and, at the same time, pulling Knock offnVorreli. \"No, no...\" he said, leading them to the patient. \"If you work with Dr.nPenknife, you'll want to take a look at this man too.\" \"If anyone else wants to look at you, you can start charging for it.\"nPenknife whispered in the patient's ear. \"Doctor, you still haven't told me what's wrong with him!\" Stephens shoutednin frustration. \"Is somebody sick?\" Vorreli asked. \"Don't be silly, who would be sick in a hospital?\" Penknife replied. \"Nowncome on, let's examine this man.\" The four of them surrounded the patient and, in unison, put their hands tontheir chins and leaned forward. The sick man suddenly looked much, muchnsicker. \"Well, what do you think, nurse?\" Penknife said. \"I tell ya,\" Vorreli replied, \"I think we should run some tests first.\" \"True/False or multiple choice?\" \"Better be the second one, I don't have a coin to flip.\" \"You're off to a great start, testing my patience.\" \"Well, the patient's what we're here to test, right?\" \"You were dropped on your head a lot, weren't you? I'll bet some of it evennhappened when you were a child. You say you want to run some tests, eh?nOkay, we'll start by testing his reflexes. Harrison, get me the rubbernmallet.\" At that, Knock whistled and shook his head. Then he held up a finger andnproduced a large wooden mallet from his jacket, which he proudly presentednto Penknife. \"Well it's not rubber but it'll do.\" Penknife said, smiling and taking thenmallet. \"If nothing else, this'll give us an ailment we can identify- anbroken leg.\" He drew the mallet back dramatically, held it at it's apex forna moment, then slammed it downward. He stopped inches from the patient'snknee, but everybody winced all the same. He then gave the knee a littlentap, and the patient's leg shot upwards. \"You see,\" Penknife said, turning to Stephens and Greensleeves, \"the kneenis by and large the most overlooked part of the body. That's because it'snso often located much lower than the eyes.\" As he said this, he continued tapping with the mallet. With each tap henmade, the leg rose a little bit higher, until it was almost parallel withnPenknife's head. \"That's odd.\" He remarked, \"does anyone else feel anbreeze?\" He turned back to the patient, only to see that somewhere in the course ofnall this, Knock had jumped onto the table and moved his own knee in placenof the patient's knee. He continued swinging it upwards after Penknifenstopped tapping it. \"Get off that poor man there, he has enough diseases as it is.\" Penknifenremarked. The patient stood, sending Knock to the ground. \"Do you really think I havensomething?\" he asked. \"Nurse?\" \"I dunno, I think we needa few more tests.\" Vorreli replied. \"All right, next we'll test your vision.\" Penknife pulled a sheet of papernout of his pocket and held it up in front of the patient. \"Look at thesenblotches and tell me what you see.\" The patient considered this a moment. \"Well, it looks like an ostrich.\" \"Are you kidding?\" Vorreli replied. \"That? No, that's an elephant.\" \"Well I think it looks like an ostrich.\" \"You're both wrong,\" said Penknife. \"It's my pen, and it's broken.\" \"What do you think, Knock?\" In lieu of a reply, Knock took a whistle from his pocket and blew it, verynloudly, next to the patient's head. \"Aaugh!\" the patient cried. \"Ah, good.\" Vorreli said. \"What's good?!\" \"Your ears work. Asta good.\" \"Well, I've seen all I need to see.\" Penknife declared. \"This man has anclear-cut case of Atisetisitisetisosis. Don't you agree nurse?\" \"Nah.\" Vorreli said. \"What, you don't like it?\" \"Nah. Too many etises.\" \"What, you think I should take one etis out and leave just the one?\" \"One is too many, you can take both etises out.\" \"Well wait a minute, how about I take out one etis and you take out thenother etis.\" \"Okay, but I got no place to take her.\" Penknife grabbed his own hair and pulled backwards. \"Never mind.\" Vorreli said, shaking his head. \"I don' like Edith anyway.nWho else you got in there?\" \"Who else?\" Penknife counted off on his fingers. \"Well, if we get rid ofnthe etises, there's an atis, an itis and an osis.\" \"Well, I'll tell ya what we do, Doc. We tell itis that she can't hangnaround here no more... then when she goes to tell etis about it, we changenthe locks and pretend to be out.\" \"Well, it sounds reasonable so far.\" \"An' while that's happening we send osis out to the corner for groceries.nBread, milk an' asparagus.\" \"What, no eggs?\" \"Nah, we got plenty eggs. So while she's out with the groceries, whadayanthink we do? We change the locks again!\" \"Well that's all right for her, but what about atis?\" \"Don' worry 'bout her, she's a friend of Edith. See, she left when theynleft.\" \"Ah.\" \"So the itis's gone and the osis's gone, and now we got something!\" Dr. Penknife considered this \"So there's no etises, no itises, no atisesnand no osises? There's no more disease left. He's cured!\" He leapt up andnshook hands with Vorreli. Knock, who had made his way onto the patient'snlap again, shook hands with Vorreli while Penknife shook hands withnHarrison, and so on. \"I'm... cured?\" the patient muttered, sounding dazed. \"Yes... I'm cured. Indon't have to come back here any more...\" With renewed energy, he shook thenhand of Dr. Penknife, who was still engaged in several other handshakenexchanges. \"Thank you...\" He walked happily to the door, seemingly unawarenthat he was still in a hospital gown. On the way out he shook Stephen'snhand as well. \"Thank you,\" he repeated, and left. Mr. Stephens buried his head in his hands.

Even though there wasn't must interaction between Rodney Copperbottom (the sleek, blue robot,) and Piper Pinwheeler (the young, yellow teenage robot,) I liked the chemistry between the two :). Besides, I never honestly cared for Cappy :P it just felt like‚Ä¶ she just existed for the sake of Rodney's love interest, you know? It's like that clich√© movie where the nerd gets the hot babe at the end of the scene- not exactly complaining, but I just think that Rodney and Piper seems more‚Ä¶ understanding, well, not exactly, but nevermind. Besides, I've noticed there's like, no fanfictions about this movie either : that kind of sucks, but then again, I never cared about the movie until I re-watched it about two weeks ago XD, this probably have to the most underrated movie I ever watched‚Ä¶ except for Turbo and Epic , but that's another opinion to share later. I'll probably be the first to write a Piper/Rodney fanfics‚Ä¶- ah, well I take that back, this won't really be a shipment one-shot per-say, but it's in Rodney's point of view about the spunky female character :9. PS. I also believe that they're both teenagers, but Rodney is probably in his late teens (like 18/19) he graduated before the whole movie progressed, so I'm assuming he's eighteen.

Disclaimer: I obviously don't own the Robots movie, it belongs to Blue Sky Studios.

'' Rodney seethed, his fingers gripping around the metal part of his foot and yanked it away from the grimy hands of this thief . ''I'm not a mugger.'' He's not in the mood for this. Rodney heaved, jerking his lower leg out of the silver pan and shoved it against the empty socket of the foot, twisting and turning, readjusting till' a click was heard. Finally, he could feel the sensations running through his lower left limb and he sighed in relief. ''I'm a‚Ä¶'' His cyan eyes glanced at the head lying sideways near a trashcan. ''A scavenger.'' Scavenger? Pfft, yeah right, more likely a crook . The robot huffed, eyes flickering over to the headless red body wondering blindly and Rodney couldn't help but to frown‚Ä¶ and then shook his head before carefully moving towards the unattached head. His hopeful attitude for meeting his dream faltered a little, but he understood things doesn't come easy, though, it seems the dream will just have to wait a tad longer. Rodney sighed again as he rolled his eyes, ''here, let me help you.'' Let his kindheartedness be damned yet the gentle nature of compassion inside himself couldn't be ignored, even to a‚Ä¶ crook. ''No, no, I can do it myself.'' The head replied, ''I'm good attracting myself, if you know what I mean.'' Internally, Rodney rolled his eyes once more. The head began to whistle, ''c'mere boy!'' He called, and then he whistled again. The thief's body gained attention of his owner's called as it followed towards the head, ''w-wait, waitwaitwait- ouch! '' The headless robot kicked its owner's head, clank! ''wait!'' And kicked over again. Rodney stood there, unimpressed. Well, that's fine, if he doesn't want help then Rodney's not going to force it. I need a place to recollect and strategize a new plan. Investigate Bigweld's Industry and find answers to Bigweld's disappearance. Quick idea, somewhat flawed, but it'll be suitable. Abruptly, Rodney stiffened. Wonderbot. Oh goodness. The gears inside him went to a rigid halt, jittering and shifting at an irregular pace. How could he forget about Wonderbot? He frowned deeply as he worried. The plan must be postponed for now, his tiny companion is top priority. Clang! Thalump! Rodney's worrisome thoughts paused as he stared at the tumbling head falling off the balcony. He could've still asked for help. That's going to hurt. I might as well follow him . There might be a town further ahead, he can look for shelter and start there. Rodney cringed as he watched the body stumble over the edge. ''That's gonna hurt‚Ä¶'' He can't blame the thief, he had been toppling down fifty feet in a trashcan previously hours ago. -0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0- Rodney trudged through the streets quietly, eyes looking everywhere that might be the appearance of Wonderbot, but that past five minutes were no luck, and he has yet to find the small contraption. He groaned, his head shaking and arms folded, what if I never find him? Even though he ignored the negative feelings for a while, it still lingered there, haunting him, I have to keep looking. If Rodney doesn't find Wonderbot then there will be no point returning to Robot City. Things aren't starting too well the first day in Robot City. Kicked out from the famous Bigweld's Industry to being humiliated through magnetization, and then nearly mugged and now scavenging to find Wonderbot. ''Talk about first day‚Ä¶'' Rodney muttered, glaring at the ground for a while before grunting, tempter rising as his foot struck a can; kicking it across the concrete and watching it scatter towards the junkyard. He'll check the junkyard, Wonderbot must be in there‚Ä¶ The young adult picked up his speed and went inside the compost area. Rodney stared, awestruck‚Ä¶ ''There's barely any parts!'' He blurted loudly, eyes scanning the empty, dusty area. In a sense, it's great because he could find Wonderbot easier, but at the same time‚Ä¶ who could find a legitimate part when there's barely any? ''That's the guy! That's the guy who knocked my head off!'' Huh? Rodney blinked, and blinked again. Someone's here? He turned to find two robots charging at him- a dingy, dull gold and a dark blue robots growling at his sides, he stumbled backwards. ''What the‚Ä¶!'' He glanced to find a yellow robot holding Wonderbot‚Ä¶- hey! ''Hey! That's mine!'' Rodney shouted, becoming upset. Seeing it in the hands of a stranger is placing him on edge, defense. He withdrew backwards. A sleek, young yellow robot marching up to him, face angry and footsteps hasty while still carrying Wonderbot. Large fiery green eyes burned into his light blue ones, obviously telling she's not to be messed with. Rodney took a step rearward and blinked. Shiny brown hair, on the edges where showerheads for her pigtails, bouncing with every step she took, and a black button nose, burning brown. ''Who do you think you are? So punk like you knocking off my brother's head?!\" She ranted, pointing a finger in his direction- on his chest, making Rodney lose his breath. She appear younger than him, maybe fifteen or sixteen, either way, she's an obvious loud-mouth teenager. Rodney made a noise, offended. Well that thief's head wouldn't be dislocated if he didn't steal his foot ! ''You're lucky I have this delicate doodad in my hand or I would make sure you would regret it!'' She finger pointed his chest again. Poke. Poke. Poke. ''How would you like it if someone knocked your head off, huh?!'' Piper scowled, Rodney frowned and snatched her hand, placing it in a tight grip. ''I'm sorry, but you're mistaken‚Ä¶ I didn't knock his head off, he tripped and his head disconnected from his body, and what you're holding is my invention.'' Her burning bright yellow started to grasp his attention as he glanced below at the curves of her hips- no, no‚Ä¶ face is upwards, not downwards. He noticed suddenly there's pink oval flushes on her cheeks. ''Oh really?'' She questioned, and he nodded. She's kinda cute. ''If you mess with my brother-...\" She halted, staring at Rodney with a different set of eyes. ''Hey‚Ä¶ you're kind of cute.'' The girl drawled slowly, a grin edging around her mouth. The bright yellow began to dull into a darker set of yellow- an attractive, seductive yellow. Rodney released the girl's hand with a blush ( A/N: Let's pretend that robots can blush‚Ä¶) and a shy smile slithered around his face. Ironic, he thought the same thing. Of course, he's not going to tell her that. ''Come on Piper, let's just get out of here. We need to find some parts for Fender.'' Rodney glances over his shoulder to find the other two robots walking out of the junkyard, and then his eyes reverted towards the teenage girl. So Piper is her name‚Ä¶ ''Here's your‚Ä¶ thing-a-ma-bob‚Ä¶'' Piper handed Wonderbot over to him and Rodney accepted it graciously. At least his worries of Wonderbot are now over, but where would he stay? ''By the way, the name's Piper, rhymes with viper ,'' Her burning anger subsided into admiration, maybe attraction, Rodney wasn't sure‚Ä¶ her heated brown nose resided to black and green eyes scanning over him and oddly, he felt self-conscious. Did he look‚Ä¶ attractive? While Piper gave a generous gaze over him, Rodney figured it wouldn't hurt to give a gentle stare over her- wait, no, stop ! This isn't how gentlemen suppose to act like! Very, very inappropriate. '' Piper! \" ''Fine, I'm coming!'' Piper's heated green eyes flickered at Rodney before smiling, ''I'll see you around.'' She cooed, waving before twisting her body to leave, giving Rodney a good look at her hips. Rodney hummed. Piper tripped with an ' oof! ', arms flailing as she fell to her knees. Automatically, Rodney would have offered her help, but instead, watched as Piper instantly stood straight, ''I'm fine.'' Recollecting herself, the girl's hands brushed against her pigtails and kept walking, hips swinging and her bright, yellow persona flaring. Cute, passionate, a little loud mouth, but yellow seemed to describe Piper. Rodney smiled. -0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0- A/N: END. :D[Chapter 2] Blue Totally Fits A/N: Hey guys! I'm back by sudden inspiration! Ya'll excited? Anyway, I was like, totally thinking of a decent scene without extreme OOC edition and like, totally not (lies) adding my personal fantasies. I'm going to add a little extra here an' there , but in the end it'll be as if this was a deleted scene in the movie! So no incredibly mushy stuff, but ya'll gonna get the sweetness they need :) Ps.

Summary: Fixing hundreds of broken robots within the slums of Robot City can certainly drain a robot. Relaxing away sore gears with Aunt Fanny's special hot oil is totally what Piper needs. Not only that, but talking to this cutie Rodney is certainly a delight, so what better way getting to know him than play 21 Questions? A fun game of 21 questions eventually turns deep and... Not fun anymore. Blue, that's Piper can think of...- why is Rodney's color so vivid in her thoughts? Disclaimer: I obviously don't own the Robots movie, it belongs to Blue Sky Studios.

I DECIDED TO ADD SOME STUFF‚Ä¶ SO YEAH :3. -0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0- Cogs jittered by the rust emerging from its hilt, creating slow movements in Piper's limbs when the girl stretched. Oily sweat dribbled down her mechanical vertebrae and slickened the crummy gears, but it wasn't enough to stop the sluggish motions below her lower half. \"And there you go, good as new!\" Piper watched the elderly-bot graciously shake Rodney's hand in absolute appreciation, giving numerous 'Thank You's and begging to treat Rodney in return. But Rodney continued to declined. \"Oh no ma'm, I appreciate your offer but I'm very content seeing you fixed.\" \"Are you sure? A little money wouldn't hurt, would it?\" The elder reached into her purse, but was stopped by Rodney's hand. \"That won't be necessary, ma'm. I'm very happy to serve you.\" Rodney smiled. Piper snorted, but internally, she signed dreamily. This have to be the most cutest robot she'd seen! Not to mention a natural goodie-two-shoes at heart. He's definitely not from here. \"Yes- yes, I'll certainly keep that in mind. You too, ma'm.\" When the elder-bot finally left, Rodney released a sigh of absolute relief. \"It's been quite a day.\" The robot mused gently, cyan eyes gazing at the twilight bliss sky. Piper on the other hand was preoccupied staring at the lanky, yet handsome, smooth blue robot. That figure, the luscious shine reflecting his color baby blue and- and oh gosh, Piper never seen such gorgeous eyes before she met Rodney. And the name is so... Abnormal, certainly unusual, but lovely and nerdish at the same time. Piper Pinwheel is totally crushing on Rodney Copperbottom. Sure, she had many crushes on a few bots here and there, but it lasted no more than a day. With Rodney? It's definitely more than a day, Piper argues two full days and one-third of the hour has she been admiring- no, obsessing over Rodney. His attractive sleek body structure, those smooth and shiny grooves for those bold, delicate fingers. Face beautiful in such a masculine way, but immense youthfulness that Rodney could be mistaken as a kid. \"Piper?\" Piper thought the obvious, blunt fact she could state. He's so hot. Unbelievably, mesmerizing, totally hot... \"Piper? Piper are you with me?\" A hand waved through Piper's vision, suddenly startling her. \"W-what? What happened?\" When Piper blinked, she found Rodney gazing directly at her with his worried cyan eyes. \"Nothing exactly ' happened ', Piper. Are you okay? You kind of went blank there.\" Rodney's voice laced with delicate concern, eyes scanning every inch of Piper's face to see if anything disruptive occurred. Again, Piper internally and blissfully sighed, admiring Rodney's natural instinct of worry over her. \"Nah, I'm good. Let's head inside and have a cup of oil. Sounds good?\" Rodney nodded. \"Yes, that sounds very nice.\" Piper's positive Rodney wasn't born here in the slums of Robot City, neither the rich, fancy areas. His accent screams immediate newbie around here. And Piper loved it. A new boy she can talk to without being downgraded as some little girl, a kid . Besides, majority of the males around here are a bunch of grown adults, way old for her, let alone anyone's interests. \"Aunt Fanny, we're home!\" Piper opened the door and pushed it so Rodney could walk through her...- yet the blue robot stayed in place. \"Aren't you coming in?\" Piper asked, slightly confused. \"Of course! But ladies first, correct?\" The robot said, right hand holding the door securely. Piper stared blankly at him. Ladies first? What language is that? \"Um, thanks.\" That's the most weirdest thing Rodney ever said to her...- but she likes it. \"Hello children! How was you day? It must have been exhausting! \" They found Aunt Fanny in the kitchen cooking some oilizer soup with her huge butt confronting them. The derri√®re is a big give away regardless of any situation, so it's no worry over Aunt Fanny's 'disappearance'. \"Yeah, I'm totally worn out. Hey Fan, ya got any oil for us?\" Aunt tried to turn at Piper's question, but knocked over a few dishes within the process. \"Of course darling! I would never leave no child of mines without oil!\" Aunt Fanny gushed, staring at the two while her butt swiped a few ingredients off the counter. \"Great. Where's it at?\" \"Well, I have to fix fresh oil for you. The boys took majority of the oil and the rest is a bit... Cold. You don't mind waiting a bit, will you darlings?\" Piper was about to speak, but Rodney beat her to it. \"No ma'm, I'll don't mind waiting. You can take your time.\" He said, carrying that goodie-two-shoes tone in his voice. No offense, even though Piper likes hearing his voice, the goodie-goodie nice boy act is honestly annoying as hell. \"Such a nice young man you are! I'm certainly glad meeting you.\" The woman continued praising Rodney, causing the blue clad robot to blush and Piper to roll her eyes. I barely receive any praise... The thought made Piper a little irked, wondering why everyone loves this new kid. Strange, cause' she likes the kid, like, very much. Piper asked, \"where's everyone else?\" She noticed the vacant of males around the house and decided to know about their whereabouts. \"They're at the junkyard scavenging for parts and other extra items. Did you wanted to go?\" Aunt Fanny tilted her head, bemused. Piper shook her head, internally smirking at the thought of being alone with Rodney. Kinda. \"Welp, looks like I'll be in the living room. Coming Rodney?\" It sounded so weird saying that name off her tongue, but Piper liked to hear the name coming from her lips. \"Sure, lead the way?\" He responded. There were so many questions Piper wanted to ask him, so many things she wanted to learn about this boy! But where could she start? How? It's not like she frequently talks to decent bots her age, let alone a dude, but this could be the perfect chance! You don't see a young, hot and fully constructed and not rusted robot here in the ghetto of Robot City. \"Wanna sit over there?\" \"Huh?\" Rodney blinked, and then turned when Piper pointed her finger at the dusty furniture. \"Oh! My bad.\" The male chuckled nervously. The gears in Piper's chest shifted in rigid, slow manners that made her gulp. Alright, she's a bit nervous. Maybe a lot. The girl plopped onto the sofa with Rodney following afterwards. \"Whew! What a day, yeah? Totally freaking stooped. What 'bout you?\" Piper asked while Rodney shifted in his seat until he got comfortable. \"Yeah, I'm rather tired, but as long as everyone's happy then I'm happy.\" Gosh, even when Rodney's tired he's still smiling! Totally cute. Eventually, silence emitted itself into the living room, making the situation rather... Awkward. Piper swallowed her nervousness and decided to play... A game. \"Let's play 21 Questions, okay? I ask a question and you answer, and then you ask me a question and I'll answer. Got it? Good. First question: are you enjoying your stay?\" The suddenness of Piper's statement-yet-question made Rodney blink, taking a moment to comprehend her... 'Game'? He turned towards her and simply stared. ... Okay, maybe this wasn't the best idea, but come on! Things were getting weird and she didn't know what to do! \"Oh... Um, yes , yes I'm enjoying my stay here. If it weren't for you guys then I honestly have know idea where I would live. N-not implying I'm homeless or anything like that, but I like it very much here.\" Rodney said with a brief smile. \"And I'm suppose to ask a question in return?\" When Pipper nodded, Rodney laid against the sofa and hummed, fingers drumming against the arm on the sofa. It had taken a moment, but Rodney eventually asked, \"How long have you lived here?\" \"Most of my life. I say... A decade? Anyway, my turn! What brought you here to Robot City?\" Piper heard bits and pieces of Rodney's reasoning being here, but never really gotten full detail about it. Something about Bigweld and inventions...- something like that. Rodney smiled brightly, almost as if Piper given him a delightful present. \"Well,\" he started as his eyes stared across the distance, \"it's been my dream to finally come to Robot City. As a kid I always dreamed to visit Bigweld and show him my inventions, and then support my family as well helping others. I understand it's sappy, but that's the ultimate goal being here, chasing my dream.\" Ah, a naive kid with blissful, optimistic thinking. Interesting, but sad. \"So, how old are you? Just curious.\" Piper waved at Rodney's question with a laugh, \"it's fine. I'm sixteen... And a half. What about you?\" Rodney grinned, \"eighteen... And a half.\" They both found themselves laughing. Wow, for an eighteen year old Rodney is definitely mature! Heck, Piper thought he was twenty. Incredibly likable, mature and intelligent than the posers at her rundown high school. \"So, uh, do you go to school?\" \"Like, duh? I go back to school in the fall. On a side note, it's not really school but a place to hoard stupid people doing absolutely nothing but failing tests.\" Me included. But Piper would never say it. \"Okay, sixth question: are you straight, bi or gay?\" Talk about a laughable reaction. Rodney immediately appeared flabbergasted with absolute shock blazing in his startled eyes, as if such words she spewed completely slapped him, \"I...\" Rodney seemed hesitant to answer the question. Wait, could it possibly be that Rodney's...? Piper immediately blushed, \"oh, uh, s-sorry-\" \" No! No, it's... It's fine. Um, to answer you question... I'm preferably heterosexual. Um, w-what's your...?\" Rodney looked too embarrassed to say it. \"I'm inbetween, if ya know what I mean.\" Piper grinned when she saw Rodney's blush deepening. \"Nah! I'm just kidding. I'm straight dude.\" \"Oh.\" Rodney then coughed, \"I see. Um, what's life like here?\" \"Life here honestly sucks. Too many old people, barely any legitimate parts, thug bots hover the night area and there's no girls around here. School is shit, most of the boys either want something from me or just interested getting into my-\" \"O-okay! I think I understand what you meant.\" Aw, Piper just wanted to pinch Rodney's cheek! For a teenager, Rodney's sure innocent with his childish perception of the world. So sad she doesn't have any of it. Piper asked a more simpler question, \"what's your favorite food?\" \"Grilled tar sandwich with bolted oil soup. Yours?\" \"I don't really have a favorite. Most of the food we usually eat is soup related, and don't get me started on the lunch menu at school. I seriously think it's junk you get out the garbage. No joke.\" The awful memories of disgusting glob called 'food' penetrated her memory, making Piper shudder in disgust. Great, now she has to fear food when she returns back to school! Rodney slightly chuckled, \"I understand the feeling. My high school menu wasn't appealing, either. We have a lot in common than we think!\" So they continued with their little game of 21 Questions, asking about personal preferences and other interesting junk. \"Here's fresh oil, children!\" Aunt Fanny moved across the living room gradually, trying to remain careful from bumping into things. \"Thanks Fan.\" Piper stood from the couch walked towards the large endowed woman, grabbing the mugs before nodding her head in thanks. \"If ya need anything, just give me a call!\" Aunt Fanny exclaimed, walking past a tiny table, oblivious when her butt pushed it over. Piper sighed as she handed a mug to Rodney, who graciously accepted it. \"Thank you, I'm certainly grateful-\" \"You don't have to keep up the act, you know.\" Rodney tilted his head, confused, \"what do you mean? I'm being genuine.\" He stated. Piper rolled her eyes and sighed again, \"are you always this nice?\" Not that she has a personal issue with it, but it's kind of annoying saying thank you 24/7. Yeah, she's not the best with mannerism but Rodney should relax! They're teenagers and they should have fun. \"Well, my parents always raised me to be nice and mannered. I'm accustomed being structured this way...- um, my bad?\" \"Hm, that brings an interesting question. What's your life before coming to Robot City?\" Piper took a sip from her cup, relishing the taste of fresh coffee flavored oil. \"My life is pretty average, I guess. Lived in Rivet Town, a quiet suburban area. Have two parents...- my dad works at a restaurant as a dish washer, and I would help him pretty frequently. Actually, my main reason being in Robot City is because of my dad.\" Rodney chuckled softly, contrast to his eyes narrowing in thought. It made Piper incredibly curious, but she withheld herself from asking further. After all, gotta play fair, right? \"What's your life before living at Aunt Fanny's?\" Rodney asked. ... Life before Aunt Fanny's? Piper can barely remember, and even if old time memories still lingered, she doesn't want to remember it. The silence made Rodney frown, \"you don't have to tell me if it's comfortable.\" He said. Piper shook her head, \"nah, I'm good. Life before Fanny's was... Depressing, actually. I lived in a not-exactly-average family, and by that I mean poor. Two parents, too, and I was an only child. But my parents wasn't happy about my gender and body structure...- bluntly speaking, they wanted a son, and I mean really wanted one. They distasted my presence and sometimes pretended I wasn't there. It's really depressing, you know? Having parents act like you weren't their child. So, around six my parents bought a son, a.k.a, my little brother and then... They threw me out. No, I don't mean dropped me off at some random orphanage, I mean they dumped me in the garbage to be scrapped.\" God, the sudden emotions from years before started to plague her subconscious. Unwanted. Forgotten. Alone. Disgrace. Piper felt herself relishing the memories, making the game feel... Dull. Unconsciously, her fingers gripped the mug tightly for comfort, but nothing soothed the rigid, tightening gears within her chest. And then felt a hand on her shoulder. \"I'm... I'm sorry.\" Piper heard Rodney say, and suddenly, she laughed. \" Sorry? How's that going to change anything?\" She just wanted to slap his hand away and cower in sadness, like a little emo teenage girl sobbing in a typical angst manner. But no, this goodie-goodie nice guy wanted to comfort her and her problems! So clich√© and ridiculous. \"I shouldn't have asked-\" \"Too late, you asked and I answered. Now that we're on depressing things I'll ask you a depressing question. Did you ever feel unwanted? Hated and, well, emo?\" Piper was curious about Rodney's emotional conflicts during his teenager (and still) life. Did he ever wear dark makeup and changed his eyes? Did he ever let himself purposely rust? Or did he just whine about life to his momma? Actually, that'll be funnier than anything else. \"Yes. Yes I have...- I think we all go through emotional pain, no matter what it is. It's just... A way of life. I wasn't, well, emo as you call it, but moments in my life I have pondered my existence and doubted my purpose many times due to my failures, my faults and mistakes. School wasn't a stroll in the park, either. However, I had support to assist me during my depressed moods.\" Piper could felt his hand tightening on her shoulder. \"And Piper, I'm ready to support and help you through any pain you're going through, physically and emotionally.\" She can see the determination in Rodney's blue eyes, a firm yet encouraging smile that made Piper's metallic heart flutter. \"Do you have a girlfriend?\" Piper blurted out. Rodney blinked, \"what?\" He took his hand off her shoulder and stared. \"Uh, my bad. You were suppose to ask a question but-\" \"I'm not in a relationship currently.\" Yes! He's available! Piper suddenly felt incredibly happy. \"Are you in a relationship, Piper?\" Rodney questioned and Piper immediately shook her head, \"nope! Single and ready to mingle, hun!\" At this Rodney laughed. \"What's your full name, Mr. Copperbottom?\" Rodney frown a little, appearing somewhat embarrassed. \"You don't want to know...\" The eighteen year old mumbled. This made Piper incredibly curious, \"come on! It shouldn't be that bad...-\" \"It is. Don't pry on the question because I'm not answering it. Ever.\" Wow, this is the first Rodney ever made a rebuttal, a refusal. Piper smirked, \"look, if it makes you happy, I have an embarrassing middle name, too. Well, it's not official because I don't recall my true middle or last name, but everyone call me Piper Kinect Pinwheeler. Sounds stupid, right?\" \"...\" \"I'll just assume you're agreeing with me, 'kay? And since you're not going to answer my question, I'm going to ask you two questions. Don't argue me on this. What your preference of girls, and finally, what's your favorite color?\" Rodney seemed to relax at this, took a drink from his cup and mused quietly. \"... I fancy strong willed girls...\" I'm strong willed. Check. \"I like prettiness. Personality I'm attracted too...- suppose entertaining ones?\" I can be entertaining. Check. \"And I do enjoy a girl's ambition.\" I can be ambitious. Check. \"And did you say favorite color?\" Piper nodded at Rodney's question and the robot boy sighed. \"Well, my favorite colors are a little... Strange, but it's green and silver. Abnormal, yes? Expected I say the obvious color blue?\" \"Yes.\" Piper admitted. \"I'm sure you'll be asking the same question, so I'll just answer them for you. I like hot dudes with an attractive personality, and no douche baggery. Genuine, kind and all mushy stuff that's not too romantic. I totally like bad and good boys. My favorite color is...- well, I don't know, honestly.\" But inside, Piper immediately knew by looking at Rodney the day she stormed up to him that her favorite color was blue. Because blue totally fits him. \"21 Questions is over! Thank you for participating in my game and hope we have another game to play sometime soon, yeah?\" Piper stood up and grabbed Rodney's empty mug. When the girl glanced at Rodney, she felt herself sharply inhale. He's staring her in admiration! Maybe more? The thought is making her tremble in anxiousness. \"Yes, we'll play again soon.\" Rodney's eyes twinkled.[Chapter 3] Colorful Nicknames Hours of the night burned away with numerous of mechanical duties and long, tedious repairs. Along with the burden of scavenging for useful parts, they could only make do with cheap substitutes. It didn't matter, the customers were rather satisfied with the simplest of spare parts being used. Even though many of the citizens of Robot City were restored from their crumbling state, there a few particular beings who requested an ideal ' upgrade '. Suppose it's more work than anticipated, but at least they'll receive a good reputation. Piper packed up the remaining tools scattered on the table and placed them in Mr. Hammer's box. She couldn't shield the yawns that constantly escaped from her mouth, \"ugh, I so need some beauty sleep.\" For the past three days she's been helping the crew rebuild broken townspeople by the rise of dawn to twilight. Thank goodness Mr. Hammer closes on Sundays. Piper doesn't consider this whole ordeal an obnoxious experience but a good one. She gets to preoccupy herself majority of the time, and then always being beside Rodney‚Ä¶ Ugh, just thinking about the guy gives her these mushy chills. Cloth held tightly in her hand, the robot wiped down the oily counters and tables. \" Phew! Boy am I tired!\" Piper heard Fender exclaim, \"I could just drop dead and sleep beneath the ground!\" \"Uh, how can you be asleep if you're dead?\" \"Dear child, ever heard the meaning eternal sleep? Oops! Sorry, I forgot you're very young.\" Piper immediately slapped a hand on her hip, \"and what's that suppose to mean?\" She never understood why everyone treated her like a tween. Sure, she's younger than everyone else but that doesn't exclude her maturity whatsoever! Fender waved casually, \"don't look into it too much.\" He said, \"it's adult stuff you won't understand.\" Piper grumbled underneath her breath as she sprayed cleaner soap on the counters. Adult her ass . You know what? Fine, whatever, she doesn't care what Fender nor anyone else thinks about her. \"Come on Fender, be nice to your sister. Piper can comprehend many situations, so no need to hide it.\" Piper glanced at the robot reorganizing the clustered drawers, and sighed. Ever since Rodney came to Robot City, things changed significantly. In the midst of lost and despair, hope has been found through the eyes of Rodney Copperbottom. He brought new insight, skills and being an awesome dude to hang out with‚Ä¶- maybe that's why Piper likes him so much? Nah, everyone knows good looks are the main factor, and then a charismatic personality that Rodney totally carries. \"Pfft, Piper can barely understand adult situations. She's like, the baby in this dysfunctional family. Besides, Fanny would totally have our as- butts if we talk about any of that stuff.\" Crank explained as he swept the floors. Piper felt embarrassment seeping through her gears and suddenly wanted to dissemble herself. \"Okay, I am not a kid. I experienced many adult things in my teenage years! Just because I'm a girl and young doesn't mean I don't understand anything!\" Don't they remember what happened to her all those years previous? They weren't kid friendly, and her school reeks with losers that desperately tries to be wannabe adults. And why did they have to humiliate her in front of Rodney? Now he's going to think of her as some‚Ä¶ Some little girl! \"Ugh, you know what? I'm so done. I'm out!\" \" W-w-what!? \" Fender gasped loudly, \"a girl like you shouldn't be out at night! Alone and young and innocent!\" Great, not this again. \"Whatever Fender, I don't care. You keep treating me like a child and I'm sick of it! I'm done here, so I'll see you when I get home.\" Cloth tossed aside, Piper prepared to leave the store without a second thought- \" wait! \" Huh? Piper paused. \"I'll go with you‚Ä¶\" Honestly, if this whole ordeal about immaturity and kiddishness never happened then Piper would feel incredibly flattered, unfortunately, Rodney just happened to pour water on rusting gears. The girl tsked in annoyance, \"save it Rodney. I don't need you or anyone else to baby me.\" \"No, no , I don't mean it like that. I'm not doing this because you're young.\" Rodney winced when Piper gave him a tense glare, \"I want to walk you home because it's the polite thing to do.\" He finished with a weak smile. Is that a backway to imply I'm a kid? She won't look into it much. With a rolling of eyes and a quick snort, Piper motioned Rodney to follow her. Just like a puppy following its master, Rodney gladly complied. \"Good night! We will see you when you return home!\" Rodney waved at the guys, and Piper tsked. How could someone older than her act so na√Øve? And these men have the nerve to suggest that she's innocent? Ridiculous. Oh well, no need to become so rusty over it. The summer air warmed their exoskeletons from the bitter cold inside Mr. Hammer's workshop. Consider Jack Hammer a stingy robot since majority of electricity ranges from rare to completely nonexistent. Hands clasped behind her head, Piper hummed. This is another alone moment with Rodney, which is a total bonus since Thursday. Things racked her brain, begging to question Rodney once more, but Piper withheld it. She didn't need to act like some immature child with a silly crush, \"so, uh, do you like it here?\" \"Didn't you already ask me that question?\" Oh, right, she did. Piper coughed, trying to conceal her second degree embarrassment. \"Sorry, I mean, well, I don't really know what I mean. I'm probably repeating myself, but I just wanna know if you really like it here. Seems like you do.\" Guess it's personal satisfaction? Piper wasn't sure. Maybe she's trying to repeat a sentimental conversation they had previously. Rodney appeared very amused by the question for some weird reason and simply replied, \"yeah, I think it's awesome.\" Piper nearly choked. Did he say awesome? That's like, teaching a baby new words! \"Cool! Glad you like it here. Uh, yeah. Um, do you wanna play ' Twenty One questions ' again?\" Maybe they can burn time while walking home, and‚Ä¶ Possibly become closer? \"Okay, but‚Ä¶ What will we ask? My questions can be, well, quite boring.\" \"Eh, it's fine Rodney! Just ask anything and I'll answer it!\" What is she saying? Gosh, she's totally sounding like a ridiculous fangirl. They continued to asked the common questions with \" how was your day? \" and \" what's your plan for tomorrow? \" Everything seemed casual and Piper knew Rodney liked her questions. Unfortunately, turning around the corner and finding yourself within a sea of darkness could wipe all pleasant emotions. The urge to fawn over Rodney died, soon replaced by inklings of nervousness. Even though Piper's accustomed to the midnight streets, it still bugged her going through dark allies without company. And no, that does not make her a child. \"Piper?\" \"What?\" She glanced to find Rodney staring at her with his glowing blue eyes. \"It's okay,\" A hand rested firmly on her shoulder, \"I'm here with you, and I'll protect you. Trust me.\" He finished with a grin. Piper wanted to believe him, to reassure herself that she wasn't dumped in a trashcan and left to be scrapped in the pits of darkness. For a split second, she remembered the cold air chilling her gears and stiffening her heater. Alone and uncertain, desperately trying to find her way through the unknown streets. \"‚Ä¶ Y-yeah, I guess.\" The memories Piper shoved within the depths of her subconscious began to whisper, luring the girl in an uncomfortable place she didn't wish to recall. At that moment, she didn't bother for Rodney let alone anything else for that matter. Cold, abandoned and wasted. No, let's not focus on that. There's better things to dwell on as of current. \"Hey‚Ä¶\" Piper blinked back oily tears when Rodney held both of her shoulders and gazed in her dimmed lit eyes. \"Are you having flashbacks?\" He questioned. \"W-what?\" \"Flashbacks. Repressed memories that suddenly appear?\" Oh, she understands now. N-not like she didn't previously, but it makes more sense. \"Um, yeah, I guess you can say that. It's not that serious, so‚Ä¶ No need to baby me.\" She doesn't need anyone's help in this matter. Besides, why bother? It'll only endorse everyone to treat her like a complete kid and that's the least thing she needs right now. \"Piper-\" \"Can we get out of this ally? It's freaking me out.\" \"Oh, um, of course. Sorry.\" They continued down the dark streets in silence. Suddenly, Piper felt rather ridiculous for responding like a scared little bot, \"I'm sorry,\" She barely says sorry for anything, but it's only her attraction for Rodney and her immatureness is why she even bothered to apologize. Rodney turned to her in a look of surprise, \"why? There's no need! I understand your concern. We all have fears‚Ä¶ It's nothing to be ashamed of Piper. Oh, look, we're home now.\" For what seems like eternity, they found rows of tiny houses down the street with bright lights welcoming them instantly. Piper sighed in relief, and then blushed when Rodney smiled at her. Maybe it's a good thing to bring Rodney with her after all‚Ä¶ \"Thanks Rod, really.\" \" Rod? \" Rodney raised an eyebrow at the nickname, almost as if he never heard such thing. \"Yeah! Rod, Ro, Roddy . Ever heard of nicknames?\" Piper watched Rodney rub the back of his neck in hesitance, \"uh, not really. Everyone referred to me by my full name.\" \"Well then, I'll be the first to bestow you a nickname!\" Piper smirked when Rodney blinked in surprise. \"I'm going to call you‚Ä¶ Rod. Sounds cool, right?\" Rodney, or Rod, hummed in thought, and then nodded. \"Yes, I seem to like it. But isn't it common to give you a nickname as well?\" \"Well, I casually go by Pipe. But you can call me Pip if ya want.\" Rod clasped his hands in delight, \"then it's settled! I appreciate the nickname, Piper- oh, Pip.\" He smiled cheekily. Piper returned the haughty gesture, \"no problem Rod. Let's go home so we can get Fanny's famous soup! Race you there!\" And she took off without warning, receiving a loud \" hey! \" in return. Laughter jittered her core when Pip glanced over her shoulder, watching Rod catching up to her with speed. Every insecurity Pip felt washed away through the wind and relished the midnight sky that shined above them. Nighttime isn't so bad after all. ","Summary":" Yellow Seems To Fit A/N: To those who don't remember the movie Robots (2005) and decided to read th"},{"Movie":"Magic Mike","Title":"Yours and Mine","Author":"diamondisis","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11475777","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter 1 Brooke: Mike and I are about to engage in our evening sex, but tonight I am just not feeling it. As a matter a fact I haven't been feeling it for the past couple of weeks, but at least I've been going through the motions tonight I'm not even doing that. I push myself up to the head of the bed and press my back tightly against the headboard. I curl my knees up to my chest. \"What's wrong babe?\" Mike asks, \"Why'd you stop? aren't you having fun\" I pull the covers up to my chin and rest it there. It suddenly dawns on me that I am freezing despite the fact that we live in Tampa Florida. \"Mike I'm not feeling it today\" I say, \"Babe what's wrong?\" He asks again, \"It's not me is it?\" I prey to god that he hasn't noticed that I haven't been feeling it for weeks. \"No\" I say in a quiet voice. \"Really?\" Mike asks, \"Because you do seem kind of distant lately\" So I guess he has noticed. The thing about Mike and I is we are a very off again on again couple, we've broken up and gotten back together so many times it's ridiculous, this must be our 6th or 7th time back together, it's so hard to keep track. We have been dating for 2 years now which is as anyone may have guessed the longest we've stayed together. \"I don't really want to talk about it\" I say quietly. \"Great\" Mike says, \"just great.\" I then very suddenly find myself interrupting him. The words just kind of pop out of me like some weird sort of tourette syndrome. \"I'm sick\" I say, and I honestly can't explain to him why I said it, I don't know that for sure, I've been trying to avoid doctors which has been hard seeing that I am a second year resident in medical school, Mike smiles lopsided. \"You're just getting over something\" He says. \"It's probably just taking a while for you to recover\" He kisses me on the top of the head. \"I think you'll be fine. but all right no sex tonight you got it\" \"He is absolutely right I am getting over something, and I do not mean I'm just getting over a common cold from a week ago, I actually was hospitalized for three different diseases, the cold not being one of them and by just getting over something does not mean just a week ago either, try a month ago. As a matter a fact I should be better by now, but I'm not, I haven't recovered from those three diseases so there must be something else wrong with me. It all started when one night out of the blue I suddenly developed a strange habit of waking myself up choking and coughing it had happened three times that night. I have never had any sleep problems ever nor do I have a family history of sleeping problems so it was of course very unusual. By my third choking spell Mike who was usually a very heavy sleeper (Obviously since he wasn't woken up by the other two) rolled over and seemed as awake as could be. \"You all right babe?\" He asked me. \"Brooke sweetie? Are you choking?\" All I could do was nod my head yes. Mike had called the ambulance and I was instantly rushed through the hospital. It was found out that all though I had my tonsils out when I was 10 years old they had apparently grown back 19 years later. Not only had they grown back, but they had grown to be twice their size and were blocking my airways. On top of that, I also had an extreme case of double Pneumonia as well as mono, all three problems were apparently completely unrelated. But you know me, I'm just a bunch of loose idea's tied into one huge rubber band ball of mess. I know that as a second year in medical residency I should be using more intellegent language and that, that would be more forgivable if I were an Intern or maybe an adorable little freshman in Medical school (Undergrad that is), you know it's how an unintelligable med student would describe someone with a bunch of unrelated health issues, I guess a special snowflake would work too but how un medical sounding is that? Anyway what a mess. I can't say I ever remember being so much of a mess. If anyone in our family is a mess it's my younger brother Adam, cross that out WAS my brother Adam. He has now gone off to college and has recently launched his career in teaching, I'd say for the time he's one of the most together people I know. So now I guess it's my turn to be the mess. The loose idea's tied into one huge rubber band ball of mess that is. At least Adam was a straight forward mess. A refreshingly straight forward mess that is. I guess I would be lying If I were to say I'd never been that thing I just said I was (Don't really feel like spelling it all out again thank you very much) After all there was Freshman year of college. That year I had developed some sort of a seizure disorder, not like Grande Mall Epileptic seizures or anything like that, more like short moments where I would space out and completely forget where I was, other times I would be eating in the cafeteria and I would freeze whilst going through the motions of eating. Those seizures were of course less like seizures because I was completely aware of them, but very similar to cataplexy, Locked in Syndrome, or Stiff Person's Syndrome. Instantly I would become the center of attention at the entire table, \"Are you okay Brooke?\" Someone would ask, \"What's wrong Brooke?\" Someone else would ask. \"What happened Brooke?\" Someone else would ask, \"Should we call 911?\" Other's were ask. Other's were not so nice. \"Look's like Dumb Blonde's back\" That's right. I was nicknamed Dumb Blond even though I am not by any means dumb, It was the damn seizure's that earned me the nick name. Because of all the attention I was getting negative and positive it didn't matter to me, I stopped eating in the cafeteria. Eventually I stopped going to class to avoid humiliation as well after experiencing another kind of embarrassing kind of seizure where I would have smacking or chewing spells, fortunately those seizures were very rare because man were they ever embarrassing as I've already said. Also like the catatonic spells those seizures also weren't really seizures because I was also very well aware of them \"Ms Kennedy, you know very well I have a strict policy against chewing gum in class.\" My Anatomy and Physiology Prof had said, \"You better go spit it out\" \"What?\" I had asked. \"You heard me, go spit out your gum\" There were a couple of giggles from the classroom. \"Right\" I said. \"My gum\" I couldn't bring myself to tell him I wasn't chewing any gum, I would rather have him think that I was just being a bad student then have him think that I was having a seizure. I stood up from my seat in the front row (Lucky me having a seat in the front row) and headed over to the back of the classroom where the garbage was, only when I was to about the fourth row of seats I completely spaced out and forgot where I was. \"Ms Kennedy?\" The Proffessor asked. \"Are you all right?\" \"I'm sorry\" I said, \"I got uh side tracked\" \"Are you feeling all right?\" The Proffessor asked, \"Do you need to go to the nurse?\" I didn't say anything, I just bolted out the door and rushed back to my dorm room where I stayed for the rest of the day. It was the story of my life Freshman year I would have said I had become a total Hihikumori but I did leave the room to go to soccer practice, where I completely blew out my knee doing pretty much nothing which was as you guessed it another unrelated health issue. Without soccer or class or the cafeteria I kept to my room and I slipped into what I thought was a deep depression but now that I think about it was more likely a complete mental breakdown. I said few words to my roommate Genica which was really sad because we got along so well the first couple months of school. Pretty soon it just annoyed me when she went out of her way to try to include me and try to snap me out of my funk. She eventually gave up trying and we drifted apart which was fine by me, that way she would never have to find out about my embarassing seizures. \"Unfortunately one day she did find out. I was sitting on my bed eating a cup of noodles, my mouth was open and was filled with a fork full of noodles. It was one of the rare times I actually ate something, I was becoming a stick figure I could tell, but food just wouldn't go down, nor would it stay down. Genica had come back into the room because apparently she had forgotten her Math book. \"Hey just hear to get my math book\" She said, she then took one look at me, her eyes became wide as dinner plates (And I mean that in the least literal sense of course) and she dropped her duffle and ran over to me. \"Brooke?\" She cried. (Literally cried that is) She is not a pretty cryer but is anyone? \"Are you okay?\" \"Brooke hey!\" She said waving her hand in my face. I snapped out of it and instantly choked on the huge wad of noodles that was in my mouth. Genica put her hand on my shoulder. \"Are you okay?\" She asked gently. \"Brooke what happened?\" I coughed up the wad of noodles and burst into tears. \"Hey it's okay\" Genica said stroking my hair (Not in a lesbian way, okay maybe a little, but I'm pretty sure she had a boyfriend if I remember correctly) \"I' I need to go to the hospital\" I stammer. \"It's it's getting really bad.\" \"What is?\" She asked. I just couldn't bother to tell her about my seizures or that I barely did a single thing to blow out my knee. \"Just it\" I said, \"Just go to class\" I said. \"You expect me to go to class?\" She had asked. \"No way, I'm staying with you, you might have another fit? Why didn't you tell me you were epileptic it's really no big deal that you are\" \"Because I'm not\" I found myself snapping at her and I didn't really mean to snap at her, she'd been nothing but nice to me. \"Fine then\" Genica said, \"I'll see you after class, let me know what the doctor says\" She then took her duffle and ran off to class. I did end up going to the doctor eventually. Well technically the student health center. Let's just say it was a huge bust. I started crying deep chested sobs and told him that I was miserable but for some unexplainable reason I couldn't explain why I was miserable. He ended up \"Prescribing\" me with various over the counter pain medicines. Fuck that. Up until now I came to realize that I had nothing to worry about after that the seizure's disappeared and I was able to come back from my complete mental breakdown. But now I realize I had every reason in the world to be worried. Things haven't been the same since I was hospitalized with that unrelated trio of diseases. First of all there is the presisant cough, it seems like I at least have Pneumonia in one of my lungs still. My appatite has also been really suffering, I used to love all kinds of food especially things like prime rib and filet Mignon and rumor has it breakfast food (It's okay I guess but it's not my favorite) Now however the only thing I'm ever hungry for is plain buttered noodles and other equally bland foods. I'm sure Mike is sick of making pasta for me every night, (The athletes diet) especially since I'm only ever able to get a couple of bites. It is really nice of him to go out of his way to boil a new box of past for me every instead of making reheating it from the night before. Another thing that is really suffering is my gag reflexes, I never had a bad gag reflex by any means before but now it's completely over activated. I used to love playing the Oboe, in high school I was the master of the double life, I was both on the cool soccer team and on the totally geeky marching band, I floated between both crowds being a jock/geek hybrid. Unfortunately when I tried to play my Oboe I vomited all over the instrument and I'm pretty sure It's ruined now. Sometimes my gag reflex would just become activated for absolutely no reason whatsoever like when I was working at the hospital the other day (During one of my first days back at work since I got sick that is) here's the thing. I wasn't even doing anything remotely gross, I was just putting the doctors gloves on for him and I vomited everything that I had eaten that day which was a vanilla blizzard from Dairy Queen (Which was basically just soft served vanilla Ice cream in a blizzard cup) and a cherry soda, (Best tasting throw up ever) all over him. He gave me the rest of the day off. \"Do you want to just go to bed?\" Mike asks. \"Yeah I guess\" I say. I am awoken again, not by choking but by some weird kind of sneezing fit or something. Mike turns on the light and sits up in bed next to me. \"You okay?\" He asks me. He helps me out of bed. \"Let's go clean off the throw up\" he says, I don't know what he's talking about until I realize that this weird spray stuff has been coming out of my mouth. I can't even vomit right anymore apparently. I continuing vomiting (or trying to vomit I suppose you might call it) as we make our way towards the bathroom. It tastes terrible like the chinese take out we got. That's right Mike really is sick of making me buttered noodles. I wonder if I might be having an allergic reaction to something, maybe I have suddenly developed a peanut allergy although I'm pretty sure the Kung Pao Pork, Beef and Snow Peas and Mango Chicken didn't have peanuts. I suppose they do almost always use peanut oil in Chinese food though. I can not stop the fit. \"You okay?\" Mike asks. Tears stream down my cheeks as I shake my head. I can feel myself suffocating. My throat becomes so closed that I suffocate and collapse to my knees. \"Brooke Hey\" Mike says shaking me I can feel myself start to foam out of my mouth.\"Are you all right?\" Mike asks for the third time that night. I am unable to answer \"C'mon Brooke\" Mike says right away. \"We're going to the hospital\" He than picks me up, swaddles me in our bed sheets and carries me out to the car, I can not seem to stop throwing up on him, but he doesn't seem to care right now he just cares about getting me to the emergency room \"I'm not really sure how long I have been out but the next thing I know the doctor a doctor is shining a light down my throat. \"Well this is quite unusual\" The doctor says putting on his glasses. \"What is?\" Mike asks, \"It looks like her tonsils have completely blocked off her airway. \"What wait! How could that be?\" Mike asks, \"She just had her tonsils out a month ago which was already weird enough in of it's self since she had her tonsils removed when she was a little girl\" I throw up all over the doctor well the way someone with over grown tonsils would that is. That has got to be a record that is the second time I've thrown up on a doctor. \"Is she going to have to have a tonsilectomy?\" \"Of course\" The doctor says. It frightens me to think that I'm probably going to need a tonsilectomy every single month. It's probably going to be that every time my tonsils grow back in they're going to be enlarged a bit. Very rarely patients come in who have regrown their tonsils due to having special abilities where they can regenerate similar to how some species of lizards are able to regrow their limbs if cut off. On paper it sounds like it would be really cool, but if it means things like needing a tonsilectomy every month then it's really not so awesome. Thankfully I'm pretty sure that I don't have the power of regeneration, if I had that my knee would have healed it's self right away and I wouldn't have had to have a complete replacement also I probably would have recovered from the three diseases which I clearly haven't. \"This is just ridiculous\" Mike says, grabbing my hand tightly. Frustration drips from his voice, although I can tell that he is trying very hard not to sound frustrated. \"She just had a tonsilectomy, is she going to need one every month now? Every week? Every day?\" I might have a pretty good idea of what he is thinking. If things continue to go that way, he may be stuck having to put my food through a blender every night, which would be maybe 50 billion steps down from making buttered noodles every night. On the other hand he could go back to making normal stuff like steaks on the grill just as long as my portion goes through the blender everyone's happy. I realize that I am projecting my thoughts on to him and that of course that is not what he is thinking. How silly of me to think so. How stupid of me. \"We may be getting a little bit far ahead or ourselves there son\" The Doctor tells Mike, \"All I can say is she needs to have her tonsils out right now before she suffocates to desk. A nurse hooks me up to some morphine and wheels me down to the opporrating room. Now Mike is crying. Really crying as in snot is running down his nose crying. \"By the time I wake up I am in some strange room which I figure must be the recovory room. My throat hurts tramendously, like even worse then it did when I had my tonsils in, tonsils are supposed to protect people from getting really bad sore throats and without them, sore throats are about 50 billion times more miserable, the feeling is very similar to the consistancy of raw hamburger, prickly raw hamburger that is, it also feels like I have a whole colony of bumble bee stingers only the stingers that is. I suppose that is a terrible analogy. After all the stingers wouldn't be able to work without being attached to the bees, after all once the bees are dead the stingers have no use. I should know that. It is after all basic biology. I feel stupid for letting myself think such a stupid thought, but I suppose I was given a heavy dose of morphine and anethesia, which I assume has warn off by now and that is why I am in so much pain. It hurts so much I cry. The nurse let's herself in shortly. She is carrying a big jar \"What's that?\" I ask, my voice of course coming out raspy and throaty, \"These are your tonsils\" She says nervously. I can't imagine why she is showing me my tonsils, let alone why she has kept my tonsils in the first place. \"Why are you showing me my tonsils?\" I ask, \"Well\" she says \"Take a look, It's very unusual you will find\" I take one look and find that yes it is very unusual, I have never seen tonsils that enlarged, much less from my own body, It appears that they must have at least gone as far as my esophogas \"How are you feeling Are you all right?\" The nurse asks, \"Yeah Why?\" I ask, \"Just that was quite the procedure\" She says \"My throat hurts\" I moan \"Can I have some ice cream or morphine\" The nurse giggles a tiny bit, \"Sure we could get you some ice cream\" She says, \"But I'm afraid we can't give you Morphine because we're going to want you fully awake when the doctor runs some tests, \"Test what kinds of tests?\" \"He's going to ask you some questions about your medical history and maybe run some biopsy's spinal taps and other stuff. I shutter. \"You okay?\" The nurse asks. \"I'm just cold\" I lie. I am cold that much is true but I am not just cold I am also scared to death. \"Would you like a blanket?\" She asks. \"Sure\" I say absently. \"I'll be back shortly, would you like chocolate or vanilla?\" She asks. \"Huh?\" I ask, because I really had no idea that blankets came in flavors. \"You said you wanted ice cream\" She said. \"Chocolate or vanilla?\" \"I don't really care\" I say, \"Whichever\" \"All righty\" she says. I really don't want any ice cream at all when I asked for Ice cream or morphine the thing I wanted was well morphine. The nurse returns with a paisley blanket that already looks like it's going to be super itchy for my already super sensitive skin. As pathetic as it may sound, I am probably already developing a rash just from looking at the thing. As for the ice cream she has ended up chosing a chocolate and vanilla duo cup. \"Thanks\" I say unenthusiastically. I expect the ice cream to at least sooth my excruciating sore throat a little but instead it does just the opposite, instead of having a nice smooth texture that you would expect ice cream to have it is rough and grainy causing me to cough fitfully. \"Good heavens, you okay?\" The nurse asks. I set the ice cream cup on my bed post. \"This ice cream hurts my throat\" I say and she must think I'm really idiosyncratic and weird. \"What do you mean sweetie?\" She asks, I really feel like she is laughing at me. \"It's so grainy\" I complain. \"Hospital ice cream\" She says apologetically, \"You'll get used to it after a while, \"It's known for being kind of bad quality, would you like something else for your pain?\" \"Morphine\" I moan miserably. The nurse gives me a generous squeeze of the hand, \"You're going to wait until after the doctor does your tests\" She says, \"In the mean time I could give you an IB Profin would that work okay for now\" \"Don't you have anything stronger like Vicoden?\" \"Sorry sweetie\" the nurse apologizes, she is a little too touchy feely for my liking I find. \"But Vicoden's a very powerful drug and when it kicks in you're not going to be able to give the doctor fully accurate answers.\" I have taken Vicoden before for my knee and I don't remember it causing any fun trippy effects it just caused me to be angry, constipated and not hungry, oxycontin didn't cause any fun or trippy effects either though it basically caused the same terrible effects as Vicoden but well worse, plus some other terrible effects like crippling anxiety. Morphine on the other hand. Morphine is fun. If anything that works too well for me. I was prescribed Morphine pills for my injury in addition to the Oxy and Vicoden, I would take them during the afternoon and would sleep all day, as it was my only escape from the terrible real world. The morphine pills ran out almost as fast as they were prescribed so basically on top of everything else I also had a drug problem. Now that made two of us in the family, but when Adam did drugs he was out doing them with his stripper friends at night, not in his dorm room alone in the middle of the afternoon. \"Vicoden doesn't effect me the way it effects most people\" I say folding my arms across my chest. \"I'm sorry\" The nurse says, \"But you're going to have to deal with just an IB profin for now\" \"Fine\" I say as she hands me the red pills and a cup of cold water. \"Atta girl\" She says patting my back. \"The doctor will be with you shortly\" By shortly I guess she means a couple of hours or at least that's what it feels like, I am all alone scared, cold and miserable. The tylonal or IB profin or whatever the nurse has given me hasn't worked at all. My throat continues to burn and I wonder if it is at all possible to miss your tonsils. It must be. Because I miss mine. /span/p The doctor let's himself in. It turns out to be none other then Dr. Paul McCarthy, not to be confused with Paul McCartney the former Beatle. Paul and I go way back. We have been working together since I had my part time job as a filing clerk during the summer before my Freshman year at College, and had continued working their the next couple of summers and later started to go steady with him. So as you can imagine this is incredibly awkward. I have also shadowed him a couple of times with my first year intern group which doesn't really help the awkward factor too much. \"Hello Brooke\" He says holding out his hand. I shake it woodenly. \"I'm sorry I have to see you under such bad situations\" He says. I shrug. \"So I got some of your medical records but I'm also going to want to talk to you about some stuff\" \"K\" I say which is more of a letter of the alphabet then a sentence but whatever. \"According to this document, you were hospitalized in June with double pneumonia, tonsilitis and mono\" \"right\" I say staring down at the ground. \"This one here says that you had a complete knee replacement in 2030, and of course we know now that you had an emergence tonsilectomy for unusual tonsil growth.\" He sets down the documents. \"Other then that? We've got nothing. I was hoping you could give me some additional information if you could\" I guess the reason their is nothing documented about my seizure disorder is because I never ended up telling any doctors about it, I'm sure the student health doctor wasn't in any way shape or form willing to write any me any medical evaluations, he probably just saw me as a whiney histrionic annoyance. \"There's more about 2007\" I say. \"That was the year you started college yes?\" He asks, \"You were so excited to start Freshman year that summer\" \"Yeah too bad it had to suck so much\" I say. He puts down his glasses and starts jotting down a new set of notes. \"Tell me a little bit about Freshman year, I know about the knee injury already, according to the document you were playing a pretty brutal game\" \"No\" I say shaking my head. \"No what?\" He asks, \"It wasn't a brutal game at all. I probably lied. I mean I definitely lied. It was during practice, we hadn't even started playing yet I blew my knee out putting on my shin gaurds. I can feel my cheeks flush with embarrassment. \"I'm sure you can see why I'd make up a story to make it seem less embarrassing right?\" I ask. \"Yes I could see that\" He says. \"I think we're getting somewhere.\" \"I was just a mess Freshman year of College\" I say, \"A bunch of loose idea's tied into one huge rubber band ball of mess.\" I feel myself blushing again. \"I'm sorry\" I say, \"I'm second year resident I shouldn't be using such idiotic speak\" Paul lets out a kind of sad chuckle. \"No it's all right\" He says, \"Quite poetic\" \"I had seizures\" I blurt out. \"Seizures eh?\" He asks. \"Yes but not like the typical epileptic kinds more like\" \"Petite Mal Seizures?\" Paul guesses. \"Well some of them I wouldn't say were really seizures at all, like sometime's I would just altogether freeze in place, \"Like cataplexy\" Paul says, \"Right\" I say, \"Other times I would have lip smacking moments I don't think those were really seizures either because I was well aware of them. But then their were the third kind which were actual seizures where I would just space out and completely forget where I was or what I was talking about. I was dubbed the dumb blonde for those attacks by my classmates, \"Well that's not very nice or fair of your classmates now is it?\" Paul asks. \"Of course it's fair\" I say shrugging, \"They didn't know\" \"Were you on any anti seizure meds?\" He asks. \"Brooke?\" He asks when I don't answer him right away, \"Are you all right Brooke?\" \"I'm thinking?\" I say. \"Are you sure?\" He asked, \"Because it looked to me like you were having one of your seizures you were talking about.\" Was I? I had been seizure free for 10 years now. \"Um no I don't think so\" I say, \"After Freshman year of College I never had seizures again\" Paul continues to jot down notes. \"So you're okay?\" He asks. \"What?\" \"So you didn't have a seizure just now you don't think?\" He asks, \"I don't think so no\" I answer. \"All righty\" He says. \"Were you on any new or different medications that year that may have caused the seizures, \"just prozac which I'd taken since 6th grade\" I say, \"I've basically been battling depression since puberty\" He jots down notes I assume it is something about my history with depression and prozac. \"My depression worsened during freshman year\" I tell him. \"All right Brooke\" He says, \"Now that we've got this part over with let's get going with the physical part you ready Brooke?\" \"Ready as I'll ever be I guess\" I say, \"What are you going to do?\" \"Full body scan\" He says, \"Come with me\" He helps me into a wheelchair and wheels me up to the lab. He asks me to take off my cloths and dress into a robe and then step into the machine. I remember this procedure from when I injured my knee but last time it hadn't been a full body MRI. I shudder. \"Brooke you all right?\" Paul asks, \"Cold\" I moan, \"It's going to take 45 minutes.\" For some reason that seems like centuries. Finally Paul releases me and sends me back into my recovery room. \"The nurse will be in with your results\" He tells me. The nurse shows up much faster than I thought she would, Paul goes over to talk to her. They talk for quite some time. I know that this is not going to be good. The nurse leaves and Paul comes over to my bed stand with the MRI \"Well I've got some good news and some bad news for you Brooke which do you want to hear first\" \"Good\" I say because it is almost guaranteed that 100% of the time people are going to want the good news first and about 99.9% of the time the good news sucks. \"All righty then\" He says, \"The good news is we have a diagnosis\" See what I mean? I suppose it's better to have a diagnosis then to go your whole life not being able to put a name to what's wrong with you. You know what? Bullshit! It's just as terrifying and sucks just as much having something with a name tagged to it. \"What kind of diagnosis\" \"Well\" Paul says, \"Based on the pea shaped nodules on your connective tissue, the double jointedness and Chiari malfunction of your brain and Spinal Cord, I believe you have a condition called Ehlers Danlo's Syndrome. So that's what it s called and yes it does suck as much as having an un named disease. Just thinking about the pea shaped nodules on my connective tissue makes me feel like gagging. Peas just make me gag in general. I remember sitting at the table when I was a little kid crying and gagging while my mom forced me to eat my peas before leaving the table. But now having something like that in my body? And that disease is already just about as gag inducing as you can possibly \"B'Bucket\" I moan. Paul hands me a bucket while I throw up the chocolate and vanilla ice cream cup. \"You all right?\" Paul asks. \"What's the bad news then?\" I ask. Paul sighs heavily. \"The bad news is, your tonsils grew back in\" \"What already?\" I ask, \"You must be joking\" \"No\" Paul says, \"No joke, we're going to do another tonsilectomy. We'll get you some morphine and get you going\" I am once again wheeled back into the opporating room. Mike quickly gets the news and rushes in to see me. \"Are you all right?\" He asks me. I am hooked up to morphine so I am already feeling a little loopy. \"Ehler Danlos Syndrome I has it\" I say. \"I know\" Mike says. \"That's what Paul said.\" \"Can I have my phone?\" I ask I am not sure how I managed not to mess up that sentence. \"Of course\" Mike says[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: Adam It is the First Semester of the First day of school, but the last period of class, as a matter a fact I am down to the last 30 minutes of class. I teach a class on Music and Lyrics at Tampa Beach Alternative School a school for kids who are at risk. Kids who are like how I used to be in High school, only I went to the public school. This semester they have scheduled me for 3rd period and 8th period. So I know what you're probably all thinking. It's kind of an obscure class, I hate to admit it but it would never make it at the public high school, but it has always been something I've been interested in and it's a great way for kids to get a music education course in without having to play an instrument. The music we study in the class ranges from the late 50's to todays current hits. Today after having the kids listen to music and and do some group Icebreakers I have asked them to write little introduction essays about themselves and about what their favorite songs are and what they mean to them. \"All right\" I say, looking up at the clock \"The bell is about to go off for today, so let's finish up our essays and hand them forward\" I am amazed by this group of kids they are so good and well behaved compared to my lazy third period kids who were quite the challenge, this group just seems so polite and amiable I wish I could be with them all day but what can you do? \"Is this everybody?\" I ask as soon as all the papers are passed forward onto my desk \"Well no\" William Johnston a real wholesome looking kid with dirty blonde hair and a checkered shirt says apathetically, he was quite an entertaining guy when he introduced himself during the ice breaker, \"Do you have it?\" I ask. \"Nope\" The kid says apathetically, \"Why Not?\" I ask I find my tone growing a bit sharp. Just then the bell rings all the kids including William line up for the door. \"William\" I say sharply. \"See me\" William walks up to my desk. \"Why not?\" I ask firmly. \"I just don't like doing homework\" William says looking very earger to go. \"Look William\" I say, \"This was not a homework assignment, you were supposed to do it IN CLASS and I think it's a pretty bone headed move on your part to just go to a class and not do the work got it?\" \"I guess I could do it for homework\" He says, \"But I never do homework so probably not\" There is just no getting through to this kid. He is not a bad kid or anything, he is really interesting and would probably have a lot to say if he sat down and did his homework once in a while. \"Look I'm sorry I called you a bonehead\" I say, \"That wasn't a very nice thing of me to say and on top of that it was very unprofessional but you do know that part of going to this class is doing the work don't you?\" William shrugs his shoulders. \"You sighed up for this class didn't you?\" I ask. \"Well yeah\" He says, \"Well If you're not going to meet the expectations then maybe you should drop the class\" \"Yeah maybe\" He says. I really don't know how with this kid but right now I realize I'm going to have to put that problem on hold for a while because my phone is beeping out of control. It's been beeping during class, but I know I'm not supposed to answer it. I see that I have gotten a new message. \"I got to take this\" I say heading out into the hall. The message is from my sister Brooke. It is very incoherent but it sounds like she is most definintly crying. Usually I am the one who is crying over the phone not only that but I am also the one who is leaving the incoherent messages. Yes that happens quite often (The crying not the incoherence at least not so much anymore) like whenever my girlfriend Bernadette and I break up or when a kid is mean to me or when a parent is mean to me and also quite a lot during my days as a stripper. I was the one who needed her but now it seems like the tables have been turned and now she needs me. I instantly punch in her number. \"Hello\" Brooke says her voice sounding teary, \"Brooke it's Adam you sent me a very weird message Are you okay?\" Brooke then sobs uncontrollably like I have done so many times. \"Brooke? What's wrong?\" I ask. \"I'm sick Adam\" She says, \"I have Ehler Danlo's Syndrome\" I briefly know what that is because our dad's older sister our Aunt Beverly has a very mild case of that, it is however her least favorite thing ever to talk about. \"Brooke that's terrible\" I say. \"Listen if you want to crash with me and Bernadette for a few days then you can would you like that?\" \"Sure\" She says, \"Can Mike come too?\" She asks. \"Yeah sure\" I say. \"You guys can stay as long as you need to\" It suddenly occurs to me at the age of 27 I am finally about to become a big brother to my 29 year old sister. I don't know how to be a big brother because I never had to be one. Brooke has always been my rock, as a matter a fact I really don't think I would be where I am today without her in fact. She had after all actively helped me apply for colleges and reconstruct my life. Now it is time for me to give back to her. \"We'll have the house ready for you and Mike by 12:00 tomorrow\" I find myself saying, I hear and see myself say the words but they feel very foreign coming off my tongue somehow. It then occurs to me that I had just invited \"Brike\" to stay with us for who knows how long without even confirming it with Bernadette. I mean who does that. Just inviting people to move in with you is kind of really drastic. Not that I could see her being completely uncool with it or anything because I think she'd totally be cool with it, after all just a couple weeks ago we had her Identical twin sister Vallarie who is Epileptic and has been since puberty live with us. Vallarie is one of those people who is really into the whole live life to the fullest thing which got really annoying after a week. As much as I love Bernadette's sister, she just has WAY too much of a presense about her and that whole rule about fish and visitors definitely started to apply with her after day 1. Vallerie and her neurologist had been working on an experiment together in which she was supposed to try to trigger one of her seizures in order to find the underlying cause and hopefully a cure. You see the only thing that's stopping her from YOLOing are her crippling seizure's otherwise she'd probably be sky diving rocky mountain climbing and all that wild stuff every single day instead of just once a month. The fact that she was trying to trigger a seizure meant that she could get as baked as she wanted. According to Doctors orders apparently. Also according to Doctors orders we were supposed to go to strip clubs, concerts, raves go to lazer shows and play endless games of lazer tag. Also during all of this she was supposed to be off her medications It didn't worked none of it worked. and it just ended up in a very tearful night of events. It's very odd that she didn't have a seizure, but I guess the human brain is just a whole lot more complicated then a lot of us think it is. That would however be more Brooke's area of expertice then mine. Vallarie broke down sobbing about her innability to have a seizure, which actually did make sense given the situation, it must have been god damn frustrating and then Bernadette broke down because Vallarie was putting her life in danger and was killing herself. Bernadette is a real human hose pipe when it come's to her twin sister. Just mention the name Vallarie and there go the water works. I suppose as for family they are really all each other have. They live with their maternal grandma who is somewhere in her 90's but still alive, well and kicking, which is more then I can say I have going for me, both my sets of grandparents are dead. Bernadette is not so fortunate in terms of parents however in her own words \"Hell if I know?\" It may sound bitchy of her and like she really doesn't care. But I suppose if she doesn't know, she doesn't know. It really can't be helped. I'm sure deep down she really does want to know about her parents, but she loves putting on the tough girl facade. Vallarie knows just as much about their parents as Bernadette which is also absolutely nothing. Luckily Bernadette works in the same building I do teaching a class in Women's studies. Bernadette and I met in undergrad college Freshman year at the University of Miami, that is my second Freshman year I gave the whole college thing a try when I was 18 but it didn't work out and I was stuck fixing roofs which lead to stripping. But once I was in College my life really started turning around and Bernadette was a huge part of it. There were three things that instantly struck me about her. 1. Bernadette was one of my favorite songs by the African American 60's Band the Four Tops 2. There was just something super sexy about that birth mark (Mole/pimple/wart) on her forehead it kind of made her look exotic like maybe she had a little bit of Indian in her, even though her features were clearly Aryan. 3. She strikingly resembled the most current rendition of Wonder Woman. what's not to love? So I very awkwardly asked her out on a date one day. \"Doyoulikefood?\" I had asked. \"Huh?\" She asked. \"I Said do you like food?\" I said again. \"Do I like food?\" She asked. \"Yeah food's good\" I cleared my throat. \"Do you like food with me?\" I had asked. \"Do I like food with you?\" She asked her eyes glistening with amusement. Damit. Eventually she seemed like she got it, \"I did not go to college to date\" She had said \"I went to college to get a degree\" \"Oh okay\" I had said and that was that. From that day forward we didn't really say much to each other but I watched her, I know that sounds creepy as fuck well maybe it is a bit. And every day I wanted her even more, however the more I wanted her the more I realized I couldn't have her. She played hard to get. Not just hard to get. Impossible to get. She had no time for boys, all she cared about was the books. So It was a huge surprise that day, maybe at the very end of the first semester when we just happened to run into each other after class. \"I do like to eat food\" She had said. I blushed furiously. Only a beautiful girl like her could turn an such an awkward thing to say like that into something classy. \"What?\" I had asked. \"I have some free time on my hands\" She said \"Why don't we go to Soho Sushi tonight\" She suggested. \"As a date?\" I asked. \"Don't push it\" She said. \"6:00. You be there\" From that day forward things just clicked with us. We have been living together for roughly 7 years now. Not that things haven't been rocky because things sure have been. As I have said there have been break ups, we are so off and on it's just crazy. Luckily we are together now because I really feel like I need her. She is at a meeting right now, which is really unfortunate because I really need to talk to her now and I know all too well that calling her during the middle of a meeting is absolutely not an option right now. Not that she'd answer, It being the first day of school and everything, I'm sure their is a lot to say at the meeting. I helplessly slump my back against the wall and slowly slide down to the floor letting tears spill down my cheeks, before I know what's happening I am sobbing like an idiot. It totally slips my mind when Bernadette get's out from her meeting and stands directly in front of me. She just has a very obvious presence about her. I can always tell when she's there without even having to look up. \"Adam are you okay?\" She asks. I wipe my tears. \"Sweetie what happened? Did you have a bad first day oh man that sucks\" I shake my head. \"Sweetie what's wrong?\" She asks. I take her by the hand and lead her outside, I have a feeling this is way too emotional of a situation for both of us. \"Adam?\" She asks. \"What is it?\" \"It's Brooke\" I finally say as I lean against a tree and wipe my eyes. \"Oh my god\" Bernadette says, \"What about her is she okay?\" \"No\" I say, \"No she's not, she's very sick and I.\" My mouth starts moving but I can't get any words out, \"I said she could stay with us, I know we just had your sister stay with us during her freak out experiment and I know it seems like we just cleaned out the house for our last guest\" \"Adam\" Bernadette says placing her hand on my shoulder. \"Hey chill.\" I take a deep breath, \"What's wrong with Brooke?\" She asks me. \"She has Elher Danlo's Syndrome\" \"Oh my god what's that?\" Bernedette asks in a hushed voice. \"I don't really know much about it, I have an Aunt who has it but she never talks about it, trying to talk about it with her is like saying Voldemort.\" I can't believe I am making such an out dated reference \"Huh?\" Bernadette asks, \"Harry Potter Reference\" I say. Bernadette rolls her eyes, \"Never read it. Never want to\" She says.\" \"Okay\" I say, \"My point is I don't know much about it\" \"Well you know\" Bernadette says, \"If it's something really serious I'm happy to have her stay on our couch for however long she needs to and it's more then a week then that's fine, we have a guest room and can set a table for three\" \"That's the other thing\" I say. \"I invited Mike as well\" \"Oh\" Bernadette says she doesn't sound super enthusiastic. \"Does he have to stay\" \"Look they're kind of a thing now, they're Brike now?\" \"Brike?\" She asks sounding all confused, \"That sounds so stupid\" \"Why do you have to be like this?\" I ask, \"I wasn't like this when you let YOUR family stay\" Bernadette folds her arms across her chest. \"Mike is not your family now is he?\" She says. \"Why are you so prejudice against Mike?\" I ask, \"Is it because he is a person with issues is that it?\" That is Bernadette's coined term for stripper. \"Because you know what your dating someone who used to be a person with issues\" \"Yeah but your different now\" She says, \"Now you're a person with an education and a real job\" She says, \"Yeah\" I Say but do you have any idea how long it took me to get their?\" \"A lot of places wouldn't take me because of my stripper background and on a lot of applications I had to lie and omit stuff and that didn't feel so good.\" It's true that it took me long and hard to get where I am today the whole reason why I ended up getting the job at the Alternative school was because Bernadette knew some people on the school board and they all worked really hard to pull some strings. I love Bernadette to death for that. I'm pretty sure Brooke pulled some strings for me there too. I totally more then owe her for everything. I realize that I have got to stop thinking of our relationship in terms of I owe her. She's my sister. I should be taking care of her and letting her stay with me based on unconditional love not because I feel obligated, but now it's hard when Bernadette won't agree to play a full part in all of it. \"What about your sister?\" I ask. \"What about her?\" She asks, \"She's a person with issues\" It is true Vallarie is most definitely a stripper. \"That's different,\" She says, \"Different how?\" I ask \"She is a person with issues, she has Epilepsy, she's not capable of having a regular job. and I can forgive you because you were just a kid, you didn't have an education yet. But Mike? What's Mike's excuse exactly. I mean Mike is a completely capable human being he's 40 years old for god's sake. I'm sorry.\" She says. \"But it's okay with your sister Vallarie because she has Epilepsy?\" I ask because I am really not understanding this arbitrary statement of hers. \"I mean people take advantage of her and you really think that's okay?\" \"Of course that's not okay. It's sick and you know who take advantage of her are people like Mike, people who run the buisness, I'm sorry I don't see why it's necessary for him to stay with us. \"Because\" I say firmly, \"They've been together for almost as long as we have and he obviously really cares about her and he obviously really want's to be with her when she's sick.\" Bernadette scowls hard. \"All right\" She finally says, \"So when did you say they would start moving in?\" \"Tomorrow at 12\" \"Damnit\" She says, \"I'm sorry Adam. It's just we really don't have a lot of time.\" \"We can make time\" I say, \"Bernadette stares at her watch. \"5:00\" She says, \"We'll order Chinese takeout\" I suggest. \"Perfect\" Bernadette says.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: Bernadette: I don't feel like talking. God damnit do I ever not feel like talking right now. What even is there to say I feel like Adam has down right tricked me into this deal of his like one of them dirty sales men selling cars or like someone making one of those Faustian deals from the old german legend Faust. I realize I am being melodramatic having Mike Lane stay with us isn't exactly the same thing as giving your life up to the devil, but it was quite sneeky and kind of mallicious of Adam. I had agreed with open arms to have Brooke stay as long as she needed to. Then after all that, Adam had to spring it on me that Mike was also part of the deal. If I recall the last time I saw Brooke, she and Mike were taking a break, I was pretty sure she was over him, but apparently not anymore apparently they are back together and really love each other and are Brike. I will never get used to how hideous that word sounds to me. Not that Adette sounds much better. Sounds like that loser princess from the Swan Princess, who I sure as hell don't like to associate myself with, she was such a loser and a bitch and such a wanna be Disney Princess. Oh well I guess there's really not much you can do with a name like Bernadette. I'll just come out and say it. Bernadette is yucky, no matter what you do with the name it will always be yucky. Unfortunately no nickname could possibly fix the Bernadette situation. Bernie or Bern sound just like nails on a chalk board for a girl, always makes me think of a big fat drooling St. Bernard or Bernise Mt. Dog and 99.9% it is that of the male gender that it makes me think of. But there is actually a nickname I hate even more then Bern or Bernie believe it or not and that is Detty. Hideous right? Adam called me that on our first date after maybe a few too many drinks. I shot him a look. And if looks could kill he'd be lying dead on the floor. No Bernadette is yucky. But compared to the alternatives it's fine thank you very much. My sister Vallarie got stuck with the good name. Not that that's that great of a name either but at least it's not yucky and at least she has nick names that aren't totally gag worthy Val Vallie (Works because she's a total Valley girl) My Grandma says my parents named my sister Vallarie and I after oldies before they died, or got swept to sea, or got abducted by aliens or just disappeared into molecular atoms or somehow escaped to a different dimension or whatever. I might sound like a completely insensitive bitch for not missing my parents or for joking about their mysterious disappearance, but to my defense. It's kind of hard to miss the parents that were never there? Who knows maybe we never had them, maybe we just sprouted from the ground one day. Besides talking about how my parents named us after oldies Grandma hardly ever talks about my parents, she doesn't keep pictures of them. Hell I'm not even sure who's parent she is. Maybe the case is we've never actually had parents at all, maybe some single woman just really wanted twins so got invetero treatments, not that I really want to think about that because ewe. But you never know with this day and age She's just Grandma Ruth. She is probably the hippest granny I've ever met. She likes to pretend that she is in our generation which is kind of creepy, she is up to date with all of today's technology, maybe even more up to date then some people in this generation and like Vallarie she is also into Yolo. She is 92 but she looks like she could be about in her 50's she's had so many plastic surgeries. She dyes her hair the same blonde as Vallarie and goes around telling people she is our mother. She is so hot (Gross) that she could have any guy she wants yet she is a radical feminist and insists that having a boyfriend just ties you up. I used to be just like that until I met Adam. Not Vallarie, she's had a boyfriend since 7th grade, it is just impossible to keep track. I'm pretty sure her current boyfriend is named Dallas though, he is another one of them people with problems who has connections to Adam (Small world aint it) Grandma and Vallarie are both super into the whole friends thing. Me not so much. I never had friends and I was fine with that. While Vallarie spent weekends going to the mall or going to the movies, I stayed at home in my room typing away disturbing stuff at my computer. My Grandma and Vallarie both insisted I get more sunlight and said someday I'll be sorry. I guess maybe someday, right now I don't really regret anything but whatever. \"You know\" Adam says, \"You're acting like they're moving in with us. You know they're not don't you? You do know this is only temporary\" \"That's what you say now\" I say, \"But a weeks going to turn into a two weeks, and two weeks is going to turn into three weeks and so on and so forth\" \"Look could you please not be like this. Please do this for me. Please?\" \"Okay\" I say grudgingly. I hate to speak ill of the ill (So to speak) but although I have met Adam's sister many of time's Brooke is a great big question mark to me. She has never been someone I have been able to get a read on. I have dated Adam for seven years and she's been present for holidays and we have gone of dates but I still was never able to get a read on what her personality is or if she even has a personality at all. She is Adam's sister and I've had plenty of chances to get to know her so I feel like I should know her better, but It feels like I am about to house a complete stranger for a week or longer then a week I'm almost sure. \"All right, I guess I'll reset up the guest room\" It never occured to me that we were going to have to make up the guest bed again. For two people none the less. One I can't stand and one I don't know the first thing about. Sometimes I really wish I was a nicer person. I know it sounds passive and like I'm not doing much to try to work on my bitchiness, but sometimes I just would love ask look at myself in a full view mirror and say \"what the fuck is your problem\" Why am I being such a bitch to Adam if anyone should know about having a sick sister it's me, so why the hell can't I be more sympathetic to Adam. Vallerie has been Epileptic since we were 12 years old and I remember I had gone through a lot of grief. I would spend hours on end in my room and I cried a great deal. I'm sure Vallerie did too but she didn't show, she just kind of got more annoying with the whole YOLO thing. Adam had always been so understanding. There was no argument about having Vallerie crash with us. Adam's just too nice of a guy, It's amazing how long we've stayed together. It suddenly occurs to me that I am crying. Thinking about Vallerie just always does that to me it always get's me teary, I think a part of me has never really stopped grieving about it. but it's not just that. I feel like Adam is too good for me, and it is just that time of month if you know what I mean. But who am I to be grieving about Vallerie who has had Epilepsy since she is 12, when Adam is the one who should be grieving. Brooke was just diagnosed with Elher's Danlo's Syndrome. How could I be so selfish. How dare I make this about me? Once I am done with the guest room I rush out into the kitchen where Adam is cleaning up. \"Here\" I say tearfully let me help with that. I say grabbing the sponge. \"Detty?\" He asks. \"Are you okay?\" I manage to laugh through my tears. I am such a mess right now. \"You know how much I hate to be called Detty\" I say and burst into unconsollible tears. \"I'm sorry Adam. I'm sorry I was such a hormonal bitch. I would be happy to let your sister and even Mike stay for as long as they like\" \"It's all right\" Adam says stroking my back. \"We'll give it a week\" \"Adam\" I say tearfully \"They can stay as long as you need them too.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 Mike: There is a really long wait. I feel like I have been in the waiting room for about an eternity. I stare down at my watch it appears reads 11:01 AM, 11:01 seriously? Literally the last time I checked my watch it read 11:00, has really only a minute gone by. Well I know technically a whole night has gone by, because I had spent the first half sobbing unconsollibly for literally hours on end I'm really not sure because I really wasn't really keeping track but I'm sure it was more then a couple of hours, the rest of the night was spent in a sleepless zombie like stuper. I did get maybe a couple hours of sleep but they were dreamless. A doctor approaches me in what seems like hours but is probably just seconds. See what lack of sleep does to you? \"Are you Mike?\" A Doctor asks me. \"I am\" I say, I'm surprised he doesn't recognize me, most people imediatly know who I am, I'm kind of well known in the city of Tampa for the whole Magic Mike thing and all but I suppose he just doesn't recognize me out of context, sadly a lot of people don't \"I'm Paul McCarthy, your girlfriend Brooke and I we go way back\" What are the chances of that? Brooke's doctor is the man she used to date. That really doesn't help things. Not in the slightest. He hands me a box of tissues. \"What I am about to tell you is going to be pretty emotional\" I am all cried out, I feel like I have no tears left to cry. I feel like I have cried all my tears out dry in this waiting room. \"Is she okay?\" I ask, \"I'm afraid not. \"First things first, her tonsils have grown back?\" \"WHAT?\" I shriek. Paul lowers his hand signaling for me to lower my voice. \"I understand that you are upset and shocked, but it is hospital policies that you keep your voice down, you understand. I'm sorry. I guess I was wrong about the whole tears running dry thing because I definintly am at it again. Tears of frustration that is \"How could they have grown back? She just had a tonsilectomy. What the actual fuck man?\" \"She has a condition\" He tells me. \"I printed some stuff out about it for you why don't you read it.\" He hands me a couple of pages he has stapled together at the top of the page is the name of the disease. Ehler Danlo's Syndrome. I have never heard of this disease in my life. But now I realize that I just can't look away from it, I ready page through page like a man possessed. There are 7 different kinds of the disease but the kind Brooke has is Type 1 and 2 Classical the type that effects the most people It can effect everything from the musculoskeletal system to the pulmonary system, the the cardiovascular system to the nervous system. I scroll down and find that it is a hereditary defect which get's me worried about Adam, maybe he should test for it before it's too late. I also find that it is something that is present at birth, so this whole time I've known her she's been sick, but the scary thing is she didn't know until now. Apparently most people don't find out until later life, but their are some tell tale signs that appear in childhood such as double jointedness, flexible skin and tall stature and frequent colds and ear infections. Brooke is freakishly tall, about 5'10 but it has never really been something I thought about, lot's of people are tall. Hell I'm tall actually I'm quite a bit taller then she is and theirs nothing wrong with me, hell Bernadette is also quite a bit taller then Brooke as well and stands at about 5'15 and theirs nothing wrong with her either except that shes a a conecending bitch Also I didn't really think much of the fact that she got a lot of colds, I had thought she just had allergies. although it was unusual that she happened to have Double Pneumonia, Mono and tonsilitis all at the same time. I find out that the neurological problem's are actually a whole seperate other condition of it's own. Something called Arnold Chiari Malformation apparently that was the culprit for the reaccuring tonsil growth. That may also explain her unusually sensitive gag reflex. Poor Brooke throws up at the drop of a hat these days and has been since she was hospitalized. It doesn't take much at all her gag sometimes even the slightest coughing fit can cause her to vomit and when I say sometimes I mean 99.9 percent of the time, I'm really not sure she did make a full recovery from Pneumonia, she had double Pneumonia before but I'm pretty sure now she instead of being all the way better she just has single Pneumonia. Other times she just gags for no reason whatsoever. For that reason she refuses to eat anything other then angel hair pasta with melted butter. She is very specific about what kind of pasta it is, if it is anything any thicker she won't touch it. Another thing she enjoys these days are plain vanilla blizzards from Dairy Queen, any other kind will either make her gag or just irritate her throat. So basically it's just already soft served ice cream put into the blender it is not something that you can even order on the menu, but they make it for her like she is a little princess. She will also drink Shirly Temples once in a while, but only if they are luke warm and not super bubbly. I just got so sick of her princess diet the other night and that was why I ordered the chinese food I know it is not my fault but I suddenly feel all kinds of guilty for ordering Chinese food. I know I am being an idiot. But give me a fucking break, I haven't gotten a wink of sleep, well maybe a little bit of sleep but clearly not enough sleep for me to be thinking rationally. On top of all that I just find out that Brooke has a really complicated disease and if it weren't complicated enough as it already was, if there weren't enough symptoms already it just had to go and get even more complicated, it is not that she has two completely separate diseases or anything like that, it is just that, that those two complications are always, always comorbid with each other, but Chiari Malformation can co exist by itself or with other disorders like Marfan Syndrome. Suddenly I feel my heart pound rapidly against my chest and myself become short of breath. I try to take a deep breath but I just can not for the life of me get enough air. \"Are you all right Mike?\" Paul asks. My face crumples and I disolve into tears. Uncontrollable tears. My whole body is shaking uncontrollably. \"I I need to see her\" I stammer, \"Has she had her surgery yet. I need to be with her\" I get up and start walking aimlessly down the hall. \"She hasn't had her surgery yet\" He says, \"You can see her\" \"thanks\" I say quickly, \"Where is she?\" \"Right this way\" Paul says leading me down the hall and then sharply to the right. She is hooked up to an IV as I rush in. \"Are you all right?\" I cry throwing my arms around her. \"Can I have my phone?\" She asks slurring her words a tiny bit but not too much, \"Looks like the morphine's starting to kick in\" Brooke's nurse says to me. \"You could go ahead and make your phone call before the surgery if you'd like\" She says, I think that. \"Could I have my phone?\" She asks again, this time slurring a little bit more. \"Yeah of course\" I say. \"Adam hi\" She says, she then starts crying and slurring her words like crazy. The Morphine kicks in just like that. I gently take the cell phone from her hand and kiss her gently on the top of the head. I spend another painful night in the waiting room constantly wondering if once their done with her toniselectomy she's going to need a new one soon after, but how soon? Her tonisils could grow in within a matter of years to a matter of seconds after they were removed to actually during the surgery. Poor Brooke. I think to myself and shutter. It is a good thing, a very good thing, a damn god very good thing that they have given her so much Morphine and Anethsisia, otherwise she'd be gagging/vomiting up a storm, plus I'm sure theirs a rule that you're suppose to put a patient under during that kind of surgery so there's also that issue too. So now we are packing up our stuff to drive over to Adam and Bernadette's house. Apparently Brooke had arranged that with Adam during her stay in the recovery room. It kind of sucks that we don't just get to go home, I would love to spend the night in my own bed again instead of an icky guest bed, but on the bright side Brooke does not need another tonsilectomy, I guess maybe the first time was just a fluke, the nurse wheels her out, she still looks a little drugged. \"So her tonsils didn't grow back?\" I sound like such a weirdo freak asking such weirdo questions. \"They did\" The nurse answers me, during the surgery. It's weird that such a random thing that popped into my head could actually be right. \"She basically had two tonsilectomies going at once\" \"Oh my god Are you all right Brooke?\" I ask. She puts her hand to her throat. \"Pain\" She moans. \"We put her on a high dose of Methadone which is a pretty dangerous narcotic and given her history of narcotic abuse we're going to ask you to be responsible for her drugs, she can only take them if you give them to her, that sounds like just a bit too much to ask and I have never noticed Brooke having a narcotics problem, what could he be referring to, I haven't noticed her having any kind of drug habits in fact. \"What are you talking about?\" I find myself asking. \"Didn't you know, she had an addiction to Morphine Pills during her Freshman year in College after she got a complete knee replacement.\" I didn't even know about her complete knee surgery. How could I have been with this person off and on again for so long and know so little about her? \"I Didn't know her Freshman year of College\" I say. \"Well we need to be on the safe side\" He hands me the perscription which reads Mike Lane to give to Brooke Kennedy. That really kind of sucks. It's as if I'm giving pills to a dog or an old person or a little kid or I suppose someone with a really bad drug problem which I suppose is the case. /span/p Adam and Bernedette are waiting at the house when we arrive. To be completely fair we did get to spend a little time at home, packing our stuff that is. \"Hey\" Bernadette says, \"Did you guys have any trouble finding the place?\" \"No not at all\" I say. Bernadette just rolls her eyes. It is clear that she doesn't like me. According to her I am a person with issues. Scratch that, I am not just a person with issues I am the creator/enabler of all other people with issues. She does however give full attention to Brooke. It always seemed to me like she has a little bit of a girl crush on Brooke, which really must be awkward for Adam hell it's going to be awkward for all of us, hell this whole thing is going to just be awkward as shit but I guess it's only going to be a week or so. \"How are you feeling?\" She asks Brooke \"Tired I guess, and my throat hurts\" \"She did just have three tonsilectomies\" I say once again Bernadette steamrolls over me and gives all the attention to Brooke. \"Holy shit. You all right?\" She asks. Brooke shakes her head. \"No I bet not\" Bernadette says, \"Would you like a popsicle?\" She asks this question with a bit too much enthusiasm and in that annoying babying voice which is really annoying because she shouldn't forget that just because she towers over Brooke doesn't mean she's older. Because Adam started College when he was 21 she has always been two years younger \"Oh yes\" Says Adam, \"We love Popsicles in this house\" \"Yes we do\" Bernadette agrees. We head into their kitchen. They really weren't exhaggerating. There whole fridge is filled with frozen treats and other stuff of course like TV dinners and other stuff. \"Here you are Brooke\" She pulls out an amazing looking see through star shaped popsicle filled with edible glitter it is so sparkly and shiny it is over whelming. It is very remminicent of one of those wonder wands from the 1980's which have made a great comeback and are often times something we use in our stripper shows. I guess now they have become so popular that they have been made into popsicle form. \"C'can I have one too\" I ask a bit hypnotically. Bernadette sighs heavily as if it is so much trouble. \"Here\" She says catch. She then throws me an orange Mr Freeze Pop. Just plain orange. She is acting like such a preschooler. \"Bernadette\" Adam says warningly, \"You promised remember\" \"It was the only one left\" She says, and shrugs it off. They have a million other better popsicle's in their freezer and what about that I got the worst of the worst. I remember really hating Mr. Freeze pops when I was a kid because they always lost their flavor right away. In the end you were just sucking on an icicle. A slushy Icicle that got frozen over. So basically a snow cone. Something I also hate and I don't think anyone actually likes. For some reason Orange was always the most offensive of the flavors, I think it might have been the quickest to lose it's flavor Why would they even have Mr Freeze Pops when they have all those other awesome futuristic popsicles from this day and age. I guess Mr Freeze pops just became popular again because they are such an apparently awesome throw back to the 90's. Or maybe Bernadette just bought one for that prank. Maybe she planned it all along because maybe she thinks were still in 2nd grade. She's always seemed Borderline well Borderline to me. When she tosses it to me (More like tossing it at me then anything) She misses and it falls to the ground. \"Oops\" She says. \"My bad\" \"Bernadette\" Adam says again. \"You can pick that up\" She says to me, \"You're not the one who's helpless\" She's still not even trying. As a matter a fact I think she may be trying even less then she was a couple of seconds ago. \"What are we in 2nd grade?\" I ask. Bernadette folds her arms across her chest and gives off that air of coolness. Her look screams \"Your cooler then me\" Obviously. \"I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about\" She says blowing her bangs away from her face in that ultra cooler than me manner. \"This acting like you're better then me\" I say. \"Like your cooler then me\" I also can't stand the way she implied that Brooke is helpless, although it is kind of true that Brooke has kind of been enjoying playing the roll of helpless these days and it probably doesn't offend her at all so maybe part of the reason why I am so offended by her statement is because it is just so true and all that stuff about the truth hurting and stuff. Brooke saves Bernadette and I from continuing our awkward conversation by having a massive coughing fit. \"Brooke you okay?\" Adam asks pounding her on the back. Tears stream down her cheeks. \"The sparkles hurt my throat\" She cries. \"The glitter?\" Bernadette asks. \"I'm sorry\" She says. \"Yeah you should be\" I suddenly find myself snapping. \"How dare it never occur to you that the sparkles might hurt her throat?\" Bernadette raises an eyebrow at me as if I had just said something really stupid even though she was quite forgiving when Brooke had said it. \"I'm tired\" Brooke says, \"Can I take a nap\" \"Of Course\" Bernadette says with her over friendly attitude of course. \"Adam will you show her the guest room\" \"Yeah sure?\" He says, \"Are two going to be okay alone together?\" He asks. \"We Can handle it\" Bernadette says, \"After all we are adults\" \"Are we really?\" I ask. \"Well at least one of us is\" Bernadette says. \"Don't kill each other\" Adam says as he takes Brooke by the arm and leads her down the hall. Now Bernadette and I are as a matter a fact the only two in the room. We are on opposite ends of the kitchen with our arms crossed I am standing and Bernadette is sitting on the counter. I know that any minute now one of us is going to be on the attack. It is as if we are both trying to see who is going to attack who first. It is me I am the first to speak and it is all because I can no longer stand looking at that smug look on her face \"What the fuck is your problem?\" I snap, \"Why are you like this? Why are you such a god damn bitch?\" \"You want to know why I'm a bitch?\" She asks sliding down from the counter. I am at a bit of an advantage that I am a bit taller then her but I am really not that much taller then her. \"You know my sister Vallarie?\" She asks. \"Your Identical twin?\" I say. \"Yeah I know her, She's dating my kid brother\" Although a lot of people think it is just a stage age that Dallas and I brothers, the truth is we are stage brother and Biological brothers half brother's that is, we have the same mother but different fathers I think or maybe the other way around. We grew up under the same roof with the same parents etc. \"The one.\" She spits out. \"And I don't like your brother either, in fact I hate him.\" My big brotherly instincts right away come into full swing as she insults Dallas. But I hold my tongue I do not want things to get ugly with Bernadette at least not yet I know they are already heating up to. \"Anyway Vallarie has suffered from Epilepsy since she was 12 years old\" She says, I really don't understand what Bernadette is getting at. \"So what?\" I ask, \"What's that got to do with me?\" She moves in closer. She is really quite the maniac. \"It's got everything to do with you\" She says in a hushed voice. \"People take advantage of her and you're one of them. In fact your the one who makes it happen. Your the reason Vallarie who already has Epilepsy probably has like 60 different STD's now. So that's my problem so I'm sorry I can't be more welcoming.\" \"Yeah?\" I ask, \"Then why did you agree to let me stay? Didn't you realize how awkward it was going to be for everyone? In case you didn't realize this. I don't like it anymore then you do.\" Bernadette rolls her eyes and shrugs. \"You're just putting everyone in an awkward situation the way your doing all of this\" \"Doing all of what?\" She asks. \"This whole playing favorites thing. You make it way to obvious that you hate me but you act like you have the biggest girl crush ever on Brooke, do you know how Awkward that is for Adam? And for me? And for Brooke? Bernadette holds out her hand. \"Hold on a second did you say girl crush?\" \"Yeah\" I Say, \"I'm pretty sure that's what I said, \"No I don't have a crush on her I'm straight god damnit\" \"I said girl crush\" I says, \"Yeah girl crush as in a crush on a girl as in Lesbian\" \"Not really\" I say, \"It's actually something totally different it just means having feelings of admiration and adoration for a girl in a nonsexual way that's it.\" Bernadette rolls her eyes and raises her eyebrow. \"Well no\" She says, \"I'm sorry if you read it way the fuck wrong, their's no girl crush or regular crush their's no crush at all I'm sorry if you read me wanting to get to know Brooke better as having a girl crush on her because I really feel like I don't know her. You can't have a girl crush on someone you know so little about god damnit\" \"Actually that's kind of the way crushes work\" I protest. \"Whatever\" She says again, that is just starting to be her favorite multi purpose word these days. \"And what do you mean you feel like you don't know her of course you know her, you've known her for as long as you've known Adam\" \"Yeah I know technically I know her, but she's one of those people who I can never get a read on\" I can totally see where she's coming from because I too have noticed that with Brooke, Bernadette fortunately does not have that problem I can read her inside and out. \"I mean no offense or anything but what even is her personality?\" Truthfully no one's ever asked me that question before, but I somehow don't think it's a question I am going to be able to answer, because really I don't know how to describe her personality either, If someone was to ask me to describe my personality I'd have no problem with that, I'm tall and Mike. I guess I would have a bit of a problem with it after all. Hell I'm sure Bernadette wouldn't be able to describe her personality, it is just a situation that puts people in an awkward position. And the way Bernadette keeps going with this? How dare she attack someone who's already down? \"I mean I don't want to sound like a total bitch or anything like that but uh, what is she like? I'm still not getting it\" Great just like that now she is attacking Brooke and on top of that does her voice have to be so damn loud \"Could you be less quiet?\" I hiss, \"She's in the other room you know\" I'm not sure what other room, there are many other room's in this house, \"the other room\" is by no means very specific, but their house is only one story so I'm sure she is down the hall some where. \"Look if you're going to insult us maybe we should just leave\" \"No\" She says hastily. She then clears her throat. \"No. It's really important to Adam that you two stay, obviously both of you are very important to him, and also I'm really sorry. I can be a total bitch sometime's and it's that time of month so when I have my period I'm even worse, but I'll try to be nicer.\" \"Look Mike\" She says \"You don't have to do this for me. But could you please do it for Adam, he can't do this alone\" I look down at the floor. Bernadette lets out a heavy sigh. \"I'll tell you what why don't we make this apology official, why don't you let Adam and I take you out for dinner, we have some money left in the bank from previous teaching gigs, \"Why don't we take you to Chico Callie Mimi\" \"I don't know I don't really think Brooke would be up for going to a restaraunt\" I say, I do not tell Bernadette that Brooke will only eat angel hair pasta with butter because even though she apologized I still don't trust her not to be a judgemental bitch about the whole thing. \"We could order in\" Bernadette says, \"Our treat\" \"Yeah thanks\" That should be good. \"So would you like anything to drink?\" Bernadette asks. After a couple long hours of silence. I wonder what is taking Adam \"A beer?\" I ask, \"Sure\" She says shrugging. \"It's 6:00 some time in the world\" She goes to the fridge and pulls out a 2 cans of cheap Shaws brand beer \"5:00\" I say after another silence. \"Huh?\" She asks, I can't believe how awkward I am around Bernadette I'm Magic Mike for god's sake I'm not awkward around anyone but now suddenly I'm acting like I'm Adam or someone. As Joanna my old girl friend has once said I'm usually a real chatty Cathy, \"The uh expression is it's 5:00 sometime in the world\" \"mmm\" Bernadette says sipping her beer. I wish Adam would get done with whatever he's doing and joining us. It's funny how much the Kid who hardly said a peep has come out of the shell. Adam used to need me to fill the awkward silence not the other way around. Now 7 years later Adam is an expert at filling awkward silences, but unfortunately he has his hands full which is to be expected. After a while I try again. \"You were right you know\" I say. \"Yeah?\" Bernadette says taking another sip of her beer not even bothering to ask what it is that she was right about. This is going to be a lot harder then I thought. \"Brooke is hard to get a read on\" I expect that to be a good conversation grabber but it's not. I thought she would be all over that. Instead she just gives me a single \"Yeah\" And continues sipping her beer. Why on earth is she snubbing me? She was the one who was mean to me. Not the other way around. I guess she still hates me but I thought we were passed that. \"I've been dating her for 8 years now about as long as you and Adam.\" \"7\" Bernadette says sipping her beer again. I might as well be having a conversation with the wall. \"I Didn't even know about her narcotics addiction or her fake knee or her seizures she didn't tell me anything that happened during her Freshman year. Bernadette takes another sip of beer and then sits in silence for a moment she appears to be deep in thought. \"Well you know why should it matter?\" She asks. \"It was all in the past right? God I hate to sound like that old Lion King movie and all that but what can I say?\" She sounds like she is getting at something now. \"What do you mean?\" I ask. She shrugs and makes a perfect toss with her beer can into the waste basket. \"I Don't know nothing\" She says, \"Just forget it\" \"No what?\" I ask because I feel like we are finally getting somewhere. \"I don't know just Adam\" She says and shrugs. \"It's nothing.\" \"He didn't tell you he was a stripper?\" I ask. \"Not right away no\" She says chewing at her fingernail. \"Were you pretty pissed?\" I ask because I know all about her hatred for strippers. \"Yeah\" She says. \"Did you hate him?\" \"At first\" She says, \"We broke up over it, but then I let it go because you know it's in the past and so is that thing with Brooke maybe she doesn't want to talk about it because it's embarassing I don't know\" \"Well apparently because of that past aditction, she has to be really careful with her painkillers she's not supposed to take them herself she's only supposed to take the god damn pills if I give them to her. I pull out the bottle. \"See\" I say, \"It says, For Mike Lane to give to Brooke Kennedy\" \"How long ago was her addiction again? Bernadette asks. \"Like 10 years ago, she was adicted to Morphine\" \"Wow that's not good\" Bernadette says, \"You don't want her to get addicted again do you? And I heard Methedone's even worse then Morphine in terms of addiction\" \"I think she'll be fine, she had an addiction but it was in the past remember 10 years ago?\" \"Eh\" Bernadette says shrugging her shoulders. I can already tell that talking to her is going to be a dizzying roundabout vortex first she attacks me then she ignores me, then she says one thing then another thing. Screw that. \"Are there any more beers in the fridge?\" I ask. She shakes her head. \"Would you like a coke zero?\" \"Sure\" I say. We sip our cokes in silence this time not even trying to have a conversation. Been there done that. Didn't work. Just then Adam returns from the kitchen. \"How's she doing?\" Bernadette asks. \"She's finally asleep now\" He says sounding both relieved and exasperated. \"God I really don't know if I'm up for the task\" He says, \"First she was uncomfortable with the sheets, they were too itchy, so I had to find another blanket, but that one was too soft for her, It sure is a hell of a good thing that we have a lot of blankets.\" Sweat pours down his face the poor kid. Once I finally did get her the right blanket she complained that her pillow was too fat so I had to go through the same thing we did with the blankets, then once I finally had the right pillow and the right blanket she was too hot, then she was too cold, then she was too hot again. I really could have lost it with her, but she's just so sick and helpless\" Once she was comfortable enough she wanted to watch the TV, but she couldn't find anything that was interesting. So I showed her my movie connection, she watched each movie for at least 5 minutes before deciding it was totally boring.\" \"Oh Adam sweetie\" She says, \"I'm so sorry\" \"So then she asked me to read to her. So I read a couple of the kids essays\" She didn't seem to care much about that either. So then I read her the names on the seating charts I thought she would get a crack out of some of the names of the kids in my class because a lot of them have pretty funny names, she didn't. At one point I think she had a seizure?\" \"She did?\" Bernadette asks, \"Well sweetie why didn't you tell me, I could have helped you, he'llo I've known how to work and deal with seizures since you know Vallarie was 12. I am so sick of hearing about Vallarie, sick of being here as a matter a fact. It's obvious that Adam is sick of us being here to, its only been at least 2 and a half hours and already fish and visitors are starting to apply It would just make it a whole lot easier on all of us if we left. We are not exactly stuck I mean we could leave at any time. We have a car, we don't live too far down the road we didn't pack too much stuff. \"Well no I don't think you could have\" Adam says placing his hand on Bernadette's shoulder. \"It wasn't that kind of seizure. It wasn't that kind of seizure at all\" \"Then what kind was it?\" Bernadette asks. \"Like Petite Mal because that can happen to Vallarie but it's very rare like just sometimes she stares off into space and loses track of where she is but she quickly returns\" \"No it wasn't really like that\" Adam says, \"It was more Like Cataplexy, like I handed her a cup of water and she just froze. and she didn't come back right away either.\" \"Oh my god what did you do?\" Bernadette asked. \"I have to say that I totally feel like I am only a guest in this whole situation. It is the Adam Bernadette and Brooke show, guest starring Mike. I wrack my brain to try to remember if their was anything on that printed page about cateplexy or seizures or catapletctic seizures and if their was what are you supposed to do for that. Adam answers my question right away. \"There was nothing I could do\" \"Oh\" Bernadette says sympathetically, \"I'm sorry\" \"We just had to wait it out\" \"How long did it take\" Bernadette asked her voice is shaky as if she are about to cry and what exactly is it that gives her the right to cry in this situation. Brooke is practically a stranger to her she said so herself, it would almost make sense if she did have a \"Girl crush\" but since there is no girl crush to speak of what's her business. Just Who does Bernadette think she is. I think the question that everybody's been asking. I really hope this only lasts for a week and no more, maybe something like three days will be better, but it already seems like this is going to be a three person job. \"I'm not sure how long it lasted\"Adam says getting teary eyed which is understandable in his case. \"But once she came out of it, she said it's happened to her before\" \"It has?\" I ask because I hadn't seen it happen before. \"She said it happened quite a bit during Freshman year. It sounded like she had the Freshman year from Hell, but what was I supposed to say I had an awesome Freshman year I wasn't going to just say that how cruel would that be?\" \"You did have an awesome Freshman year\" Bernadette agrees, \"Yeah that would have been mean your right\" So I guess here we are again, Freshman year, the year that sucked for her but that she has kept a deep dark secret. Then she just cried for hours on end. \"Was it really hours on end?\" Bernadette asked, \"It seemed to be\" \"How did you finally get her to sleep?\" I ask wondering if maybe he had gotten a hold of my Methadone pills. \"I gave her a Belsomra\" He says, \"But then she was all whiney that they didn't start kicking in right away. So I read her some children's books. \"Why do you have children's books\" \"It's just the 2nd through 5th grade readers collection. They belong my special ed class that meets Tuesday and Thursday mornings.\" Bernadette nods. \"It was nice when she finally doze off\" Brooke finally comes out of the guest room looking just zonked. Obviously the pill hasn't started kicking in yet, because she looks like a complete zombie. \"Where's the bathroom?\" She slurs. \"I have to pee\" Her eyes appear droopy like she is sleepwalking \"To your right\" Bernadette says. Brooke then takes a sharp turn to the left. \"Oh no sweetie to your other right\" Bernadette says. Brooke just walks around aimlessly until she smacks right into the wall. Adam rushes over to her. \"You all right?\" He asks. Brooke doesn't say anything just stairs up at him in her zombie like stuper, is it happening again? Is she having another one of her seizures? \"The bathroom's this way\" He says taking her by the arm. She does not go back to the guest room, I guess she is awake for the afternoon, I guess it is now pushing 3:00 almost. \"Would you like something to drink?\" Bernadette asks. Brooke shakes her head. \"Should we all go out to the living Room?\" Bernadette asks \"I think we should all be a lot more comfortable out there shouldn't we all agree\" I disagree. I think we are going to be uncomfortable no matter which room we are in.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: Adam I knew this wasn't going to be easy, being the second born and not having any younger siblings after me I have never imagined that I'd ever be in this situation, I always kind of had the idea that my sister Brooke was invincible, that nothing could ever happen to her which I guess is kind of a funny thing to think but hell Brooke has always played it kind of safe if you ask me. I grew up thinking that she was my perfect responsible older sister, although she was never by any means cool, she was on the soccer team, but at the same time she was on the marching band she never really did have many friends what she did have were aquaintences from both the soccer team and the marching band but she wasn't super close to any of them and was never popular by any means nor did she ever have a best friend. But she was still someone I looked up to, she was aloof and pretty much invisible but she was always someone I could come to for advice and she is someone who saved my ass many times when I was drowning. I had never ever thought I'd be in a situation where I'd have to be the one to take care of her, but now I find out she is sick it is my turn to take responsibility and I feel like I am sinking. It is my chance to be the big brother, but even though she is sick that will never change the fact that she is older then me, she is still as bossy and ever and even though I am trying as hard as I can she keeps managing to make me feel inferior. \"Adam\" She moans. \"What what's wrong\" I ask \"I don't like this blanket\" She moans. Bernadette and I have set up a really nice bed for her and Mike the night before and I had thought we did a good job. \"Why what's wrong?\" I ask again. \"It's too itchy\" She moans. This should be easy I have had practice with being assertive, I am a high school teacher for really challenging kids at an alternative school for god's sake, why should this be any different. Fact of the matter is, it's a lot different, I guess it's because I just wasn't meant to be a big brother because I don't know how to be an big brother, I was meant to be a little brother the second born the youngest. I have been programed to please and not to assert so that is exactly what I do. So why? I ask myself, why did I offer to take on this situation that I knew I couldn't handle. I guess it's just who I am. For example I was taking a huge risk taking a job as a stripper when I was 19 and stupid and an even bigger risk being a teacher without telling people about my past although a lot of people might think that by not telling people about my past may be taking the easy way out I suppose in a way it kind of is but it's also really hard going from day to day with this huge secret below my belt, it's kind of like sleeping with a bed of rocks or nails behind your pillow, it would be a lot easier if I could tell the truth but then I'd know their would be hell to pay \"All right, I'll see if I can find you something better\" I say, heading towards the bed Brooke just sits up in bed looking unhappy and why shouldn't she? I wonder if Dad ever had to go through with this with our Aunt Beverly she too is the older sister and she too is incredibly bossy. The thing is both my dad and Aunt Beverly are very type A personalities they are both bossy but about different things, but no one is even close to as bossy as Aunt Beverly. She was always very bossy to us kids when we were growing up and staying at her house was a nightmare she had very strict rules about what we were aloud to watch on TV, when we were supposed to have dinner what we were supposed to eat for snack, when we were supposed to go to bed, when we were supposed to get up, what we were supposed to wear, when we were supposed to do our chores, how clean we were supposed to be, you get the point. Like I said our dad has also been very bossy but in a totally different way, that basically just means that he plays by a totally different rule book, I could see them totally clashing if he was supposed to be in the roll of care taker, but Aunt Beverly's condition is very mild. \"Adam?\" Brooke moans. Again. \"What's wrong?\" I find my self asking for like the third time. \"For God's sake Adam get this itchy thing off me before I break into hives\" \"Oh sorry\" I say. As I grab the wool blanket off her. \"Ooh burr Adam\" She moans. \"Could you just use the top sheet for now?\" I ask. She doesn't look too happy about that. \"What's taking you?\" I ask, honestly I'm doing the best I can, It's just why did Bernadette have to put the blankets up so high out of reach, I guess it's because she's so freakishly tall that's why. \"Here you are\" I say pulling down a down comforter. \"Thanks\" She says woodenly. \"That blanket's cold\" She complains. I suppose it should be since it has been in the closet for so long and the guest room doesn't get any heat. \"Just give it a while\" I say it will warm up. \"Adam bur Adam, I want to be cosy\" She is really testing my patience and I really want to yell, but one look at her lying their so helpless and exhausted I can't yell at her, even if she is being exasperating beyond belief saying exasperating things like she wants to be cosy if she's going to continue saying stupid shit I just might lose it. I grit my teeth. \"It's a down comforter\" I say raising my voice a tiny bit. \"It's supposed to be warm\" Just like that seconds later. \"Adam I'm too hot\" She complains, \"I'm going to die of heat stroke\" It takes almost literally all the strength I have not to yell. Let me tell you something, I am usually an even tempered kind of guy when something ticks me off, I really really lose my temper. It's the whole reason why my football scholarship didn't work out. The whole reason why my first time at college didn't work out and why I even have a stripper background to speak of. I have to take many deep breaths to calm myself down. Brooke angrily kicks off the down comforter, she can be as angry as she wants, but me I guess I have to be the one taking the high road in this situation. It's really not fair that both of us can't be angry in this situation, but what can I say I was the one who got myself into this mess, I had invited her to stay. I'll tell you I continue to go through hell, I go through pretty much every single blanket in our top shelf before I finally find one that is acceptable to her, that isn't too itchy or too hot or too cold or too soft or too hard or too gross or whatever. \"So you're good now?\" I ask. Brooke sulks and shakes her head. \"Why what's wrong?\" I ask again. \"My pillow's too fat\" \"You're pillow's too fat?\" I ask I can't help finding that ridiculous, anyone would think she'd prefer the fatter pillow. \"What's wrong with it?\" I ask. \"It's hurting my neck\" She complains. \"Fine\" I say through grit teeth, \"I'll get you a better pillow\" I let out a sigh of exasperation. \"What's that now?\" She asks. \"Nothing\" I say keeping my composure, \"Nothing at all.\" I toss down all the pillows which is a much easier thing to do then with the blankets. Believe it or not, it turns out she is even pickier about pillows then she is about blankets, she goes through about 15 of the pillows before finding one she actually likes. \"All right\" I say. \"Have a nice rest\" \"Noooooo Adaaammm! Don't leave me Adam\" She moans as I start to walk out the door. \"Staaayyyy! Stay with me Adam. At least until I fall asleep?\" I turn around and shut the door behind me. I have never heard her sound like such a vulnerable little girl before, it is both frightening and at the same time sort of refreshing. I also feel like if she doesn't let me go soon I am really going to go all kinds of crazy. \"All right\" I say \"Would you like to watch a movie?\" \"Sure\" She says, \"What do you have?\" I show her my collection. \"This one's pretty funny\" I say referring to an experimental movie called \"The Taker\" It is about a special snowflake named Dingo who just expects everyone to give him everything. The reason why I picked it is because it seems right up Brooke's alley. She is being a taker right now and a special snow flake and I think she could very well relate to Dingo's behavior. \"Sure\" She says. We are only at the credits when Brooke announces, \"This is boring what else do you have?\" \"Boring?\" I almost shout, \"How can you already know it's boring? We're 1 minute into it\" \"I just know\" She says. \"Brooke we're only on the credits\" \"Yeah\" She says, \"They're boring\" I guess she expects the credits to be super exciting. What a taker she's being. I would really like to watch the movie but I suppose it is not about what I want it is all about Brooke. \"All right\" I Say, \"Do you want to pick out a different movie\" \"Please\" She says. Maybe she could find a movie with really awesome credits all the power to her I guess. \"I think you'll like this movie\" I say, pulling out a documentery that was made in the year 2015 about Otherkin. \"I think you'll find this one very interesting\" I tell her, \"It's about Otherkin\" \"Other what?\" She asks, not sounding even the slightest bit interested. \"Otherkin\" I explain, \"Their people who feel they were born into the wrong bodies\" \"Sure\" Brooke says, \"That sounds okay I guess\" I guess I can't say I blame her one tiny little bit for not being completely pleased, she did just find out she was sick after all and she has had a long history of clinical depression dating back to 5th grade. Oh my god Brooke in 5th grade. I don't even remember what started it or when it started, maybe now that I think about it, it was after christmas break, but I couldn't really quite get the concept because I was only in 3rd grade I thought maybe there was just a little holiday let down as their always had been for Brooke, both Brooke and our mother always loved Christmas, while Dad and I were always kind of on the more neutral side about it. I love it and everything but I was never too bummed about taking down the Christmas tree. Brooke on the other hand has always been one to cry when our family took down the Christmas tree that year was no exception, but as the year went by I came to realize that it was much more then a little after holiday blues, much much more as a matter a fact. January became February and February became March and so on and so forth, every day it didn't get any better. Some days she just wouldn't go to school at all but instead stay in her room and sleep all day, on weekends our family would sometimes go through days without seeing her at all. During spring break we literally never saw her. I don't even think she ever got up to use the bathroom, I am in fact still convinced to this day that she used a bed pan which is really not something I like to think about. That Spring Break our family of four was planning a big day trip to Disney World, but Brooke never came out of her room so we went without her. It was kind of a cruel thing to do, but our mother never really seemed to care much for my sister. She seemed to think she was a constant disappointment and that just thinking about her brought great sorrow. I could never really figure out why Brooke could just couldn't win with our mother. But she always seemed more relaxed and happy in a way that I'd never seen when Brooke wasn't part of the picture. Hell she was a totally different person when Brooke wasn't in the picture, I didn't really understand my mother's issues with her she always seemed very inoffensive and quiet. We had a wonderful Brookeless time in Disney World, I was sorry Brooke didn't get to go, but on the other hand she wouldn't have had fun, Brooke didn't have fun at least not anymore. I'm also very sure that she didn't feel left out. I'm sure she didn't even notice when we were gone. On the rare days she would go to school she always looking as if she had just rolled out of bed and always walked into the classroom as if she were still half asleep, she wouldn't talk in class nor would she do her homework and instead of playing outside at recess she would take refuge in one of those playground tubes. I had asked my mom why Brooke was so sad because I really couldn't see much of a reason, from what I heard, 5th grade sounded awesome. It was the year that they got to chose instruments, the year they got to preform Shakesphere plays and the year they got to go on the most exciting field trips that other grades had talked about for years. Also as far as I knew no one was bullying her, she had a really nice teacher who was rumored to be the best teacher at the school and she got a long well enough with her classmates. My mom told me that it was because she had a chemical imballance in her brain. I didn't really understand at first I thought she was sad because her brain was different or something and that that would make anyone sad, I didn't think it meant she had some kind of mental illness, but then my mom explained to me about Depression. I had vaguely heard about depression on Public Service Announcements, but for some reason I had the impression that it was only something that happened to adults. What even more surprised me was when she was given Prozac. I had never heard of any other 5th grader taking Prozac I knew that there were kids who took pills like ritilin for concentration, but of course I had never heard of any 5th graders being on antidepressants but of course a big part of it may have been because I didn't know 5th graders could suffer from depression in the first place, I had thought you were supposed to be a certain age to start taking the drug. But she started taking it and never stopped taking it. She still takes it to this very day, plus some other anti depressants I wonder if the depression is a result of her Elher's Danlo's Syndrome and if that causes people to have more mental health problems, or if she is just feeling blue because she is sick. I suppose it doesn't really matter. Why should it? What matters is that she is really unhappy and I am not doing anything to help. I might as well leave, but clearly she wants me to stay and entertain her. I can't entertain her. I pop in the Otherkins movie. Believe it or not she get's bored even earlier into the movie. Now I find myself getting mad at her. I honestly can't help it. \"Are you fucking kidding me?\" I snap. \"We hardly watched any of this movie, we watched even less of this one then we did the other movie.\" \"Yeah well it's boring I can tell, please put on a different one\" I cross my arms across my chest. She has now crossed the line. \"NO!\" I snap. She sits up in bed. \"Excuse me?\" She asks. \"I said no god damnit, give it at least another couple of minutes god damnit. You can't just know it's boring when you hardly watched it. It's a really great movie if you watch it. I think you'd really like it if you give it a chance.\" Brooke appears as if she is going to cry, I am right away sorry for yelling at her. Am I ever fucking sorry, her lips start to quiver but she does not cry. \"I guess I don't really feel like watching a movie\" She says. \"Could you read to me Adam?\" I remember back in the old days when she used to read to me when we were little kids before I went to bed. I remember it was especially nice when she would read to me during the week of the chicken pox. Now that I think about it when she caught the chicken pox from me a week later, she was a hell of a lot sicker then me, maybe I should have seen that as a tell tale sign. \"Sure\" I say, \"I'll read to you.\" I try to dig out some reading material but the problem is, the only thing that even comes close to reading material that I have stored in the guest room are old documents from my first two semesters of teaching and a couple of old classroom rosters. I come to realize that Bernadette and I really put all the effort we could have in the guest room, and that it's not really the best place to stay if you are a guest. The rosters are pretty entertaining though I have to say there are some pretty futuristic names on the lists that I think she might get a kick of, seriously who wouldn't get a kick out of names like Timecapsule McMullun and Waterbottle Davis. I think that might be just the thing that gets her to laugh or at the very least smile today. She doesn't smile and she most certainly doesn't laugh. \"Eh\" She says, \"I don't think that's that weird. Parents can name their kids whatever they want in this day and age, there's no reason to be so judgmental Adam\" She says appathetically. She's so boring how can she stand herself? \"I'm really not interested in listening to class lists. I meant I wanted to hear a story.\" I now feel really bad that we haven't stocked up in the guest room and even worse that I can't think of any stories to tell. \"Do you have any children's books?\" She asks. It just brings tears to my eyes to hear my strong, mature together responsible sister ask to hear a children's book. \"Children's book?\" I ask, I in fact don't have anything like that because why would I? We don't have any kids or nieces or nephews. Hell I'd like to have kids, but Bernadette won't even touch that idea. Not even when we get married. \"Could you get me some from the library?\" She asks, when it suddenly occurs to me that I do have just the reading material she is looking for and it is right in my teaching bag. Every Tuesday and Thursday Mornings, I go over to the Public school and teach a class for highschooler's with mild to moderate to sever to profound reading disabilities. The Highest readers are able to read at a 7th grade level, but the lowest readers can only read at a 2nd grade level. I'm pretty sure Brooke is really wanting to hear one from the 2nd grade level, she is acting like quite the 2nd grader right now. I only have a 3rd grade reader and an 8th grade reader So I take out the 3rd grade reader. They are very old readers like from the early 90's to the late 2020's I guess by the 2030's they just stopped making them. The one I have is from maybe 1994 or something. Again we go through the exact same ordeal with the movies, I read her the first sentence in the story and she is bored, but at least their are at least 17 stories in this reader so it's progress to watching her just watching 1 minutes or less then the credits of two movies. She doesn't care about any of the 17 stories, not about the family who only eats jam, not about the girl who is horse crazy, not about the girl who is teaching her grandma how to read, not about the deaf girl who everyone is mean to, not about the man who builds himself a scarebird, not about the dentist who plays tricks on his patients, not about the kid in Japan who sleeps for 7 years, not even about the polar bear cub or the seal pup (Not that I give a damn either) or even about the kids who's Uncle with Down's Syndrome moves in with them, or about the boy who discovers a magical garden. I close the book and let out a huge sigh of exasperation. \"Why don't you just take a nap\" I suggest. \"No way Adam\" She moans, \"I'm not tired. Do you have another reader?\" I do have another reader but forget it, if she wasn't interested before what in the world gives her the idea that she's going to be interested in the next one. \"I think you should just rest, your obviously in a really shitty mood\" I did not mean to say it it just slips out, but man does she ever look offended. Great now what can I do. \"Would you like half of my Belsomra?\" I ask, when I say that her eyes light up and it seems like all is forgiven for now. \"I'd love one\" She says. I am probably the only one in our direct family of four who takes sleeping pills because like I said sleeping under a pillow of rocks is not comfortable. I hadn't needed to take it until the secret got really out of hand. I quickly head over to Bernadette and my room and get my Belsomra bottle. Technically I'm not supposed to share it with other people, but Brooke is really suffering and she doesn't have anything else for sleep and if I can't get her to sleep it's going to be a whole afternoon of this nonsense. While I am at it I get her a glass of water from our bathroom, she could swallow the pill with her saliva but after all the choking she's been going through lately I don't want to chance it. \"Here you are Brooke\" I say handing her both the half a Belsomra and the water. When she holds pops the pill into her mouth and goes to take a sip of water something very odd happens. She freezes. Just freezes. \"Brooke?\" I say waving my hand in her face, \"Brooke you okay? Brooke\" Then something even weirder happens, I feel guilty. Like it is my fault for being snippy at her. I try to remind myself that I am not thinking logically because I am obviously really freaking out. \"Brooke!\" I shout again, she remains in her frozen position. \"Are you all right? Can you hear me?\" Still nothing. While she is in her position with her mouth open, I take the opportunity to remove the saliva drenched pill from her mouth and the cup of water from her hands. \"Brooke sweetie what's wrong?\" I ask, \"What's wrong Brooke?\" I repeat, still nothing. \"What's wrong?\" I ask again. \"What's wrong?\" Still she does not snap out of her funk. As time goes by I start to wonder if I should go get Mike and Bernadette, maybe they will know what to do, I am about to leave the room and get one of them or both of them when she finally snaps out of it. \"Brooke?\" I ask, \"What happened, are you all right?\" She then bursts into heavy tears. I sit down on the bed next to her and let her lay her head down in my lap and stroke her hair as she sobs so hard her entire body shakes. She wipes her eyes and looks up at me. She is shivering uncontrollably despite the fact that I have finally found her the right blanket. \"This isn't the first time this has happened\" She says. \"Has it been happening a lot lately?\" I ask. \"Actually no\" She says, \"Not lately, not in a really long time actually. It happened a lot during Freshman year of College\" This is actually the first time I've heard Brooke talk about Freshman year of College, usually she tries to avoid the subject like it is the plague. I remember thinking she was having a really good time at first, she had sent our family long and detailed email's about how great things were going and about all the new friends she was making and all the parties she was attending and clubs she joined. It made our mother so happy that Brooke was happy, and when my mother was happy, everyone was a lot happier and relaxed. I believed it at the time, we all did but when she came home for Christmas break she seemed to be in one of her funks again, maybe even more so then usual so I knew she wasn't really that happy. Although it is a well known fact that Brooke loves Christmas, it's also a well known fact that she often times brings a foul mood with her to the Christmas dinner table, it is in fact very rare when she is in a good mood at Christmas dinner. Nothing compared to her mood that year however. When she talked about the wonderful times she was having she seemed to be doing so through grit teeth. She seemed bitter and angry. My dad realized picked up that she was in a bad mood, which leaded them to get in a huge fight, where Brooke started throwing chairs and breaking dishes and crying so hard she was practically screaming and snot was running down her nose. We had never seen her so angry it had Mom to cry and me to step in and play the roll of mediator. \"Stay out of this Adam\" My dad had yelled. Thank god it had only been our direct family of four that year, Aunt Beverly was out of town, Grandma and Grandpa were dead and Brooke and I didn't have anyone we were dating at the time. Brooke slowly moves to the edge of the bed where she parks herself and let's her feet dangle. Her eyes wide and scared but her tears are now all dry. \"It really was a shitty year Adam\" She says, \"Freshman year of College\" That much I figure. I wish I could give her some comforting words like \"I know how that is\" But I don't. Freshman year might have been terrible for her, but it was the best year of my life, I'd sound like a selfish bastard. We are silent for a while, I keep looking at her to make sure she doesn't freeze again. She doesn't. She is playing with the end pieces of the woven blanket. \"I do remember Christmas dinner that year\" I say. \"Oh God\" Brooke says, she is now in tears again. \"I broke all of mom's important China\" \"I recall\" I say, \"And one of the legs on our fine wooden chairs. And the salt and pepper shakers\" \"Did I?\" She asks. \"Oh Man, I was just so crazy out of control, I don't even remember that\" I nod my head slowly as we slip into silence again. \"How often did that happen Freshman year?\" I ask trying to remember if that ever happened during Christmas break. \"What?\" She asked. \"The that. you know the freezing what ever you want to call it\" \"I don't know I guess seizures but not really because I was well aware of them, episodes\" She shrugs her shoulders and moves back to the head of the bed where she lays her head on the pillow and starts anxiously playing with a strand of hair. \"It was very infrequent how often they happened\" She says, \"Sometime's it would be like 5 time's a day, some days they wouldn't happen at all, other times I'd go through entire weeks just waiting for them to happen but they wouldn't, but then by second semester they became more predictable they happened every single day, at least 6 times a day sometimes even more. \"Brooke\" I say, that is all I can say. \"It was so frustrating.\" She continues, \"But it was more frustrating when I wasn't having them every day, those days when I just waited around for them to happen were just the pits. Eventually I stopped going to class and even when I did go my marks were pretty much deplorable, I was already flunking every class and I was already really behind because I had to take some time off with my knee injury\" That is the one thing I remembered sucking about her Freshman year. some time in early October she had completely wrecked her right knee or was it her left during an epic soccer game. I can't even remember anymore. I had thought that besides that she was happy, although I'm sure she was pretty down in the dumps about not getting to play soccer and having to be bed ridden. \"Yeah that's right\" I say, \"You had that huge accident in that huge soccer game\" \"That's what I said\" She says, \"But that was a complete lie it wasn't during an epic soccer game, it was during soccer practice, I wasn't even playing, I was just getting ready to play, I was just putting my shin guards on and then the next thing I knew I was in the hospital and they were telling me I needed a complete knee replacement because I had completely blown it out. I couldn't tell you guys the truth.\" I take it in for a really long time, In a way I can sort of relate one time I had a sex related injury and I made up a story about it but that's probably a lot different. The only similarity is that they both happened Freshman year of College. I honestly cannot think of a single word to say without making myself sound like a shallow asshole. I can't just say talk about my Freshman year which was so Redonie to her Blueonie. \"You guys just thought I was doing great\" She says, \"I felt just terrible lying to you\" \"Like you were sleeping on a bed of rocks?\" I ask, finally I have something I can relate to \"Exactly\" She says, \"It was so hard for me to write those long detailed emails talking about how great I was doing. I felt terrible fooling you guys, but you know It would have killed me if mom knew how bad I was doing. She just needs me to be happy. If I can't be happy then she can't be happy\" \"Yeah she worries about you\" I say, \"I know she resorts to drugs and alcohol if I'm not happy, and I didn't want to do that to her, and I'd hate to think of how she'd handle this\" I hold Brooke tightly to me. \"I think she'd be very worried\" I say, \"I think she was very worried about you then too\" \"Why should she have been?\" She asks, \"I was having a great time in College\" \"She knew you weren't as soon as you came home for Christmas break she knew you weren't doing so well at all\" \"Because of how I acted at dinner?\" Brooke asks staring down at her legs. \"She knew before that\" I tell her, \"The day she found you in your Pajama's she knew you were sad\" \"What's that supposed to mean?\" Brooke asks. \"Found me in my pajamas where, in the sewer, by the train track, in the lost and found?\" She says it through grit teeth. \"Are you okay Brooke?\" I ask, \"You seem really upset.\" \"Of course I'm upset\" She says. \"And I have no idea what your talking about\" \"Um no she found you in the living room at like 3:00\" \"Didn't sound like she had to look very hard\" Brooke says grouchily. Way to take everything way too literally. I remember my mom pulling me aside that day. \"Adam\" She had said, \"Your sister seems sad, don't you think?\" It was a conversation I had had with my mother many of times, it was my job to reassure her that no she wasn't sad. But I hadn't seen her since that summer, I knew about as much as she did, her emails seemed a bit manic if anything. \"How so?\" I had asked. \"She's wearing her pajama's at 3:00 for gods sake\" My mother said. \"I think she might be depressed again\" In some ways it is like Brooke and my mother are the same person if one of them is Depressed then both of them are depressed, if one of them is relaxed and happy then both of them are relaxed and happy. She is overly attached to my sister but at the same time she is freakishly detached to her. \"It's Vacation\" I say, \"She didn't have to go anywhere, why shouldn't she wear her pajama's all day? She's been busy at school all semester I think she deserves to spend a day in her pajamas give her a break\" \"Well so what?\" My mother had said, \"You've been busy at school too and look at you, you bothered to get dressed this morning\" \"Well that's different\" I said trying to reason with her, \"I'm in high school, she's in college\" \"Same difference\" My mother said sipping her afternoon martini, it made me sad that her frustration with Brooke caused her to drink during the day. \"Actually no, College takes a lot out of you\" \"I think I'd know better than you\" She had said, she was/is a mean drunk but she's also kind of a bitchy sober as well a really bitchy sober actually. \"I've been to college and you haven't so shove it\" I have seen my mother wear her pajama's all day, but I guess that was because she was depressed too which must have been where she was getting the idea from. \"Maybe she's just not feeling well\" \"She's always getting sick\" My mother had complained. \"She probably just has a bad immune system because she's so damn depressed\" She probably thinks that her depression could easily be cured with a simple \"Go cry emo kid\" no one's telling my mom to go cry emo kid, but that's all Brooke ever hears from my mother. \"Oh grow cry emo kid\" go cry emo kid hasn't been popular since her generation by the by. And also Brooke is not emo she is rightfully depressed thank you very much, I'm pretty sure emo just means hating on your life because it's in style, not hating your life because it actually sucks. If only my mother could see Brooke now and find out that there actually is something more then depression that is complicating her immune system, she'd feel damn sorry, but at the same time she'd probably drink and drug herself stupid, the only way she'd ever be okay with Brooke having Elher Danlo Syndrome would be if Brooke handled it well and Brooke is not handling it well, she is handling it like any normal person would. It would be way too much for my mom to ask if someone who has had a history of Depression did not get depressed about having Elher's Danlo Syndrome. Fucking way too much to ask. Fucking bitch. If you ask me I think it was a bit too much of her to expect Brooke to get dressed during a day of Christmas vacation when she didn't have anywhere to be and we didn't have anyone coming over and she had just gotten done with her first semester of college. And for god's sake at least she actually got up, some times during her deep depression's she never even bothers to get out of bed \"Would you like your sleeping pill now?\" I ask Brooke. \"Yeah sure\" I hand her the water and the pill and worry that she is going to have one of her seizures again, I can tell that maybe she is thinking the same thing. She looks pretty scared. \"You okay?\" I ask. \"I'm scared Adam\" She says. \"What if this triggers a seizure every time\" It is like the two of us have some kind of ESP or something. \"You'll be okay\" I say even though I know that as well as she does which is not at all. She takes the pill without having any kind of spell. \"I'll stay here till you fall asleep\" I say, \"Okay\" She says. At first I couldn't wait to get out of the room, but now I'm afraid to leave. She had said that the \"Seizures\" had happened on a daily basis Freshman Year second Semester. Brooke tosses and turns a bit. \"You okay?\" I ask for about the billionth time that day, well maybe not the billionth time but something close. \"This pills not working\" She says, \"Can I have another half\" \"I'm sorry\" I say, \"But technically I'm not supposed to share this perscription since it has my name on it, and 1/2 of a pill is the normal dosage, it always works for me, it might be really dangerous for you to take anymore. It will take a while but when it kicks in you'll know it. \"Am I boring you?\" she asks suddenly sounding really guilty, \"Because you could go hang out with Mike and Bernadette if you want\" \"No\" I say, \"I um should probably be here anyway in case you have another seizure.\" \"So you're just hanging with me because you feel obligated?\" She asks. It is the truth and we both know it. \"I don't want you to hang out with me because you feel obligated\" She says just like that she is tearing up again. \"No\" He says, \"I'm fine. I want to\" \"But I'm being such a pain\" She says. Now the tears are flowing freely down her cheeks. \"No. Well yeah you are but I can understand\" \"Thanks\" She says, \"You're just like Genica She was such a good friend I don't deserve her. I was such a bitch to her, but she stayed my friend\" Although up until today I knew very little about Brooke's Freshman year I did know Genica. If Brooke didn't have a best friend in Elementary School or high school, Genica was definitely her best friend in college, she still is her best friend, they still keep in touch and get together quite often. According to Mike, Bernadette has a girl crush on Brooke, but Genica has a real genuine crush on Brooke if you ask me. She says she has a boyfriend but I don't believe it. I'll believe it when I see it Brooke keeps going on. \"I don't deserve you either Adam\" Now I can tell that her voice is kicking in by the way she is slurring. \"You invite me over, and I act like shit to you I'm sorry Adam\" \"Hey It's all right\" I say. I look over at Brooke. \"You getting sleepy?\" I ask, She looks at me and nods then falls asleep as soon as her head hits the pillow. I kiss her on the top of the head and then make my way to the kitchen. Mike and Bernadette are sitting at the counter sipping beers and boy do they look uncomfortable to be in each other's presence, I feel really bad for taking so long and leaving them alone for so long, but I remember that my job is to take care of my sister, my job is not to keep Mike and Bernadette entertained, if they can't do that for themselves then I guess their loss or something. \"How's she doing?\" Mike asks, \"She's sleeping\" I say. \"You sure took long enough\" Bernadette says, \"It was hard work\" I say, \"You deserve a beer\" Bernadette says. \"We drank the last beer remember?\" Mike asks, \"Oh oh yeah\" Bernadette says, \"Would you like a coke?\" \"Yeah sure\" I say. \"So what all happened?\" Bernadette asks, \"I thought you were just going to make up a bed for her and that would be it\" \"Do you want the long list or the short list?\" I ask. \"Whichever\" Bernadette says, I end up going with the long list, since that is how it happened. \"First she was uncomfortable with the sheets, they were too itchy, so I had to find another blanket, but that one was too soft for her, It sure is a hell of a good thing that we have a lot of blankets. Once I finally did get her the right blanket she complained that her pillow was too fat so I had to go through the same thing we did with the blankets, Once she was comfortable enough she wanted to watch the TV, so I showed her my movie connection, she watched each movie for at least 5 minutes before deciding it was totally boring some time less then 5.\" \"Oh Adam sweetie\" She says, \"I'm so sorry\" I don't give her a chance to speak, I just continue venting, I can't help it, it feels good. \"So then she asked me to read to her but I didn't have any reading material in the guest room so I read her the names on the seating charts.\" Bernadette smirks. \"Yeah I agree, that does not count as reading material\" I thought she would get a crack out of some of the names of the kids in my class because a lot of them have pretty funny names, she didn't. At one point I think she had a seizure?\" \"Really?\" Bernadette asks, now she is all serious. She nudges me hard in the ribs. \"Well sweetie why didn't you come and get me?\" She asks. He'llo! Valli's been epileptic since she was 12 I've known how to deal with seizure's since then. \"Well I don't think you would have been able to deal with this one\" I tell her Well no I don't think you could have\" I say placing my hand on Bernadette's shoulder. \"It wasn't that kind of seizure. It wasn't that kind of seizure at all\" \"Then what kind was it?\" Bernadette asks. \"Like Petite Mal because that can happen to Vallarie but it's very rare like just sometimes she stares off into space and loses track of where she is but she quickly returns\" \"No it wasn't really like that\" I Try to explain \"It was more Like Cataplexy, like I handed her a cup of water and she just froze. and she didn't come back right away either.\" \"Oh my god what did you do?\" Bernadette asked. \"I panicked\" I admit, \"There was nothing else to do\"[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: Brooke Does it ever seem like old ghosts from Freshman year of College are out to Haunt me? Now that word has gotten out about my awful past things are unable to stay in the past. I had thought my seizure's were a thing of the past. As soon as Freshman year of college ended, so did they. But now they are back. As I make my way out of the guest room down the hall I swear I have another. Thank god it is not the catatonic kind of seizure again, but the spacing out types of seizures are just embarassing. \"Brooke you all right?\" Bernadette asks snapping me out of my state. \"Yeah I'm okay\" I say, \"I just forgot where I was for a while\" \"Don't you love those prescription sleeping pills? They just make you feel so demented, I always say why take them when you can always take ZZZquil? It works like a charm for me every night. Also it's delicious it actually tastes like mixed berries\" I Had forgotten all about taking the sleeping pills. I hope that is all that is that explains it. \"It's 4:30\" Adam says, \"I gave her the pill sometime around 12:30, it should be worn off by then.\" \"Oh my god Brooke are you all right?\" Bernadette asks. \"What why?\" I ask, \"Oh my god\" She says, \"I've just seen Valli get like this so many times, she stares into space and she doesn't remember where she is. Do you know where you are?\" It intimidates me when she stands directly in front of me and places her hands on my shoulders she is at least 3 inches taller then me. \"Your house\" I say, \"And I really have to pee, could you please let me use the rest room\" \"Oh yeah sure of course\" Bernadette says. \"It's to your right\" I wander off in the direction that I think is my right but apparently it is not, because Bernadette is very quick to point that out \"Oh no sweetie your other right\" She says gently grabbing me by the arm. I jerk away from her. She really creeps me out. She just tries way to hard with me. Way way way to hard. Without her help I slam right into the wall. Adam is right at my side. \"You all right?\" \"Ouch!\" I moan. Then I realize the most embarrassing thing that could have happened, during the time I smacked myself into the wall, I hadn't realized that I had lost control of my bladder, how could I not have felt that? Oh well I feel it now all right \"Oh shit\" I cry. \"What what's wrong?\" What does he mean what's wrong? Does he not notice? Is there not a huge puddle on the carpet? I scrunch down to the floor and sob. \"Brooke?\" He asks, \"What is it?\" I motion for him to come over so I can whisper in his ear. \"I wet myself\" I whisper in a little girly voice. \"It's okay sweetie\" Adam says. \"No it's not\" I cry. \"It's totally disgusting and weird and abnormal\" I'm so embarassed I would just love to crawl in a hole and hibernate for the rest of existence. \"Oh my god is it super obvious?\" I cry, \"No\" Adam says, \"It's okay. \"Brooke what happened are you okay?\" Bernadette asks. No way am I going to let Bernadette in on this. \"I'm fine\" I snap. \"Did you have a little accident?\" Bernadette asks, it's scary that she knows that, but I guess it makes sense, I did really have to go and I wasn't able to make it to the bathroom after all. \"Yeah so?\" I snap. \"So nothing\" Bernadette says shrugging it off. \"It's okay, we could get you a change of underpants\" Although she says it is no big deal, there is a smirk in her voice. \"Damnit Bernadette\" I cry \"Don't laugh at me\" \"No no no\" She says giving off a kind of condescending baby voice and why shouldn't she I had just wet the my pants and the floor thank you very much. \"Brooke I'm not laughing at you\" She says, \"Believe me this shit happens to Valli all the time. She got really embarrassed and cried like this too when she had her first pants wetting seizure\" \"Did I leave a puddle?\" I ask. \"Did I go and leave a god damn puddle?\" \"You did\" Bernadette says, \"But it's really not all that bad, we have some fabreez in the closet and then we could use an old towel to clean it up. Or even better let's use the lammy\" I have no idea what she's talking about. I cover my eyes with my hands. \"Oh my god you guys\" I cry, \"You have no fucking Idea how sorry I am about this\" I cry and cry for hours on end. \"Don't cry Brooke\" Adam says. \"Why shouldn't I? I'm so weird and gross\" Bernadette returns shortly from her room with an old warn down sheep skinned rug, that must be what she reffers to as the lammy. \"See\" She says cleaning it up, \"It's really not that big of a deal. The whole time she says this I can feel her smirk. It is just so obviously there. \"Here's a clean pair of panties\" She says, giving them a genuine toss \"Mike got them from your suitcase \"You're laughing at me\" \"No sweetie I'm not laughing.\" Is there any way this situation could get more babyish then it already is, A. I have wet my pants, B. Bernadette is speaking to me in that babying voice and C. She is cleaning up my puddle with something presumably from her childhood that she used to refer to as a lammy, the lammy is just making everything worse. I god damn hate the god damn fucking lammy. I'm sure that it probably goes way back to her nursery days, I can in fact just picture her lying on that thing as a tiny baby with a huge smirk across her face. I'll tell you she was born with that demented grin plastered right on her face. \"I'm not laughing at you\" She says again. I find locate the bathroom where hideout for a couple of seconds. Their probably all having a nice conversation about what a weird freak I am. I decide their's really no point in going back into the guest room to lay down, I decide I will join the other's in the living room. \"Feel better?\" Bernadette asks I can see that smirk from inches away. \"Just shut up okay?\" I. \"Bernadette really is trying to be nice to you Brooke\" Adam says as I flop myself down on one of the chairs. \"She's laughing at me\" I say grouchily folding my arms to my chest. \"She is not.\" Adam says, \"God damnit why do you have to be so judgmental?\" So Apparently now I am being judgmental of Bernadette being judgmental of me. Just what? \"I'm the one being judgmental?\" I ask, \"Yes\" Adam says, \"As weird as it may sound, you're judging her about judging you\" \"Hey\" Bernadette says holding out her hand, \"Let's not fight. Not on our first night as roommates no bad idea. Just remembered I have to call Chico Callie Mimi about ordering take out\" \"You're not going to get takeout at Chico Callie Mimi\" Adam says. \"Why not?\" Bernadette asks, \"Are you kidding?\" Adam asks, \"It's an expensive restaurant they don't do takeouts\" \"Oh\" Bernadette says, \"I uh, I totally didn't think of that shit. Brooke would you be okay with going out for dinner?\" She asks. I really wouldn't it is the absolute last thing in the world I want, but for some reason my my mouth just won't co operate with my brain. \"Sure I say, what time\" \"Really?\" Bernadette asks, \"You sure?\" \"Sure\" I say I do not get carsick on the rest of the way to Chico Callie Mimi, but on the other hand that is really not all that much of an accomplishment since it is only a couple of blocks away. As we walk in I see that the restaurant's interior hasn't changed all that much from when our family used to go their when we were young upon occasion. Us kids always got the exact same thing every time we came to Chico Callie Mimi, prime rib off the kids menu. Then one day. 6 year old Adam decided to do something really brave and daring. My ultra brave little brother decided to try ordering something different off the kids menu for once. He decided to be adventurous and order baked chicken can you believe it. It may sound like I'm being condescending by all means I am, but Adam was 6 it was a huge accomplishment at the time, he probably just than realized that he could order other things off the kids menu besides prime rib and that would be pretty exciting and I suppose brave even if it was just something ordinary like baked chicken which we had all the time at home, but I suppose I was not so brave because I continued to get prime rib off the kids menu no matter how old I got as a matter a fact prime rib off the kid's menu is exactly what I'm planning on ordering tonight and I am 29 years old, but still I'm not brave enough to order something new, and not in the slightest brave enough to order something off the adults menu. But that's just how things have been going lately, every time Mike takes me out to dinner I order off the kid's menu, I think that's actually kind of brave in of its self to eat something besides buttered noodles, but if they do have buttered noodles at restaurants I try to get it, although they usually don't have angel hair, it's usually stupid wagon wheels. \"We'll get a table for four\" Bernadette says to the waitress, \"Our reservations are under Kennedy-Kane-Lane\" I don't see why she had to complicate it so much, I guess none of us our married, but I suppose if I do get married to Mike someday in the nearby future and if I were to hyphonate my name it would be Brooke Kennedy-Lane, it kind of has a nice ring to it actually, I guess if Bernadette were to marry Adam and if she were to hyphonate her name it would be Bernadette Kennedy-Kane. It's funny how things worked out, but I'm pretty sure as much as Adam wants to settle down and have kids I can't see it happening for him and Bernadette because Bernadette does not believe in the whole marriage thing and having a man tie her down. \"Booth or table?\" \"Booth please\" Bernadette says giving her a can opener smile. She's such a can opener. The first thing I go for as we sit down at the table is the drink menu. Adam raises one eye brow at me. \"WHAT?\" I snap. \"What what?\" He asks, \"I didn't say anything.\" \"You didn't have to\" I say, \"Why are you giving me that look\" \"No reason\" He says. A waitress comes by. \"Hello\" She says, \"My name is Purity and I will be your waitress for tonight\" She looks exactly like someone who would be named purity, she is so fat and covered with acne and gross that anyone can bet she's still a virgin, and no that is not by choice. I hold my tongue. \"Can I start you off with any drinks?\" I realize that there is nothing in the world I want more then to get drunk. I just want to drink away my sorrows, and why shouldn't I? I have every reason, it's something I've always done during states of depression, It was something I'd done in college some of the time even if it meant 101% of the time drinking alone. As soon as I was out of Morphine pills I would splurge on the heavy stuff, Brandy, Whiskey, Jack Daniels, Everclear\" Now in retrospect I realize that I was stupid. I shouldn't have been drinking with my seizure disorder, but the thing was, although I'm probably making myself sound like an alcoholic with a really big problem, truth be told I really didn't drink that much because you see, I hardly ever left my room. Although there was a liquor store almost directly across from Campus and, I never really had the energy to go there, nor did I want to be seen in public, I would go their once in a blue moon, maybe twice a month and buy an expensive bottle of hard liquor which would last about a week. \"Let's see\" I say taking some time with the menu, \"I guess I'll get a chocolate rasberry martini,\" \"Okay\" Purity says, writing it down, \"And how about the rest of you,\" \"I'll get a bud light\" Adam says, \"Could I get a strawberry daquari too?\" I say interrupting Adam, \"Sure\" Purity says righting it down, \"And uh maybe a Whiskey Sour and could I also get a guiness chaser\" Adam makes a face, \"Brooke hey whoa girl, just get one or the other\" \"Don't boss me around\" I shout. \"Brooke\" Adam says trying to keep his voice calm, \"Please don't yell this is a fancy restaurant. I'm not trying to boss you around, I just don't think it's a good idea for you to be drinking with your condition that's all, besides I gave you that medication earlier.\" \"So?\" I say a little too loudly, \"You take Belsomra and your having a drink.\" \"Brooke for god's sake\" Adam says again, \"Not so loud, do you see what you just did? Now everyone at the restaurant knows I take Belsomra and people are staring. Besides FYI I only take that medicine at night and It's been out of my system for over 20 hours now and I'm only having a light beer not four heavy cocktails so that's not the same thing.\" Purity clears her throat. \"It sounds like you guys are still deciding, should I get back to you?\" \"I'll go with a bloody Mary\" Bernadette says, \"And I agree, I think this lady here should only get one or the other\" She turns to me, \"Can't you just imagine the hangover you're going to have tomorrow?\" She asks me, her blue eyes going wide. \"I'll go with a whiskey sour\" Mike says, \"And I think she should just have water\" \"Good lord\" I snap \"Stop treating me like a little kid you guys, just because I'm ordering off the kid's menu doesn't mean I'm not an adult\" \"Okay fine she'll get the white Chocolate Raspberry Martini, that was your first choice right?\" \"Right\" I say poutingly. \"Oh yes could we get a kid's menu?\" Mike asks. \"Sure of course\" Purity says, \"Hey don't judge me\" I snap, \"I'm just not very hungry today okay? OKAY?\" \"Okay\" Purity says, she then nervously skitters away. \"Good lord Brooke\" Bernadette says, \"What's the matter with you? She wasn't judging you\" Now that I think about it she wasn't, she hadn't said anything judgmental and I had acted like a grade A bitch for no reason. Oh shit. Oh god damn fucking shit.[Chapter 7] Chapter 7: Bernadette: I have never seen Bitch be so much of a Brooke, I mean Brooke be so much of a Bitch. But once we get to Chico Callie Mimi she seems to be on a roll. Usually when the four of us go out to dinner she shows little to no trace of personality, as a matter a fact she usually doesn't really show much of a personality in general, but now she is quite the piece of work. Of course I can't say I blame her for one second, she does have Ehler Danlo's Syndrome and from what very little I know about the disease that really sucks, but still she really shouldn't have agreed to come to Chico Callie Mimi if she obviously wasn't up for going out. \"Hello\" A homely looking waitress akin to the character Sadness from the old Pixar classic Inside Out says, \"My name is Purity and I will be taking your orders tonight\" Oh man and I thought my name was awful, Purity just takes the cake, and it is already really obvious that she hasn't been layed a single day in her life. Brooke is busily scanning the drink menu. \"I'll get a chocolate raspberry Martini\" Brooke says. I for one don't think she should be drinking at all, she did have a seizure earlier, although a lot of time's seizures and drinking can be very unpradictable together I would know all about that from Vallarie's stay. Anyone would think that Brooke would be trying to avoid having the kind of seizure she had, but I guess it probably just hasn't crossed her mind. \"All right\" Purity says writing down Brooke's order. \"Do the rest of you know what you're having?\" \"I'll get a bud light\" Adam says right then Brooke interrupts him and that is so not like her at least I don't think so, I guess I am finally getting a glimpse at who Brooke Victoria Kennedy really is, and I have to say I don't really like what I'm seeing. I remind myself over and over that I am doing this for Adam, she is Adam's sister and it is important to him. \"Could I get a strawberry daiquari too?\" She asks. \"Sure\" Purity says, \"What can I get for you two?\" She asks Mike and I, but before either of us can get a word in Brooke interrupts us again with more drink orders. \"Maybe also a Whiskey Sour and a Guiness\" She says. Poor thing. She really is grieving. I guess everyone grieve's differently but four drinks? Really? Acting like a total fucking bitch is already more grieving from her then I can handle right now. I swear if she adds four drinks she's probably just going to be even more insufferable. Not that I've noticed her being a mean drunk, but I also didn't really notice her getting more then one drink when we went out, nor did I notice alcohol ever giving her any more of a personality. Adam is the first one to say anything about Brooke's beyond embarrassing behavior. \"Brooke hey whoa girl\" Adam says, \"Just get one or the other.\" Brooke's eyes become narrow slits. \"You are not to boss of me Adam\" She snaps, \"I'm older then you and don't you ever forget that,\" Oh man. Vallerie always plays the I'm older then you card with me too. Of course she is only 3 minutes older then me. Still I feel like she get's everything first and I get what's left over. For instance Vallerie got the better name of the two of us, not only is it more flattering but also there is the fact that she is not named after just one oldie but three whole entire different oldies, one being the late 60's or maybe early 70's hit by the monkeys, one being the 80's hit by Steve Winwood and one being the 2010's hit by Amy Winehouse. Also she got all the boyfriends and all the popularity the better personality, but I suppose she also got stuck with the epilepsy which I did not, so at least I have that going for me. But you know what? Despite the fact that she's 3 minutes older, I'm still the bossy one because I think she makes really shitty choices with her whole Yolo thing and it totally deserves to be called out on. And Brooke is making really shitty choices by ordering four drinks so why shouldn't she be called out on it? Besides Adam is just trying to make her as comfortable as she can be while suffering from Ehler Danlo's Syndrome and if she get's drunk and has a hangover she's going to have all kinds of hell to pay tomorrow morning. Brooke continues to go at it with Adam, \"besides It's only 4 drinks I can handle it\" \"Only four?\" Adam asks. Brooke just rolls her eyes clearly she doesn't want to hear it any of it, \"Please just get one\" Adam says, \"Please\" \"No\" She snaps, \"I'm getting four of them\" Adam leans in and keeps his voice low. \"Brooke listen.\" He says, \"Please not so loud, this is a fancy restaurant, and I'm not trying to boss you around\" From there he speaks in soft whispers so I can't really tell what he's saying, but I can sure tell what Brooke is saying because she shouts everything. For god's sake doesn't she realize she's supposed to be at a restaurant. \"Well you take Belsomra and you're having a drink tonight\" God damnit why must her voice be so god damn loud, and what a god damn innapporopriate thing to say, that is just not something you do. You don't just blurt out in a public place what medications someone else takes, which is another reason I am glad I only take ZZquill. I wouldn't mind if a restaurant full of people knew I took over the counter medication to help me sleep once in a while, lot's of people do, but you're just not supposed to talk about perscription medications in public, that is something you're supposed to be private about, right up their with religion or sex or even diseases. Speaking of I am so fucking annoyed with her that I would love to shout out in front of the whole restaurant \"Forgive her behavior she has Elher's Danlo's Syndrome\" I do not because despite what a lot of people may think of me, I'm really not THAT much of a bitch. Besides it's not like that's a super well known disease or anything it's not like people are going to automatically know what I'm talking about. Also it's really not my place to be telling people that. If anyone should be spilling beans about her Elher's Danlo's Syndrome it should be Mike or Adam. I don't really feel like I have any kind of relationship with Brooke, and now that she is showing her true colors I'm not sure If I want to know her that well. I feel really bad for poor Purity having to be in the middle of this, but she is doing her best, she rolls right over their whatissupposedtobeaprivateconversation and takes Mike's and my order. \"I'll get a Bloody Mary\" I say, I quickly turn to face Brooke, \"And I quite agree with Adam here, I think she should just get one or the other\" Brooke continues to look angry, \"No I'm getting all four\" Purity obviously doesn't want to get into this conflict so she just focus's on getting Mike's order. \"I'll get a whisky sour\" He says, \"And I think she should get a water\" \"Good lord\" She snaps, \"Stop treating me like a little kid, just because I'm ordering off the kid's menu doesn't mean I'm not an adult\" It's so cute and funny that she thinks that, that's why we're treating her like a little kid. \"All right fine\" Mike says \"She'll get a Chocolate Raspberry martini\" Brooke continues to pout. \"Wasn't that your first choice?\" He asks, \"Sure\" She says \"Whatever\" \"And could we also get a kid's menu?\" Mike asks, \"Yeah sure of course\" Purity says, \"Don't you dare judge me\" Brooke snaps, bitterness falling from her lips. \"I'm just not hungry okay? Okay? OKAY!\" \"Okay\" Purity says helplessly then scurries away like a frightened rabbit. \"MY God Brooke what's the matter with you?\" I want to know, I mean really really want to know. \"She wasn't judging you, no one was judging you\" \"God damnit\" Brooke says, she then repeats it very loudly. \"Brooke hey\" I say, \"There are little kids here watch your language\" \"I'm just really fucking sorry\" She says her voice becoming teary. \"Hey it's okay\" I say, \"She's coming back, she's going to be our waitress all night you can apologize to her any time\" Just in the nick of time Purity is back with our drinks and Brooke's children's menu. \"What no crayons?\" Brooke asks critically. Purity looks confused. \"He'll'o\" Brooke says, \"I ordered the kids menu, don't I get crayons\" \"Oh\" Purity says, \"Did you want crayons, we don't usually give crayons with our menu but I'll see what I can do.\" What a fucking princess Brooke is. \"She's joking\" I say. More likely she's just being bitter but no need to say that. Purity ignores the whole crayon conversation. It's over. The crayons are never discussed again. Brooke appears dissasisfied at her drink. \"Where's the rest of my cocktails?\" she asks. \"You only ordered one remember?\" Mike asks. \"No\" She says, \"I specifically remember ordering four\" \"Yes but Brooke, you agreed on just one remember?\" Brooke stares at the table and pouts. \"Fine\" She says, \"But I'm getting a refill\" She takes one sip and tightly squeezes her fore head. \"You all right?\" I ask. Not that I especially care or anything, as I have said I don't think I like her or want to get to know her etc, but also as I've said earlier holy shit I'm starting to sound like a broken record, she's Adam's sister and I love Adam, so I've got to put up with this Brooke situation whether I like it or not. I'm sure Adam wasn't a huge fan of Vallarie either, but when two people love each other as much as Adam and I, you sometime's gotta do things that really suck. Brooke pushes her martini glass away from her. \"Are you all right?\" I ask again. Could she possibly be drunk already, oh man is it ever a good thing that she didn't try to drink four different drinks. \"Brooke what's wrong?\" I ask her. \"I feel funny\" She moans, \"Like drunk?\" I ask, \"Something like that\" She says and leaves it at that. She definitely seems drunk when Purity comes back. \"May I take your orders?\" She asks. Brooke at one point she falls out of her chair, when she is trying to reach for her menu, I guess what's happening is her perception is totally off because the menu is right in front of her and there was really no reason for her to fall off her chair, but she just didn't seem to get that it was right in front of her. \"Good heavens are you all right?\" Purity asks. Brooke appears utterly confused and embarassed and why shouldn't she? Adam helps her back into her chair. \"You okay sis?\" He asks. \"I don't really know how that happened\" She says. She is embarrassed again. \"Well\" Adam says, \"I hate to say I told you so but I told you so\" Brooke just stares at her lap, while Purity goes over the specials. \"The special for today is a mixed grill of red deer, Karabu and Antilope.\" \"Oh my god that just sounds delish, I know what I'm getting\" I say, Adam and Mike agree to take the same thing and I'm glad I saved so many teaching bills to take us out for tonight. Brooke is still staring at her lap when Purity taps her on the shoulder. \"What would you like today\" She asks. \"Kids prime rib\" She says completely robotically. Poor un adventurous Brooke. She still is freakishly boring but at the same time she's the most interesting I've ever seen her ever.[Chapter 8] Chapter 8: Mike I have never seen anyone respond to a single sip of an alcoholic drink the way Brooke has responded right now. I mean I've seen plenty of light weights before, but Brooke seems to be in a class all of her own tonight I mean the alcohol just barely touched her lips and already she is so drunk that she doesn't know what is what. Here are you're orders. Purity says, \"Hey Puberty could I get a refill\" Brooke asks, Bernadette stifles a laugh and nearly chokes on her bloody Mary, \"Puberty\" She says, \"I'm sorry\" She apologizes (Duh I guess the very definition of apologizing IS saying your sorry) I'm not laughing though, I'm really not sure if that was even supposed to be funny or not, but I'm guessing probably not she's probably just drunk as a skunk which if you ask me is a horrible expression. That poor waitress probably get's that all the time any way. It's bad enough being stuck with a name like Purity when I'm pretty sure she want's to get laid just as much as anyone else does. \"No that's okay\" Purity says, \"I get that some times, it's one of the perks to having a name like Purity. Also between you four and me, I'm not a virgin by choice, I would love to have sex some time. Is it any fun\" \"That's way too much information\" Brooke slurs, \"Now get me a refill already\" \"What are you talking about?\" I ask her, \"You only took one sip of the one you have\" \"No I finished it\" She says, \"I finished it and I want another\" \"Brooke it's half full actually more then half full, like maybe four quarters full\" Bernadette says. Of course Brooke's not going to see it that way, she's always been a half empty type of person. Once her food is placed down in front of her she starts clumsily cutting the table. \"Brooke\" Adam says, \"What Adam?\" she slurs irritably. Adam grabs her hands and guides her to her plate. \"NO ADAM!\" Brooke snaps, repremending him like a puppy that just peed on the floor \"No, bad touch\" \"Sorry\" Adam says \"I uh, I mean, You were cutting the table did you realize that?\" \"Was not\" She says indignantly. She attempts to cut her meat again, but completely misses the meat somehow and somehow, somehow is back to cutting the table. \"Brooke here\" Adam says \"let me help you.\" He then takes his knife and fork and begins preparing to cut her meat, well actually cutting it, he does make one pretty damn good cut through the center of her prime rib. \"NO!\" Brooke howls. She is practically in tears. \"Don't you dare cut my meat Adam\" She says forcefully, \"You hear me, don't lay a finger on my roast meat\" \"I was just trying to\" he starts to say, She then stares down at her prime rib and there go the water works. \"Brooke? Hey? Are you okay?\" Adam asks. \"Oh Adam look what you've gone and done\" She sobs. \"You slashed my roast beef you asshole\" It is true there is a big slash mark on her prime rib, but not a big obvious one it's still edible for god's sake. \"You ruined my meal Adam\" \"God damnit\" Adam snaps, and I really didn't know the kid had it in him, but I really do have to say Kudos, when I first met the kid he couldn't stand up to himself at all, and I'll admit he's always had trouble standing up to Brooke because Brooke is just a god damn tough person to stand up to. \"I did not ruin it it's fine\" Adam snaps, \"It still tastes the same god damnit\" \"Adam\" She snaps, \"You listen to me and you listen to me good I'm the older one, I am two friggin years older then you. I should be cutting YOUR meat\" She then takes it a level further by leaning over and attempting to help Adam cut his mixed grill. Key word attempting She is making failed attempts with it by the by and continuing to make huge obvious marks in the table. \"Brooke?\" Adam says all exasperated. \"What?\" She snaps in a drunken rage. \"What are you doing? I mean seriously what the fuck are you doing?\" \"Just trying to be a good big sister\" Adam face palms \"Brooke good lord\" He says in a low whisper. \"Stop it. For Heaven's sake just stop it. You're embarrassing everyone. Please don't make a scene okay. You're being 100% ridiculous okay? I was just trying to help.\" \"Well don't\" She snaps \"I got it.\" She continues carving her knife and fork into the table. \"Well I got it too. Obviously It has nothing to do with birth order Brookie,\" She doesn't seem to like being called Brookie too much at least I'm assuming that's what she is pouting about all though it very well may have to do with other things. \"It has to do with the fact that your cutting into the table I'm not the one making cuts at the table.\" He says evenly cutting into his own piece of (I can't really tell them apart) and taking a big juicy bite. \"Here Brooke\" Bernadette says, \"Let me help you\" I guess she thinks that it's just Adam she has a problem with apparently she's wrong \"Well you definitelly have no right to go anywhere near my meat\" Brooke snaps and I'll tell you something she is one seriously scary drunk. \"Sorry\" Bernadette says, \"I just thought you'd want to eat tonight, I guess I'm wrong\" \"Just shut up\" Brooke says folding her arms across her chest. \"Of course I want to eat, isn't that why I ordered?\" She continues making cuts at the table, \"Brooke you're going to leave perminant knife marks in the table\" I tell her. Surprisingly she actually let's me cut her roast meat without making any kind of fuss. It's really pretty arbitrary if you ask me. I know it's going to be something I'm going to have to deal with when she suffers from the degenerative eye problems that I have read about on her list of symptoms that are very slowly causing her to go blind. She even allows me feed her like she is 0 years old which really surprisises me, but I suppose she trusts me because I am her boyfriend, and Adam is just her annoying little brother and Bernadette a practical stranger who she doesn't even like. I am sure people are staring at us and pointing, but we really don't have anything left to lose because as far as I know people were already god damn staring and pointing at us it's not like we're ever going to come here again for any reason in any context. As I see it this is just the icing on the cake, the red roses decorated on the white canvas of the god damn fucking cake. And if she's going to act like a baby then she should be god damn treated like one. She has a lot of trouble getting the food into her mouth and bites down on the fork. \"OW!\" She cries. \"I'm so sorry sweetie\" I say, \"Are you all right?\" \"Ow ow ow\" she moans clenching her jaw. She then choses (Well I guess choses is a bad choice of words for this) to have one of her catapletic seizures. I'm not sure if it's from biting on the metal fork or if it's from the one sip she took of her cocktail or if it's just part of her illness either way she is gone and I can't seem to get her back. I try to remember what Adam had said earlier that she doesn't exactly go anywhere during her seizures, she is their the whole time, but one look in her eyes I can tell that she is most certainly more gone than Adam thinks she is. Her eyes appear dead and glassy like she is having two different kinds of seizures at once. A young child who I'm not sure is male or female comes up to Brooke (Not that it really matters, the last thing I should be thinking about right now is the sexual identity of this child after all) His family has just gotten their bill and are just leaving the restaurant. \"Mrs. Lady Mrs. Lady Mrs. Lady\" He says waving his hand in front of her face, (Getting a little too close for comfort if you ask me) \"Are you all right Mrs. Lady\" \"Now Pillow\" (Pillow. That name can totally go either way, not that that is a name, I guess it isn't not a name after all apparently Adam has a kid in his class named Water bottle which also could very well be either male or female, that just makes it all the more confusing.) His father says, \"You know better than that, instead of saying Mrs. Lady you know very well that she has a name ask her what it is\" \"Brooke her name's Brooke\" I say since she is clearly unable to answer in the state that she is in right now. \"Are you all right Brooke?\" Pillow asks, she still does not come out of the state she is in. \"She can't answer you god damnit, er I mean gosh darn it\" I find myself snapping and really don't mean to snap at such a young boy or girl or child or whatever Pillow is, I'm pretty sure It is ambigous which is perfectly cool, I don't have a problem with that at all. What I do have a problem is, is Pillow its self. \"And no\" I continue \"She's not all right she has Elher Danlo Syndrome\" \"What's that?\" The child asks in horror, where are his parents anyway right now, why aren't they putting a stop to this. Since they are not there at the present moment to give me a piece of my mind. I go way too far I have scared the poor kid with my too much information about Brooke's disease. Every single detail about her disease as a matter a fact. I finish off the whole thing with a big fat \"Boo Child!\" I watch the kid dissolve into tears. \"Mommy\" he cries and the mother shows up instantly, \"That man scared me mommy, he yelled at me and he swore and he talked about a scary diseases his girl friend had and he finished it off with Boo Child.\" \"You had no right to do this to my child\" \"Well he wasn't leaving my girlfriend alone\" I say, \"Well for your information, Pillow here was watching your table the whole entire time and was really concerned.\" So the kid had seen everything just great including her order 4 different cocktails and shout at Adam and get butt hurt about not getting crayons and get epically drunk from one sip of one cocktail and try to cut to table and bawl hysterically when her meat was cut and bite the fork when I tried to feed her and most importantly the poor kid saw her go into a seizure. \"Well I was just telling the child what was going on\" I tell him, \"Now Pillow's a little more caught up with the world. Your welcome\" I just can not stop myself from being a fucking asshole an I hate myself for that. I am not being fair to Brooke right now. \"Pillow is a very fearful young child\" it's mother says. \"Thanks a whole lot giving him something new to be scared of.\" \"I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to upset your son, er daughter? Seriously which is it\" God damnit shut the fuck up Mike you fucking asshole I keep saying to myself, but I can't stop shutting up nor can I stop being a fucking asshole. \"I'm a child\" Pillow says shakily. \"Oh\" I say and clear my throat, \"I uh I didn't mean to upset your child, he or she or uh Pillow was obviously already really upset about this whole thing\" Pillows mom nods. Pillow's Dad then comes back from where ever he went. \"Daddy\" Pillow says and burries his face in his legs. Seriously what a little brat and also what a little wuss how old is it like eleven? It should be able to handle all that, but I guess on the other hand it's eleven. Now I feel guilty as shit. \"I'm so sorry kid\" I say. \"Come on Pillow\" The father says, \"Let's get out of here\" \"God Mike what the hell?\" Bernadette says, \"You're supposed to watch how you talk to kids you're supposed to watch what you talk about with them. I should know I do work with kids. Oh wait my bad\" She blinks her eyes several times after that quick \"my bad\" \"You wouldn't know how to talk appropriately with kids, because they don't teach you how to work with kids when your a stripper\" Slice. Just slice. A Big slice of that fucking cake with those fucking roses that were the icing which I referred to earlier. If having too spoon feed (Fork feed her rather, because could you imagine trying to eat prime rib with a spoon?) Brooke in front of all those people was the roses, then this whole Pillow situation is the white icing on the sides of the cake, or maybe even the finishing gel on the cake. \"Slice\" That's all I can think of to say right now but I don't say it, I don't even feel like giving her the saticfaction that she hurt my feelings. Brooke comes back from her seizure and begins choking on her roast, coughing forcfully with her singular Pneumonia damamged lung, but fortunately that's taking the attention off of me, how could I say that I'm such a selfish asshole? \"Brooke? You okay?\" I ask her. pounding her really hard on the back which is somehow only seeming to make it worse \"Sweetie are you choking?\" Bernadette asks. \"You don't have to worry any longer I know CPR and I am damn qualified.\" I know she is probably still trying to make show me up about stripper but I'm not sure how, I just have the feeling that's where it's going. Stripper's do need to know CPR btw, for example when Adam overdosed on Heroin with that crazy bitch Norah, I felt lucky I was certified \"Hang in their Brooke\" Bernadette says. \"Careful Detty\" Adam says, \"She's much, much littler then you, try not to crush her\" One thing Bernadette hates more then anything is being called Detty, but I suppose this is a life or death situation so she overlooks it. Brooke is able to cough up the piece of meat that got stuck in her throat. \"You all right babe?\" I ask. She coughs up a storm and then disolves into tears. \"No Mike\" She cries, \"No I'm not\" \"I've never been so embarrassed in my life, why did you have to go and tell that complete stranger about my disease\" She sobs and sobs and sobs and sobs, at the rate she's going I don't think she's ever going to stop sobbing. \"I hate to say this Brooke, but the only reason I did that was because you brought that on yourself, I realize that I embarrassed you and I'm sorry, but you have to realize that you embarrassed me first. I mean why did you agree to come to the restaurant in the first place. You had every chance in the world to say no.\" Now that is what you'd call a backhanded apology I know I shouldn't be so hard on her when she's already down but agreeing to go to the restaurant when she clearly wasn't feeling well was a stupid ass move on her part \"I'm sorry\" She says pitifully \"Please don't yell at me\" \"I'm not yelling\" I say curtly and just leave it at that. My former girlfriend Joanna has a private practice in psychology I decide that if Brooke is going to see a therapist it would be best to set her up with someone I am well connected with then to search the internet and phone books for therapists. When we get home Brooke and I hardly speak a word to each other we can't even be in the same room as each other which is fine by me. We are very much angry at each other While Brooke is in the bedroom I decide to make the call even if it makes me feel like a total sleaze ball. I still have Joanna's number in my phone. Why I haven't gotten rid of it is a mystery to me. \"Joanna hey\" I say, \"It's me Mike\" \"Mike?\" Joanna asks, \"What's going on Are you okay?\" \"No\" I say, \"I'm not. Joanna listen this is going to sound really weird but I have a favor to ask you but I don't know if you're going to be able to do it for me because it might break the rule of therephist/client confidentiality\" \"Mike just tell me what's going on\" She says, \"It's 1:00\" \"Yeah\" I say \"But it's 1:00, that's hardly late\" when Joanna and I were together we used to stay up till 4:00 in the morning. \"Mike I have a job and a schedual now and yes this is late for me now. What's this about\" \"Brooke's been diagnosed with a chronic disease and she really needs someone to talk to, she's really having a hard time\" I can somehow hear Joanna nod her head on the phone it is a very distinct sound, I don't have super hearing or anything special like that, I can just tell. \"Let me explain the rules\" She says, \"If you wanted me to give you therapy I would have to say no because I'm not allowed to take clients who I have had long connections with, but since I only met Brooke one time and I didn't really get a good sense of who she was then, it won't be too much of a problem as long as things stay confidential in my office. Damn I think to myself why does everyone keep saying that about how they never get a sense of who Brooke is, is it really that hard to figure out You on the other hand if you're looking for a therapist then you're going to need to go find another therapist if you need some one to talk to.\" \"What makes you think I need a therapist?\" \"Really?\" I ask, which I realize as soon as I have said it that it is a pretty dumb question. \"Well I imagine this can't be easy for you Mike\" She says, \"Come on don't be so dumb\" \"I'm sorry\" I say, \"I'm just really been out of it lately with this whole Brooke thing but really? You don't think this is too awkward you know with our dating history and everything?\" \"As long as everything stays confidential and as long as you seek out another therapist then we're good\" She says, \"So can you make an appointment?\" \"I don't know Mike\" Joanna says, \"It's 1:00 in the morning and that is very, very very last minute\" \"Please, Joanna please\" I beg. I really wish I could see her, it sucks that I have to find another therapist but I guess it would be totally awkward to be seeing a therapist who I had sexual intercourse with I'm sure everyone in the world knows that that is innappropriate. \"Okay Mike\" She says, \"I don't usually do this, but since you sound really desperate then I'll check my calendar and see when I can meet with her\" \"You'd do that for me?\" I ask, \"I have Wednesday at 3:00 available\" She says, \"How would that do?\" \"Good\" I say hastily. I feel like a fucking dick for going behind Brooke's back like that and setting up an appointment for her with Joanna none the less. When I get into bed Brooke is tossing in turning clearly she is not able to sleep at all. \"You all right Babe?\" I ask, \"Can't sleep\" She says. \"Would you like one of my methedones, \"Sure\" She says \"I'd like that, I place a white rectangular pill in her hand and watch her swallow it with a glass of water, \"Mike\" placing the glass next to the bed stand \"I feel really terrible about how I acted at dinner tonight I'm really sorry\" \"Hey it's okay\" I say, \"Water under the bridge\" \"It's getting really bad Mike\" She moans, \"Really really bad\" Her eyes are swimming as she says this, \"I've never had a seizure that's lasted so long I'm so scared\" She sounds so vulnerable and shaky that it scares me to death. \"You need to talk to someone don't you?\" I ask. \"What are you saying?\" She asks. I clear my throat a couple of times as we sit side by side in the dark room. \"Mike?\" She asks. \"Don't be mad\" I say, \"About what?\" She asks, \"Well It was really stupid of me, but I kind of took the liberty of setting you up with a therapist\" Now she sits up in bed. I can see her shadow hunched up in an angry position. She's angry all right. \"You did what?\" She says these words in slow motion and the way she says it there is a bit of an eerieness to the whole thing. \"I said that I set up an appointment for you\" She lets out a single snorting/sobbing sound \"Mike\" She says wiping her eyes, \"I don't know if you realize this, but telling someone they need to see a therapist is a downright mean thing to say it's like saying I'm doing really badly\" \"Well we both know that you're not at your best\" Mike says\" \" It was downright mean of you to just go and make that god damn appointment. Shit Mike\" she says turning around \"Brooke sweetie\" I say, \"You're miserable, you really need someone to talk to\" Brooke makes that noise again that snort/sob hybrid of a noise \"Mike why can't I talk to you about this?\" She asks. \"Are you saying that you aren't listening to me\" \"Well Brooke\" I say, \"I'm just going to come out and say it, you're not doing well and you need a therapist\" Brooke lays back down in bed \"You okay sweetie?\" I ask because I can't tell whether or not she's angry or not. \"When's the appointment?\" She asks. /span/p[Chapter 9] Chapter 9: Brooke I can't believe I let Mike talk me into seeing a therapist but, I most definitely caved in and that is the reason that I am sitting in the front seat of Mike's van as we drive in silence to where ever we're going, I haven't asked any questions which I realize is kind of stupid. \"I was going to turn on some music\" Mike says \"Do you want the oldies station?\" It is sadly the first time said much of anything to each other on this car ride that is. I make no kind of response \" Listen Brooke\" He says, \"Just give this one session a try, if you seriously hate it then you never have to go back okay?\" \"Fine\" I say folding my arms across my chest, we are completely silent the rest of the way until we pull up in front of a brick cul du sacs \"Hey\" Mike says to the receptionist, \"This is Brooke she's here to see Joanna Sinclair\" Now that changes everything my therapist the person who I'm going to be having to talk to for a half an hour is Mike's ex girl friend. Is this his idea of a god damn fucking sick joke? I turn to face Mike with my eyes formed into slits. \"Brooke you okay?\" He asks even though I am making it pretty darn clear that I am not okay. I grab him by the arm with a firm grip and believe me, I have a really firm grip. \"Why would you do this to me?\" I ask, he smiles sideways he looks like he is really in for big trouble which he really is \"It's bad enough that you just went and made an appointment for me behind my back, but with your ex GIRLFRIEND Mike?\" \"Brooke\" He says putting his arms firmly on my shoulders \"Keep it down all right\" \"Why?\" I hiss, \"This is a god damn fucking private practice besides no one's in this god damn fucking waiting room\" Mike holds his hand out. \"Brooke I get it your pissed\" He says, \"Yeah\" I hiss, \"I'm pissed, and why shouldn't I be? You couldn't have even bothered to go through the dignity of finding me a new therapist, you had to go and give me a fucking leftover therapist, who wasn't even your therapist but your fucking friend with benifits\" \"Brooke\" Mike pleads with me, \"These walls are very thin she can hear what you're saying\" I don't really see what the big deal, isn't that what therapy's all about anyway saying what's on your mind? Getting all your feelings out. Why should it matter if it's in her office or if it's in the waiting room. Therapists aren't supposed to get mad at you for expressing your feelings at least they never have before, I should know having been through a long line of therapists dating way back since 5th grade. Joanna steps out of her office, she is very well dressed and is wearing make up, the last time I had seen her she was wearing a bakini and tevas and I hardly recognize her out of context. \"Brooke Kennedy\" She says holding out her hand, I guess she hasn't heard my little outburst I just had, or if she had heard it she sure isn't saying anything about it. I follow Joanna down the hall into her office is, the first thing I notice is how busy the office is, it's almost chaotic it seems to be split into two major cultural identities although I'm not sure what the cultures are all I can tell you about the room is that there is definitely some cultural fusion/confusion going on, maybe something kind of east Asian meets old time western Euoropean would be my best guest. I suppose she has a little bit of jewish blood in her seeing there a couple of dreidel on one of her counter tops. I hope she doesn't expect us to play a game of dreidel ever. The therapist I had dating back from way back when I was a little kid liked to play games with me, board games aka boring games really they weren't as much boring as they were uncomfortable now that I think about it. One of her games involved making up stories with background cards and little cut out people, how it was suppose to help me in therapy is beyond me, now that I think about it I think maybe the therapist was having me play the game based on my best interest because what kid doesn't love to play? I was an odd kid, because I always felt really awkward playing that game and got tearful when it got frustrating. I had thought that therapists were supposed to help you feel better, but forcing me to play that game every session and make up stories just made me feel worse about myself it made me feel incabable and inadaquate and what the fuck kind of 11 year old would feel incabable and inadaquate whilst they are at play. I'll tell you a very unhappy one. I'l tell you something else That therapist in general made me feel worse about myself I didn't stop to think that their was something wrong with the therapist however I thought their was something wrong with me, only someone with big problems failed therapy. My school therapist who I saw way back in Elementary school was somewhat better, but that wasn't really saying that much. He was also really big on \"Therapy games\" he had me play a game that was titled the \"Un game\" and I kid you not and that was exactly what it was an \"Un game\" it looked like a typical board game but their was nothing game like about it. No one won or lost at the un game, you were just supposed to roll the dice or draw cards and move your piece and answer questions about how you were feeling and all that good stuff. I look around the room, Joanna does have a shelf full of games but my eyes become more attracted somehow to her ultra heavily stacked bookshelf (Ultra crowded I might say, jam packed as a matter a fact) it also appears to be a huge melting pot from everything to the classic teachings of Frued and Erickson which I'm sure you can find in just about any therapy office to some outlandish Asian psychogists who's names I've never heard of before in my life. She has all the classics you'd expect to find in every therapists office including the most updated DSM and every other version for that matter, but also some books about Ancient Japanese and other Eastern Asian practice's of Psychology. The last tharapist who I saw in College litterally only had a couple of paintings on the walls and that was pretty much it, as anyone may have guessed it was very under stimulating and even the waiting room had way more personality, but hell Joanna's office is way too over stimulating We sit across from each other on opposite couches which is just like every other therapist I've ever been to. \"So Brooke\" She says, \"How are you feeling today?\" also no different then other therapists. I am the only one who realizes that there is a huge difference between this therapist and all my other therapists, and that is the fact that none of my other therapists fucked my current boyfriend. Oh god I just can't get passed that. I just stare at the ground and shrug, this is terribly awkward and she is not going to make me talk but I realize that I am going to be in here for a half an hour so I figure I might as well say something, \"You uh, you have a lot of stuff\" I find myself saying, \"Yeah\" She agree's, \"I kind of over did it with the decorating my first day\" She says, \"The thing is I wanted to educate my clients a little bit about my cultural background, that's one thing I've learned at my school of therapy, that you as the therapist are supposed to make yourself presentable to the client. In a lot of those old school therapy classes it is learned that it's all about the client and that the therapist should be as dull as dirt and all that but that's just crap.\" I guess all my previous therapists have been coming from that school of thought. Joanna keeps going on. \"but anyway a little bit more on the decor, with having two backgrounds? It kind of turned out to look like one big mess didn't it? Fortunately it's a big office and their's a lot of room for all this stuff\" She doesn't give me a chance to respond she keeps speaking as if this is her therapy session and not mine, which is fine by me, I guess in new school therapy it's we're equal partners, \"my Father's a first generation Japanese and my mothers a second generation Polish Jew.\" She says as she sips something out of a clay mug. I've never heard anyone so proudly embrace their heritage as Joanna has right now. \"Really that's nice\" I say, the thing is I'm starting to realize that their is a strong stench in the room and I am not sure why I didn't it was there. I gag and before I know it I vomit all over the rug. \"Oh no are you all right?\" Joanna asks, \"Oh sweetie you threw up apricots are you all right?\" How she knows that it is apricots is completely beyond me, maybe she's some sort of a psychic what a pointless psychic ability if she was, being able to detect what people threw up if I were her I'd want a different ability. No reason for her to remind me of what I threw up. Mike thought I needed more vitamin's in my diet so he gave me a tiny portion of his mothers canned apricots to go along with my usual very tiny portion of grape nuts this morning. The funny thing is I can stand eating grape nuts but when Mike eats them the sound just makes me increasingly irritable and a bit nauseated. The canned apricots were a different story I can't stand those in any situation, I love Maya to death and everything, she is the mother I wished I never had and I would love more than anything then to trade her in for Olivia but to tell you the truth she goes a little crazy and get's a little bit obsessive with her canning during the fall, every fall for that matter she is a retired secretary at an office and has a lot of time on her hands and that is the way she spends a lot of it by canning canning and more canning and no offense to her but most of it's pretty damn terrible. And for gods sake just because she's a health nut doesn't mean she has to completely leave out all the sugar to her canned goods, it tastes even more sour and tart coming back up then going down. \"I'm sorry\" I say, \"I just gagged a little bit you just have a really strong smell\" \"Oh I'm sorry\" Joanna says, \"I've got some heavy pretty heavy duty lavender action going on in here we can open the windows if you want.\" \"Thanks\" I say trying really really hard not to gag and I surpirise myself by not gagging?\" not vomiting at the very least because I most definitely gag. \"Is that a little better\" I'll tell you what my last patient, I'm not going to give you any names or anything as that is breaking the rules of confidentiality but he is really high strung and anxious all the time and lavender works as a natural sedative for him, it's the only way he can function in my office\" \"Right\" I say, \"I'm sorry\" She says again, \"I guess not everyone like's lavender I guess it's just one of those things that you either really like or you really hate, be honest with me is it any better for you now, because if it's not I could turn on a fan for you\" I can't fathom the idea of cool air in this room, I'm already freezing and I am wearing a sweater which is starting to feel increasingly itchy by the second even though it is hot out like always after all it is Tampa Florida and all that. \"Maybe a little bit of soup will help you feel better\" She says pointing to her clay mug. \"Chicken noodle?\" I ask because as a doctor I have discovered that their is no medical evidence that chicken noodle soup actually cures stomach ailments or even makes them any better it's probably all just a lame old wives tale if you ask me, and their's definintly been no medical evidence of it curing Elher's Danlo's Syndrome \"This?\" She asks \"No\" \"This is Ox tendon broth with ginger is supposed to be really good for you, it's their special at the local food co op this week\" she says, just hearing the words tendon makes me feel like gagging all over again, I'll let this one go because she doesn't know that I suffer from painful tendons the much bigger problem which I'm sure Mike did not go into so many details about if he told her about it at all which he very well may not have, but any way offering this soup with tendon as an ingrediant is pretty much the opposite of something you'd want to do for someone with Elher's Danlo's Syndrome. I cover my mouth trying really really hard not to vomit any more apricots not that I have anymore apricots left to vomit, maybe a little bit of stomach acid and a couple bites of grape nuts. \"Are you okay?\" Joanna asks, \"Because if you're going to throw up again I'd rather you don't do it on the floor again, no offense or anything but can I offer you a bucket\" I do throw up a little bit in my mouth but I swallow it and man is it disgusting, I swear it just burned a couple holes one in my throat and one in my esophogus. \"No I'm okay\" I lie, \"my gag reflex's are just really sensitive and just the mention of the word tendons kind of really sets it off since they've been really hurting along with everything else in my body. \"I'm so sorry\" Joanna says, \"That was horribly insensitive of me. Is there anything else I can get you chamomile tea or anything?\" \"Sedatives\" I say, it just pops out of my mouth clearly I am not thinking it through. Joanna raises one eyebrow at me. \"I'm sorry\" She says, \"But that's one thing we're not allowed to do in this office\" \"Really you don't have any marijuana Joanna\" Joanna smirks through sips of that awful tendon broth. \"Ha I see what you did there\" She says setting down her mug. Now she has got me. \"Huh?\" I ask, \"I'm sorry\" She says, \"You know Mary Joanna Marijuana, the old street name?\" That certainly was not what I was thinking, I was thinking that with my condition I should have been given medical marijuana, I would definitely qualify for it I should definitely be taking it by now so why aren't I? \"I'm sorry\" she says, \"I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself I'm being obscure, but I'm sorry I can't give my patients sedatives in this office\" \"But what about your last patient?\" I ask, \"You said you gave him sedatives\" \"You mean the lavander?\" She asks, \"Because natural sedatives don't count as sedatives they don't like completely control you're mind or knock you out or put you in an altered state, they just make certain people feel more relaxed, but as I found out with you not all people like the scent of lavander\" \"What time is it?\" I ask, \"11:00\" Joanna says, \"We still have half an hour to go\" That actually seems like a really long time. \"What am I supposed to do for that long?\" I ask, \"Well\" Joanna says folding her hands in her lap, \"You could start by telling me why you think you're here\" I scowl hard. \"Because stupid Mike went behind my back and scheduled the appointment to punish me to trick me to make me feel like a bad person\" \"Do you feel punished?\" She asked. I nod my head melodramtically. \"Do you want to talk about that?\" She asks. \"I'm stuck getting therapy from my current boyfriends ex girl friend who pretty much objectified me last time we saw each other I usually don't like blondes but this one's cute how is that not punishment?\" \"So it bothers you that I am Mike's ex girlfriend?\" She asks, \"How could that not bother me, it's awkward and I had no say in it at all, It's pretty much the whole story of my life I've always been dragged to therapists without having any say in the matter\" Joanna continually jots down on her note pad. \"I just don't think we can ever get passed that\" I say, \"Okay\" Joanna says. \"You know something?\" Joanna asks, \"I know Mike just as well as you do, and I don't think he did this to embarrass you or to trick you\" \"I don't think you do know him very well\" I say folding my arms across my chest, \"Why would he punish you?\" She asks, \"Because I was bad\" I say hatred dripping off my lips. Joanna continues to jot stuff down on her notepad. \"Why do you say that?\" She asks. \"Mike said that you were sick you were diagnosed with something, I really don't understand why that's you're fault or why you should be punished.\" I stare down at the floor for a while and am silent. \"I just feel like I failed somehow\" I say tears flowing my vision. Again I hadn't meant to say it, it just slipped out, \"What do you mean?\" Joanna asked. \"I don't really want to talk about it\" I say staring out the window. I turn my attention to the Japanese magnets on the table next to me. \"Do you feel like a bad person?\" Joanna asks. I sure as hell hope she doesn't expect an answer to that question because I really don't feel like giving her one. She is still Mikes ex girlfriend and nothing can erase that fact. \"My own mother is dissapointed in me\" I say in a stiff robotic voice. \"Do you think so?\" Joanna asks, \"Think so?\" I ask \"I know so I'm not what she wanted, I'm not happy enough for her and now that I'm sick I feel like I really let her down and I'm too ashamed to even tell her. The only times she ever appreciated me were the rare times when I was happy or pretending to be happy, she couldn't accept that I was for the most part a miserable human being and by the way not that you asked or anything but I don't want to talk about my condition\" \"That's okay\" She says, \"You don't have to talk about it until you're ready to\" At this rate I don't think I'm ever going to be ready to talk about it, not with her any way. \"So you think you're unhappy?\" Joanna asks. I nod. \"Why do you think that is?\" Is she really that dense, I'm fucking sick I might even be fucking dying \"I mean everyone has their moments of unhappiness and I understand that your life wasn't that easy but why do you describe yourself as a miserable human being?\" \"Because I am, I'm so fucked up. \"Have you ever\" Joanna says this next part really carefully \"thought about suicide\" \"Woah\" I say \"That's way too personal, it's none of your business\" \"Actually\" She says, \"No it's really not because it's my job as your therapist to make sure you're safe and when your saying all these negative things about yourself then it kind of is my buisiness\" There were a couple incidences with over dosing on pills but to tell the honest to god truth I wasn't thinking about suicide either times I hadn't meant to kill myself. \"I overdosed on my roommates valium second semester college\" I say, \"I'll never forgive myself, it was a horrible thing to do, I can't believe Genica and I are still best friends after that, I wouldn't be best friends with me\" \"Were you trying to kill yourself?\" Joanna asks. I stare at the wall and blink back tears. \"I just wanted it to stop\" I say, \"What?\" Joanna asks, \"You know I say, the pain\" I am not about to admit that their were some moments where I would self harm as in slit my wrists, but I was not your average slitter believe it or not, I mean I seem exactly like the type of person who would slit, Freshman year especially I was basically the walking stereotype of a slitter as a matter a fact (Well maybe not the walking stereotype, since I don't dye my hair black or where black eye shadow or heavy chains or even write dark poetry nor could I see myself doing any of those things ever I'm not goth by any sense of the imagination not in any universe or reality or twisted dimension but you get the picture I'm definitely a definition of a slitter if not THE definition of a slitter) but my reasoning was not the reasoning of an average slitter. The reason I slit was because I was stupid enough to believe that somehow if I slit my wrists the catapletic states would come less frequently or not at all. I don't need her to know that I was a wrist slitter she already thinks I am messed up enough as it is especially with the logic I had for being a wrist slitter, I realize now that I was not depressed freshman year, depressed would be putting it way too mildly I was certifiably psychotic that's what I was. I guess it was the same with the pills. When I took morphine during my knee injury I never had attacks not ever they dissappeared with the effects of the drug. \"I had seizures\" I find myself telling Joanna, even though I had told her I didn't want to talk about my condition. \"And they were really painful and I wanted them to end\" \"I can understand that\" She says, \"Seizure disorders are very painful\" \"These weren't typical seizures\" I find myself saying, I am surprised about how much I am opening up to Joanna when that is the last thing I want to do, I would go into cataplectic states sometimes for like hours and the only time's I didn't was when I was heavily sedated\" I now know that there is no medical connection between the two things but when I was high on Morphine they miraculously stopped happening to me and it was great Flashback 10 years ago \"I'm going to Chi Alpha\" Genica says, it is 2nd Semester and the first time she has left me alone in the room to go to extra curricular activities that is since she saw me have a seizure before Thanksgiving Break, she doesn't even go to class any more. It's not that she completely stopped going to class like me, she's one who can't stand watching her grades slip, just the opposite of me that way just from that day forward all of her classes have been done online and even then she's been keeping a sharp eye. I guess eventually she started to get cabin fever after a while and couldn't stand to be around only me all day every day and who could blame her? She had been an active member of Chi Alpha before well you know before what and used to go every thursday and to pretty much every event. She probably can't wait to see all her annoying goody goody Christain friends again. \"Are you going to be okay here on your own?\" She asks. \"Yeah\" I say \"You should go, you'll have fun\" I don't think she's capable of having fun anymore not with that constant chip on her shoulder I feel bad that I put so much pressure on her as her roommate I shouldn't have that much power. \"All right then I'm off\" She says. I know for a fact that Genica has stored Valium in her top drawer and I am dying to get my hands on it, I haven't felt so happy since the morphine and the doctors won't give me any refills because they found out the reason why they were disappearing so fast was because I was overdosing. Valium is also a heavy sedative, I want that feeling back I want one more night free of cataplexy is that too much too ask? And I realize that I am just tiptoes away from Genica's top drawer. I know that this is a horrible thing to do and that Genica is never going to forgive me if she finds out but I'm only going to take one she won't know a difference. My hand shakes like crazy as I grab the nob of her top drawer, sure enough their are the pills, she had just recently gotten a refill when she got back after break and the large bottle is filled to the top with the pink round pills. My hand won't stop shaking as I grab the bottle. My brain keeps telling me that I am being bad but my hand will not listen, It begins unscrewing the top once I get it unscrewed my other hand, the one that is holding the bottle of pills becomes so wet and sweaty that the bottle drops to the floor and next thing I know the whole bottle of pink pills is scattered across the linoleum. \"Shit\" I say to myself, \"Shit shit shit\" I take scoop the pills into a handful my brain tells my hands to put them back in the bottle but once again my hands aren't listening and they place a whopping handful into my mouth thankfully not all the pills but definitely enough for Genica to notice that their are a ton that have gone missing. \"Oh shit oh shit oh shit\" I think to myself. I guess I could spit them back into the bottle but then she'd definitely notice. I find myself walking towards the sink where I fill up a tall glass with water. \"Bad girl\" I think to myself to the sounds of the faucet dripping, \"Bad girl bad girl bad girl\" I then start drinking gulps of water \"Bad girl bad girl bad girl bad girl\" I think with the swallows, I realize I should probably go to the rest room and spit the pills out only to realize that they are gone, to my horror I have swallowed them down with the gulps of water, how could I not have realized, they're not supposed to kick in for 20 minutes and already I'm not thinking straight. The same words continue to drum through my head, \"Bad girl bad girl bad girl bad girl\" I then realize that I need to get that drug out of me, I had only meant to take one. I head into the girls bathroom. I have never gagged and purged before but now I realize that might be the only way. I lock myself inside the stall and stick my finger down my throat and vomit unfortunately the pink pills do not come out, I guess because I haven't digested them yet. I let myself out of the stall wiping my mouth. \"Brooke are you okay?\" Liberty McKenna the RA who was also the the captain of my soccer team stands in front of the sink. I don't say anything I just rush out and back to my room. \"Bad girl bad girl bad girl\" I think to the rhythm of my feet moving down the hall. Before I know it 20 minutes has gone by and the drugs have taken over. I collapse not on my bed but on the chair across from the computer desk, \"Bad girl bad girl bad girl\" The thoughts continue to run into my head and turn in the mush. I hear the keys jangle and Genica let herself in. \"Fuckfuckfuck\" \"I just came back to get my purse\" Genica says, \"Oh my god Brooke are you okay?\" \"Huh?\" I ask, \"My god, I'm not going back to Chi Alpha after all and why is my top drawer open. \"I was borrowing soccccccckssss\" I slur\" \"Why?\" Genica asks quizingly not believing it at all but why should she it is a very poor excuse for a lie on so many levels for what reason would I have to borrow her socks when I am just going to bed and when I don't go any where any way. \"Brooke what's the matter with you?\" She asks \"Nothing\" I say, \"I'm just tired\" \"Here\" Genica says, \"Let me help you in to your bed\" She says. She then turns around, \"My socks are in the second drawer by the way\" She says, \"Not the top drawer\" Even with being in such a tranquil state I still know that I am busted and that any minute she is going to find me out, \"Oh okayyy\" I slur. Genica then takes out the bottle of pills, uh oh major ginormous fucking uh oh. \"Why is the lid to my valium off?\" She asks, did I really forget to screw back on the lid. It is amazing how much I can remember despite being totally stoned out of my mind, but I guess when I was taking loads of Morphine pills every day I don't know I kind of built up a tollarance for it which I guess explains why I am still awake. \"Damnit Brooke\" She snaps, \"Why is the lid to my vallium open and why are at least a quarter of them gone\" \"Ittt was likkke thaaat the eniter time I mean the entier time I mean the entire time\" I say. \"Damnit Brooke I just got my prescription refilled I had a whole bottle of them and why are you slurring?\" \"Nervous habit\" I say and break into a fit of nervous giggles to fit with my nervousness. \"Brooke what happened to my pills?\" Genica asks, \"Someone brokkkkkkke innnnnn and toooooook them\" I slur. Genica isn't seeming to buy a single word. \"No fucking shit someone god damn took them\" she says slamming her top dresser door shut I have never heard Genica swear before and honestly I have never seen her get this angry, I mean not to the point of swearing the girl is such a goody goody usually she can hold it together much better but I guess she's finally reach her breaking point and I'm to blame,. \"You did! You Bitch. There is no coincidence that you're slurring and your pupils are dialated and \" I stare at her guiltily. \"Look\" Genica says, \"Just go to bed your obviously stoned out of your mind, we will talk about this further tomorrow god damnit will we ever talk about this tomorrow\" I wake up from a dream only to realize that I am facing a nightmare. Genica stands beside the foot of my bed fully dressed. A scowl is planted upon her face which is so unusual for Genica usually she is in a cheerful chipper mood in the morning even before she's had her coffee not today today she's in a fowl mood. I turn around and face my clock and see that it is not actually morning it is actually to my horror 12:45. Not that I have to be anywhere or anything just usually I don't let myself sleep in that late. \"Brooke we need to talk\" She says her voice coming down like a black raincloud she means serious business, I hope she this isn't what I think it is about. I thought I had just dreamed this whole thing about taking all of her Valium. In fact I was planning on asking her to try to interpret my dream, she is a psychology Minor and is big on the whole idea of interpreting people's dreams as it is something she is learning about in a class all about dream interpretation. To my absolute horror she pulls the bottle of Valium pills from behind her back. My body breaks out into a cold sweat and a hot sweat. It wasn't a dream it really happened, it really fucking happened and now Genica and I will probably never speak to each other again ever. \"Yeah what about it?\" I ask, I don't know why I can't just apologize like a normal person, I don't know why I have to go and make the situation even worse. \"Last night remember?\" She asks. \"No\" I say \"I don't remember\" Genica face palms. \"What am I saying?\" She says, \"Of course you don't remember you took about a quarter of my valium of course you don't remember I only take one and a half pills every night and I get day time amnesia the next day god damnit.\" \"I'm sorry\" I say, \"I really have no memory of this at all\" \"Of course you don't\" Genica repeats, \"Because you took Valium god damnit my fucking Valium\" She places her hand on her forehead. \"God damnit Brooke\" She says again \"What am I going to tell my pharmisists when I come in to get refills\" Now she is really panicked I feel bad for her because I know what that's like with that whole morphine incident. \"Tell him your crazy roommate from hell stole it, tell them I'm like the roommate from Single White Female\" I say bitterly hoping she will get a laugh out of it, she doesn't. \"Damnit Brooke\" She says again. \"Don't you joke about it it's not funny\" \"You know\" I say changing the subject, \"This whole time I've known you I've never heard you swear\" Now Genica is in tears. \"I don't Brooke\" She says, \"I usually don't swear. But you know what? You've really pushed me to my limit\" Her voice is dripping with anger and tears. She turns around as if she doesn't want me to see her cry. As if I haven't seen her cry before. She cries at the drop of the hat and it's always I repeat always on my account, but I guess that's what happens when you have a roommate like me I imagine it can't possibly be easy for her. I'd say she's a bit overly attached, but I guess she's one of those people who expects that in college you're supposed to become best friends with your roommate, but I guess I ruined it for her. She is now sobbing really hard so hard her body is shaking. I try to comfort her by putting my hand on her shoulder. She sharply jerks away. \"I don't think we can ever be friends again\" She sobs. She turns around her face is covered with tears. \"I don't even think we can be roommates anymore, I trusted you!\" She gives me a slight push with both hands. \"I trusted you Brooke Kennedy. I asked if you were going to be okay on here on your own and you said you were\" She gives my bed a good kick. \"Fuck you\" You she says, \"You never swear\" I say again. \"And I don't fucking care anymore\" She sobs. \"I don't even fucking care you know why?\" \"Why?\" I ask, I too would like to have a good cry about this, but for some reason I can't, \"Because you're dead to me that's why\" She then grabs her bottle of Valium continues crying and slams the door. Present Tense \"Wow\" Joanna says \"That's quite the story\" \"Huh?\" I ask, I seriously did not notice that I had told that whole story out loud I thought I had just been thinking it in my head \"Brooke are you okay?\" She asks, \"Yeah why?\" I ask, \"I don't know\" She says, \"It just kind of seems a little bit unusual that you would not realize that you were speaking is that something that happens?\" \"Oh yeah, that's another kind of seizure\" I say \"Not that I want to talk about it or that that's any of your business or anything\" \"So you had an out of body experience?\" She asks, \"Something like that\" I say, \"Are you feeling all right?\" Joanna asks which I'm pretty sure she has already asked me. \"No not really\" I say, \"I feel like I told you way too much information and like I was saying before I don't want to get too close to you because you're Mike's ex girlfriend and that's awkward. \"Well like it or not you told me that\" \"I'm scared\" I say, \"I don't like it that I told you that with out knowing\" \"You know\" Joanna says, \"It might have not been a seizure sometimes people can't keep track of what they said inside their head vs what they said outside their head I wouldn't worry\" \"you wouldn't?\" I ask, \"Do you think you should be worried?\" Joanna asks \"Kind of\" I say, \"Why's that?\" Joanna asks. \"Why's that?\" I ask in complete dismay. \"Why do you think, I had a total out of body experience why shouldn't I be worried?\" \"Is that something that typically happens with your disease?\" \"I told you\" I say folding my hands tightly across my chest, \"I don't want to talk about my disease\" ","Summary":" Chapter 1 Brooke: Mike and I are about to engage in our evening sex, but tonight I am just not feel"},{"Movie":"Magic Mike","Title":"The Magic of the Night","Author":"MagicJen","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11028599","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"Alright, alright! Let's welcome to the stage the one, the only, the cock-rocking kings of Tampa!\" The stage lights come on, soaking the room in their blue-white glow. Mike walks to the centre of the stage, hat pulled down over his eyes. He drops to the ground, and the crowd gasps. Sweat slithers down his back as he pounds the floor with his fist. The screams grow so loud they become part of the air and he breathes them in. They are his oxygen, his sustenance. He jumps up, flexing and biting his lip. The others file in behind him, all scanning the crowd. One by one, they choose a woman from the audience. They all have their favourite types: the screamers; the grabbers; the shy ones who turn into screamers and grabbers. Mike is different, though. He's looking for something special. Some nights he thinks he has found it, but always there is something missing. Will he ever find her? The one? A redhead wearing a bridal veil is desperately trying to get his attention. She stands on her chair, screaming \"Pick me! Pick me!\". Mike is about to hold out his hand, when he glances at the chair beside the redhead. Sitting there, arms crossed over her chest, is a woman with long brown hair that is glowing from the stage lights. She is staring at the table, jaw clenched tight. He sees this all the time, of course‚Äîthe unimpressed bridesmaid forced to come to Club Xquisite by an overbearing bride. Mike can normally get them to at least crack a smile by the end of the night. But this woman‚Ä¶ this woman isn't like the ones he normally sees. She's pretty, though not beautiful‚Äîangular face and thick full lips‚Äîbut it's more than that. There's something going on within her, something captivating. Mike ignores the redhead and holds his hand out to the brunette. The redhead, fuming but still smiling, pushes her friend's shoulder. \"Go on, Abby!\" she screams. It is only then that Abby looks up, sees Mike holding out his hand. Their eyes lock, and a shiver shoots down his spine. He tries to calm himself‚Äîhe's felt this before, hasn't he? And hasn't it always gone wrong? Abby is shaking her head. Mike jumps down from the stage and walks up to her, holding out his hand again. \"Dance with me,\" he says. He can see her mind working behind her blue eyes. His smile broadens. Abby takes his hand and he pulls her onto the stage. The stage lights are bright in Abby's eyes. She tries to shield them, but he has hold of both of her hands. What did the announcer call him? Magic Mike? Abby's stomach burns. Mike pulls her towards an empty chair on the stage. \"Sit down, Abby,\" he whispers in her ear. Abby sits‚Äîor tries to. She is so focused on Mike's green eyes that she misses the chair and falls onto the stage. She hears laughter from the audience and for a few seconds she is frozen, unable to get up. Then Mike is beside her. \"Are you alright?\" he says. \"I'm fine,\" Abby says. \"I just want to go.\" \"Take my hand,\" Mike says. \"That's what got me into this mess.\" Abby starts walking to the edge of the stage, but Mike grabs her shoulder. \"Do you trust me?\" he says. Abby turns and stares into his eyes. She wants to say no‚Äîshe doesn't know him, knows nothing about him apart from that he's a stripper and the most handsome man she's ever seen in person. He could be a serial killer for all she knows. But‚Ä¶ there's something in his eyes, something that makes her feel safe with him. \"Do you trust me?\" Mike repeats. Abby nods and Mike smiles. \"Let's go,\" he says. He rushes her backstage, to a dingy dressing room. He stops to put on a shirt and shoes before leading Abby outside. He opens the door of a shiny black truck. \"Your chariot, my lady,\" he says. Despite herself, Abby laughs. As he closes the door, she knows she's in trouble. And for the first time since that night in Tallahassee, that night three years ago that changed everything, she doesn't feel like running away.[Chapter 2] Abby sits with her head pressed against the soft leather seat of the truck. She stares out the window as the lights of the city whip by in blurred streaks. She lifts her hand, feels the air coursing through her fingers. She almost forgets who she is. She almost forgets her past, what she's done. She almost forgets Tallahassee and the night that has haunted her for the past three years. Mike has the radio on, some top-40 song Abby doesn't know, and is drumming his fingers on the steering wheel. Abby allows herself to glance over at him. With his clothes on he looks less a god, and more a man. There's no hiding his height and his build, and his handsome face, but here in the truck he seems more human than he did on the stage at Club Xquisite. The butterflies in Abby's stomach quieten their flapping, enough for her to be able to speak. \"Where are we going?\" she asks. Mike looks over, grinning. \"You'll see.\" Ten minutes later Mike pulls into a dark lot. Abby swallows, hard. She looks up as they drive under a faded, cracking sign: Albert's Drive-In Movees! The place is abandoned. Mike drives up in front of the old screen‚Äîor, the rusted frame that used to be the screen. He puts the truck in park and turns off the engine. They are surrounded by darkness and silence, apart from the sound of their breathing. \"Where are we?\" Abby asks, finally. \"Albert's. What's left of it, anyway. I used to come here when I was a kid.\" \"What happened to it?\" \"When was the last time you went to a drive in movie?\" \"I can't even remember.\" \"THAT'S what happened to it.\" The wind blows a pile of dead leaves in front of the truck. Abby watches them dance, then thinks of Mike dancing. She covers her blushing cheeks. \"Who are you, Abby?\" Mike asks. \"I don't know. I'm no one. I'm just Abby Davies.\" Mike turns to her. \"If there's one thing I'm sure about, Abby Davies, it's that you're not JUST anything.\" For a while, neither of them speak. \"Where are you from?\" Mike asks. \"The mean streets of suburban Tallahassee.\" Mike laughs. \"Why are you in Tampa?\" \"I was transferred for work. I'm an accountant with Drawson and Galligans.\" Silence again. Abby looks up at Mike‚Äîhe is staring at her, green eyes narrowed. The intensity in those eyes makes her turn away. \"What were you doing at the club tonight?\" Mike asks. Abby raises an eyebrow. \"You sure ask a lot of questions.\" \"I\"m sorry. I'm just‚ÄîI want to get to know you. I want to understand you.\" The butterflies return to Abby's stomach. \"The redhead, Jillian, she's the HR manager at work. I'm not even friends with her, but she invited me and she can make life difficult for me if I piss her off. So I put on this ridiculous dress and these shoes I can't walk in and I came out.\" \"I don't think the dress is ridiculous.\" Abby laughs at this. \"You're smooth, Mike.\" \"And you're defensive, Abby.\" Abby sighs. He's right‚Äîshe feels like she's been on the defensive ever since she moved to Tampa. It probably explains why she has no friends, and why tonight is the first night she's been out since she arrived. She feels pathetic. She knows she's pathetic. And she doesn't want Mike to think of her that way‚Äîbut she has to tell him. Because if she tells him the truth, the REAL truth about her past, she knows he'll kick her out of the truck and leave. If he finds out her secret, she'll never see him again. \"I've been in Tampa for three months now,\" Abby says. \"It still scares me. I don't know anyone here, and the most human interaction I get is my geriatric boss Tom hitting on me every day. I'm defensive because I'm alone. I need to look out for myself.\" Mike leans in. He slips his arm around Abby's back. \"You're not alone anymore,\" he whispers. He leans in closer. Abby can smell his cologne, mixed with the sweat from the stage. It feels so long ago that they were in the club, now that it's just them, alone in this abandoned place. Abby's heart feels like it's going to beat out of her chest. Mike's lips are almost touching hers. Suddenly, without understanding why, Abby pulls away. Mike sighs and sits back in his seat. He rubs his chin as he stares up at the decayed old screen. \"I'm sorry,\" Abby whispers. Mike turns the key in the ignition and shakes his head. \"You're going to be a tough nut to crack, Abby Davies. I can tell that much already.\"[Chapter 3] Abby stares down at the reports on her desk, the numbers blurring in her head. She's been stuck all morning - she know she needs to finish her reports, but all she can think about is Mike. Abby sighs as she glances up at the clock. It's not even twelve. She finds herself tapping her pen on the desk to the beat of the song Mike was dancing to on stage. She glances up at the clock again‚Äînot even a minute has passed. \"Do you have those expense reports, Abby?\" Tom, her boss, is standing in front of her desk. He's wearing his brown, stained trousers again, and he's missed a button on his beige shirt. A sliver of pasty skin shows through. Abby shudders. \"There were a couple of discrepancies,\" Abby lies. \"I'm just going over them again.\" Tom walks around beside Abby's chair and perches on her desk. He has the faint smell of cabbage. \"It's almost lunch time,\" he says. \"How about you and I go down to Bruno's, we can discuss the Denham account.\" \"Oh, I brought my lunch today. I'm trying to be healthy.\" \"I'll order you a salad. Come on.\" Tom stands. Abby knows the look on his face - he's not going to take no for an answer. \"I'll get my purse.\" Abby takes a bite of her salad, staring wistfully at Tom's pizza. She feels something on her leg, and repositions herself. The something touches her again‚ÄîTom's foot. She sits as far back in her chair as she can, pushing her legs right back. Tom grins at her. They're sitting at Tom's favorite table, outside, right near the entrance. Right where every single person walking past can see Abby with him. She plays with her hair, trying to cover her face so that no one can see her. When she looks up at Tom, his mouth is gaping open, staring at her hair. \"You wanted to talk about the Denham account?\" Abby says. It takes Tom a few seconds to respond. \"Ah‚Äîyes‚Äîthe account. Well, Abby, you've been doing great work for us since you've been here. I see some real potential in you. So, I'd like you to head up the Denham account. You'll be the lead accountant, dealing directly with Travis Denham himself.\" Abby's eyes go wide. The Denham's are like royalty in Tampa, and one of the richest families in the state. They practically have a monopoly on food manufacturing, amongst all their other investments. And Travis Denham is known around the city for his high-roling, hard-partying ways. \"They're our biggest account,\" Abby says, dumbly. \"That's why I want my best gal on it. You and I will be working very closely on it, of course, there will be a lot of late nights and weekends.\" Abby's stomach flips. There's the kicker‚Äîdeal with Tom's constant sleaziness, or lose the biggest opportunity of her career. \"So? Are you up for it?\" Abby nods. \"Yes, I am.\" Tom grins again, and Abby's heart sinks. This isn't going to be easy. They finish their lunch, and Tom goes inside to settle the bill. Abby stands on the street, lost in thought about her big new promotion, and the headaches that will surely come with it. \"Abby Davies.\" Abby looks up, still in a daze. Mike stands in front of her, dressed in jeans and a shirt, with dirty work boots and a huge smile. \"I don't even get a hello?\" he says, laughing. \"I'm sorry,\" Abby says, still lost in his energy. \"Hello‚Äîhi.\" \"What are you doing out here?\" Mike asks. \"I was just at lunch with a colleague. I'm on my way back to work.\" \"Do you want me to walk you?\" Abby nods, smiling. She points up the street. \"I'm up that way.\" Mike walks up beside her‚Äîthen she hears Tom's voice. \"Abby? Where are you going?\" She hates the sound of that voice. It takes everything in her to not scream at him to leave her alone. Instead she turns back. \"I just ran into an old friend. I'll meet you back at the office.\" Tom stares Mike up and down, a scowl on his face. Mike's smile doesn't falter as he reaches his hand out to Tom. \"I'm Mike.\" Tom puts his arm around Abby's shoulder. The smell of cabbage grows stronger. \"Is this guy bugging you?\" Tom asks. Abby can't help but laugh. She shrugs his arm off. \"He's my friend. Like I said, I'll meet you back at the office.\" Tom's face grows red and he pushes past Mike. \"Don't be late back, Abby.\" Abby and Mike both turn and watch Tom angrily stride down the street. \"Seems like a cool guy,\" Mike says, laughing again. \"That's Tom, the bane of my existence.\" \"I guess I'd better get you back to the office quick. You can't be late back!\" Abby stares up into Mike's deep green eyes. \"What are you doing here?\" \"I'm just on my way home.\" \"Oh. Look‚ÄîI'm‚ÄîI'm sorry about last night,\" Abby says. \"Sorry about what? I had a great time.\" \"Things got weird. I got weird.\" \"I don't remember weird. I remember spontaneous, interesting, sexy. Not weird.\" Abby feels her cheeks burning once again. There's something about his voice that makes her knees weak. \"Do you really have to go back to work?\" Mike asks. \"Yeah. I wish I didn't. But we have this big new account. I have to be on my best behavior.\" \"Have dinner with me tonight then. I'll pick you up.\" \"Alright.\" Abby smiles. But in the back of her mind, all she can think about is Tallahassee.[Chapter 4] Abby stares at the clock on the wall, grinning. Twenty minutes. In twenty minutes she gets to leave, to go outside where Mike will be waiting for her. Dinner, and then‚Ä¶? Abby bites her lip, trying not to let her excitement boil over. \"Abby?\" Even the sound of Tom's voice can't dampen how she's feeling. \"Abby?\" he repeats. \"Yes?\" \"I have great news. Travis Denham has flown in from Miami this afternoon and he wants to meet us to discuss the account. We're meeting at his hotel in fifteen minutes.\" \"I can't‚ÄîI‚Äî\" \"What, you have other plans? Well, I'm sorry, Miss Davies. Do you need me to take you off the account so that it doesn't interfere with your questionable social life?\" Abby sighs. There is no one she wants to see right now more than Mike. The thought of his smile, his smell, the way he speaks‚Ä¶ But the Denham account is the break she's been waiting for, and could make her career. With that kind of account on her resume, she knows she can get a job at any accounting firm in the country. \"No,\" Abby says. \"I'm fine. I can go.\" \"Good. Go freshen yourself up and meet me downstairs in two minutes.\" \"Yes, boss.\" As Tom walks away, Abby picks up the phone to call Mike, but puts the receiver back down a second later. Her stomach is flipping over violently‚Äîshe can't face the sound of his voice right now. Instead she takes out her cell and sends a message. I'm so sorry, I can't come tonight. We have a meeting with a major client and I can't miss it or I might lose my job. Can we reschedule? She puts her phone in her bag and pulls out a small mirror, checking the makeup she put on just for Mike. She hopes Travis Denham is worth the trouble. Abby walks into the Seminole hotel, two steps behind Tom. He looks ridiculously out of place amongst the hip decor, next to the young and fresh patrons. Abby stays behind him, terrified someone might think they're together. They get into the elevator, thankfully alone. \"Remember, let me do most of the talking,\" Tom says. \"I want us to make a good impression.\" Maybe you should have changed your shirt then, Abby thinks. But she just smiles and nods. They get off the elevator and walk up a door that says \"Roxy\". Tom knocks, six times. Abby stifles a laugh at his awkwardness‚Äîfrom what she knows of Mr Denham, this is going to be interesting. A few seconds later, the door opens. Abby has seen photos of Travis online, and in the paper, but they don't do him justice. He's tall‚Äîat least six foot two‚Äîwith black hair perfectly slicked back. He has the face of an old-Hollywood movie star, and he's dressed immaculately in a navy suit. He smiles, flashing perfect teeth. \"Tom Sanders?\" \"Yes, Mr Denham, Sir. My name is Tom, Tom Sanders.\" Travis laughs. \"Come in, Tom Tom.\" Tom walks into the room and Travis turns his attention to Abby. \"And you are?\" \"I'm Abby Davies. I'm assisting Tom Tom on your account.\" Leaning against the doorframe, Travis smiles. He lowers his voice. \"Thank God. That guy looks like a headache and a half.\" \"You have no idea, Mr Denham.\" \"Call me Travis. And come in.\" Abby walks into the suite. Tom has already taken a seat at the dining table, and opened his briefcase. He's shuffling through the mess of papers inside. Travis walks to the bar and pours himself a whiskey. \"Would either of you like a drink?\" \"No, sir,\" Tom says. \"We never drink on the job.\" Abby sits down next to Tom at the table. \"I'll have a whiskey.\" \"That's what I like to hear!\" Travis says. Tom kicks her, hard. \"What are you doing?\" he whispers. \"I'm bonding with the client,\" Abby whispers back. Travis pours a second whiskey, then brings both to the table and sits down. \"So, here's the deal,\" Travis says. \"My parents have worked hard their entire lives, to build our empire out of nothing. They deserve to take a break, to relax and enjoy what they've built. So they're going to start taking a step back in the business, and I'm going to be taking over most of the operation. Our last accountants were useless, which is why we signed on with you last week. I have a very hands-on approach to the business, and it's important to me to know what's going on at all times. I need to trust that I can contact someone at your company any hour of the day to discuss our account. Can you handle that?\" Tom nods vigorously. \"Of course, Mr Denham.\" \"Who's my point guy on the account?\" Travis asks. Abby raises her hand. \"That would be me.\" \"And you're alright with this? I need to be able to contact you any time. That's non-negotiable.\" Abby smiles and takes a business card out of her bag. She picks up a pen and writes on it. \"This is my work number, that's my cell, and that's my home number. Call whenever you need to.\" Travis considers her for a while. \"Alright. I like this, I think it's going to work. Now, Tom Tom, have you looked over the acquisition plans I sent today?\" \"Yes, Sir. I ran the numbers on it myself. I have thirty years experience in corporate accounting, I'm not sure if you knew that.\" \"I think you mentioned it in your emails. Once or twice.\" \"Well, from the information you gave me, I have to advise against it. I can understand the appeal of owning a small airline, of course, but T5 Air have been steadily losing money every single quarter since they launched. I have no idea how they've even stayed afloat this long. And you have to think about the outgoings‚Äîthey're astronomical.\" Travis claps his hands. \"Exactly what I wanted to hear.\" Tom exhales. \"Great. I think it would have been a big mistake to acquire it.\" \"Oh, I'm still buying it,\" Travis says. \"I'm just glad you're advising against it. That's what a good accountant would do.\" Abby laughs, and Tom kicks her again. She takes a sip of her whiskey. Tom clears his throat. \"Mr Denham, I have to strongly advise‚Äî\" \"What do you think, Abby?\" Travis says. \"I agree with Tom that it's a bad investment,\" Abby says. \"But I have a feeling you've got deeper reasons than just financial. I'm interested in finding out more about your plans for it.\" Travis nods. \"Alright, Tom. You can go. I'm going to need those reports we talked about by 10am.\" \"Yes, sir,\" Tom says. \"And I'm going to need Abby to stay for a while to discuss the T5 acquisition.\" \"Uh, if she's alright with that‚Äî\" \"I'm fine with that,\" Abby says. Travis stares at Tom, eyebrow raised, until he slinks out of the room and shuts the door behind him. \"He's definitely a headache,\" Travis says. \"I have a sixth sense for that kind of thing. I have no idea how you work so closely with him.\" \"That's life,\" Abby says. She suddenly feels uncomfortable, alone in the room with Travis. \"You wanted to discuss T5?\" Grinning, Travis takes a sip of his drink. \"You're right about my reasons. They're not financial. Not entirely, anyway.\" \"Are you going to tell me what they are?\" \"No.\" Travis leans across the table and brushes a stray piece of hair off Abby's face. \"I'm going to show you. Let me get my things.\" Travis walks into the bedroom, and it's only then that Abby thinks to check her phone. Her heart beats faster when she sees the little message icon‚Äîa text from Mike. Of course, I understand. But just so you know, I'm going to be thinking about you all night, while you're at your boring meeting. Thinking about you, and planning our next date. xx Mike. \"Are you ready?\" Travis says. Abby quickly puts her phone away. She smiles. \"Yes, let's go.\"[Chapter 5] Mike stands backstage, behind the curtain. He can hear the noise of the crowd growing‚Äîit's almost showtime. He takes out his phone, for the hundredth time that night. Still nothing from Abby. He pounds his fist lightly on the wall as he thinks. Ever since the minute he laid eyes on her, he's wanted to know more, wanted to experience more of her. Normally girls don't have this kind of effect on him‚Äîthe crazy checking of the phone, the up-all-night fantasies. \"You ready, my man?\" Mike turns to see Dallas behind him. He's shirtless, ready to go out and get the crowd warmed up. \"Uh-huh,\" Mike says. Dallas raises an eyebrow. \"You don't sound too enthusiastic there.\" \"I just‚ÄîI have something on my mind.\" \"Something, or someone?\" Mike forces a laugh. \"Since when have you known me to lose my mind over a girl?\" Shaking his head, Dallas lays a hand on Mike's shoulder. \"You gotta grow up sometime. It happens to the best of us. Who's the girl?\" \"Hey, what girl?\" Richie says, walking up to them. \"There's no girl,\" Mike says. \"You mean except for the one you ran off with, and made us cover for you the rest of the show?\" Richie says. \"He thinks we have damn short memories,\" Dallas says. Mike shakes his head. \"Let's not keep these ladies waiting.\" \"Whatever you say, loverboy.\" Dallas grins and slinks out on stage. The crowd screams, and Mike gets into character. Thoughts of Abby will have to wait. Abby wakes up with a jolt. She looks around, confused for a moment‚Äîshe's in a car. A limousine, to be more accurate. Through the fog of sleep she remembers, and turns to see Travis typing on his phone. He looks up. \"You're awake.\" \"I'm sorry.\" Abby rubs her eyes. \"Don't apologize. It's a long drive out here.\" \"Where are we?\" \"Almost there.\" Abby looks out the window‚Äîthey're in the middle of nowhere. How long was she asleep for? A couple of minutes later, the limo turns off the main road and stops at a gate. The sign on the gate says: Private Property. Trespassers will be prosecuted. Within seconds the gate starts to slide open, the sound of clanging metal breaking the silence. The road beyond the gate is dark. Abby turns back to Travis. \"This is T5?\" Travis nods, but doesn't answer‚Äîhe's caught up in whatever he's typing on his phone. When the limo finally stops, Travis smiles at Abby and gets out. Abby follows him. They're standing in front of a single, sad-looking hangar. The metal walls have strips of rust, and the building's sign has fallen from its place, now sitting face-down on the ground where piles of rubbish are strewn about. \"I don't understand,\" Abby says. \"Come inside,\" Travis says. \"In there?\" Abby raises her eyebrows at the hangar. \"It's not as scary as it looks,\" Travis says. He winks. \"I promise.\" He walks over to the door and pulls it open. Abby stands behind him, peering in‚Äîit's pitch black inside. Travis feels on the inside wall for the light switch. \"Are we meant to be here?\" Abby asks. \"Do we have permission?\" \"We don't need permission. I bought the company on the way here.\" He finds the light and switches it on. He steps inside. The hangar slowly comes to life, the light illuminating an immaculately-kept interior. The walls are freshly painted, and the room is lined with shelving and workdesks, all in perfect order. In the middle of the hangar is a single, small plane. It's the type with a small propellor on the front, and space for two inside. It gleams white under the bright lights, and has a curving red pattern painted on the side. Near the tail is the word \"Eternity\". Travis walks over to the plane, runs his hand over the pattern, stopping on Eternity. \"It's finally mine,\" Travis says. \"All these years later and it's mine.\" Abby walks over to stand next to him. He has tears in his eyes. \"Whose plane is this?\" she asks. \"It belonged to a friend. And I'm going to take it home.\" \"Home to where?\" \"Tallahassee.\" Abby bites her lip, hard. She can feel her eyes widen, and she tries to force them back to normal. \"What's in Tallahassee?\" she finally manages to say, her voice low. She's sure Travis will be able to hear her heart beating wildly, so she covers her chest with her hand. \"The fulfilment of a promise and the end of a long story.\" \"A long story‚Ä¶\" Abby mumbles. Travis turns to her. \"Have you ever been there?\" \"I lived there for a little while.\" Abby tries to sound calm, but she can't look Travis in the eye. \"See, there's another thing we have in common.\" \"You're going there now? To‚Äîto Tallahassee?\" The word tastes bitter on her tongue. Travis sighs. \"No. Not now. But soon. Right after I take care of some business.\" Abby nods, relieved. For a moment she thought he was going to ask her‚Äî \"I want you to come with me when I go,\" Travis says. \"I think you're going to like how this plays out.\" \"I don't think I can do that. I have work.\" \"You work for me. Tom will do whatever I tell him to do.\" \"I have‚Äî\" Abby panics, unable to think of an excuse. \"That should be fine,\" she says. She needs time, to think of a reason to go. Three years ago she swore she'd never set foot in Tallahassee again, that she'd die before she did, and she intends to keep that vow. Travis leans in, his face close to hers. \"I'm glad I found you,\" he whispers. He kisses her, his lips soft, gentle. Despite herself, Abby kisses him back. And at that exact moment, an image of Mike flashes into her mind.[Chapter 6] Abby stands out the front of her apartment, twisting her hair around her finger. She plays with the straps of her white satin top, pulls at the waistband of her jeans. The butterflies that have taken up a permanent spot in her stomach flap and flap their wings. She hears an engine, and turns to see Mike's van approaching. She swallows and exhales, trying to calm herself down. He pulls up, and jumps out of the van, his smile wide and infectious. Ah, that smile. It gets Abby, every time. Things just feel easy when Mike is in front of her. She can forget Tom, and Travis, and Tallahassee. She can just be Abby. \"How's my girl?\" Mike says, as he stands in front of her. \"Better, now,\" Abby smiles. Mike's grin grows wider. \"Ready to go?\" \"You haven't even told me where we're going.\" \"You know me. It's a surprise.\" Twenty minutes later, Mike pulls the van up in front of an old building by the beach. It looks boarded up, deserted. \"You have a thing about abandoned places, huh?\" Abby says. \"I like privacy. I spend all night in a club with screaming women‚Äîsometimes I just want some peace and quiet.\" Abby smiles as Mike leads her around the side of the building. At the back, a long metal ladder leads up to the roof. Without a word, Mike climbs up the ladder to the second-story roof. He disappears for a moment, then peers over the roof and motions for Abby to climb up. She raises an eyebrow at him, but she climbs the ladder. At the top, Mike takes her hand and helps her over. Abby stands, dumbstruck. Although the building is abandoned, and there's no one for miles that she can see, the roof is like a secret oasis. There are plants in pots, flowering red and orange and purple. A table sits in the middle of all the plants, set with two places. Covered bowls and bottles of wine cover the table, along with a large bunch of flowers. Little twinkling lights are wrapped around everything, glowing stronger in the twilight. \"Better than a noisy restaurant with a million other people?\" Mike says. Abby glances over at Mike. All of this, for her. Feelings rush over her, more than she can even identify. Fear. Love. Lust. Terror. She pushes them aside. There's only one thing she wants. Abby reaches up, slips her hands behind Mike's neck. He looks surprised for a moment, but he doesn't move. Abby stands on her toes, leans in close. She thinks of the drive in, where he took her the first night they met. He tried to kiss her and she pulled away. What was she thinking? Abby presses her lips to Mike's. His kiss is strong and sweet, exactly like he is. She gets lost in it for a while, let's her mind switch off and her body switch on. This is how it should feel, she finally thinks. When Travis kissed her at the hangar it didn't feel like this, so comforting, and right. She pushes thoughts of Travis from her mind. This is where she wants to be. This is what's real, right now. They stand like that for minutes on beautiful minutes, Abby's hands softly slipping through Mike's hair, Mike's hands gripping her waist, venturing down to her hips. She can sense the light disappearing, the moon lighting the sky. Eventually, they break apart. Abby looks into Mike's eyes, scared for a moment that he doesn't feel what she's feeling. But she sees it there, the same desire and connection she has. Mike slowly shakes his head, his grin returning. He takes her hand and leads her to the table, sitting her in her chair. He pours two glasses of wine, and they watch the remainder of the day disappear in silence.[Chapter 7] Abby stands on the jetty, looking over the sleek white yacht in front of her as it glistens and shines in the bright sun. Abby glances around nervously - Mike is nearby, chatting to two of his friends, dancers at Club Xquisite. There are others, men and women who Abby hasn't been introduced to yet. There are about twenty people in all and this makes Abby anxious. \"Everyone ready to party?\" Mike's friend, Dallas, walks up to the group with a case of beer. Some of the guys cheer, and they start filing onto the yacht. Mike comes over to Abby. \"Are you nervous?\" \"No,\" Abby says. Mike grins. \"It's alright to be nervous, babe. But these are my friends and I want you to get to know them.\" Abby looks to the yacht again, watches the group laughing and dancing as they board. She looks back into Mike's eyes, and all her nervousness falls away. She leans in and kisses him. \"Let's go,\" she says. She walks up the ramp, with Mike just behind her. Just as she reaches the top, her phone rings. She looks at the screen - it's Travis. She answers the call. \"Hello, Mr Denham.\" \"Hi Abby. How are you?\" \"Good, just spending time with some friends.\" \"Well I'm sorry to have to cut that short, but I need you to meet me at the hotel in twenty minutes.\" Abby looks up at Mike. \"Right now?\" Mike's brow furrows. \"Yes,\" Travis says. \"Could it wait a couple of hours?\" \"This is vital and urgent, Abby. You said you understood what was required of you when you took my account.\" \"Alright. I'll be there soon.\" She hangs up the phone. Mike has his arms crossed, and doesn't look happy. \"You have to go.\" Abby nods. \"I don't want to. It's this new client, he's very demanding.\" \"Sounds like you're kind of a slave. If you don't mind me saying.\" Abby feels her cheeks burning. \"I do mind you saying.\" Mike stands his ground. \"It's Saturday and some guy gets to demand you drop everything to attend to him? That's not normal.\" \"Well my goals aren't normal. I'm trying to make something of myself.\" \"You're already something. You're something special, something great.\" \"It's not enough. I need to be more. Or else‚Ä¶\" Abby trails off, thinking of Tallahassee. \"Or else what?\" Abby sighs. \"Nothing. I have to go.\" \"You can't keep running away, Abby.\" Abby can't think of a reply. She turns and runs down the ramp. Half an hour later, Abby is at the Seminole hotel, knocking on the door of the Roxy suite. Travis opens the door. He is wearing a shirt with no tie, and his hair looks messier than last time she saw him. He ushers her inside. \"It's bad,\" Travis says. \"What's happened?\" Abby tries to sound interested, but she can't help but feel resentful towards him for ruining her day with Mike. He seemed so upset‚Ä¶ \"It's T5. Someone's trying to undercut me.\" \"I thought you already bought it.\" \"I made the payment - but the paperwork isn't signed yet.\" \"Why not?\" \"A delay from my office. Someone's head will roll, don't worry about that. But in the meantime someone else has put in a bid, and it's significantly more than I was about to pay.\" Abby sits down at the table. \"What do you want to do?\" \"We need to go to the airline now and get it back.\" Travis walks into the bedroom and Abby quietly takes out her phone. She holds her breath as she clicks it on, and her heart sinks - no message from Mike.[Chapter 8] The office of T5 airlines is small, like the hangar, but just as sleek as the Eternity plane. Abby is sititng next to Travis, and across from an older, distinguished looking man - Michael Hennessy. \"I'm afriad my client isn't willing to accept your last offer,\" Michael says. Travis fumes. \"That wasn't an offer. That was a deal. We agreed, it was all worked out.\" \"But nothing was signed. Therefore, not an actual deal.\" Abby clears her throat. \"What are they willing to accept?\" \"The other interested party has offered significantly more.\" \"How much, Mr Hennessy?\" Abby asks. \"Let's not beat around the bush.\" Michael smiles. \"Three point seven million.\" Abby's chest burns. She can see Travis's hands forming fists next to her. \"That's one point three million more,\" Abby says. \"Yes, so you can understand why my client isn't happy with your last offer. If you'd be willing to up that offer ‚Äî\" \"It's not worth that much,\" Abby says. \"It wasn't even worth our original offer.\" \"I think you'll find that things are worth what people are willing to pay for them, my dear.\" \"I can't advise Mr Denham to pay ‚Äî\" \"Four point five,\" Travis says. Abby looks over, incredulous. \"Mr Denham ‚Äî\" \"Four point five, and I sign the papers here and now, and take ownership straight away.\" Michael smiles. \"Done. I'll be right back.\" He gets up and walks out of the office. \"Are you crazy?\" Abby says. \"Four point five million?\" Travis exhales slowly. \"Eccentric, Abby. When you're rich it's called eccentric.\" Three hours later, with the documents signed and money transferred, Travis Denham is the new and official owner of T5 airlines. Abby stands with him in front of the Eternity, as he stares. \"Now it's real. It's really mine,\" Travis says. \"Congratulations,\" Abby says. Travis climbs up into the plane and sits in the pilot's seat. He looks intense, focused. He glances down at Abby. \"Come on,\" he says. \"What?\" \"Get in.\" \"Why?\" \"We're going for a ride.\" Abby fidgets nervously. \"If you don't mind, I'd rather not.\" Travis fixes her with a stare. \"I do mind. Get in.\" Abby sees the determined look on his face, knows that she has no choice. She climbs up into the plane and sits down, strapping the seat belt on. \"Where are we going? She asks. Travis turns the plane on and starts pressing buttons and dials. Finally he turns back to Abby. \"Tallahassee.\" Abby feels like she's going to throw up. She checks her phone again ‚Äî still nothing from Mike. She types him a message. I'm sorry. I miss you. I have to go to Tallahassee for work, I'll call you when I get there. The plane starts moving, rolling towards the open hangar door. Travis turns it out onto the runway and they quickly gather speed before the wheels lift and the plane is in the air. Flying towards Tallhassee. Flying towards the worst place in the world.[Chapter 9] The knot in Abby's stomach twists and turns as the lights of the city appear on the highway ahead of them. She looks out the window of the limousine, feeling like she's going to be sick. She looks away, to where Travis is sitting. He hasn't spoken since the flight, lost in his own thoughts. Tallahassee - it brings out the worst in everyone, Abby thinks. They drive further into the city, with its regular quiet nighttime energy. It's still early, only just past nine, but already it feels asleep to Abby, compared to Tampa. Only when they're in the center of town is there any life - college kids from Florida State, already drunk and staggering along the streets outside the bars. Abby sees one girl fall, only to be picked up by a guy in a letterman jacket, and guided into a dark doorway. Abby looks away. She closes her eyes, and concentrates on the gentle rocking of the car. A few minutes later, the car stops. Abby opens her eyes - Travis is staring at her. \"Ready?\" he asks. \"For what?\" \"You'll see.\" Travis opens the door. They're in an alleyway, dark apart from a light above one door. Abby can feel the deep beat of music coming from somewhere underneath. The door opens, and a security guard is standing there. There's a sign on the wall inside that says LUST. Travis walks inside - in a way that makes Abby uncomfortable. Abby hesitates. She takes out her phone and types a message to Mike. I'm sorry. For everything. I'm in Tallahassee with Travis Denham at some place called LUST. I don't know what's happening, but I'll call you as soon as I can. She puts her phone away and walks inside. Steps lead down, further and further underground, dimly lit with red lights. The beat of the music grows stronger. Finally Abby reaches a door. She opens it. It leads to a club like Abby has never seen before. She stands in the doorway staring. The entire club is bathed in red light, red as blood. The furniture is all white and expensive - the seating for the most wealthiest men in the city. On podiums, barely-dressed women dance provocatively, writhing to the serpentine beats of the music. Abby slowly walks into the club, looking around. She finally spots Travis standing near the bar. He smiles as she approaches. \"I have something to show you.\" \"More than this?\" Travis laughs. \"Much more.\" He leads her to the back of the club and through a large metal door. The room beyond is quieter. There are less men here - but they look wealthier. More important. Abby hesitates again. She feels panicked, her whole body telling her to run. Travis sees she's stopped and walks back to her. \"What's wrong?\" \"I don't feel well.\" Travis puts his hand out to take hers. \"Do you trust me?\" he says. Abby thinks of Mike. She doesn't trust Travis - but she doesn't dare tell him. \"Yes,\" she says. Travis smiles and takes her hand, leading her to the back corner of the room where there's a dark booth. Abby sees someone move in the booth, and stand up. The person's face falls into the light, and Abby stops breathing. \"Well, you shouldn't,\" Travis says. Abby can't move. She can only stare at the man in front of her - Peter Montague. The face that keeps her up at night, the vision of her nightmares. \"Hello, Abby,\" Peter says. \"It's been a long time.\" He gestures to someone behind her, and suddenly a hand holding a damp cloth is clamped over her mouth. She struggles, but soon her vision goes black and her mind drifts off into nothingness...[Chapter 10] Mike stares down at his phone, at the message from Abby. He feels stuck - he's never felt this way about anyone before. None of the women he's met have ever come close to Abby - and he's not sure why. He barely knows her, but there's something about her. Something he wants to spend the rest of his life discovering. \"What's up, my man?\" Dallas sits down next to Mike. They're in the back room of Club Xquisite, cooling down after the show. Richie walks up and hands them both a beer. \"Something's up?\" he asks. \"It's nothing,\" Mike says. Dallas and Richie look at each other and laugh. \"So it's the girl again?\" Dallas asks. Mike sighs and nods. \"Look buddy,\" Richie says. \"I like her. I know she's a handful but what woman isn't!\" \"It's just that every time we get close, she runs away,\" Mike says. \"Where is she now?\" Richie asks. \"She's in Tallahassee with her rich, handsome client, at the LUST club. Remember our trip there? She's probably having an amazing time. Without me.\" Tarzan walks into the back room, followed by two very drunk and pretty bridesmaids. He nods at Richie, who downs his beer and stands up. \"I guess if you want her, you better go chase her.\" Richie walks out and Mike turns to Dallas. \"What do you think?\" Dallas claps Mike on the shoulder. \"I think anything worth having in life is worth chasing.\" Mike smiles. Then he stands and runs out the door. ","Summary":" \"Alright, alright! Let's welcome to the stage the one, the only, the cock-rocking kings of Tampa!"},{"Movie":"Robots","Title":"Robots: las precuelas","Author":"dimitrix","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12847589","Passage":"[Chapter 1] ROBOTS: LAS PRECUELAS Este fanfic ha sido presentado por Dimitrix Enterprises y Dimitrix Inc. Robots ha sido siempre una de mis pel√≠culas favoritas de todos los tiempos y desde hace mucho tiempo lleva esperando una secuela que parece que no llega ya que estoy desesperado por querer volver a Rodney Hojalata y a todo el grupo reunido otra vez, tengo una secuela en mi mente pero lo que no sabemos es que sucedi√≥ antes de todo eso, pues estos son los seis segmentos precuela que nos cuentan las historias alternas a lo que puede suceder en un Robots 2: La Nueva era, estad muy atentos a lo que vais a ver. SEGMENTO 1: EL EVANGELIO DE LA INVENCI√ìN Jack Hammer iba bajando por un elevador bastante ruidoso y estrepitoso hac√≠a el barrio de Chinabot que se encontraba unos pisos mas abajo. Se quito las gafas y se las limpio haciendo que ahora pudiese ver mejor, asinti√≥ complacido al mismo tiempo que atemorizado ya que hac√≠a unos meses que por alguna extra√±a raz√≥n varios inventores a los que √©l conoc√≠a hab√≠an desparecido misteriosamente sin dejar rastro, sab√≠a muy bien que era imposible que todos se hubiesen esfumado ya que eso supon√≠a que todo el mundo estaba pasando del plan que ten√≠a Gran Soldador. Desde que Rodney Hojalata hab√≠a devuelto la paz hac√≠a Ciudad Robot este se hab√≠a convertido en el nuevo jefe de Industrias Gran Soldador haciendo que ahora todo el mundo pudiese desarrollar sus nuevas ideas, incluido √©l, pero ahora por alg√∫na raz√≥n algo estaba cambiando y no sab√≠a lo que era, ten√≠a que tener mucho cuidado ya que ahora √©l era presa f√°cil para cualquiera que le descubriese. El ascensor bajo haciendo una peque√±a sacudida y de ah√≠ abri√≥ la puerta de rejas, sali√≥ al exterior observando el inmenso barrio en el que se encontraba, Chinabot era uno de los nuevos barrios extranjeros que se hab√≠an formado tras la aprobaci√≥n de Rodney Hojalata de reconstruir Ciudad Robot de una manera mucho mas moderna, lo cual no era tan mala idea, pod√≠a ver como robots de diferentes partes del continente occidental ten√≠an sus propios puestos de comida o tiendas que vend√≠an cualquier cosa con tal de usar como actualizaci√≥n, ya nadie ten√≠a miedo a oxidarse y a quedarse hecho pedazos, ya no, eso hab√≠a terminado, esta era una nueva era. -Reguladores, ¬øquien quiere reguladores? Reguladores. -Recambios, ¬øquien quiere hacerse un recambio de ruedas? Recambios. -Cambio su tono de metal, cambio su tono de metal, v√©ase con un nuevo aspecto por si no le gusta el viejo, se no preocupe, se le devolver√° el dinero si no queda convencido. Todos aquellos vendedores se hab√≠an puesto para ganarse un peque√±o dinerillo con la nueva moda de que ya nadie ten√≠a que ir rebuscando en la basura para conseguir actualizaciones, la dictadura de Ratchet hab√≠a llegado a su fin gracias a Hojalata y ahora viv√≠an con todos los lujos, pero esos lujos ten√≠an su consecuencia y ahora hab√≠a hecho que varios sujetos de otros lugares viniesen a crearse sus propias organizaciones criminales, las mafias se hac√≠an llamar, esos grupos lo que hac√≠an era adue√±arse de la gente mas d√©bil y obligarles a hacer cosas que hasta ahora nadie hab√≠a querido hacer, y si todo eso iba bien, se les recompensaba, si no, acabar√≠an teniendo un castigo mucho peor que el de acabar incinerado en la Chop Shop del cual ahora ya no funcionaba. Mientras iba avanzando lentamente por todo aquel barrio extendido a lo largo de la zona, pod√≠a ver a distintos ni√±os jugando con varios juguetes ni√±os que hab√≠an salido de la compa√±√≠a de Gran Soldador, los ve√≠a jugando con Hula-Hops de luces, drones teledirigidos y peque√±os animalejos electr√≥nicos que usaban para sus juegos estrat√©gicos de cartas, le gustaba las cosas que ve√≠a, lastima de que ahora no tuviese tiempo para aprovechar algo como eso ya que se encontraba en una situaci√≥n en donde ten√≠a que mantener la cabeza bien alta, no pod√≠a confiar en nadie, levanto la capucha de su t√∫nica haciendo que nadie pudiera reconocerle, aqu√≠ √©l no era nadie, simplemente era un viejo robot con gafas que ten√≠a consigo algo un libro poco importante. Se dirigi√≥ hac√≠a una tienda que hab√≠a a la vuelta de la esquina, atraves√≥ las puertas de plasma y de ah√≠ paso al interior de la tienda donde todo estaba mas limpio y ordenado que afuera, hab√≠a toda una calma que le hac√≠a pensar que estaba so√±ando tras haber estado presenciando una pesadilla. -¬øPuedo ayudarle? -pregunto el due√±o de la tienda, era un robot escu√°lido de ojos saltones y ten√≠a piernas de neum√°tico, se acerco al mostrador. -Si, necesito algo parecido a esto si es que lo tiene -se saco de encima un perno dorado hexagonal. Se lo ense√±o al due√±o y este se le quedo mirando fijamente para ver como era. -¬øLo tiene? Es importante. Apoyo el perno encima del mostrador y entonces suspiro pensativo ante esa propuesta. -Si le digo la verdad, muy pocas personas vienen aqu√≠ buscando algo como esto, no se donde lo ha sacado pero no tengo nada parecido, aunque si un tornillo -admiti√≥ con total sinceridad. -Ya, pero yo no necesito un tornillo, yo necesito un perno como ese -le insisti√≥ nerviosamente, se desesperaba demasiado con encontrarlo. -¬øPara que? ¬øEs usted inventor? No supo como contestarle a eso ya que era bastante obvia la pregunta. -Parecido -fue lo √∫nico que pude decirle con tal de que pareciese ideol√≥gico. -Esp√©reme aqu√≠ -le aviso se√±al√°ndole con el dedo y entonces se marcho hac√≠a un hueco que hab√≠a pasando el muro que ten√≠a delante, se oy√≥ como se le mov√≠an las ruedas. Jack se quedo ah√≠ esperando al robot mientras se pon√≠a nervioso al no saber que hacer, quer√≠a saber que todo estaba yendo sin problemas pero sab√≠a muy bien que no, no sab√≠a si alguien le estaba siguiendo o le estaba espiando sin que se diese cuenta, se hab√≠a metido en un mal lugar pero era el √∫nico lugar que conoc√≠a lo suficientemente bien como para saber que acabar√≠a encontrando lo que andaba buscando, su vida depend√≠a de ello y la de Gran Soldador, √©l era el ultimo inventor que quedaba libre como para proteger el proyecto del que parec√≠a que era la raz√≥n por la cual todos estaban siendo secuestrados misteriosamente. Oy√≥ un fuerte ruido y reaccion√≥ bruscamente al o√≠rlo, enderezo su mirada hac√≠a el frente y observo que el robot due√±o de la tienda hab√≠a vuelto con un caja de cart√≥n que parec√≠a contener todo tipo de cosas met√°licas, se notaba el sonido en cuanto lo apoyo contra el mostrador. -Si quiere puede buscar aqu√≠ -le propuso dandole la caja para que mirase. Alzo la mirada observando que hab√≠an todo tipo de tornillos, pernos, tuercas y engranajes y cualquier cosa mec√°nica que pudiese ver con exactitud. -¬øPero no me va a ayudar usted? -se cuestiono viendo que le estaba dando la caja llena de metales como para que lo buscase √©l mismo sin que este hiciese nada por ayudarle. -Si encuentra algo no quiero saber lo que es. -¬øComo? -se extra√±o a√∫n mas con ese comentario. -Creo que es mejor que no se quede mucho tiempo -le aviso poniendo un tono como de saber muy bien lo que estaba haciendo con √©l era algo bastante peligroso. Aquello lo pudo entender, el due√±o se marcho volviendo hac√≠a donde estaba antes dej√°ndole ah√≠ solo como para que se ocupase de mirar en la caja, la abri√≥ lo suficiente como para ver con mas luz lo que hab√≠a dentro, fue rebuscando por el interior provocando tanto ruido que le preocupaba que aquello llamase demasiado la atenci√≥n, no sab√≠a que estaba haciendo el due√±o pero seguramente no era algo bueno, no pod√≠a confiar en nadie, ni siquiera en aquellos que le estaban ayudando. -Vamos -rechisto esforz√°ndose por encontrar lo que quer√≠a y entonces acabo encontr√°ndolo, hallo un perno dorado parecido al otro que ten√≠a en sus manos-. Lo tengo. -Ser√° mejor que salga de aqu√≠ -se oy√≥ la voz del due√±o desde el otro lado. -¬øComo dice? -alzo la mirada queriendo verle pero apenas pod√≠a, por alg√∫na raz√≥n √©l estaba escondido intentando de ignorarle por alg√∫n motivo. -Si lo ha encontrado ser√° mejor que se vaya con √©l. -¬øSin pagarle? -Me da igual, vayase ya, usted no estado aqu√≠ -le presiono insisti√©ndole para que se fuera. Al o√≠r eso pudo entender porque se lo estaba pidiendo, se guardo los dos pernos, cerro la caja haciendo que no encontr√≥ nada de ah√≠ y se marcho saliendo de la tienda sin apenas despedirse por agradecerle al due√±o lo que hizo, pero no pod√≠a hacerlo. Se puso la capucha de vuelta y ah√≠ entonces se alejo teniendo consigo los dos pernos que andaba buscando, no le faltaba nada mas, pero si un lugar seguro donde poder quedarse, sigui√≥ avanzando por todo el callej√≥n cuando entonces se dio cuenta de que se sent√≠a muy seco, necesitaba ponerse algo de aceite, ten√≠a que tomarse un buen trago por lo menos, miro cada uno de los puestos de comida y bebidas y vio uno que le llamo la atenci√≥n, era un puesto circular que se encontraba en medio de la esquina donde apenas hab√≠a alguien sentado en las butacas de los extremos, decidi√≥ meterse ah√≠ al ver que parec√≠a estar bastante tranquilo. Se junto delante del mostrador y se sent√≥ en una de las butacas que hab√≠an al otro lado del robot que parec√≠a estar tomando tranquilamente, se acerco el barman que era igual que el due√±o de la tienda donde hab√≠a conseguido los pernos solo que este iba vestido con el t√≠pico traje de un barman y ten√≠a los ojos mas saltones, le pregunto que quer√≠a y Jack le respondi√≥ que una copa de aceite, se quito la capucha esperando que nadie le reconociese en ese lugar, luego apoyo el libro encima del mostrador mientras √©l se manten√≠a tenso de lo nervioso que estaba, aquellos nervios no se le iban a ir nunca. El otro robot que ten√≠a al lado se le quedo mirando interesado, se levanto y se apoyo encima de la butaca que hab√≠a en medio al lado de Jack, √©l pudo notar como aquel robot se hab√≠a puesto ah√≠ aprop√≥sito con tal de incordiarle o algo parecido. -Eh amigo, ¬øte conozco de algo? -le pregunto poniendo una expresi√≥n desinteresada pero se notaba que de alg√∫na forma lo estaba reconociendo. -No -le respondi√≥ neg√°ndose a contestarle cualquier cosa que le dijese, ya ten√≠a suficiente con sentirse perseguido, ahora no iba a perder la poca tranquilidad que ten√≠a con aquel idiota. -¬øSeguro? ¬øNo eres de la tele? ¬øEh? Jack quer√≠a plantarle en la cara un buen golpe pero sab√≠a muy bien que si lo hac√≠a llamar√≠a demasiado la atenci√≥n y entonces se le arruinar√≠a la tapadera y otra vez tendr√≠a que volver a correr. -No, yo te he visto en alg√∫n lado -se hac√≠a el que parec√≠a que estaba pensando detenidamente, estaba claro que √©l ya lo hab√≠a reconocido pero se comportaba as√≠ aprop√≥sito con tal de insistirle que confesase la verdad aunque no quer√≠a hacerlo. El barman le paso el vaso con el aceite, Jack le agradeci√≥ y entonces se dio un peque√±o sorbo. -Vamos t√≠o, confi√©salo, eres conocido -le presiono poniendose vacilante con √©l. Al final Jack se canso y decidi√≥ hacer lo que mejor conoc√≠a, se quito de encima un implante con aspecto circular y se lo tiro delante para que lo viese, aquel robot pirado lo cog√≠o y ah√≠ entonces lo miro absorto reconociendo de que se trataba. -Eso a cambio de tu silencio, ¬øentendido? -le pidi√≥ expl√≠citamente. -Es bueno hacer negocios con usted -lo acepto poniendo una sonrisa picarona, pago al barman y entonces se marcho desapareciendo como si no hubiese estado ah√≠. Jack asinti√≥ agradecido de ver que se lo quito de encima, estaba cerca de que esto hubiese acabado en desastre, pero ten√≠a que tener mucho cuidado con eso, empezaba a pensar que hab√≠a cometido un error al venir aqu√≠, o de al menos no estar mejor preparado, volvi√≥ a ponerse la capucha haciendo que nadie le reconociese en lo mas m√≠nimo, era mucho mejor as√≠. -Una copa -dijo alguien. Se giro y observo que otro mas se meti√≥ ah√≠, era otro robot pero distinto a todos los que hab√≠a visto antes, era mas joven y con gafas, parecido a √©l pero mucho mas moderno, no sab√≠a porque pero aquel joven le interesaba bastante, no sab√≠a si era porque ten√≠a aspecto de inventor o porque le hac√≠a acordar a √©l cuando era mucho mas joven. El barman le entrego la copa y se dio un peque√±o sorbo, de pronto dijo: -¬øEsta bueno eso? -le pregunto. -¬øComo? -se cuestiono viendo que parec√≠a que se intereso por √©l. -El libro, ese de ah√≠, ¬øes suyo no? -aclaro se√±alando el libro que ten√≠a en la barra. -Ah, esto -se ri√≥ viendo que le se√±alaba el libro y no otra cosa mucho menos importante. -¬øQue es? -se acomodo apoyando su pu√±o encima de su barbilla para escucharlo. Agarro el libro d√°ndolo vuelta por la portada y se lo ense√±o. -El Evangelio de la Memoria. -¬øDe que va? -Es b√°sicamente como una enciclopedia que te ense√±a todo lo que necesitas saber sobre los inventores de anta√±o y de como todos ellos nos ayudaron a crear un mundo mejor para todos nosotros -le resumi√≥ poniendo una sonrisa de expectaci√≥n por el libro. -Lastima de que esta ciudad paso como 20 a√±os sufriendo un terrible Armaggedon que casi nos destruye a todos nosotros -indico ingenuamente. -Si, yo pase por esa √©poca. -Yo apenas -tomo un fuerte sorbo de su aceite. Jack hizo lo mismo pero no pudo evitar sentir que por alguna rara raz√≥n aquel chico se hab√≠a puesto ah√≠ por algo, no era como el otro individuo de antes pero si sent√≠a que era demasiado f√°cil que se hubiese sentado a su lado y no le preguntase por si lo reconoc√≠a o algo. -Se lo que estas pensando -le dijo con cara de estar insinuandose. -¬øComo? -se extra√±o al o√≠r eso. -Estas pensando en como me he sentado aqu√≠ tu lado y no te he preguntado sobre quien eres en realidad -aclaro demostrando que no le iba a hacer la misma pregunta que al otro. -Ah, maldita -exclamo sinti√©ndose avergonzado por reconocerlo. -No importa, yo tambi√©n habr√≠a hecho lo mismo -volvi√≥ a dar otro sorbo. -Se que no es de mi incumbencia, pero... ¬øquien eres? -Digamos que alguien que necesita algo en la vida -dio una respuesta bastante metaf√≥rica. -Pues tu pareces tener mucho con lo que vivir. Le miro con una expresi√≥n indirecta al no entender esa menci√≥n. -Veo que llevas una agenda port√°til -declaro se√±alando el estuche que llevaba colgando en el costado de su cintur√≥n-. ¬øQue eres? ¬øInform√°tico? -Sol√≠a serlo, hasta que me echaron por pasarme de la raya -confeso poniendo una cara de disgusto. -Lo siento mucho. -No lo sientas, hice bien en irme de ah√≠, todos eran unos aut√©nticos cerdos, no sab√≠an lo que pod√≠a hacer, y ahora estoy trabajando para alguien que si sabe lo que puedo hacer. -Parece un hombre muy trabajador. -Lo es -afirmo sinti√©ndose orgulloso de eso y entonces se echo el aceite encima de su espalda, lanzo un enorme suspiro de satisfacci√≥n al sentir el aceite caliente por todo su cuerpo. Jack pudo ver como con aquel chico sent√≠a una satisfacci√≥n que hasta ahora jamas antes hab√≠a visto, le hac√≠a acordar a sus viejos tiempo cuando era joven, cuando no ten√≠a nada encima y tuvo que buscarse su propia manera de trabajar, al menos con eso le hac√≠a sentirse bien. -¬øSabes que me interesa de este libro? -Cu√©ntame -se puso en una posici√≥n de inter√©s al saber lo que ten√≠a que decir. -Este libro no solamente te cuenta el desarrollo de los mayores inventores del mundo, sino tambi√©n de ver como un grupo de personas se unieron en contra de toda la √©tica, y se crearon sus propias ideas con tal de saber que lo que har√≠an cambiar√≠an el mundo, no les importaba si de alg√∫na manera se oxidar√≠an con el paso del tiempo, solamente les importaba dejar una peque√±a parte de lo que ten√≠an en mente para que as√≠ con el paso de los a√±os, alguien acabase encontrando esas pistas y pudiesen dar lugar a algo mucho mas nuevo, y fijate ahora -le explico resumi√©ndole todo lo que pensaba sobre los inventores al estar relacionado con el libro, luego le se√±alo el televisor que hab√≠a en un costado, se pod√≠a ver la imagen de un reportero. -Diganos Meca-Critico, ¬øque piensa de la nueva Constituci√≥n hecha por Rodney Hojalata? La imagen paso a la del Meca-Critico mirando de frente y con una mirada malhumorada. -Pienso que ese Rodney Hojalata es solo otro loco adolescente que se cree que puede hacer lo que le de la gana, aunque viendo lo que hice Ratchet antes veo que al menos lo ha mejorado un poco pero eso no quiere decir que estemos tan pendientes de esto como lo est√°bamos antes, alguien deber√≠a de bajarle los humos a estos jefes inventores, ¬øalguien sabe donde est√°n todos ahora? Porque me prometieron que me har√≠an unas gafas con luces, ¬ødonde est√°n? -protesto soltando todas las quejas que ten√≠a sobre cualquier cosa que le viniese a la cabeza. -Ese t√≠o nunca se si lo han puesto ah√≠ aprop√≥sito porque sabe quejarse o solamente porque necesitan un cabeza de turco para que sepa lo que tiene que decir -opino pensativo. -Si -coincidi√≥ el otro. Al ver lo bien que le hab√≠a ca√≠do el chico, decidi√≥ aprovechar para preguntarle una cosa. -¬øSabes eso de los inventores? -Si, es terrible, es como si alguien se estuviera quitando de encima a todos los inventores. -¬øPero lo que no logro entender es porque sucede? No han pasado cinco a√±os desde que Madame Engranaje muri√≥ y su hijo se fue a la carcel, ¬øcrees que puede tener alg√∫na conexi√≥n. -¬øUsted cree? -frunci√≥ con el ce√±o para arriba al estar interesado en esa cuesti√≥n. -No lo se, quiz√°s haya alguien por ah√≠ relacionado con Madame Engranaje que todav√≠a no ha ido a la carcel y esta por ah√≠ libre, capturando a todos los inventores. -¬øPara que? ¬øPara vengarse? -No lo se, pero eso ser√≠a lo menos preocupante -indico exasperado y entonces se dio el ultimo sorbo de su vaso lleno de aceite, suspiro aliviado al mismo tiempo que agotado. -¬øTu no eres de por aqu√≠ verdad? -No, no lo soy, yo he venido aqu√≠ para hacer un trabajo, pero me parece que no soy capaz de hacerlo -le aclaro confes√°ndole sin dudarlo, estaba tan preocupado por lo otro que no le importaba para nada decirle todo lo que menos le preocupaba del asunto. -Pues yo tambi√©n he venido para hacer un trabajo -declaro el otro. -¬øAh si? -se intereso al o√≠r eso. -As√≠ es, me pidieron que viniese a buscar a una persona, a alguien que necesitaba ayuda en algo. -¬øY la has encontrado? -le devolvi√≥ el vaso vac√≠o al barman, √©l se lo llevo. Hubo un momento de silencio y entonces el joven robot dijo: -Al parecer si -confirmo serenamente. -¬øY has podido ayudar a esa persona? -se saco unas monedas del interior de su traje para d√°rselos al barman para pagarle al barman. -Esa persona no necesita ayuda en realidad. -¬øAh no? -sigui√≥ escuchando mientras se peleaba por encontrar las monedas precisas que necesitaba para pagarle al barman que le estaba esperando ah√≠ delante. -No, en realidad necesita que se re√∫na con los suyos. Aquella ultima menci√≥n le hizo estremecerse bastante ya que le resultaba bastante raro por alg√∫na raz√≥n, se giro mirando al joven del cual ahora pon√≠a una expresi√≥n seria y enfurismada. -¬øQuienes son los suyos? -le pregunto a pesar de saber que estaba cometiendo un error al preguntarle eso ya que estaba bastante claro que hab√≠a algo raro en ese joven. -¬øAcaso no se da cuenta se√±or Hammer? -le critico indirectamente. -¬øQue? -se atemorizo al ver que sab√≠a quien era, aquel joven no era un amigo. -Es incre√≠ble que despu√©s de todo el rato que llevamos aqu√≠, no se haya dado cuenta de que jamas ha estado a salvo durante todo este tiempo -se insinu√≥ soberanamente. -¬øQuien eres tu? -quiso descubrirlo ya que se notaba que hab√≠a ca√≠do en una trampa. Se acomodo en la silla y entonces se quedo mir√°ndolo mas r√≠gido que antes. -Soy aquel que quiere llevarle con mi jefe, se√±or Jack Hammer, el ultimo inventor que todav√≠a queda libre -confeso demostrando que no hab√≠a venido aqu√≠ por pura coincidencia. Ah√≠ entonces Jack se dio cuenta de quien se trataba aquel chico, se puso a pensar en todos los aspectos que lo corroboraban, la agenda port√°til, que fue expulsado, esas gafas que ten√≠a puestas encima de la cabeza, todo indicaba que se trataba de un robot en particular. -Database -era el hacker fugitivo que todo el mundo conoc√≠a de sobra. -Ya era hora de que se diese cuenta -dijo con tono de querer actuar ahora. Jack se alarmo tanto por esto que decidi√≥ levantarse y marcharse cuanto antes, agarro r√°pidamente sus cosas y se dispuso a irse pero en cuanto se giro observo que hab√≠a alguien mas delante de √©l, hab√≠a un robot de aspecto humanoide con la piel medio rosada, con un casco amarillo en forma de peinado enderezado hac√≠a la izquierda, de cuerpo robusto rojo y en las manos ten√≠a unos bordes de pinchos que parec√≠an bastante afilados y letales. -Triturador -lo reconoci√≥ enseguida al verle. -Bien hecho Database -le dijo agradeci√©ndole al hacker que continuaba ah√≠ sentado en la butaca. -Sab√≠a que el muy idiota no se dar√≠a cuenta de que lo estaban siguiendo, se cre√≠a tan listo que no vio que ya le ten√≠amos puesto los ojos encima -comento incr√©dulamente Database. Aquello lo hizo estremecer mucho mas a Jack ya que demostraba que a pesar de todo el trabajo que hizo para impedir que no lo cogiesen, al final ya lo ten√≠an cogido desde hac√≠a un buen rato. -Tu te vienes con nosotros Hammer -le aviso amenazadoramente Triturador. -Ni en sue√±os -dijo y entonces soltar unas peque√±as bolas en forma de canicas negras contra el suelo, rodaron un par de metros hasta que de pronto se detuvieron al instante. -Oh no -exclamo Database al reconocer de que se trataba. Las bolas explotaron haciendo salir una enorme luz que los ceg√≥ a todos los que hab√≠an alrededor incluyendo los dos, Jack aprovecho de nuevo y se marcho pero se le cayo el libro sin que se diese cuenta. Ambos recuperaron la vista y se percataron de que ya no estaba en ning√∫na parte, se exasperaron tanto que se pusieron a correr para seguirle pero ya le hab√≠an perdido el rastro. -¬øAdonde cojones se ha ido? -protesto Triturador al ver que no lo encontraba. Ah√≠ entonces Database se percato de alguien que iba con capucha, parecido a Hammer. -Ah√≠ -le se√±alo euf√≥ricamente y ambos marcharon a seguir a ese sujeto. Corrieron lo mas r√°pido que pudieron y entonces engancharon al sujeto con capucha agarr√°ndole por los hombros y lo giraron para verle la cara, no era √©l, era simplemente un viejo robot gris con gafas, este se asusto al verles, ambos se miraron indignados al ver que agarraron a uno que no era. -Vete -le rechisto y el robot se marcho. Ambos se llevaron las manos a la cabeza del disgusto que ten√≠an. -¬øAdonde puede haber ido? -se cuestiono otra vez Triturador. -No lo se, pero se que no puede haber ido lejos -opino Database. -¬øTu estabas con √©l? ¬øSabes si dijo algo mas? -No aparte del libro que ten√≠a en sus manos -aclaro ense√±ando que ten√≠a el libro de Hammer en sus propias manos, Triturador se quedo desconcertado al ver que lo hab√≠a cogido sin darse cuenta. -¬øCuando lo has cogido? Cuando recuperamos la vista, me resultaba una lastima tener que desperdiciar un buen libro -indico fij√°ndose bien en el libro, le resultaba tan interesante que no lo iba a dejar tirado por nada. -Tu pensando en libros cuando podr√≠amos estar buscando a ese rufi√°n de Jack Hammer. -¬øSabes algo de Screch? -le pregunto cambiando de tema al instante. Carraspeo pensativo y entonces alzo el brazo donde ten√≠a el comunicador, lo pulso y dijo: -Screch, aqu√≠ Triturador, hemos perdido a Hammer, ¬øsabes algo? -le pregunto. - He encontrado a Hammer, esta abandonando el comercio, pero se esta metido en un callej√≥n, ser√° mejor que veng√°is ahora si no queremos perderlo -anunci√≥ Screch por el otro lado. Database esbozo una sonrisa de orgullo al ver que no lo hab√≠an tontamente por completo. -Vamonos -ordeno y ambos marcharon corriendo dispuestos a seguir la pista de Hammer antes de que lo perdiesen una vez mas. Database ten√≠a en sus manos el libro del cual ahora se lo iba a quedar. FIN DEL PRIMER SEGMENTO.[Chapter 2] ROBOTS: LAS PRECUELAS Este fanfic ha sido presentado por Dimitrix Enterprises y Dimitrix Inc. SEGMENTO 2: EL PODER DE LA BUROCRACIA Una gran tormenta azota la prision de M√°xima Seguridad de Zerodome. Dentro de la prision todos los prisioneros se hallan en sus celdas intentando de dormir pero algunos se mosquean con el sonido de la lluvia y de los truenos haciendo que se pongan como locos, van lanzando gemidos y alg√∫n que otro reproche como para intentar de llamar la atenci√≥n. Uno de ellos era Tim el guarda ahora mas conocido como Tim el preso que se hallaba metido en su peque√±a celda intentando de dormir a duras penas ya que se hartaba de la manera de quejarse de los dem√°s presos que no le dejaban un solo momento dormir. -Hola, ¬øpodr√≠a alguien insistirle a estos idiotas que dejen de quejarse porque algunos queremos dormir de una maldita vez? -pidi√≥ protestando con tal de que alguien le escuchase. -¬°Callate la boca Tim el preso -le reprocho otro preso. -¬°Callate tu! Ja ja ja -se puso a reirse como un loco y dando vueltas por el suelo. En la alta torre de la prision se encontraba el alcaide Ivon Fortress cenando tranquilamente en su enorme despacho, ten√≠a un plato con una chuleta de fierro a la que iba cortando parte por parte, corto un trozo y entonces se lo llevo a la boca, lo degusto pl√°cidamente. -¬øSabes una cosa Owen? -le pregunto a su mano derecha-. Esta es la mejor chuleta de fierro que he probado en un mucho tiempo, ¬øy sabes porque es la mejor? -¬øPorque se√±or? -inquiri√≥ interesado el guardia jefe Owen Grill que se encontraba sentado en el sof√° de la esquina leyendo el peri√≥dico con total tranquilidad. -Porque esta chuleta se ha conseguido con sudor y mucho aceite desperdiciado, imaginate esto, piensa en lo mucho que la mayor√≠a de los robots hacen para poder conseguir una chuleta de este tipo, demasiado, hacen demasiado, y a√∫n as√≠, se consigue algo tan benepl√°cito como esto -le explico dando su opini√≥n al respecto sobre las chuletas de fierro. -¬øAdonde quiere ir a parar se√±or? -le miro esc√©pticamente al saber muy bien que no le estar√≠a dando ese argumento a menos que tuviese que ver con algo importante. -Hemos llegado demasiado lejos para ser lo que somos, fijate en mi, tengo un trabajo respetable manteniendo encerrados a todos esos cretinos del resto de la civilac√≠on, tengo traje, tengo dignidad, y tengo mucho patriotismo pasando por encima de mis engranajes, y tu tambi√©n, fijate bien, te has convertido literalmente en mi mano derecha porque me caes tan bien que no sabr√≠a que hacer sin ti -aclaro justificando el hecho de que lo que interesaba era en que hab√≠an acabado convirtiendose a partir de todo el buen trabajo que hab√≠an mantenido hasta ahora. -Pues buscarse a otra mano derecha -a√±adi√≥ ir√≥nicamente. -Si, eso es cierto -afirmo convencido de esa menci√≥n ambigua-. Pero al menos tu eres uno de los pocos que al menos saben lo que se tiene que hacer en una situaci√≥n como esta. Esbozo un risa falsa de incredulidad al o√≠r eso. -Alg√∫n dia de estos vamos a tener que acabar dando lo mejor de si ocurre un mot√≠n -agrego. -Jamas de los jamases dejare que suceda un mot√≠n en mi prision, nunca, lo juro por mi medalla al honor que no permita que esto se salga de descontrol -decreto se√±alando su placa en el traje como para dejar que era su prision y se iba a quedar con las normas que ten√≠a impuestas. -Bien por eso -levanto el pulgar en se√±al de afirmaci√≥n. Le devolvi√≥ el gesto alzando su vaso al saber muy bien de lo que hablaba. -Se√±or -alguien empezo a golpear la puerta por el otro lado. Ambos se miraron esc√©pticamente al hacerse una idea de que esa voz solamente pod√≠a significar en una cosa, siguieron golpeando la puerta por el otro lado con tal de que la abriesen. -Abrele -le pidi√≥ a Owen ya que estaba ah√≠ cerca. Se levanto al instante y ah√≠ entonces le abri√≥ saliendo un joven guardia sobresaltado. -¬øQue sucede? -le pregunto levantando sus gafas para ver mejor. -Se√±or, no se como decirle esto, pero... ha hablado -mencion√≥ alzando sus manos en se√±al de estar mas sobresaltado de lo que ya estaba. -¬øHablado? -se cuestiono esa menci√≥n. -Si, ha hablado. -¬øQuien? El mamon de Crackpot que nunca para de estar parloteando todo el rato -dijo vacilante y entonces ambos se pusieron a reirse incr√©dulamente al o√≠r eso. -No, no me refiero a ese, me refiero a ese cabron que lleva cinco a√±os sin decir nada -les aclaro justificando que se trataba de otro individuo importante. Ah√≠ entonces tuvo un presentimiento de lo que quer√≠a decir en realidad. -¬øHa hablado? ¬ø√âl ha hablado? -Ha hablado se√±or, al final lo ha hecho. Le dirigi√≥ la mirada a Owen del cual √©l ten√≠a una mirada seria como de saber muy bien de que hablaba, frunci√≥ seriamente el ce√±o y entonces √©l se levanto decidido a investigarlo. ¬∑¬∑ El joven recluta acompa√±o a Ivon y a Owen por todo el pasillo principal donde se encontraban las celdas con los reclusos gritando y chillando sin parar al ver que el alcaide que los hab√≠a mantenido encerrados durante tiempo se encontraba por ah√≠ paseando tranquilamente como si nada. -Eh se√±or Alcaide, ¬øsabe cuantos robots se necesitan para desarmar a un cabron como usted? Solo uno, y ese soy yo -reprocho amenazantemente uno de los reclusos, este se puso a reirse. Siguieron adelante ignorando a los reclusos ya que ten√≠an otro asunto importante ahora mismo. -¬øComo ha pasado? -le pregunto al joven recluta. -Estaba recogiendo la comida en la bandeja, se lo hab√≠a comido todo sin dejar una sola miga cuando entonces me gire y o√≠ que me dec√≠a: Gracias. -¬øGracias? -critico Owen. -Si, as√≠ es, lo repiti√≥ como dos veces para que lo entendiese. -Pues yo no creo que eso sea hablar -opino Ivon tom√°ndoselo como algo no muy importante. -Ya, pero entonces me dijo algo mas, algo con rabia. -¬øQue te dijo? -le apoyo su mano encima del hombro para que se lo dijese con total sinceridad. -Me dijo que corriese, que corriese como si le estuviese persiguiendo porque iba a acabar metido en un chatarrero como el de su madre -a√±adi√≥ honestamente. Aquello hizo que ambos se mirasen al ver que ahora el asunto era mucho mas serio. -Ese t√≠o esta loco, pensaba que me iba a matar -dijo el guardia sinti√©ndose aterrado. -Descansa, de esto me ocupo yo -le pidi√≥ que se marchara por su bien y entonces acepto march√°ndose por donde vino, ah√≠ entonces le dirigi√≥ la mirada hac√≠a Owen. -¬øQue hacemos se√±or? -pregunto susceptiblemente. Ivon se quedo r√≠gido como asimil√°ndolo y entonces dijo: -Voy a hablar con √©l, quiero resolverlo -acoto decidido a comprender el asunto en si. Llegaron al fondo de toda la sala dirigiendose hac√≠a la puerta blindada que hab√≠a en medio, Owen se acerco al panel que hab√≠a en el costado y entonces pulso el pulgar sobre el rect√°ngulo turquesa, la maquina empezo a escanear la huella y entonces se puso rojo, la puerta se abri√≥ en dos hojas que se levantaron en forma de diagonal revelando un enorme fondo negro. Asomaron la cabeza observando que mas adelante se encontraba un puente luminiscente con un sujeto parado en medio y que ni se inmutaba, se miraron seriamente al saber bien donde se estaban metiendo. -¬øQuiere que le mande alguien mas se√±or? -No, d√©jamelo a mi, si algo malo sucede, estoy preparado -indico ense√±ando que ten√≠a sus rev√≥lveres metidos en su cintur√≥n, hizo un gesto con los dedos como de estar listo para la acci√≥n. -Yo estar√© aqu√≠ -acoto cumpliendo con su cometido. -Muy bien, pero si algo malo sucede, cierra la puerta, ¬øde acuerdo? -¬øY que pasara con usted? -se cuestiono -Mantenlo cerrado, solamente eso, pase lo que pase, oigas lo que oigas, no te metas -le advirti√≥ con total seriedad para que entendiese lo que ten√≠a que hacer. Owen se cuestiono esa idea ya que no iba a dejar que su alcaide muriera a manos de aquel loco que se encontraba mas adelante, pero conoci√©ndole de sobra pod√≠a entender que no le pasar√≠a nada a menos de que resolviese el asunto antes de que el otro lo empezase de mala manera. Lo dejo estar y entonces marcho metiendose al otro lado de la enorme celda. Fue cruzando aquel puente estrecho rodeado de paneles azules que hac√≠an que la mayor parte de la celda estuviese iluminada, toda la celda era una esfera abovedada con un fondo negro por donde se pod√≠a notar que hab√≠a una altura de 12 metros, sigui√≥ avanzando lentamente hasta llegar al fondo donde se encontraba una plataforma circular con el detenido levantado y vestido con un traje naranja para se√±alar que era un recluso. -Levanta la cabeza Ratchet -le ordeno soberanamente. Phineas T. Ratchet levanto la cabeza mostrando que le faltaba la aleta que ten√≠a en la cabeza, se hab√≠a cambiado el casco de su cabeza por uno que le hac√≠a la cabeza completamente plana, alzo la mirada y entonces puso una sonrisa ingenua, luego dijo: -Bienvenido se√±or Fortress -le saludo con un tono autocompasivo. -Joder, si es verdad que has hablado, cinco a√±os, ¬øporque ahora? -le pregunto absorto al ver que hab√≠a sucedido tal cual como le hab√≠an mencionado. Se enderezo y entonces se bajo del pedestal circular en el que estaba apoyado, fue avanzando unos pocos pasos hasta que ya no pudo mas, ten√≠a una cadena atada alrededor del cuello, la cadena estaba incrustada en un soporte que hab√≠a al final de la pared. -¬øNo puede aflojarme un poco las cadenas, me matan demasiado? -Nada de trucos Ratchet, ¬øque le has dicho a uno de mis guardias? -¬øPorque te importa tanto eso? -critico egoc√©ntricamente. -En esta celda todos est√°n adiestrados para no soportar ning√∫no de los comentarios insultantes de los dem√°s guardias, pero en este caso ha sucedido algo distinto, ¬øque le has dicho a ese guardia que solamente te recogi√≥ la comida para que le hayas hecho huir despavorido? -Solamente le dijo lo que ten√≠a que escuchar. -Le dijiste que corriese, ¬øte suena eso de algo? Se quedo r√≠gido sin apenas pesta√±ear cuando entonces dijo: -Quiz√°s me haya precipitado un poco. -De precipitado nada, lo has dicho con ganas, ¬øporque? ¬øPorque despu√©s de cinco a√±os has soltado la boca y has dicho eso, que explicaci√≥n ah√≠? -La √∫nica explicaci√≥n es que estoy encerrado injustamente en esta celda siendo tratado como un delincuente, ¬øde vera cree que necesito una explicaci√≥n para haberle dicho eso? -¬øLo hiciste para llamar la atenci√≥n? ¬øLo hiciste para que yo viniese? ¬øEs eso? Se quedo firme de vuelta como fingiendo que no hab√≠a nada raro. -¬øSabes que puedo dejarte de dar de comer por una semana como no me digas nada verdad? Se puso a re√≠rse a carcajadas delante de √©l, Fortress puso una mirada ingenua como pretendiendo asimilar porque se re√≠a de aquella forma, pero algo indicaba que sab√≠a algo y todo esa actuaci√≥n que estaba haciendo era simplemente para ocultar algo importante. De pronto se callo lanzando unas pocas risas que apenas pod√≠a aguantarlas. -Oh se√±or Fortress, usted es tan gracioso. -Es Alcaide Fortress maldito pedazo de escoria, y ademas, estas aqu√≠ encerrado porque tu y tu madre planeasteis la destrucci√≥n de Ciudad Robot y la aniquilaci√≥n de cientos de robots oxidados, suerte de que ese chico Hojalata cambiase las cosas porque sino, ahora mismo tu estar√≠as sufriendo un castigo mucho peor que este -le argumento hac√≠endole entender que estaba ah√≠ por una cierta raz√≥n especifica que parec√≠a no comprender del todo. -Ese Hojalata jamas debi√≥ de meterse en mis asuntos. -Lo se, y me alegro de eso -indico poniendo una sonrisa ingenua para contradecirle. Cambio su expresi√≥n a una mirada vac√≠a como de querer ignorar ese gesto que hac√≠a. -¬øTe das cuenta de que todo esto ha empezado por culpa tuya verdad? -La culpa es de mi madre que quer√≠a acabar con todos los oxidados, tanto que puso a mi padre colgando del techo por in√∫til, pero al menos no lo hizo conmigo, √©l me dio una oportunidad, me dio una oportunidad para ganarme algo mejor, y entonces me ense√±o el poder de la burocracia. -¬ø√âl poder de la burocracia? -se intrigo al o√≠r esa menci√≥n. -Si, el poder de la burocracia, ya sabe, hacerse el poderoso por encima de aquellos que se creen que pueden controlarlo todo, cuando en realidad lo √∫nico que controlan es aquello que pueden manejar f√°cilmente, yo lo que hice fue controlar a las compa√±√≠as de creaci√≥n de actualizaciones que en vez de haber estado creando nuevas mejores siguieron construyendo las mismas cosas chapuceras que ya ten√≠an desde hace varios a√±os, ¬øporque cojones hacen eso? ¬øPorque? -Lo hacen, porque a nadie le interesa ser moderno, a todo el mundo lo √∫nico que le interesa es ser lo que son, tanto si son chapuceros como un mont√≥n de chatarra andante, pero no, tu jamas lo comprender√°s, porque vives con todos los lujos del mundo y como jamas has sabido vivir de la miseria tu jamas te har√°s idea de lo que se siente vivir con ellos, y por eso mismo, te ha ca√≠do esto, te has quedado encerrado aqu√≠ conmigo por haberte comportado como un gilipollas -le explic√≥ Fortress hac√≠endole entender la raz√≥n de porque estaba encerrado en esa celda cuando podr√≠a haber seguido estando donde estaba antes. Ratchet se enderezo de vuelta poniendose en una expresi√≥n autoritaria. -Dime, ¬øcu√©ntame mas sobre ese poder de la burocracia, de que sirve exactamente? -El poder de la burocracia es una manera de hacerse con una compa√±√≠a que vende cierto tipo de productos que le hacen ganarse millones de d√≥lares tras estar usando un cierto tipo de autoridad sobre los compradores y sobre aquellos para los que trabajan, si no juegas bien tus cartas acabaras perdiendo y no te quedara nada, y yo jugu√© bien mis cartas, me hice con la compa√±√≠a de Gran Soldador cuando este se marcho, ah√≠ empece a aprovecharme y hacer lo que el viejo gordinfl√≥n nunca hizo, crear un nuevo estilo de actualizaciones mas asequibles para la nueva √©poca, cosa que logre, sino fuera porque los dem√°s robots de la zona se estaban revelando a medida que un 5% de ellos se estaban cayendo a pedazos, por eso met√≠ las barredoras, para que se los llevasen a todos al chatarrero y los quemasen de una vez por todas, as√≠ entonces yo habr√≠a tenido mucha mas importancia de lo que cualquier otro jefe podr√≠a haber tenido -argumento resumiendo todos los hechos relacionados con la burocracia y de como funcionaban, as√≠ fue como se hizo el jefe de la compa√±√≠a de Gran Soldador y se aprovecho de todo el mundo. -¬øEras un Dios verdad? -objet√≥ poniendo una sonrisa ingenua al ver por donde iba. -No, los dioses est√°n en las nubes, yo solamente era un jefe, un l√≠der, un hombre dispuesto a sacrificar todo lo que ten√≠a para tener mucho mas, dinero, actualizaciones, fama, y mujeres, ay, eso si que eran buenos tiempos, lastima que Hojalata me lo quitase todo -aclaro poniendo una expresi√≥n de disgusto al acordarse de como hab√≠a acabado toda su gloria. -Si, una lastima, pero... te lo merec√≠as. -¬øMe lo merec√≠a? -Si, fijate bien, te hiciste con una compa√±√≠a que ya estaba bien como estaba, todo el mundo adoraba lo que hac√≠an, hasta que de pronto Gran Soldador desapareci√≥ misteriosamente, pero hay algo que no entiendo de todo eso, ¬øcomo hiciste para que ese \"gordinfl√≥n\" se esfumara? -Cuando empezaron las redadas por la falta de buenas actualizaciones, Gran Soldador quedo re√±ido bajo una gran depresi√≥n, ah√≠ entonces yo me met√≠ y le insist√≠ en que le dejase la compa√±√≠a a otra persona, a alguien en quien confiase, y ese era yo, en aquel entonces yo era un poco mas joven e ingenuo, me ca√≠a bien, era mi mentor, pero despu√©s de sus impertinentes ideas empece a cansarme de todo eso, sent√≠a que aquel viejo se hab√≠a vuelto un autentico pesado jodidamente insufrible, ten√≠a que quit√°rmelo de encima, as√≠ que entonces me met√≠ en su cabeza y le di la idea de retirarse, pero sab√≠a que aunque se retirara todo el mundo me habr√≠a reprochado que regrese, as√≠ que entonces decid√≠ tomar la idea de hacer creer que √©l seguir√≠a estando en la compa√±√≠a cuando en realidad lo mande a refugiarse en su casa ya que sab√≠a bien que era lo bastante tonto para quedarse escondido ah√≠ por toda la eternidad, y funcion√≥, por un tiempo. -¬øY despu√©s de eso te volviste el jefe de todo no? -Me volv√≠ el hombre que mi madre quer√≠a ser, pero a pesar de todo eso me quede halagado, lo ten√≠a todo, fama, fortuna, atenci√≥n, y todas las mujeres que pod√≠a desear, aunque eso duro muy poco. Ivon asinti√≥ pensativo al ver donde estaba yendo a parar todo lo que le estaba contando, se conoc√≠a de sobra toda la historia, pero vi√©ndolo desde su perspectiva le resultaba mucho mas interesante. -¬øSabes una cosa Phineas? -Ratchet, si me lo permite. -De acuerdo, Ratchet -se rectifico, a pesar de todo lo que me estas contando, hay una cosa que a√∫n sigo sin entender, ¬øsi lo ten√≠as todo? Porque segu√≠as haciendo caso de tu madre. -Porque ella estaba encima de mi, ella me ten√≠a controlado, ten√≠a controlado a mi padre, pero a pesar de todo siempre supe como animarla, dandole aquello que mas le gustaba, le regale las barredoras de ultima generaci√≥n, unas que podr√≠an barrer por completo a todos los oxidados de una vez por todas y as√≠ entonces reinar√≠amos como los aut√©nticos amos de la perfecc√≠on, yo ser√≠a el nuevo jefe de todo un mundo nuevo, mientras ella se har√≠a cargo de todo, pero Hojalata y sus amigos me lo quitaron todo y ahora tengo que vivir atado aqu√≠ por nada. -¬øPor nada? -frunci√≥ el ce√±o extra√±ado ante esa menci√≥n. -Si, ¬øque pasa con eso? -Te sigues sin dar cuenta del problema ¬øverdad? Te hiciste con el control de una empresa que actuaba como el centro de todo Ciudad Robot, quisiste matar al jefe original, y creaste tus propias maquinas de matar para liquidar a un mont√≥n de robots que apenas hab√≠an hecho algo en sus vidas, y lo peor de todo, quisiste apoderarte de la ciudad para hacerla a tu imagen y semejanza, eso para mi, es ser un dictador, y tu, has acabado as√≠ por culpa tuya, solamente tuya -le concreto poniendo todos los hechos que le hac√≠an ver como el autentico criminal que era en realidad. Ratchet ni se inmuto, se quedo con esa cara r√≠gida como de guardarle rencor por lo que le estaba contando sobre lo que hab√≠a hecho, y parec√≠a no gustarle mucho. -¬øVas a admitir que te equivocaste con tus propias decisiones? -No, pero si pienso decirte una cosa. -¬ø√âl que? -cambio su expresi√≥n a una amarga al tomar eso como una provocaci√≥n. -Puede que me haya quedado sin la empresa y sin madre, pero eso no significa que este solo. Aquello hizo que Fortress tuviese el miedo de pensar que ten√≠a un complice fuera de la celda. -¬øDe que estas hablando? -le pregunto en se√±al de exigirle que le diese una respuesta. -Veras: mi madre, fue criada en uno de los peores lugares de esta ciudad, un suburbio que ahora me parece que ya no existe, pero antes de eso ese lugar era pura maldad, era un lugar donde todo aquel que se metiese podr√≠a acabar convirtiendose en su propio enemigo, mi madre aprendi√≥ de toda esa gente y cuando supo bien en que se estaban convirtiendo, se dio cuenta de lo que ten√≠a que hacer. -¬øQue hizo exactamente? -se empezo a interesar por la historia. -Empezo a juntar a su propio grupo de robots desalmados que nunca antes hab√≠an hecho algo √∫til en sus vidas, los recluto y los obligo a trabajar con ella a cambio de darles un nuevo mundo en donde ellos pudiesen vivir pl√°cidamente, creo la Chop Shop para as√≠ mantener a todos los robots como ella trabajando juntos y que as√≠ alg√∫n dia pudiesen haber dado lo mejor de si, y casi lo consigui√≥. -¬øTe refieres a todos los trabajadores de la chatarrer√≠a del subsuelo? -Si y no, todos los trabajadores acabaron muertos o destrozados a causa de la gente que junto ese maldito ni√±o Hojalata, pero ellos no eran los √∫nicos, hay mucha mas gente al otro lado de estas paredes, al otro lado de Ciudad Robot, esperando su momento. -¬øSu momento de qu√©? -reaccion√≥ enfurismado al ver que si era cierto que ten√≠a c√≥mplices. -Su momento para terminar lo que mi madre jamas pude hacer, acabar con los oxidados de una vez por todas -declaro abiertamente y entonces se puso a re√≠r a carcajadas de una manera tan inveros√≠mil que no paraba de ir movi√©ndose de un lado a otro, se o√≠a el sonido de las cadenas rechinando. Fortress no pod√≠a soportarlo, esto significaba lo peor que le pod√≠a pasar ahora mismo. -¬øQuienes son? ¬øQuienes vienen? -le exigi√≥ euf√≥ricamente. -No lo se, mi madre jamas me lo dijo, pero si se que en cuanto vieron las noticias hace cinco a√±os sobre su muerte, sabr√°n muy bien lo que tienen que hacer -indico poniendo una sonrisa ingenua como de saber muy bien que todo estaba perfectamente planeado. Fortress se hizo a un lado aterrado al ver que alguien iba a atacar la prision solamente para rescatar a Ratchet de su celda, eso era algo que no iba a permitir. -Yo que tu volver√≠a con los tuyos -le sugiri√≥ ingenuamente. -Y lo har√©, pero ten por seguro esto Ratchet, jamas permitir√© que salgas de esta celda, no sin que yo haga algo al respecto -le aviso decret√°ndole con el dedo que iba a hacer todo lo posible para mantenerle encerrado donde estaba. -Pues lo espero -puso de vuelta esa sonrisa ingenua como de creerse que verdaderamente lo ten√≠a bien f√°cil como para librarse de su condena. Fortress le echo una mirada lasciva y entonces se alejo volviendo al final del pasillo donde Owen le estaba esperando, se junto con √©l y le dijo: -Avisa a todo el personal, quiero que cada guardia este preparado por cualquier cosa que suceda, no pienso permitir que ese cabron salga de aqu√≠, ¬øentendido? -le ordeno expl√≠citamente. -Si se√±or -lo confirmo estando de acuerdo. Fortress se marcho alejandose de ah√≠ quedando solamente Owen para mirar una vez mas a la cara de Ratchet, estaba lejos pero pod√≠a ver que le estaba gui√±ando el ojo de forma incr√©dula, Owen no le hizo caso y entonces cerro la puerta ignor√°ndole por completo. Lo dejaron a oscuras otra vez en su propia celda. FIN DEL SEGUNDO SEGMENTO.[Chapter 3] ROBOTS: LAS PRECUELAS Este fanfic ha sido presentado por Dimitrix Enterprises y Dimitrix Inc. SEGMENTO 3: CUEST√çON DE LEALTAD Un coche estrecho, largo y negro atraviesa la ciudad de Tecnobeta pasando por delante de todos sus edificios repletos de luces de neon y carteles de publicidad holograficos, la mayor√≠a eran todos relacionados con refrescos y comidas mientras que el resto se trataban de anuncios relacionados con Rodney Hojalata donde pon√≠a su cara bien enorme, luego lo cambiaba a un logo de Industrias Gran Soldador como una se√±al de garant√≠a de la creaci√≥n de un mundo mejor. Dentro del coche el individuo que iba en la parte trasera ve√≠a ese anuncio y no lo pod√≠a soportar, sent√≠a tal desprecio que no pudo evitar hacer un gesto con los dedos de ir apret√°ndoselos con fuerza al imaginarse la sensaci√≥n que tendr√≠a estar delante de √©l y arrancarle sus partes. Sigui√≥ avanzando hasta aparcar delante de una discoteca en el centro donde pon√≠a: La casa de Maximillian, un robot de aspecto moderno de piel gris y bien lucida se acerco hac√≠a la puerta del coche en la parte trasera y la abri√≥ haciendo salir al individuo que estaba dentro, era Arcturus Von Sprocket saliendo del coche con una mirada persuasiva, se puso de pie mientras ten√≠a en sus manos su bast√≥n de poder, del otro sali√≥ el Triturador que miraba con la expresi√≥n de intriga que su jefe solo que para √©l todo esto no le sorprend√≠a para nada. -Se√±or Sprocket -se presento otro robot que intento de estrecharle la mano, era un agente. -¬ø√âsta √©l aqu√≠? -le pregunto soberanamente. No supo que contestarle, no estaba preparado para o√≠r esa respuesta. -Si, le esta esperando dentro -confirmo atolondrado. -Bien -dijo aliviado, golpeo su bast√≥n contra el suelo y entonces se giro dirigi√©ndose hac√≠a Triturador que esperaba una respuesta suya, le indico con la cabeza. Lo comprendi√≥ devolvi√©ndole el gesto, cerro la puerta y entonces doblo por el lado trasero del coche y se junto con Sprocket del cual ambos marcharon atravesando la puerta de entrada. Fueron pasaron por un estrecho pasillo oscuro repleto de varios letreros de neon colocados en varios lugares de los costados, tan fuertes eran las luces que cegaban con solamente mirarlos de cerca pero los ignoraban por completo, continuaron avanzando hasta acabar delante de un robot bastante robusto y que ten√≠a en sus manos detector de armas en sus manos, se juntaron y entonces el hombre puso la palma de su mano encima para frenarlos, se dispuso a chequearlos apoyando su detector encima pero entonces el agente que ven√≠a con ellos les dijo: -No ser√° necesario -le aviso seriamente. El hombre frunci√≥ seriamente el ce√±o y entonces se hizo a un lado dej√°ndoles pasar, pasaron al otro lado mostrando una cara de ingenuidad, se notaba que Triturador se estaba riendo de √©l aprop√≥sito. Pasaron al interior del club y se encontraron con una discoteca llena de luces de neon de varios colores chillones que iban girando por toda la sala, robots j√≥venes bailando despavoridamente y unas cuantas robots strippers bailando sobre un palo de bronce del cual se iban restregando de formas bastante curiosas, hab√≠an otros robots pero mucho mas viejos que estaban sentados en un obre unos sof√°s acolchados que hab√≠a en un rinc√≥n mirando a las bailarinas con una expresi√≥n de seriedad y desinter√©s, era como si para ellos lo √∫nico que estuviesen viendo era algo tan normal como la vida misma, uno de ellos le paso un tornillo y ella se lo guardo entre las esquinas sobresalientes de su cuerpo y actualizaciones. -Ah√≠ esta -dijo el Triturador se√±alando hac√≠a el frente. Observaron a un robot amarillo con la cabeza cuadrada y con una boca de dientes triangulados fumandose un puro bien gordo, era Maximillian Zeta, estaba sentado en una mesa rodeada un par de mujeres robots que le iban haciendo masajes en los hombros mientras jugaba al poker con grupo de tres robots trajeados. Ambos se miraron esc√©pticamente al saber muy bien lo que ten√≠an que hacer. Marcharon lentamente hac√≠a √©l del cual ni siquiera notaba que ellos se estaban acercando. -...y yo le dije, comprate una tuerca en otra parte -esbozo relatando un chiste, todos se rieron a carcajadas mientras √©l soltaba una risotada bastante tonta e inveros√≠mil. -Se√±or Maximillian -se presento delante de √©l con una expresi√≥n seria. Maximillian se enderezo mientras se sacaba el puro de la boca haciendo soltar el humo que ten√≠a metido dentro, carraspeo pensativo al mirarles fijamente. -¬øSe√±or Sprocket? -pregunto en tono de saludo al verle ah√≠ delante. -Se√±or Maximillian -espeto devolvi√©ndole el saludo. -¬øEra ahora? -se dirigi√≥ hac√≠a todos sus agentes que ten√≠an a su alrededor. Todos le afirmaron la cabeza se√±alando que estaba en lo cierto. -Maldita sea, dejadme aqu√≠ t√≠os -exigi√≥ amargamente y entonces todos los presentes se levantaron recogiendo sus cosas y dejando a Maximillian solo delante de la mesa. Sprocket se sent√≥ en la silla que hab√≠a delante mientras Triturador se quedo parado donde estaba. -¬øCre√≠a que √≠bamos a tener una conversac√≠on menos ruidosa? -objet√≥ con tono persuasivo. -Y yo que pensaba que lo √≠bamos a hacer cuando cambiasen el aceite a las vacas -se ri√≥ descaradamente mientras soltaba el humo de su boca. Sprocket se quedo mir√°ndole con una expresi√≥n r√≠gida, no se estaba divirtiendo. -Cre√≠a que ten√≠as algo de sentido del humor. -Y lo tuve, hasta que descubr√≠ que mi hermana muri√≥ desintegrada en su propio vertedero. -Siento mucho lo que le sucedi√≥, parec√≠a una buena mujer. -No era solamente una buena mujer, era una reina, y ese maldito Hojalata la hizo caer de su trono de chatarra -indico moviendo su boca de tal manera que se o√≠a como cruj√≠an sus dientes. -¬øEntonces porque no vas a por √©l en vez de estar perdiendo el tiempo conmigo? -Ir√© a por √©l, a su momento -se acomodo en la silla mientras se pon√≠a con las manos cruzadas. Solt√≥ una peque√±a risilla sarc√°stica al entender por donde iba. -¬øQuien es tu amigo? ¬øAlguien construido con los restos del chatarrero de tu hermana? Aquello hizo que Triturador soltase un gemido como de sentirse insultado a causa de ese comentario, dio un paso adelante pero entonces Sprocket le levanto la mano en se√±al de que se detuviera, se hizo hac√≠a atr√°s sintiendo que eso no iba a quedar ah√≠. -Controlale un poco. -Vayamos al grano, ¬øtienes lo que quiero? -Por supuesto -confirmo y entonces chasqueo los dedos. Al instante otro robot llego trayendo consigo un malet√≠n de color marr√≥n, lo puso contra la mesa y entonces lo abri√≥ mostrando unos papeles enrollados que ten√≠an algo escrito por detr√°s. -¬øSon n√≥? -pregunto con tono persuasivo para corroborar que era lo que quer√≠a. -Lo son, los he estado viendo y he de decir que son bastante curiosos, pero no entiendo de que va en realidad -comento dudoso de no entender de que iba todo eso. -Y no lo entender√≠as, porque esto no se trata de algo que todo el mundo haya visto hasta ahora -espeto considerablemente y entonces se acerco dispuesto a agarrar el malet√≠n cuando de pronto Maximillian lo cerro de golpe antes de que lo cogiese. Se quedo mir√°ndole con una expresi√≥n de no estar interesado en d√°rselo. -¬øTienes lo que quiero? Carraspeo pensativo al ver por donde iba. -Si, lo tengo, Triturador. El Triturador se puso delante de la mesa, abri√≥ un hueco del interior de su brazo y de ah√≠ saco un peque√±o dispositivo USB de color negro que se lo puso delante suyo. -Estupendo -dijo halagado y entonces agarro el USB donde se quedo mir√°ndolo fijamente-. Siempre supe que serias un hombre de confianza se√±or Sprocket. -¬øPuedo ahora? -Puedes, pero antes de eso... -le levanto el dedo. -¬øQue? -empezo a enfurru√±arse al ver que resultaba imposible confiar en √©l. -Cu√©ntame una cosa -froto las palmas de sus manos mientras se acomodaba pl√°cidamente-. Dime, ¬øcomo fue la relaci√≥n que tuviste con tu hermana? -¬øCon mi hermana? -frunci√≥ el ce√±o extra√±ado ante esa pregunta. -Si, dime, ¬øcomo hizo tu hermana para tener a todo un ejercito de chatarreros trabajando para ella mientras que tu solamente tienes a un mont√≥n de bravucones siendo entrenados por tus variopintos amigos, ¬øque hizo ella para ser la reina de los desperdicios? -Eso no es asunto tuyo -protesto el Triturador neg√°ndose a aceptar esa conversac√≠on. -Tranquilo Triturador, si el quiere saber mi pasado Archelina, lo sabr√° sin mas -le levanto la mano en se√±al de permit√≠rselo mientras soltaba un peque√±o serio gemido. Maximillian solt√≥ una peque√±a risotada como de creerse muy orgulloso por hacerle callar. -¬øQue quieres saber de ella exactamente? -¬øPorque no estuviste con ella cuando paso lo que le paso? ¬øQue sucedi√≥ que hicisteis que ambos os separaseis tan pronto? -le miro fijamente esperando una respuesta interesante. Se quedo pensando en eso mientras soltaba un suspiro de dudas ya que no sab√≠a que decirle, pero viendo que si no lo hac√≠a √©l se quedar√≠a con lo que necesitaba, pens√≥ en contarle lo mejor que pod√≠a sacar de momento, se acomodo y entonces dijo: -Cuando nuestro padre muri√≥, ambos tuvimos que tomar ciertos caminos aleatorios para que as√≠ si uno de los dos consegu√≠a algo bueno, al menos tendr√≠a el √©xito asegurado para el otro, yo me quede con la gente que provocaba problemas por todos los barrios marginales, mientras que ella se uni√≥ a los trabajadores de los chatarreros donde ah√≠ encontr√≥ al amor de su vida, se enamoro de √©l y al cabo de unos a√±os mas tarde acabaron cas√°ndose, ella tuvo un hijo y cuando me entere de eso, apenas pudo hacer algo para conocer a mi sobrino, yo ya estaba preparando mi plan para poder vengarme del mundo por no haber obtenido algo mejor -resumi√≥ toda su historia hasta el dia en que todo cambio para √©l cuando descubri√≥ que su sobrino Ratchet hab√≠a sido creado por su hermana. -Vaya, y yo que pensaba que apenas tendr√≠as algo de remordimientos, pero me doy cuenta de que si lo tienes, eres todo un ser triste -dijo burlonamente Maximillian tomandose la historia como un acto de debilidad al ver que Sprocket no era lo que √©l pensaba. Sprocket se enfado con eso y golpeo tan fuerte la mesa que la abollo, el sonido del metal reson√≥ por toda la sala haciendo que todo el mundo se enterase de eso y se quedaron mir√°ndoles at√≥nitos. Se quedo todo el local casi en silencio sino fuese por la m√∫sica robotica que resonaba a pesar de que el DJ de la barra del otro lado no estuviese tocando la mezcla con una sola mano. Maximillian se quedo tan indeciso al presenciar eso que no tuvo mas opci√≥n que disculparse, se dirigi√≥ hac√≠a el publico hac√≠endoles un gesto con la mano para hacer que continuase la fiesta como si no sucediese nada malo, inmediatamente el DJ volvi√≥ a tocar y de ah√≠ todo el mundo continuo como si no pasase nada, seguir√≠an bebiendo y las bailas siguieron restregandose sin parar por las barras. -Perdoname por esto -se disculpo mostrandose avergonzado por ese comentario. -Lo que sea con tal de darme lo que quiero, te he contado lo que quer√≠as saber, ahora d√°melo -le exigi√≥ amargado, se notaba que eso lo llevo mal. -No, a√∫n no ha terminado, quiero saber que pasa despu√©s, ¬øcomo hiciste al final para conocer a tu sobrino? -le volvi√≥ a presionar para que siguiera contando lo que no quer√≠a que dijese. -¬øHasta cuando vamos a seguir as√≠? -critico Triturador. -Hasta que yo lo diga, est√°is en mi casa, mi casa, mis reglas, ¬øya lo sab√©is? -se acomodo hac√≠a atr√°s mientras cruzaba sus brazos por detr√°s suyo, estaba poniendo esa posici√≥n para dejar claro que √©l era el que estaba al mando y pod√≠a hacer lo que quisiera con la situaci√≥n. Aquello hizo que Sprocket mirase directamente al Triturador de reojo, este pudo entender esa mirada y entonces se puso en una posici√≥n autoritaria como de estar apunto de atacar. -¬øQue pasa? -se cuestiono al mirarle descaradamente. -¬øSabes donde encontr√© a mi amigo el Triturador? -No, ¬øde donde, de un...? -No sigas por ah√≠ -le aviso se√±al√°ndole con el dedo para impedir que volviese a comentar lo mismo de antes ya que eso solamente lo har√≠a empeorar a√∫n mas. Asinti√≥ entendiendo lo que quer√≠a decir con eso. -√âl antes trabajaba como le√±ador en un peque√±o pueblo, cortaba arboles todo el dia para que as√≠ luego pudi√©semos sacar hojas, papeles y dem√°s cosas parecidas, se paso tanto tiempo cortando, que al final sus jefes le acabaron recluyendo, le echaron, ¬øy sabes porque lo hicieron? -No, ¬øporque? -Porque acabaron recibiendo a otro le√±ador que ten√≠a unos accesorios mucho mejores que los que √©l ya ten√≠a incorporados en su cuerpo, como Triturador ya no les serv√≠a de utilidad, pusieron a uno nuevo, a alguien que tuviese mejor aspecto, le echaron, y nunca mas volvieron a saber de √©l, hasta que entonces una noche dio el tiro de gracia, se ocupo de echarles la bronca a sus jefes por haberles despedido despu√©s de haber estado tanto tiempo trabajando para ellos, les dio su merecido, solo que claro, acabo siendo demasiado violento, trituro a todos los due√±os de la compa√±√≠a hasta dejar solamente un mont√≥n de chatarra desperdiciada por todas partes, ¬øte imaginas lo que es estar en una sala y observar como un mont√≥n de robots han sido partidos? Pues eso mismo -le resumi√≥ toda la historia de como el Triturador se acabo convirtiendo en el salvaje que era ahora. Maximillian no quer√≠a mostrar ning√∫na reacci√≥n inoportuna pero al final no pudo evitarlo, miro hac√≠a el Triturador observando que le miraba con aquella r√≠gida sin pesta√±ear, se quedo pensando en la posibilidad de que todo lo que dec√≠a iba muy en serio, ¬øera posible que hubiese hecho todo eso √©l solo? Viendo el aspecto que ten√≠a, era una posibilidad. -Despu√©s de lo que hizo, todo el mundo se puso a buscarle, lo persiguieron d√≠a tras d√≠a, hasta que al final √©l ya no pudo mas, quedo tan agotado y tan vac√≠o de aceite que decidi√≥ esconderse en un lugar oscuro para morir por sus pecados, pero entonces le llego su salvaci√≥n. Esbozo el Triturador una sonrisa ingenua seguido de una risa sarc√°stica, Maximillian empezo a dudar otra vez ya que ten√≠a sus dudas sobre por donde estaba yendo la historia. -Yo le encontr√©, le salve, le cure de sus defectos y acabe haciendo que aquel pobre le√±ador que siempre le ten√≠an infravalorado, ahora tiene todas las de ganar, me ha estado sirviendo durante estos a√±os, y nunca ha cuestionado mis ordenes de ning√∫n modo, no se√±or. -¬øEntonces ahora tienes que pagar su deuda, verdad? -¬øDeuda? ¬øQue deuda -¬øYa sabes? Como Sprocket te salvo de morir deshidratado, ahora tu le tienes que hacer lo mismo por √©l y as√≠ entonces ser√°s libre -le aclaro se√±alando que la relaci√≥n que ten√≠a con Triturador era como de un mutuo acuerdo por el que zanjar. -Oh oh oh -esbozo otra risa ingenua-. Estas muy equivocado conmigo. -¬øQue quieres decir? -Veras, una vez que alguien se une a mi, no lo hago porque tenga una deuda conmigo, lo hago porque todos ellos han pasado por una deplorable situaci√≥n y necesitan que alguien les ayude a ser mejores que antes, y yo he hecho b√°sicamente eso, pero no quiere decir que porque tenga que salvarles, significa que tenga una deuda pendiente con ellos, todos ellos trabajan conmigo porque tienen algo que tu jamas entender√°s tu dichosa vida Maximillian, y es una cuesti√≥n de lealtad -asomo su cabeza para mirarle con una cara amenazadora para se√±alar por donde iba el asunto. -¬øCuesti√≥n de lealtad? -La lealtad es una de las pocas cosas que me puedo permitir en este mundo, si no tengo eso, no tengo hombres, y si no tengo hombres, de que me sirve que me tengan miedo, y Triturador ha sido uno de mis mas fieles servidos porque ha sido tan leal, que me resulta imposible de que tome cualquier decisi√≥n por su cuenta, ¬øverdad que si Triturador? -Si, me encanta demasiado esto como para irme a otra parte -contesto √©l. -¬øLo vez Maximillian? Eso es lealtad, ¬øpero que tienes tu con tus hombres exactamente? ¬øEh? Aquello hizo entrar a Maximillian en un completo estado de p√°nico ya que ahora no sab√≠a que hacer, giro la mirada observando que uno de sus hombres estaba detr√°s de Triturador dispuesto a matarle, afirmo meneando lentamente la cabeza para que no se notara, le dejo hacer lo que quisiera con tal de quit√°rselos de encima. -Triturador, podr√≠as... -Si -obedeci√≥ y entonces su mano derecha se giro acoplandose a su mecanismo externo, del otro lado surgi√≥ una enorme sierra dentuda que se encendi√≥ en cuanto se incorporo al brazo entero. Se giro y r√°pidamente clavo al robot que ten√≠a detr√°s con su sierra del cual le perforo todo la parte delantera de su cuerpo y sigui√≥ cort√°ndosela a medida que iba avanzando. Maximillian lo estaba viendo y no pudo evitar como mataba a uno de sus agentes, se quedo con la boca medio abierta ya que eso resultaba lo mas horrible que hab√≠a visto nunca, miro a Sprocket y este estaba sonriendo pl√°cidamente como si le gustase lo que le estaba haciendo. Triturador termino de cortar al medio del cual le dejo un enorme agujero por todo su cuerpo, quedo con una mirada perdida y ah√≠ entonces se cayo al suelo del cual se desarmo en un mont√≥n de piezas que se esparcieron por todo el √°rea, la cabeza quedo intacta pero los ojos no, Triturador se ri√≥ entre dientes y luego giro su sierra haciendo que volviese a ponerse el brazo. -Eres un jodido monstruo -le reprocho Maximillian. -Si, ¬øy que? -objet√≥ inmiscuy√©ndose en ese comentario, para √©l le daba completamente igual. Ah√≠ entonces todos los agentes que estaban protegiendo a Maximillian se reunieron sacando sus armas y se pusieron a ir rodeando a los dos, Triturador ve√≠a bien lo que estaba pasando y supo bien lo que ten√≠a que hacer, levanto su mano izquierda y activo un peque√±o bot√≥n que hab√≠a alojado secretamente arriba en su mu√±eca, lo activo y entonces de sus nudillos sali√≥ un borde sobresaliente de color dorado con pinchos en sus extremos. -¬øQue va a hacer? -pregunto Maximillian todav√≠a mas asustado que antes. -Ya lo veras -dijo Sprocket echando una mirada de reojo. Triturador alzo su mano hac√≠a arriba y entonces esta se solt√≥ y sali√≥ disparada como un cohete, choco contra el techo y de ah√≠ reboto en el suelo haciendo que luego fuese volando en c√≠rculos mientras iba chocandose contra todos los agentes, les iba partiendo la cara a todos mientras yendo uno por uno hasta acabar volviendo a engancharse a su mano como si de un bumer√°n se tratase. Maximillian asomo la cabeza observando como estaban sus agentes, todos ten√≠an la mand√≠bula partida, uno se quito la mano de encima mostr√°ndola toda doblada hac√≠a un costado, de pronto su cara se desarmo al igual que todos los agentes, todos cayeron noqueados contra el suelo. -¬øY bien? Me lo vas a dar o no -exigi√≥ Sprocket queriendo que ahora le diese el malet√≠n por las buenas ya que despu√©s de esto tendr√≠a que estar completamente convencido de lo que vio. -Tomalo, y largate, y no vuelvas -le entrego el malet√≠n d√°ndoselo nerviosamente. Sprocket lo abri√≥ y observo que estaba todo tal y como √©l quer√≠a, lo cerro sinti√©ndose a gusto. -Ha estado bien hacer negocios contigo -se levanto mientras se acomodaba su t√∫nica. -¬øNegocios? Has matado a todos mis hombres por nada -le critico injustificando esa menci√≥n. -Por nada, no, claro que no, lo he hecho porque tu eres muy poco confiable, no tienes lealtad, no tienes prejuicios, no tienes escr√∫pulos, solamente eres un vil cobarde que se esconde tras estos muros y esos trajes ajustados, no eres nada, y jamas lo ser√°s, Maximillian Zeta -decreto Sprocket justific√°ndole la autentica verdad quien era en realidad. -Por favor, marchate -le insisti√≥ mientras se escond√≠a debajo de la mesa. Ambos se miraron esc√©pticamente y ah√≠ entonces a Sprocket se le ocurri√≥ una idea. -En realidad, creo que a√∫n no nos vamos -dijo ingenuamente. -¬øQue dices? -Tenemos otra cosa pendiente por hacer. -¬øQue otra cosa? Hab√©is venido aqu√≠ a joderme la noche en mi propio club, porque no os larg√°is de aqu√≠ de una puta vez y as√≠ todos contentos, ¬øeh? -No, no lo haremos hasta que te demos a ti una peque√±a lecci√≥n. -¬øQue lecci√≥n? -Veras Maximillian, hay algo mas acerca de la lealtad que tu no comprendes con precisi√≥n y es que la lealtad no es tambi√©n para los amigos de uno mismo, sino para aquellos con los que tambi√©n negocia, y tu has sido muy desleal al estar negociando conmigo, y cuando uno hace eso, recibe un severo castigo, y tu amigo m√≠o, vas a tener que ser castigado por tu falta de lealtad. -¬øCastigo? -empezo a asustarse mucho mas que antes. -Si -afirmo Sprocket y entonces Triturador se puso delante de Maximillian mientras iba removi√©ndose la mano izquierda de su lugar, estaba dispuesto a hacerle algo. Aquello le dejo claro que estaba en un completo peligro y no hab√≠a nadie quien le salvase ahora. -¬øNo podemos hacer un trato? -Hacer un trato es de cobardes, y yo no hago tratos con chusma como tu. -No Sprocket, espera, ¬°espera! -grito sofocantemente Maximillian mientras el Triturador le iba agarrando con fuerza el cuerpo hasta o√≠rse un chasquido. ¬∑¬∑ Sprocket y Triturador regresaron a la limusina donde volvieron a sentarse en sus respectivos sitios, abri√≥ el malet√≠n y observo encantado de lo que ten√≠a dentro, sonr√≠o orgulloso de lo que hab√≠a conseguido, asinti√≥ c√≥modamente en su asiento y entonces dijo: -Avisa a Screch, quiero que sepa que volvamos y que tenemos lo que hemos venido a buscar, quiero que prepare a sus hombres para la extracci√≥n -le pidi√≥ expresamente. -Si se√±or -obedeci√≥ lealmente Triturador y entonces cog√≠o una tableta digital que hab√≠a en un costado del asiento, se dispuso a llamar pero entonces tuvo una duda, miro a Sprocket y le dijo-: ¬øNo cree que deber√≠amos haberlo dejado en otra posici√≥n? Pens√≥ detenidamente en eso. -No lo creo, de todas formas ya saben muy bien a quien culpar -opino ingenuamente. Triturador se ri√≥ estando de acuerdo en su opini√≥n y entonces la limusina avanzo march√°ndose del lugar, dieron la vuelta y siguieron el mismo trayecto de antes. El cuerpo de Maximilian se encontraba atado de pies y manos sobre uno de los palos de aluminio que usaban las strippers, ten√≠a la mand√≠bula torcida hac√≠a abajo como para que no hablase y estaba dado vuelta con la cabeza para abajo, todo el local estaba destruido con las mesas tiradas por ambas partes del local y con los agentes muertos en varios rincones. FIN DEL TERCER SEGMENTO.[Chapter 4] ROBOTS: LAS PRECUELAS Este fanfic ha sido presentado por Dimitrix Enterprises y Dimitrix Inc. SEGMENTO 4: NO HAY LUGAR PARA BUENOS AQUI El agente Miles Thrower surge de un estrecho callej√≥n y se mete en una calle repleta de robots que van conversando de un lado para otro, hay tantos que no sabe si alguno le mira o no, va vestido con una sudadera con capucha que le tapa la mitad de la cara permitiendo que as√≠ nadie le reconozca aunque su aspecto da mucho de si en la situaci√≥n en la que se encontraba. Se hab√≠a metido en la zona mas rebuscada de toda Ciudad Robot, en los suburbios donde cualquiera pasa desapercibido de la ley, y √©l siendo la ley era como estar meti√©ndose en la boca de un lobo, la mayor√≠a de los polic√≠as no se meten ah√≠ porque siempre ocurren todo tipo de problemas, pero necesitaba hacerlo a pesar de todo, estaban desapareciendo inventores, √©l investigaba ese caso, sab√≠a que algo les estaba pasando porque era imposible que unos reputados inventores que han estado trabajando desde hace a√±os con Gran Soldador desaparezcan de la noche a la ma√±ana, algo estaba ocurriendo y √©l iba a descubrirlo aunque eso le costase la vida, o algo mas que eso. Mientras iba andando, pod√≠a ver las caras de los robots mas desalmados que hab√≠a por los callejones de enfrente, ve√≠a a unos con el mismo aspecto que √©l ten√≠a, con sudadera de capuchas para que no se les viese la cara, aunque ellos no lo hac√≠an por ocult√°rsela apropositamente, lo hac√≠an para se√±alar que eran p√©simas personas y de las que era mejor dejarlas en paz con sus propios asuntos, ve√≠a a unos chavales traficando con partes mec√°nicas de otros robots, desde hac√≠a unos meses eso se hab√≠a convertido en una nueva norma, vender partes de otros robots como si necesitasen mas de la cuenta. Desde que Rodney Hojalata era ahora el nuevo jefe de Industrias Gran Soldador, √©l hab√≠a impuesto la norma de que ning√∫n robot se pondr√≠a actualizaciones usadas de otros robots ya que eso era un acto desalmado de no tener respeto a aquellos que apenas pod√≠an obtener actualizaciones validas para su cuerpo, pero alg√∫nos lo hac√≠an de todas formas porque se pensaban que eso les har√≠a ser mejores que antes, era una estupidez, una estupidez que hab√≠a destruido a mucha gente, sobretodo a adolescentes que podr√≠an haber tenido una gran carrera y en vez de eso decidieron volverse unos ego√≠stas jugando a ser gangsters para as√≠ ganarse una reputaci√≥n por los malos barrios. Nunca lo entender√≠a, pero al menos se enorgullec√≠a de no haber acabado como uno de ellos. Sigui√≥ adelante pasando por varias tiendas de mercader√≠as, de actualizaciones y otras cosas que iban vendiendo varios robots con un aspecto no muy favorable seg√∫n se pod√≠a ver, se percato de un robot de piel verde metalizada que le hab√≠a pasado una bolsa a una mujer mayor, le dio las gracias y se junto con √©l donde se percato de su presencia al instante. -¬øComo lo llevas Gengis? -le pregunto en tono de saludo. -Oh se√±or Thrower, me alegro mucho de verle -se alegro de verle poniendo una expresi√≥n de sorpresa que parec√≠a demasiado disimulada como para ser verdad. -Y a ti tambi√©n, ¬øque me cuentas? -Lo de siempre, esos ni√±atos siguen todav√≠a pintarrajeando los carteles de Rodney Hojalata como si se creyesen que es un demonio o algo as√≠ -se quejo se√±al√°ndole en una esquina donde hab√≠a una pared que ten√≠a puesto un panfleto con la cara de Rodney Hojalata solo que este ten√≠a dibujado unos cuernos y un bigote de color rojo escritos con cray√≥n-. Ese chico b√°sicamente ha hecho lo que a nadie se le ha ocurrido hacer hasta ahora, reconstruir esta ciudad y quitarse de encima a los malditos bur√≥cratas que hac√≠an de este lugar un chatarrero, ¬øno entiendo porque le tienen tanto problema? -Le tienen problema porque Hojalata hace cosas buenas y ellas no, por eso lo hacen. -Me has le√≠do el pensamiento, dime, ¬øalg√∫na vez has conocido a Hojalata? ¬øSabes como es? -La verdad es que no, y si le conociera, seguramente le pedir√≠a que me cree una capucha de camuflaje o algo as√≠ -espeto ir√≥nicamente sin tom√°rselo muy a pecho. -¬øEn serio? Yo esperaba que dir√≠as otra cosa. -¬øOtra cosa como qu√©? -le cuestiono poni√©ndole una mirada furtiva como de saber muy bien adonde quer√≠a ir a parar con esa cuesti√≥n que ya conoc√≠a desde hac√≠a mucho tiempo. Aquella hizo que la situaci√≥n entre los dos se pusiese incomoda ya que era bastante evidente de lo que estaban hablando, Gengis intento de buscar la manera de expresarse para disculparse. -¬øPorque no lo superas ya Miles? √âl ya se fue, no puedes vivir atormentandote -razono seriamente con √©l para que intentase de dejar atr√°s aquello que tanto le dol√≠a. -No lo hago, solamente digo lo que es, es mejor as√≠, pienso mejor trabajar solo que tener a otro compa√±ero cubri√©ndome las espaldas para luego acabar perdi√©ndole -acoto contradiciendo su opini√≥n, estaba decidido a seguir su propio camino como segu√≠a haciendo hasta ahora. -Le perdiste pero a√∫n tienes oportunidad de tener a alguien ayud√°ndote. -Mi √∫nica ayuda es esto y lo tengo todo perfectamente coordinado -indico se√±alandose el dispositivo de comunicaciones que ten√≠a enganchado a la oreja derecha. -Esa chica no es un amigo, te mereces algo mejor que eso. -Pues si me lo mereciera entonces no estar√≠a aqu√≠ hablando contigo. Se inmiscuyo en ese comentario ya que sent√≠a que Miles no iba a cambiar de opini√≥n. -¬øA que has venido en realidad? -le pregunto acord√°ndose de que hab√≠a venido por una raz√≥n especifica que todav√≠a ni siquiera le hab√≠a preguntado hasta ahora. -¬øHas visto a este sujeto pasar por aqu√≠? -saco una foto de un robot inventor y se la ense√±o. La agarro y se puso a mirarlo fijamente, carraspeaba de estar pensando y entonces dijo: -No lo he visto -le devolvi√≥ la foto. -¬øEn serio? ¬øNi por un momento? -No, para nada -lo corroboro con total honestidad. Se guardo la foto mientras asent√≠a amargado al ver que no sab√≠a nada. -¬øDe quien se trata? -pregunto intrigado por el sujeto de la foto. -Steve Bots, es un inventor, y esta desaparecido, al igual que otros inventores mas, algo esta pasando con esta gente y no me esta gustando, por eso he venido aqu√≠, para ver si tu pod√≠as saber algo ya que normalmente por aqu√≠ pasando un mont√≥n de gente poco agradable. -Conozco a mucha gente, pero la mayor√≠a la ignoro porque se muy bien que voy a acabar fatal con esto, ser√° mejor que te vayas antes de que la cosa se ponga chunga. -Lo se -afirmo dispuesto a hacerle caso ya que sab√≠a muy bien de lo que estaba hablando. Decidi√≥ marcharse pero entonces le dijo algo en el ultimo momento. -Espera -le detuvo-. Si estas buscando a ese inventor creo que conozco a un tipejo que afirma saber quien es el causante de estas desapariciones. -¬øEn serio? ¬øDe quien se trata? -puso su cara delante de √©l para saber lo que ten√≠a que decirle. Acerco su cara mientras miraba de un lado a otro para asegurarse, entonces dijo: -Se llama Julian Strigges -le confeso susurr√°ndole. -Julian Strigges -carraspeo interesado al o√≠r ese nombre. -Vive al otro lado de la manzana, se pasa todos los d√≠as bebiendo en ese bar del otro lado de la esquina, creo que ahora todav√≠a sigue ah√≠ dentro si es que no se ha marchado de aburrimiento. -Gracias Gengis -le agradeci√≥ con total admiraci√≥n. -Lo mismo digo agente Thrower, y ten cuidado de por donde te metes, es mejor no llamar la atenci√≥n, sobretodo en ese bar, cada vez que se mete un poli ah√≠ dentro lo acaban descubriendo r√°pidamente -le aconsejo con total sinceridad ya que sab√≠a que algo iba a pasar con √©l. -Lastima de que yo no sea poli. -Por favor Miles, no montes un numerito por lo que mas quieras, si lo haces acabaras haciendo que me maten -le insisti√≥ suplic√°ndole que no cometiese ning√∫n error por el camino. -No lo har√© Gengis, te lo prometo -acoto decidido a seguir su consejo, se marcho dej√°ndole ah√≠ con lo suyo si es que nadie le hab√≠a escuchado. Sigui√≥ yendo por el mismo camino de antes pero luego doblo por la izquierda, se dispon√≠a a ir al bar para buscar a Strigges, conecto su dispositivo de comunicaciones que ten√≠a en la oreja y dijo: -Alexandra, ¬øestas ah√≠? - Estoy aqu√≠ cari√±o, ¬øque necesitas? -pregunto Alexandra desde el otro lado del dispositivo. -Necesito que busques a un tal Julian Strigges, creo que puede tener informac√≠on sobre la desaparici√≥n de los inventores y sobre Steve Bots. - ¬ø De veras has escuchado o simplemente has o√≠do otro de esos rumores que se inventan la gente para tomarte de pardillo? -le pregunto ingenuamente. Creeme, me confiar√≠a mi vida a este hombre, por cierto, necesito que mandes a un equipo para sacar a Gengis Mangold de este lugar, se encuentra en peligro. - ¬øEn peligro de qu√©? -De todo el mundo, √©l no se merece estar aqu√≠, as√≠ que necesito de tu ayuda para esto, y por lo que mas quieras, hazlo r√°pido, siento que ya estoy cometiendo un error meti√©ndome aqu√≠ -se puso a mirar de un lado a otro para asegurarse de que nadie le siguiese. - ¬øCuando empezaras a hacerme caso? - cambio su tono a uno de sarcasmo. -No se, cuando me des tu autentico numero de tel√©fono y te invite a cenar a ese restaurante franc√©s del que tanto te pasas hablando -indico ingenuamente. - Oh Miles Thrower, que har√≠a yo sin ti y tus chorradas -esbozo con tono vacilante. -¬øPuedes prometerme eso? - Har√© lo que pueda, pero por favor, no montes un numerito por lo que mas quieras. - Eres la segunda persona que me dice eso -alzo la mirada observando que hab√≠a encontrado el bar de la esquina que le hab√≠a indicado antes Gengis, ten√≠a un buen aspecto pero sab√≠a muy que por dentro iba a ser mucho peor-. Te tengo dejar. - Te avisare de cuando haya mandado a alguien a buscar a Gengis. -De acuerdo, pero por ahora tengo que colgar. Nos vemos Alexandra. -Adi√≥s hombre de hierro . -Nunca entender√© ese apodo- colg√≥ y se quedo indeciso ante esa ultima menci√≥n. Marcho hac√≠a el bar que ten√≠a adelante, abri√≥ la puerta y en cuanto lo hizo toda una serie de sujetos roboticos con muy mala pinta le dirigieron la mirada como sintiendo que era un robot non grato ah√≠ dentro, el local en si ten√≠a un aspecto circular con una docena de mesas a cada extremo y cuatro por delante, era como un cubo pero circulado, mas adelante hab√≠a una barra con un barman que parec√≠a tener al menos un aspecto considerable, era gris√°ceo, con la cabeza aplanada y la mand√≠bula cuadriculada, estaba lavando los platos cuando echo la vista en √©l. Carraspeo pensativo y se dirigi√≥ hac√≠a la barra, ahora pod√≠a entender porque no quer√≠an que ning√∫n polic√≠a se metiese en un lugar como este, en cuanto le echaban en cara a alg√∫n sujeto extra√±o, todos estaban con ganas de buscarse pelea sin motivo alg√∫no, no pod√≠a quedarse mucho tiempo a menos que buscase al sujeto que hab√≠a venido a encontrar, se sent√≥ en una de las butacas de aluminio que hab√≠a delante de la barra y ah√≠ entonces el barman se le acerco. -¬øDesea algo? -le pregunto con un tono l√∫gubre y vac√≠o. -¬øQue es lo mejor que tiene aqu√≠? -decidi√≥ echar un trago para aprovechar que estaba ah√≠. Aquello hizo que mirase de reojo a los robots que hab√≠an por el local mirando persuasivamente. -¬øPasa algo? -inquiri√≥ sospechando que algo ocurr√≠a por la forma en que lo miraba. -Sea lo que haya venido a hacer aqu√≠, hagalo r√°pido, no quiero mas problemas de los de siempre -le advirti√≥ seriamente pero poniendo un tono susurrante para que no se le escuchase. -Le prometo que no habr√° problemas. -Eso mismo dijo el anterior robot que dijo lo mismo. El barman estaba aterrado y era por una buena raz√≥n, se notaba que ya hab√≠a visto otras trifulcas producidas de la misma manera en el bar, estaba tan fastidiado por eso que ya no pod√≠a evitarle avisar de lo que pod√≠a pasar si se daban cuenta de quien era, con eso ya lo ten√≠a bien claro, este no era lugar para buenos aqu√≠, y √©l era uno de ellos. Justo en ese momento se acerco otro robot poniendose al otro lado de la barra, era un robot con un aspecto desali√±ado, era azulado y ten√≠a un cabello en forma de espina que iba enderezado hac√≠a atr√°s, se acomodo en la butaca y se puso a dar palmadas sobre la barra como si con eso consiguiese llamar la atenci√≥n del barman, este se acerco y le dijo: -¬øLo de siempre? -Lo de siempre. El barman se alejo y se quedo el robot donde estaba esperando a que le trajese lo que fuese que hab√≠a pedido que parec√≠a ser algo que tomaba habitualmente, se le quedo mirando intentando de hacerse a la idea de si era √©l o no, era un robot bastante desali√±ado y con aspecto de estar metido con malas compa√±√≠as, deb√≠a de ser porque sino entonces estaba mirando al robot equivocado. Volvi√≥ a poner la vista frente y justo entonces el robot de al lado se le quedo mirando. -¬øTu no eres de por aqu√≠ verdad? -le pregunto susceptiblemente. -¬øComo dice? -se hizo el que parec√≠a que no le estaba prestando atenci√≥n desde que entro. -Yo nunca lo he visto en el barrio, ¬øes nuevo por aqu√≠? Aquella pregunta hizo que empezase a darse cuenta de que estaba sospechando de √©l, ten√≠a que pensar en una excusa que resultase cre√≠ble o sino acabar√≠a provocando la bronca que el barman ya le hab√≠a avisado que no quer√≠a ver. -¬øY eso supone alg√∫n problema? -No, sino fuera por esa capucha entonces dir√≠a que es un poli -objet√≥ seriamente. En eso ten√≠a raz√≥n, deber√≠a haberse quitado la capucha cuando deber√≠a haberlo hecho eso, estar tanto rato metido en un lugar como ese ocultando su cara no era una buena idea, ya hab√≠a entrado y hab√≠a cometido el primer error como polic√≠a infiltrado, ahora ten√≠a que buscar una manera de evadirse antes de que el robot empezase a sospechar mas de la cuenta. -¬øDe veras cree que si fuera un poli me meter√≠a aqu√≠ con una capucha? -torci√≥ su pregunta haciendo que diese a otra cuesti√≥n relevante. Levanto su ojo derecho en se√±al de estar pensando detenidamente lo que dijo, aquello le hab√≠a dado que pensar pero tambi√©n de tener sus dudas al respecto. -Toma, lo de siempre -le paso el barman la bebida que le hab√≠a pedido antes. -Gracias -le agradeci√≥ y se marcho el barman. Miles se le quedo mirando esperando una respuesta de √©l, sab√≠a bien que ese tipo de comentarios siempre hac√≠a que todos los robots mas dicharacheros acabasen tom√°ndolo en consideraci√≥n, el robot se dio un trago de su bebida e inmediatamente volvi√≥ a poner su mirada en √©l. -Me cabes bien t√≠o -al final se crey√≥ lo que dijo. -Miles -decidi√≥ presentarse con tal de ganarse su confianza ahora que se sent√≠a confiado. -Julian, Striggs -acabo admitiendo su nombre, y era justo el del hombre que estaba buscando. Era √©l, lo ten√≠a ah√≠ delante, hab√≠a dado en el clavo. -¬øVienes siempre por aqu√≠? -Digamos que de casi toda la vida, llevo tanto tiempo en este lugar que casi parece mas una casa que otra cosa, aqu√≠ todo el mundo me conoce, fijate bien, ¬øcomo lo llevas Hank? -se dirigi√≥ hac√≠a unos robots que hab√≠an en el bar, era un robot de aspecto obeso que estaba sentado en el costado de la derecha leyendo el peri√≥dico agarr√°ndolo con las dos manos. -Mejor que bien -indico encogiendose de hombros. Julian solt√≥ una peque√±a risotada y volvi√≥ a dar un trago a su bebida. -Es imposible ignorar de toda esta gente -exclamo sinti√©ndose a gusto donde estaba-. ¬øQue te cuentas por aqu√≠ Miles? ¬øQuien eres exactamente? -¬øHas o√≠do hablar de eso? -¬øQue eso? -frunci√≥ extra√±ado al ce√±o al no entender a que se refer√≠a. Fingi√≥ de mirar para asegurarse de que no hubiese nadie y entonces se acerco hac√≠a √©l. -De los inventores desaparecidos. -Ah, eso, como no. -¬øSabes de lo que te hablo? -Claro, claro, lo se muy bien, todo el mundo conoce ese tema. -¬øDe verdad? -As√≠ es, lleva pasando durante varias semanas, cada vez que se oye que un inventor ha sido dado de desaparecido todo el mundo se pone a festejar aqu√≠, es lo √∫nico que nos motiva para seguir viviendo un dia mas aqu√≠ -confeso demostrando que sab√≠a de lo de los inventores. -¬øY conoces a uno? -¬øConocer a uno? ¬øYo? -Si, tu, pero no conocerlo fisicamente, sino de haberlo o√≠do por ah√≠. Carraspeo poniendo a pensar cuando de pronto cambio su expresi√≥n y entonces dijo: -Un momento, ¬øporque te interesa tanto ese tema? -¬øA que te refieres? -¬øPorque te importa tanto eso de los inventores? En eso ten√≠a raz√≥n, la hab√≠a pifiado, estaba tan convencido de que se hab√≠a ganado su confianza que no pens√≥ que podr√≠a darse cuenta de que algo iba a fallar en esa conversac√≠on. -¬øQuien eres tu? -empez√≥ a enfadarse por desconfiar de √©l. Ten√≠a que pensar en algo r√°pido si no quer√≠a que le descubriese demasiado pronto, apenas sab√≠a que se le podr√≠a ocurrir, ten√≠a que ser algo en lo que a ese t√≠o se pudiese conformar, ¬øpero que? -Digamos que yo le tengo bronca a los inventores -fue lo √∫nico que se le ocurri√≥ decir. -¬øBronca? -Uno de esos inventores le quito el trabajo a mi padre, y lo peor de todo es que cuando Rodney Hojalata se puso al mando de toda Ciudad Robot empezaron a quitarles los puestos a las dem√°s personas que hab√≠an en mi barrio, por eso estoy aqu√≠, porque necesito la opini√≥n de alguien mas para saber si estoy en lo cierto o no -argumento creando una historia falsa lo suficientemente cre√≠ble como para que se convenciera de que no era nadie sospechoso. Julian se lo pens√≥ detenidamente y entonces dijo: -Debi√≥ de ser duro cuando sucedi√≥ eso, ¬øno? En su mente se quedo sonriendo al ver que se hab√≠a salido con la suya. -Lo fue, tanto como perder a mi compa√±ero. -¬øQue le paso? -Digamos que un tipejo le corto por la mitad. -Lo siento mucho. -No tienes porque sentirlo, fue hace mucho tiempo, tanto que casi pareciera que fue ayer. -Y digamos que tambi√©n fue ayer cuando vi que se llevaban a Steve Bots -mencion√≥. Aquella menci√≥n hizo que despertarse su curiosidad de inmediato, hab√≠a o√≠do lo que justamente quer√≠a o√≠r, se giro mir√°ndolo con una expresi√≥n sobresaltada. -¬øQue es lo que has dicho? -Ah, se me olvidaba mencionar, resulta que ayer vi que se llevaban a ese robot llamado Steve Bots, andaba merodeando por aqu√≠ y en cuanto me cruce en la siguiente esquina, vi a unos sujetos llev√°rsele metidos en una furgoneta, joder, fue impresionante, como se ve en la tele -confeso demostrando que hab√≠a sido testigo de la desaparec√≠an del inventor, o el rapto mas bien. -¬øQuienes eran? -se dispuso a conocer todos los hechos ahora que ten√≠a la oportunidad. -No se, unos robots enormes, ¬øque mas da? -Da, ¬øquien se los llevo? -le agarro de los hombros haciendo que le mirase fijamente a la cara. Aquella reacci√≥n hizo llamar la atenci√≥n de todos los presentes en el bar. -Pero t√≠o, ¬øque co√±o te pasa? -le rechisto intentando de entender porque le atacaba, ah√≠ de pronto vio que hab√≠a algo detr√°s de su capucha que colgaba de su oreja, supo conocerlo al instante, era un aparato de comunicaciones que se pod√≠a usar para llamar a alguien a distancia-. ¬øEres poli? -¬øQue? -empez√≥ a asustarse al ver que parec√≠a que le hab√≠a descubierto. -Lo estabas grabando todo -le quito de encima y se quedo mir√°ndole con una cara como de sentirse indignado ante lo que estaba viendo-. ¬øLo estabas grabando todo verdad? Se puso a pensar el motivo por el cual se pensaba que estaba grabando la conversac√≠on, se acordo de su aparato de comunicaciones en la oreja y ah√≠ entonces lo entendi√≥, vio lo que ten√≠a en la oreja y supo reconocer que se trataba de un agente, la hab√≠a pifiado con eso. -¬°Eres un poli! -le recrimino acus√°ndole mientras se hac√≠a atr√°s con tal de escaparse. Aquello hizo que todos los robots que estaban en el local se acabasen asustando y mirasen fr√≠amente hac√≠a Miles, la mayor√≠a se levanto mientras cerraban sus peri√≥dicos mientras otros preparaban sus pu√±os con tal de pelearse con √©l por ser un agente. Miles vio como todos le estaban acorralando, era evidente que se hab√≠a metido en el peor lugar posible como para fingir que no era agente, ten√≠a que hacer algo o sino Julian se le escapar√≠a del susto, ve√≠a como se hac√≠a atr√°s, estaba dispuesto a escapar por la puerta de entrada. -¬°Estas muerto cabron! -le reprocho amenazandole y se marcho corriendo por la puerta. -Tu -se dispuso a seguirle pero en cuanto dio un par de pasos hac√≠a adelante acabo despertando la ira de todos los robots que le miraban con mala cara, se hizo hac√≠a atr√°s y acabo golpeandose con la barra que ten√≠a detr√°s, el barman se le acerco y le dijo: -Le avise de que no se metiera en problemas -le susurro hac√≠endole acordar de lo que le hab√≠a avisado antes ya que esto era lo que justamente quer√≠a evitar el barman. -No se preocupe, se como salir de esto -dijo teniendo una idea de como librarse de todos. Los robots se fueron acercando cada vez mas haciendo que le resultase imposible escaparse ya que todos eran enormes y no dejaban un solo espacio en medio, Miles se concentro y entonces extendi√≥ la manga de su capucha mostrando un reloj inal√°mbrico altamente avanzado, pulso un bot√≥n que hab√≠a en medio y entonces lanzo una onda el√©ctrica que dejo inmovilizados a todos los robots, se cayeron al suelo provocando un enorme estruendo que reson√≥ por todo el local. -Reloj de pulsera con procesador de descargas el√©ctricas, una gran maravilla venida de la mente de Rodney Hojalata -esbozo ingenuamente para dejar bien claro que ten√≠a un aparato hecho por un inventor y lo hab√≠a usado para librarse de ellos f√°cilmente. Se giro y se fijo en que el barman hab√≠a quedado completamente boquiabierto al ver lo que hizo. -No se preocupe -le paso un billete para pagarle la bebida de antes-. Considerelo una muestra de gratitud de alguien que se ha metido muchos problemas. Le gui√±o expresamente el ojo y entonces se largo dispuesto a seguir a Julian del cual hac√≠a un buen rato que lo hab√≠a perdido de vista, y justo ahora que hab√≠a encontrado algo de informac√≠on con respecto a lo sucedido con Steve Bots, necesitaba seguirle la pista antes de que desapareciera. Sali√≥ del local y se puso a mirar a ambos lados para ver si le hab√≠a por alg√∫na parte o no, asum√≠a que como le hab√≠an descubierto volver√≠a directamente a su apartamento para recoger sus cosas y marcharse, se fijo bien y al final lo acabo encontrando, estaba en un rinc√≥n colocado delante de una cabina de tel√©fono hablando de forma apurada, ah√≠ entonces lo entendi√≥, estaba avisando a los responsables del secuestro de Steve Bots de que le hab√≠an descubierto. Julian colg√≥ el tel√©fono con bronca y entonces se giro mirando hac√≠a el frente, ah√≠ se percato de que le estaban observando y r√°pidamente se largo corriendo de la cabina. Se puso a perseguirle ahora que le hab√≠a localizado, no pod√≠a dejarlo escapar. Se puso a perseguirlo por todo el pueblo pasando por un enorme callej√≥n repleto de tiendas de comercios de peque√±as actualizaciones y dem√°s cosas, este se puso a ir tirando todo lo que se encontraba a su paso con tal de ponerle obst√°culos, pero no le serv√≠a de nada, √©l iba saltando como un corredor ol√≠mpico todo lo que pusiese por delante. Giro a la izquierda y de ah√≠ se meti√≥ de vuelta en la continuaci√≥n del camino principal donde sigui√≥ esquivando a toda la gente que hab√≠a delante suyo, doblo en la siguiente esquina y de ah√≠ se puso a subir por las escaleras de un enorme bloque, Miles le vio y ah√≠ entonces se le ocurri√≥ una idea con tal de atraparle f√°cilmente. Julian llego arriba del bloque y de ah√≠ sigui√≥ corriendo subiendo por toda la parcela hasta acabar saltando por todos los bloques hab√≠an por el camino, fue uno por uno sin parar siquiera, se giro observando que no le segu√≠an por detr√°s, sonr√≠o orgulloso y se giro volviendo a mirar al frente pero en cuanto lo hizo observo que Miles hab√≠a subido de alg√∫na forma al ultimo bloque. -¬°No! -se asusto tanto que decidi√≥ volver por donde vino pero acabo cay√©ndose al pisar mal en el borde, se resbalo y acabo cayendo al fondo del suelo donde se golpeo bruscamente. Intento de levantarse pero estaba tan dolorido por ambos lados que no sab√≠a que parte de sus actualizaciones se le hab√≠an roto, observo que su codo izquierdo estaba perforado, se quejo viendo que ahora iba a necesitar repararselo de alg√∫na forma. Miro al frente y observo que Miles bajo del bloque mientras era ayudado por un especie de cable que sal√≠a de su reloj de pulsera, se puso delante de √©l y el cable volvi√≥ a meterse dentro del reloj como si fuese extensible. -¬øPero como has hecho... -Ah, ¬øesto? F√°cil, te presento al reloj multiusos patrocinado por Rodney Hojalata, un inventor igual de parecido con Steve, del que parece que tu sabes como fue secuestrado -le aclaro ech√°ndole la bronca por haberse largado cuando justamente sab√≠a algo de ese asunto. -¬øEn serio t√≠o? Todo esto por eso -se cuestiono incr√©dulamente y sin tom√°rselo muy en serio. -No, todo esto por Steve Bots, ¬ødonde esta? -saco su pistola de detr√°s suyo y la uso para apuntar hac√≠a la cabeza de Julian esperando que del miedo le dijese la verdad. -Ni puta idea -espeto hac√≠endose la v√≠ctima. -Se muy bien que tu sabes algo, dime, ¬ødonde esta Steve Bots? -En un lugar seguro. -¬øQue lugar seguro? -En uno al que no lo vas a encontrar tan f√°cilmente. Miles se canso, estaba tan harto del d√≠a de hoy que decidi√≥ pasar a hacer las cosas mal con tal de terminar con todos sus problemas y conseguir lo que quer√≠a, se acerco y puso el gatillo de su arma sobre su cara con tal de que este le diese todo lo que quer√≠a saber. -¬øDonde esta Steve Bots? ¬øCon quien estabas hablando antes en la cabina? -Con mi madre, pensaba que me ibas a matar. -Y una mierda, dime la verdad, a menos que no quieras que la gente que te contrato para callarte te mande directamente al chatarrero. -El chatarrero ya no existe, Rodney Hojalata y sus amigo lo destruyeron. -Pues entonces te mandare a otro, ¬øha quedado claro? Con eso ya dejaba claro que Julian Strigges no pod√≠a buscarse ning√∫na otra excusa aparte. -Lo encontr√© siendo perseguido por uno de estos callejones, √©l t√≠o iba muy bien disfrazado, pero le pillaron al instante, eran un grupo de tres t√≠os, dos de ellos eran enormes, hab√≠a un loco que ten√≠a una especie de brazo motosierra o algo parecido -le relato lo que vio el dia del secuestro. Aquello le empezo a resultarle bastante familiar. -Y tambi√©n dijeron que ten√≠an que llevarle ante su jefe. -As√≠, ¬øque dijeron? -No se, algo as√≠ como: Arcturus Von Sprocket -declaro expresamente. Ahora aquello si que le resultaba familiar, sab√≠a muy bien de quien estaba hablando. -Arcturus Von Sprocket. -Me intereso tanto lo que estaban haciendo que me met√≠ en la pelea, los t√≠os esos se me quedaron mirando, parec√≠a que me iban a matar pero en vez de eso el t√≠o con la motosierra me dijo de que ahora era su contacto, si algo malo ocurriese o hab√≠a alguien buscando a ese mismo t√≠o, que le ten√≠a que avisar urgentemente por cualquier medio posible. -¬øEntonces era a ese t√≠o con quien te estabas comunicando antes verdad? -Si, le avise de ti, ahora sabr√°n muy bien lo que van a hacer la pr√≥xima vez que intenten de llevarse a otro inventor de aqu√≠ -le confirmo agregando una nueva cosa. -¬øQue? -se extra√±o ante esa menci√≥n. Lo distrajo y aprovecho lo suficiente como para hacerle una zancadilla y tirarlo contra el suelo. -Adi√≥s Miles o vayase a saber como te llamas -le insulto y se marcho corriendo por el otro lado. R√°pidamente Miles se levanto sintiendo un terrible dolor de cabeza, se hab√≠a golpeado de una p√©sima manera contra el suelo, alzo la vista y observo que Julian se le estaba escapando, pero eso ahora le daba igual, ya ten√≠a lo que quer√≠a, ahora sab√≠a muy bien contra quien se estaba enfrentando, y no era ni mas ni menos que Arcturus Von Sprocket, uno de los terroristas roboticos mas despiadados y mas buscados por todo el globo terr√°queo. Decidi√≥ volver por donde vino, aprovecho y se dispuso a avisarle a Alexandra de lo que descubri√≥. -Alexandra, ¬øestas ah√≠? -llamo a Alexandra esperando que la contestase. - Estoy aqu√≠ Miles, ¬øtienes lo que quer√≠as? -pregunto Alexandra al otro lado. -As√≠ es, he cogido al cabron de Julian Strigges, pero se me ha escapado, a√∫n as√≠ he conseguido obtener bastante informac√≠on sobre el paradero de Steve Bots. - ¬ø Y que has obtenido? -No esta escondido en ning√∫na parte, lo han secuestrado. - ¬ø Secuestrado? -As√≠ es, al parecer hace unos d√≠as unos t√≠os enormes le encontraron y se lo llevaron a alg√∫na parte, creo que a√∫n sigue vivo y lo est√°n usando para algo importante. -¬ø Sabes quien puede haberse llevado? - Ha sido Sprocket, ha vuelto a sus andadas otra vez. - Sprocket otra vez, joder, esto es serio. -Y que lo digas, ahora mismo vuelvo a la central para terminar este asunto, por cierto, ¬øha venido alguien a llevarse a Gengis?, creo que voy a pasar por ah√≠ para ver como esta. - Ah Miles, con respecto a eso... -¬øQue sucede? - Veras, resulta que mientras tu me mandaste la orden de mandar a alguien para llevarse a tu amigo, me temo que ha sucedido algo que no sabr√≠a como explic√°rtelo. -¬ø√âl que? ¬øQue pasa? D√≠melo. - Estas cerca de donde esta tu amigo Gengis? -Si. - Pues me parece que ah√≠ encontraras la respuesta. Miles no entendi√≥ a que se refer√≠a con eso pero por el tono que le estaba poniendo sonaba a que estaba pasando algo preocupante, lo dejo estar y sigui√≥ avanzando hasta meterse en el callej√≥n donde se encontraba la tienda de Gengis, sigui√≥ andando hasta que de pronto observo algo que estaba sucediendo mas adelante, pod√≠a ver que hab√≠a una multitud agrupada alrededor de una tienda como si algo malo estuviese ocurriendo ah√≠ mismo. Aquello hizo que se temiese lo peor que se pod√≠a imaginar, marcho corriendo hac√≠a ah√≠ pasando entre la gente mientras quitaba a la mayor√≠a d√°ndoles varios empujones ya que quer√≠a saber que era lo que estaba ocurriendo en realidad. -¬øQue sucede? -pregunto esperando a que alguien le contestase. -Unos tipejos vieron a este t√≠o hablando con un polic√≠a, se enfadaron y vinieron a echarle la bronca por estar confraternizado con un polic√≠a y en cuanto √©l intento de escaparse le cog√≠eron y le arrancaron todas las actualizaciones, dejaron tiradas el resto de sus piezas ah√≠ mismo -dijo un robot viejo con gafas que estaba a un lado, le se√±alo el lugar donde se encontraba Gengis. Miles alzo la mirada y observo una enorme mara√±a de tuercas y tornillos seguido de una enorme tapa que actuaba como protector para la parte delantera, estaban tiradas encima de la tienda, con solamente ver ese protector, reconoc√≠a perfectamente de a quien pertenec√≠a, era a Gengis, al final hab√≠a llegado tarde y ya le hab√≠an matado, le fallo terriblemente. -Pobre viejo, si no hubiese estado confraternizado con ese polic√≠a, quiz√°s no le hubiesen hecho nada -opino otro que estaba a su lado lamentandose de una forma muy ingenua. -Lo mismo digo -estuvo de acuerdo otro que ten√≠a al lado escuch√°ndole. Aquello hizo que mirase aquel mont√≥n de piezas y tornillos que ten√≠a delante y se diese cuenta de que no pudo cumplir con su promesa, le fallo, pero no por haber impedido que le matasen, sino por no haberle dado una oportunidad a lo que √©l le pidi√≥ que hiciera, no pod√≠a hacerlo solo, sobretodo ahora que se encontraba en una situaci√≥n mucho mas arriesgada que antes, no necesitaba ver nada mas de eso, se marcho sin siquiera hacer nada al respecto, dejo que la gente se encargase de las partes de Gengis ya que sab√≠a que en cuanto alguien se preocupase por sus desperfectos, todo el mundo empezar√≠a a sospechar porque si y otra vez se producir√≠a el mismo alboroto de antes. Decidi√≥ regresar por donde vino, encendi√≥ su aparato de comunicaciones y entonces dijo: -Alexandra, ¬øestas ah√≠? - Estoy aqu√≠ querido, ¬øestas bien? -No, la verdad es que no, esto es urgente, tenemos que avisar a todo el mundo de esto, si es verdad que Sprocket esta mandando a sus compinches a secuestrar a todos los inventores de Ciudad Robot, entonces Gran Soldador y sus amigos est√°n en completo peligro, incluido Rodney Hojalata -le explic√≥ insisti√©ndole para que tomase represalias ahora que sab√≠an a lo que se enfrentaban. -Miles. -¬øLo has entendido todo Alexandra. - Miles, tengo que decirte algo importante. -¬øQue sucede? -se detuvo para escuchar lo que tuviese que decir. - Ha habido un aviso en el que dice que Jack Hammer ha desaparecido tambi√©n. Aquello despert√≥ mentalmente su nivel de p√°nico al o√≠r eso. -Jack Hammer, ¬øte refieres al primer mec√°nico que meti√≥ Rodney Hojalata para ser el nuevo inventor de la reconstruida Ciudad Robot? -Exactamente, seg√∫n su ayudante, se meti√≥ en su casa y vio que estaba todo tirado patas arriba, como si alguien lo hubiese atacado, tambi√©n encontr√≥ una carta que pon√≠a que estaba en peligro y que necesitaba huir inmediatamente, no hab√≠a ni documentaci√≥n, y ni las piezas que usaba para construir sus inventores, creo que Jack Hammer sab√≠a que lo estaba acechando y por eso mismo ha huido, √©l sabe que van a ir a por √©l. Miles se quedo r√≠gido al o√≠r eso ya que daba por sentado que esto solamente hab√≠a hecho mas que comenzar, si era cierto lo que dijo Strigges, entonces le quedaba claro que Sprocket no parar√≠a hasta conseguir lo que quer√≠a, pero ten√≠a que descubrir cual era su nuevo plan. -Voy para all√° Alexandra, esp√©rame -le aviso con tono desesperante y se marcho dispuesto a seguir con su investigaci√≥n ahora que ten√≠a una prueba que indicaba lo que estaba sucediendo. No iba a parar hasta acabar con Sprocket de una vez por todas. FIN DEL CUARTO SEGMENTO.[Chapter 5] ROBOTS: LAS PRECUELAS Este fanfic ha sido presentado por Dimitrix Enterprises y Dimitrix Inc. SEGMENTO 5: MECANICO DE GUERRA Norbert Vixx esta incomodo sentado delante de un escritorio esperando a que venga el director del centro para as√≠ poder hacerle saber si aceptaban su trabajo o no, le hab√≠a entregado su curriculum hac√≠endole saber de todas las cosas que hizo para que as√≠ pudiese entender que serv√≠a. Estaba dentro de un peque√±o local cuadriculado con apenas una sola ventana en un extremo y solamente hab√≠a una luz fluorescente que iluminaba todo el despacho. El despacho era bastante sopor√≠fero y se notaba que el due√±o no lo hab√≠a limpiado en semanas, las paredes estaban agrietadas y hab√≠a restos de granito que sal√≠an de debajo del suelo de aluminio, era un asco pero era lo mejor que hab√≠a obtenido despu√©s de todas las solicitudes de trabajo que hab√≠a solicitado hasta ahora. Segu√≠a esperando a que viniera el hombre pero no ven√≠a, estaba solo, amorronado y aburrido, no ten√≠a nada mejor que hacer que ir meneando de un lado para otro los dedos de lo nervioso, asum√≠a que no iba a obtener el trabajo, y lo necesitaba, si no lo consegu√≠a, tendr√≠a que volver a casa de su t√≠o donde continuar√≠a viviendo en su garaje inventando cosas que nadie quer√≠a, y justo ahora que Gran Soldador hab√≠a vuelto y le hab√≠a cedido el puesto a ese joven llamado Rodney Hojalata, le parec√≠a una aceptable tarea tener que trabajar en la mec√°nica como sol√≠a hacer anteriormente. La puerta se abri√≥ al fondo, se giro mirando de reojo y observo que era el due√±o que hab√≠a vuelto. -Lo siento mucho, es que he estado ocupado en otra cosa -se disculpo con √©l con un cierto tono de desgana y entonces se sent√≥ en la silla que hab√≠a delante de su escritorio-. ¬øLe he hecho esperar? -No, para nada, he tenido mucho tiempo para pensar -objet√≥ mostrandose entusiasta delante de √©l. El hombre era un robot gris bastante obseso, de caso aplanado y con unas enormes gafas que le hac√≠an los ojos mucho mas redondeados que de lejos. Agarro la hoja que ten√≠a encima de su escritorio y se puso a leer lo que hab√≠a puesto, pod√≠a notarse que se trataba del curriculum, puso su mano encima de su boca como indicando que estaba determinando lo que estaba viendo en √©l. -¬øEres Norbert Vixx no? -fue la primera pregunta que le hizo y era muy f√°cil. -As√≠ es -le reafirmo, no cambio su expresi√≥n para nada. -¬øY tienes experiencia en la mec√°nica? -Exactamente, soy todo un maestro, deber√≠a de ver las cosas que ha hecho. -¬øConstruyes cosas? -Bueno, reparo veh√≠culos, ayuda a los robots con sus actualizaciones, a√±ado energ√≠a a edificios que lo necesiten, b√°sicamente hago de todo con tal de tener un destornillador y un soldador en la mano. -Je, como un inventor, ¬øno? -Inventor no se, para eso tendr√≠a que ser Rodney Hojalata. -¬øLe gusta que este Rodney Hojalata al mando inventando cosas? -Bueno, no le conozco pero, debo decir que en cierto modo me entusiasma que ahora haga de este mundo un lugar mucho mejor -opino buscando la manera de interpretar esa observaci√≥n. El hombre se puso a reirse pero aquella risa que soltaba sonaba mas a un severo sarcasmo. -¬øOcurre algo? -Eso mismo dijo el ultimo que estuvo sentado en esa silla -confeso. Aquello lo alarmo a√∫n mas, no sab√≠a si aquello era un aviso o un sarcasmo al que ten√≠a que entender para dejar bien claro que estaba en la misma onda, se puso mas nervioso todav√≠a, tanto que volteo la mirada hac√≠a otra parte y ah√≠ entonces se dio cuenta de otra cosa en la que no hab√≠a ca√≠do, uno de los p√≥sters de las paredes parec√≠a haber sido arrancado con severidad, solamente quedaba una peque√±a punta pegada en la pared. -¬øAntes hab√≠a algo ah√≠ pegado? -le pregunto por curiosidad. -Lo hab√≠a, al parecer el idiota de mi primo pens√≥ que poner un p√≥ster de la careta de Rodney Hojalata parec√≠a una buena idea, se equivoco por completo. -¬øPorque? ¬øTen√≠a algo mal? -No es que todo lo estuviese, en si el p√≥ster era algo malo. -Pero, ¬øporque no era lo que tocaba o... -Mira se√±or Vixx, se lo dir√© sin mas preangulos, pero es no para que se enfade, es simplemente para que lo entienda -hizo que se acercase para que lo escuchase entre murmullos-. Aqu√≠, en este lugar, no somos muy fan√°ticos de Rodney Hojalata, si entiendes lo que te digo. -Oh -exclamo reconociendo el motivo de ese p√≥ster. -As√≠ es, el estupido de mi primo esta tan obsesionado con ese robotito azulado que se piensa que poner un p√≥ster de √©l har√° las cosas mejores, je. -¬øY porque no? Hojalata ha estado ayudando a unos cuantos robots desde entonces, si tan solo pudi√©semos darle algo de motivaci√≥n quiz√°s... -¬øComo dices? -se quedo mir√°ndole con una expresi√≥n de malos humos -Nada, cosas m√≠as, no me haga caso -se rectifico nerviosamente, era evidente que para aquel hombre los inventores no eran de su agrado, estaba rodeado de racistas de inventores y eso era algo que apenas aguantaba, pero √©l quer√≠a un trabajo, as√≠ que lo mejor que pod√≠a hacer ahora de momento era callarse y dejarse tragar cualquier cosa que le mencionasen. El hombre se puso a mirar su curriculum de vuelta y entonces dijo: -Aqu√≠ dice que estuviste trabajando como dependiente de una tienda de actualizaciones de la marca Ratchet, ¬øes eso cierto? -As√≠ es, consegu√≠ un puesto del barrio, estuve trabajando ah√≠ durante un a√±o y cuatro meses, pero claro, llego la rebeli√≥n de todos los robots oxidados que no quer√≠an mas actualizaciones de esas y la cosa se puso un poco chunga, y lo peor de todo es que claro, Ratchet fue detenido por haber estado implicando en el intento de destrucci√≥n de la ciudad, as√≠ que, bueno... no me duro mucho -argumento sincerandose con √©l mientras mostraba una expresi√≥n ingenua como de dejar claro que aquel trabajo fue algo como una oportunidad perdida que no sirvi√≥ de mucho. El hombre se le quedo mirando pensativo al o√≠r eso. -¬øAs√≠ que perdiste tu trabajo como dependiente? -Y si, aunque no es que le haya tenido un cierto cari√±o, apenas ven√≠a gente por ah√≠ que yo conociese, excepto a un hombre al que luego se quejo de que un tipo que iba magnetizado se llevo sus actualizaciones, eso si que fue rar√≠simo. -Para el carro colega -le freno antes de tiempo. -¬øPasa algo? -asumi√≥ que dijo lo que no tocaba. -¬øDices que perdiste ese trabajo por culpa de Hojalata? -Bueno, no es que fuese un trabajo admirable, pero si me desilusiono un poco el hecho de que perdiese ese trabajo cuando al menos estaba durando un poco mas de tiempo -aclaro demostrando que si hab√≠a algo en lo que se mosqueaba por culpa de aquel inventor. Se le quedo mirando detenidamente como si hubiese algo √∫til en √©l y entonces dijo: -Ven conmigo -se levanto de golpe. -¬øQue vaya con usted? ¬øEstoy admitido? -No, pero es otra cosa interesante que tengo que ense√±arte, s√≠gueme -le pidi√≥ expresamente y entonces Vixx se levanto y se dispuso a seguirle. Abri√≥ la puerta del otro lado de la habitaci√≥n y de ah√≠ salieron al exterior en medio de la manzana que estaba llena de luces de neon con todo tipo de carteles que dec√≠an: CHICAS ROBOTICAS REC√çEN ACEITADAS, SE BUSCAN ROBOTS PARA TRABAJOS SECRETOS, CONFIE EN HOJALATA, √âL SIEMPRE NOS PROTEGE. Lo llevo a la otra cuadra donde hab√≠a un garito bastante sospechoso, en un extremo hab√≠a un robot de aspecto desali√±ado sentado de una forma incomoda, se le ve√≠a rascandose por detr√°s, se puso delante de aquel robot y le dijo: -¬øQue quieres ahora? -le pregunto amargamente. -Este chico sirve, quiero que el jefe le vea -le se√±alo a Vixx. -De acuerdo, ve por ah√≠ -le se√±alo la puerta enrejada que hab√≠a al lado suyo. -Gracias -le agradeci√≥ y entonces se pusieron delante de la puerta enrejada. La abri√≥ y entonces pasaron al interior de un enorme pasillo estrecho igual de maloliente que el propio exterior, cerro la puerta por detr√°s de un portazo mientras Vixx se quedaba mirando indiferente al no entender donde se estaba metiendo, hab√≠a pasado de estar buscando trabajo en lugares donde se viv√≠a mejor a estar colaborando con gente que parec√≠a que poco les gustaban los inventores, y no porque les hiciesen algo bueno, sino en general, doblaron a la izquierda y de ah√≠ se encontraron con un ascensor que ten√≠a el mismo tipo de puerta enrejada, la abri√≥ de un tir√≥n como si le costase tirar de ella, ambos pasaron dentro y √©l la cerro de la misma forma que antes, apenas entend√≠a porque hac√≠a eso, era como si le tuviese una bronca a las puertas o al propio lugar como si le hubiese hecho algo malo en alg√∫n momento. -¬øQue es este lugar? -le pregunto esperando una respuesta a esta situaci√≥n tan incomoda. Le chisto con el dedo silencionadole. -Ya lo veras -le dijo murmuradamente. Pulso uno de los botones y entonces el ascensor se puso a bajar de una manera poco halagadora, se o√≠a el sonido mec√°nico de los engranajes y los cables rechinando como si no estuviesen perfectamente enganchados, se tuvo que agarrar para no perder el equilibrio, aquel ascensor era una caja de la muerte ya que estaba tan mal dise√±ado que no sab√≠a si se iba a romper o no a medida que segu√≠an bajando varios pisos, hasta ahora, estaban llegando a un piso -5, y as√≠ sucesivamente. Al cabo de un par de minutos el ascensor por fin logro detenerse, llego a un piso menor que apenas sab√≠a reconocer de cual se trataba, pero pod√≠a asumir que se trataba de un piso -20, lo mas bajo a lo que hab√≠a llegado nunca, el hombre abri√≥ la puerta enrejada de un tir√≥n y entonces pasaron a un oscuro pasillo por el que apenas se ve√≠a algo, no era tan maloliente como el exterior pero se notaba que este era un lugar inh√≥spito y alejado de todo lo que hab√≠a arriba en la superficie. -En serio, ¬ødonde estamos? -le volvi√≥ a preguntar del miedo que ten√≠a. -Ahora lo vas a ver -le rechisto discrepando de darle respuesta alg√∫na. Siguieron avanzando por aquel pasillo que ten√≠a aspecto de no acabar nunca, era como si hubiesen pasado a otro mundo donde nada era lo que parec√≠a, hab√≠a tanto silencio que le hac√≠a sospechar que se hab√≠a metido en un mal lugar, quer√≠a intentar de dar la vuelta pero sent√≠a curiosidad por saber que era lo que ten√≠a que mostrarle aquel hombre, continuaron avanzando hasta girar por una esquina oculta por la oscuridad del ambiente, salieron a una sala mas amplia donde se encontraban un grupo de robots obreros amontonando varias cajas de actualizaciones, uno de ellos estaba montando una carretilla elevadora, los cinco sujetos que estaban ah√≠ se fijaron en los dos como si fuesen dos individuos que se hab√≠an metido donde no deb√≠an, pero en cambio el hombre estaba firme. -Necesito que alguien vaya a avisar a Screch -pidi√≥ estrictamente. -¬øUn nuevo recluta? -pregunto uno de los obreros que estaba apoyado sobre una pila de cajas. -Posiblemente, necesito que venga √©l aqu√≠ inmediatamente -insisti√≥ apresuradamente. El obrero robot se dio la vuelta y se marcho atravesando una puerta met√°lica que se encontraba en un rinc√≥n, la abri√≥ de un tir√≥n y se cerro por detr√°s, la situaci√≥n se volvi√≥ incomoda ya que ahora se encontraba rodeado de un grupo extra√±o de obreros que no sab√≠an que hac√≠an trabajando en un lugar tan oscuro como este, no parec√≠an pertenecer a un grupo social conocido. -¬øComo va la cosa aqu√≠ eh t√≠os? -se hizo el entusiasta con ellos para que viesen que √©l estaba de acuerdo con sus ideales o lo que fuese que tuviesen. Ning√∫no le dijo nada, todos estaban con aquella expresi√≥n amargada como si para ellos √©l no fuese nada del otro mundo, siguieron con lo suyo como si no existiese. -¬øLes pasa algo o... -Creeme, es mejor que no hables con ellos -le persuadi√≥ el hombre con total sinceridad. No sab√≠a si aquello era un consejo o un aviso de que no intentase meterse con ellos por pura seguridad, le segu√≠a molestando este lugar ya que apenas entend√≠a de que iba todo esto, sent√≠a que en cualquier momento se iba a acabar arrepintiendo de todo esto. Al cabo del rato la puerta volvi√≥ a abrirse y ah√≠ entonces surgi√≥ el mismo obrero de antes, les hizo un gesto como de querer que √©l viniese hac√≠a donde estaba √©l. -Bueno chico, aqu√≠ es donde nos separamos -le dio una palmada en el hombro y se dio la vuelta. -¬øUsted no viene? -le pregunto extra√±ado al ver que el hombre no le acompa√±aba despu√©s de haberle hecho todo aquel recorrido como para acabar as√≠. -Y no, esta ya no depende mi joven Vixx, ahora √©l se ocupara de usted, no se preocupe, le deseo mucha suerte, esta apunto de lograr algo bueno -le dijo en tono de despedida y se marcho dej√°ndole ah√≠ para que se ocupara √©l solo de lo que estuviese apunto de pasar. Vixx apenas entendi√≥ a que se refer√≠a pero viendo aquel robot que parec√≠a que le estaba esperando para que viniese, decidido ir a mirar para averiguar en que se estaba apunto de meter ahora. Paso al otro lado de la puerta y ah√≠ entonces se encontr√≥ con un enorme almac√©n enteramente formado por varias plataformas con cinco niveles a los costados donde se ve√≠a a todo un grupo de robots pasando cajas de un lado a otro, hab√≠an cintas en los costados donde grupos de brazos roboticos iban soldando varias piezas que apenas reconoc√≠a de que se trataban pero se notaban que lo que estaban haciendo ah√≠ era algo importante. -¬øPero que es este lugar? -se cuestiono asombrado al no poder creerse lo que estaba viendo. -Ven -insisti√≥ el robot queriendo que le siguiese. Le sigui√≥ y lo condujo hac√≠a al frente donde en un extremo se encontraba un robot enorme y musculoso hablando con otro obrero que le estaba pasando un papel para que escribiese algo, seguramente para afirmar alg√∫n tratado o algo parecido, se oy√≥ que le agradec√≠a y entonces se marcho por la izquierda, luego el robot grande se giro mostrando su aspecto delante de √©l, ten√≠a la cabeza alargada de frente, su mand√≠bula era cuadrada, ten√≠a unos tubos que actuaban de cabello enredado que le ca√≠an por detr√°s y todo su cuerpo estaba lleno de puntas de arpones y cables de nil√≥n de gran envergadura, tambi√©n llevaba colgando un arma en el cintur√≥n que apenas notaba de que tipo era pero era evidente que aquel hombre no era un jefe normal y corriente. Trago saliva al atemorizarse por el aspecto de robot tan particular. -¬øEres tu √©l nuevo? -le pregunto, su voz sonaba bronca como si mascase algo con la boca. -¬øComo dice? -entend√≠a bien su pregunta, el problema era que no entend√≠a a que se refer√≠a con eso. -Es √©l nuevo, al parecer tambi√©n ha parecido por algo parecido relacionado con Hojalata -le aclaro murmuradamente al o√≠do como si le estuviese contando algo fuera de lugar. Se les quedo mirando a los dos al querer entender a que ven√≠a toda esta situaci√≥n. -Entiendo -dijo asintiendo-. ¬øComo te llamas chico? -Norbert Vixx se√±or, es un placer -le extendi√≥ la mano para que se la estrechase. Le miro la mano y alzo la vista como si no se sintiese encantado con ese gesto, cambio su expresi√≥n a una de disgusto y entonces la bajo al ver que aquel robot no era de muchos apretones de manos. -¬øEs verdad de que te quedaste sin trabajo por culpa de Hojalata y los suyos? -Bueno, perd√≠ un trabajo rentable, no importante pero... -¬øSientes que aquello te decepcionante bastante? No sab√≠a que responder a eso, era como si solamente quisiera saber una cosa de √©l y nada mas. -Bueno, digamos que me decepciono mucho -fue lo √∫nico que se le ocurri√≥ responderle. Carraspeo pensativo como si hubiese encontrado algo interesante en √©l. -D√©jamelo a mi -le dijo al obrero. -Bien -obedeci√≥ seriamente y entonces se marcho por donde vino. Se giro viendo que el obrero se marchaba y volvi√≥ a dirigir su mirada hac√≠a el robusto robot. -¬øSabes quien soy yo chico? -No se√±or, ¬ølo pregunta porque cree que se quien es o porque lo he visto en alg√∫na parte? -Lo primero. -Pues... sinceramente se√±or, no se mucho quien es. Se le acerco mostrando una expresi√≥n seria y fija. -Soy el capit√°n Hacksaw Screch, y a partir de ahora vas a obedecer todas mis ordenes y a escuchar todo lo que te diga, de mi y la de mi superior, ¬ølo has entendido? Aquello le dio que pensar. -¬øSignifica que tengo el trabajo? Esbozo un murmuro de disgusto. -Vas a acabar siendo un perno duro de roer, ven conmigo -le pidi√≥ y se giro marchando por el frente. Miro a ambos lados pensando que ten√≠a un lugar seguro para irse ya que empezaba a sentir un rara duda hac√≠a todo lo que le rodeaba, no sab√≠a lo que era pero no le gustaba, decidi√≥ seguir a Screch para averiguar que era el lugar donde se encontraba, no parec√≠a ser una fabrica de construcci√≥n, parec√≠a mas bien una base, pero una base diferente a todas las que hab√≠a visto en televisi√≥n. Pasaron entre una de las plataformas y continuaron avanzando hasta meterse dentro de un rec√≥ndito hueco que hab√≠a oculto entre uno de los niveles de los pelda√±os, lo atravesaron y entonces acabaron metiendose dentro de una peque√±a habitaci√≥n, era un taller mec√°nico donde se encontraban todo tipo de herramientas y dem√°s materiales como para construir artefactos mec√°nicos, pero lo que mas le llamaba la atenci√≥n era un coche ovalado con una antena puntiaguda en el tejado, el coche estaba desgastado y ten√≠a manchas negras por todo el chasis. -No puede ser -exclamo sorprendido al ver lo que ten√≠a delante suyo. Fue avanzando mientras iba girando de un lado para otro ya que no pod√≠a creerse que estuviese metido en un taller como ese, todos los aparatos mec√°nicos con los que hab√≠a so√±ado en su vida se encontraban ah√≠ metidos y en perfecto estado, miro el coche y noto que parec√≠a ser un antiguo carromato a medio construir, lo toco y sinti√≥ la suciedad que hab√≠a en √©l. -¬øSabes lo que es esto no? -le pregunto inquisitivamente Screch. Le miro notando que parec√≠a que quisiera que le respondiese por el coche. -Bueno, se nota que a esto le falta repararlo -opino ri√©ndose entre dientes. -¬øPero sabes que es exactamente no? Ah√≠ entonces lo entendi√≥, quer√≠a saber si reconoc√≠a el coche. -Si, es un carromato de volumen 5 con un acelerador V2 de propulsi√≥n m√≠nima, el motor esta conectado a un par de pistones que efect√∫an la marcha a medida que se enciende el acelerador lateral que esta escondido debajo de la parte trasera, y tambi√©n que parece que a este coche se ha quedado a medias, le falta limpiar la carrocer√≠a y cambiar el motor por uno mucho mas rentable y adecuada para estos tiempos, los V2 tienen el fallo de agotarse muy pronto porque consumen demasiado del gasoil que se le a√±ade a trav√©s del deposito de combustible que hay debajo -resumi√≥ concretando todas las propiedades del coche, se lo conoc√≠a de sobra. -Incre√≠ble -exclamo Screch sorprendido. -¬øPasa algo? -Si, que normalmente la mayor√≠a de los mec√°nicos que metemos aqu√≠ apenas saben exactamente como func√≠onan estas cosas, ni siquiera saben la diferencia entre el liquido de frenos y la crema para el acerado -declaro demostrando que √©l hab√≠a dado en el clavo. Se ri√≥ falsamente al resultarle gracioso ese comentario. -Pero tu, has conseguido resumirme b√°sicamente como funciona esta cosa sin siquiera ponerte nervioso o haber durado mas de un minuto, eso es casi todo un r√©cord. -¬øUn r√©cord? ¬øEra una prueba? -¬øQue tipo de prueba crees que era? Se quedo pensando detenidamente en esa cuesti√≥n. -¬øUna prueba para determinar que soy apto para este trabajo o para demostrar que conozco lo suficiente de estas cosas mejor que todos los dem√°s mec√°nicos de este lugar? -objet√≥ especificando dos tipos de respuestas a lo que le estaba verificando. -Estupendo -dijo encantado. -¬øCual de las dos era? -Ninguna -declaro mostrando una sonrisa ingenua. Se quedo absorto al o√≠r eso. -Veras Norbert Vixx, en este lugar nosotros no nos preocupamos por si uno hace las cosas bien o las hacen mal, aqu√≠ nos preocupamos de si alguien sabe verdaderamente que es lo que esta haciendo, si no sabe lo que hace, ¬øcrees que perder√≠an el tiempo reparando esto o intentar√≠an de al menos tener el conocimiento suficiente para saber como repararlo? -le explic√≥ razonando con √©l para que entendiese que lo que importaba era estar preparado para conocer este tipo de cosas porque sino acabar√≠a metiendose en un lugar donde no le tocaba y estar√≠a desperdiciando un mont√≥n de buenos materiales que cualquier otro mucho mas experimentado podr√≠a hacerlo mejor. -¬øEntonces eso significa que como se de estas cosas, soy √∫til para usted? -Tu no eres √∫til para mi, tu le eres √∫til a nuestro amo. -¬øQuien es el amo aqu√≠? Asinti√≥ soltando un peque√±o suspiro amargo y entonces dijo: -Ven aqu√≠ -le pidi√≥ que se levantase y entonces ambos se marcharon del taller. Volvieron a estar en la zona de carga donde continuaba el mismo ajetreo de antes, giraron en la siguiente esquina y de ah√≠ fueron avanzando hasta llegar una plataforma auxiliar instalada cerca del tejado, ah√≠ pudieron que arriba de todo hab√≠a otro sujeto hablando con otro sujeto pero este era un robot normal, le iba diciendo algo y entonces se marcho por el frente, luego se giro y miro hac√≠a abajo notando la presencia de Screch y Vixx, √©l se alarmo al ver que le estaba mirando, pudo notar su aspecto, no era un robot corriente, era un robot que ten√≠a incorporado un casco con dos hojas rojas por el cual dentro de su cabeza sal√≠a fuego como si fuese una chimenea, iba vestido con una t√∫nica roja carmes√≠ y llevaba consigo un extra√±o bast√≥n por donde la punta era parecida al mismo casco que llevaba el robot en la cabeza solo que un poco mas chico que el original. Screch le levanto el pulgar como se√±alando que estaba todo en orden, √©l afirmo con la cabeza y se marcho desapareciendo de la vista de los dos. -¬øQuien era ese? -le pregunto sin quitar la mirada para ver donde se fue. -Ese era nuestro amo y l√≠der de este centro, es Arcturus Von Sprocket -le confeso sorpresivamente. -¬øArcturus Von Sprocket? -¬øTe suena ese nombre? -Me suena de algo, pero no se de que. -No te preocupes, pronto te enteraras, ven -le agarro poniendo su brazo encima de su hombro y entonces lo acompa√±o haciendo que se fuese con √©l de nuevo. Atravesaron un estrecho camino que hab√≠a mas adelante y entonces acabaron entrando en una amplia sala cuadriculada donde se encontraba una enorme maquina que ocupaba toda la parte frontal de sala, era un enorme tubo transparente que llegaba hasta una cuarta parte del techo, arriba hab√≠a una especie de plataforma que ten√≠a encima un especie de punta de cohete formada por dos hojas parecidas a las del casco de Sprocket, dentro hab√≠a una especie de c√°psula igual de transparente y por el que parec√≠a que se pod√≠a meter una persona dentro. -¬øPero que es eso? -se quedo asombrado al ver eso. Se fue acercando con prisa y entonces pudo observar mas de cerca como era en realidad, era una maquina tan enorme que apenas llegaba a ver lo que hab√≠a mucho mas arriba. -¬øTe gusta? -le pregunto. -¬øPara que sirve esta cosa? -inquiri√≥ intrigado por descubrir que se trataba la maquina. -Esta cosa, es el invento mas importante de Sprocket, es la maquina que nos dar√° la gloria a todos nosotros y dejara de preocuparnos por los inventores -comento expresamente. -¬øComo que preocuparnos por los inventores? -se cuestiono esa ultima menci√≥n. -Veras Vixx, en este lugar, todos los que trabajaban aqu√≠ antes, se dedicaban a hacer todo tipo de cosas √∫tiles, ten√≠an buenos trabajos, familias a las que querer, pero desgraciadamente todo eso se fue al traste hace unos a√±os -se puso a contarle toda la historia de lo que hac√≠an aqu√≠. -¬øQue fue lo que paso? -se intrigo solemnemente. -¬øConoces la historia de como fue que Gran Soldador desapareci√≥? -La conozco muy bien, Phineas T. Ratchet le embauco para que pensara que ya era demasiado viejo para seguir adelante y le hizo marcharse de la compa√±√≠a sin que nadie se diese cuenta de que ya no estaba trabajando para ellos, Ratchet se hizo cargo de todo hasta que Rodney Hojalata le destapo y lo mando a la carcel, luego √©l se hizo cargo de la compa√±√≠a y ahora todo el mundo disfruta inventando cosas -le resumi√≥ el asunto tal y como hab√≠a sucedido exactamente. -Vaya, si que aprendes mucho -se quedo halagado al ver que ten√≠a un verdadero conocimiento de la historia y de todas las dem√°s cosas. -Es lo que mejor se me da aparte de la mec√°nica -exclamo ingenuamente. Carraspeo pensativo y se quedo mir√°ndole fijamente, tuvo una idea. -¬øQuieres que te cuente un secreto que hasta ahora nadie sabe? -Uy no se, ¬øes uno bueno? -se ri√≥ al entusiasmarle la idea. Le hizo el gesto para que se acercase y entonces estando lo mas cerca que pudo le dijo: -Sprocket, es el t√≠o de Phineas T. Ratchet -le confeso susurradamente. -¬°No! -esbozo una enorme expresi√≥n de sorpresa al o√≠r eso. -As√≠ es, el estupido sobrino hizo que matasen a su hermana y ahora √©l ha quedado encerrado en una carcel de m√°xima seguridad donde jamas le podra ver. -Vaya, eso si que se ve cruel -opino indignado. -As√≠ es -afirmo, ve√≠a que se estaba interesando por todo el asunto-. ¬øSabes que es lo que hacemos aqu√≠ exactamente? -¬øEs otra prueba? -No, se trata de que entiendas, de que lo que hacemos aqu√≠ es muy importante y necesitamos la ayuda de todos para poder lograrlo, necesitamos a gente experta en este tipo de cosas porque estamos apunto de hacer algo muy importante quiz√°s cambie el curso de la historia. -En serio, ¬øy de que se trata? -Veras: Cuando Sprocket perdi√≥ a su hermana y encerraran a su sobrino, se dio cuenta de que el mundo estaba cambiando de una manera que √©l no le gustaba, ni siquiera a la gente que conoc√≠a, los inventores se han hecho con todos los puestos de trabajo, y eso hace que los dem√°s propietarios hayan acabado en la calle, sin trabajo, sin futuro, y todo a causa de √∫nico responsable en todo esto: Rodney Hojalata. -Pero si Rodney Hojalata se preocupa por todos los robots. -Solamente se preocupa por los robots que jamas se han esforzado en su vida, pero la gente que hay aqu√≠ se ha esforzado demasiado por conseguir lo que tiene, y que ha hecho Hojalata, quit√°rselos, se los ha quitado injustamente y √©l ha quedado puesto como un heroe. Carraspeo pensativo al reconocer que ten√≠a raz√≥n en eso. -¬øCrees que un heroe se merece tener toda esa atenci√≥n cuando otros han quedado en la ruina? -No, no lo merecen, pero no se, ¬øcree que Hojalata se dar√° cuenta de todo esto? Lo agarro de los hombros y le puso una expresi√≥n fr√≠a y r√≠gida. -Hojalata jamas ser√° uno de nosotros, y por eso mismo merece ser castigado por eso. -¬øCastigado? -se cuestiono esa ultima menci√≥n. -¬øSabes para que sirve esa maquina en realidad? -Sinceramente no, pero pareciera que sirve para algo importante. -As√≠ es, esta maquina la construyo Sprocket porque es su herramienta para vengarse de aquellos que mataron a su hermana, y le quitaron a su sobrino, muy pronto, cuando esto este terminado, Sprocket utilizara esta maquina para acabar con todos los inventores e impedir que sigan inventando cosas, ¬øa menos que esto no te interese? -Si me interesa -acoto decidido sin siquiera pensar en lo que hac√≠a. -¬øEntonces estas dispuesto a trabajar para nosotros Norbert Vixx? ¬øO te vas a quedar en la calle como te sucedi√≥ antes? ¬øQuieres ser alguien que ayudo a cambiar la historia? ¬øO quieres quedarte para convertirte en un mec√°nico de guerra? Vixx se lo pens√≥ detenidamente y ten√≠a mucha raz√≥n, no soportaba que la gente sufriera a causa de otro tipo de gente, sobretodo los inventores, ten√≠a tambi√©n en raz√≥n, hab√≠an tantos que se hab√≠an hecho con demasiado y eso no le gustaba, ten√≠a que hacer algo, ten√≠a que demostrar que pod√≠a cambiar las cosas tal y hacerlas mucho mejor. Esta ten√≠a que ser su nueva meta a partir de ahora. -Me quedo -acepto decidido. FIN DEL QUINTO SEGMENTO[Chapter 6] ROBOTS: LAS PRECUELAS Este fanfic ha sido presentado por Dimitrix Enterprises y Dimitrix Inc. SEGMENTO 6: REGLA DE PADRES Herbert y Lydia Hojalata llevaban 25 a√±os casados, tanto que llevaban celebr√°ndolo yendo a un restaurante que se encontraba un poco a las afuera de Ciudad Remache, pero desde que su hijo Rodney Hojalata se hab√≠a convertido en el propietario de Industrias Gran Soldador, ahora este les agradec√≠a todo el cari√±o que les hab√≠an dado a lo largo de los a√±os desde que le inventaron invit√°ndoles a comer a cualquier restaurante de lujo que ellos quisieran, a ellos no les gusto mucho la idea ya que ellos sent√≠an que se estaban precipitando demasiado con el √©xito de Rodney y no deber√≠an comportarse como gente que parece tenerlo todo cuando ellos a pesar de todo segu√≠an siendo la misma pareja de robots discontinuados de siempre. Desde que Herbert se hab√≠a convertido en uno de los nuevos m√∫sicos del momento, se hab√≠a ganado una cierta reputaci√≥n y eso hac√≠a que fuese por fuese, cualquier due√±o de un restaurante les invitaba gratuitamente, pero claro, a cambio de que √©l les tocase a ellos para hacer as√≠ que la velada resultase ser mucho mas halagadora, fueron a uno de los nuevos restaurantes que ya hab√≠an sido instalados hacia varias semanas, ellos decidieron ver como era y en cuanto se metieron, al instante el due√±o reconoci√≥ quien era Herbert e inmediatamente les invitaron sobre una de las mesas del centro donde ten√≠an una perfecta vista a trav√©s de la ventana donde se pod√≠a ver la ciudad y mas adelante del otro lado ten√≠an a un grupo de m√∫sicos tocando con instrumentos de jazz para hacer parecer que estaban en los a√±os 40. Les sirvieron a cada uno una copa de aceite con champan y se dieron un peque√±o con ellas. -Feliz aniversario cari√±o -le dijo Herbert a su esposa. -Feliz aniversario a ti tambi√©n Herbert Hojalata, o deber√≠a decir: Herbert Hojalata, el padre de Rodney Hojalata que mantiene esta ciudad limpia y segura -espeto ir√≥nicamente Lydia. Ambos se rieron al ver lo absurdo que sonaba. -Es incre√≠ble que hayamos llegado a esto, hace unos a√±os ve√≠amos a nuestro hijo intentando de encontrar la manera de lograr su sue√±o, y al final ha acabado convirtiendose en algo mas que eso -opino Herbert sinti√©ndose orgulloso por ver en que se convirti√≥ en su hijo. -Le ense√±aste bien, si no hubiese sido por ti quiz√°s no habr√≠a llegado tan lejos. -Lo se, pero... ¬øcrees que a lo mejor ha sido demasiado? -¬øA que te refieres? -se extra√±o ante esa menci√≥n. Se quedo mirando la copa con champan y entonces dijo: -Fijate bien en todo esto, ¬øcrees que nos lo merecemos? -se cuestiono expresamente. -Pero Herbert, ¬øde que estas hablando? -Antes en mis tiempos siempre estaba esforz√°ndome en conseguir mas de lo que yo quer√≠a, y ahora Rodney con tan solo un grupo de amigos y un poco de inteligencia, ha conseguido convertirse en el propietario de Industrias Gran Soldador, yo nunca podr√≠a haber llegado a eso -se autocompadec√≠o de la idea de que su hijo hubiese llegado a ser alguien de una manera tan f√°cil. -Y no, no podr√≠as porque entender no ten√≠as la confianza que antes sol√≠as tener, pero tu hijo si, tu le diste esa confianza el d√≠a en que intento de marcharse sin que √©l nos avisara, si no le hubieses dicho eso, ahora mismo habr√≠a continuado lavando platos como hiciste tu antes -le argumento su mujer queriendo que entendiese que se equivocaba con eso ya que haber dejado que Rodney se marchara a Ciudad Robot fue la mejor decisi√≥n que tuvo hasta ahora. Herbert lo pens√≥ detenidamente, ten√≠a raz√≥n, no podr√≠a haber dejado que su hijo hubiese continuando lavando como un robot lavavajillas como √©l hab√≠a estado haciendo durante los √∫ltimos 25 a√±os, si no hubiese ocurrido aquel incidente en la cafeter√≠a del se√±or Gunk, quiz√°s todo habr√≠a cambiado para siempre, de eso no pod√≠a quejarse, su hijo le hab√≠a dado aquello que mas ansiaba, era estar en perfecto estado, y convertirse en el m√∫sico que siempre quiso ser. -Tienes raz√≥n, deber√≠a sentirme orgulloso por lo que hizo Rodney en vez de sentir lastima por lo que pudo pasar o no, no se porque lo he pensado, tengo tantas lagunas en mi cabeza -se disculpo sinti√©ndose avergonzado por haber pensado de forma contradictoria. -No te preocupes cari√±o, todo esta bien, vale, seguramente has pensado eso porque todav√≠a no estas muy acostumbrado a este tipo de cosas -le consolo queriendo que lo asimilara antes de pensar cualquier cosa, le miro cari√±osamente a la cara al ver que verdaderamente se avergonzaba de eso. -¬øCrees que deber√≠a hablarlo con Rodney? -le pregunto queriendo saber su opini√≥n acerca de si deber√≠a hablarlo con su hijo o no. Lydia pens√≥ en esa propuesta y no supo muy bien que pensar de eso. -Creo que ser√° mejor que no, que √©l piense que todav√≠a va bien -le propuso con tal de no hacer preocupar a Rodney ya que justamente ahora estaba en una √©poca en la que estaba demasiado feliz como para pensar que ahora su padre ten√≠a dudas sobre su propia vida. -Ser√° lo mejor -espeto estando de acuerdo. Justo en ese momento se acerco un camarero y le dijo: -Disculpe se√±or Hojalata que le interrumpamos su velada pero... nuestro trompetista se ha quedado un poco af√≥nico y no puede cantar, as√≠ que si no le parece bien, nos gustar√≠a que tocara una melod√≠a con nuestro grupo de m√∫sicos que est√°n ansiosos por seguir tocando, ¬øle parece bien? ¬øSi quiere le traemos alg√∫na cosa extra para comer? -le explico proponi√©ndole de tocar con los m√∫sicos, le se√±alo al grupo que se encontraba mas adelante, estaban preparando los instrumentos. Se dieron un intercambio de miradas al no saber que pensar de esa propuesta. -Es que... -se quedo pensando en alguna excusa ya que no ten√≠a muchas ganas de meterse en aquel grupo, estaba cansado de estar tocando-, no tengo mi trompeta. -No se preocupe, tenemos una guardada, creo que a lo mejor le gustara -a√±adi√≥. -¬øEn serio? -se quedo tartamudeo al ver que no se pod√≠a escapar de esto. -As√≠ es, ¬øsi quiere? No sab√≠a que hacer, si fuera por √©l dir√≠a que no, pero como lo hab√≠an invitado gratuitamente, ten√≠a que darles algo a ellos como acto de modestia, miro a su mujer y ella estaba mir√°ndole con aquella expresi√≥n cari√±osa como de querer que lo hiciera por pura amabilidad, odiaba que Lydia hiciera eso ya que le resultaba imposible resistirse, esa era su debilidad, pero tambi√©n ten√≠a que hacerlo por su hija, por Rodney, que se ha pasado toda su vida queriendo como su padre tocaba a mas no poder, y a pesar de que no estaba aqu√≠ mismo, se habr√≠a sentido igualmente orgulloso de lo que hiciera. -Lo har√© -acepto golpeteando la palma de sus manos en se√±al de estar decidido. -Me alegro se√±or, venga conmigo -dijo encantado el hombre y lo ayudo a levantarse de la silla. -¬øSeguro que podr√°s bien estar aqu√≠ sola cari√±o? -le pregunto a su mujer sabiendo que mientras √©l estuviese tocando, ella se quedar√≠a ah√≠ sola en la mesa. -Tu ve, yo mirare -le insisti√≥ con tono vacilante, confiaba en que diese un buen espect√°culo. Sonr√≠o confiado al ver que su madre no le daba ning√∫n problema. -Podr√≠a darle a mi mujer todo aquello que ella pida por favor -le pidi√≥ expresamente al hombre con tal de hacer que ella se sintiera mejor mientras √©l tocaba. -Con mucho gusto se√±or -acepto encantado. -Me voy -le aviso en se√±al de despedida y entonces se marcho siendo acompa√±ado por el hombre. Le hizo un gesto con la mano de despedirse mientras ella se quedaba ah√≠ con una sonrisa complaciente al saber que su hombre har√≠a un buen espect√°culo. El hombre dirigi√≥ a Herbert hac√≠a el otro lado del palco que hab√≠a al frente del restaurante, le hizo doblar por la esquina y de ah√≠ lo llevo a un enorme hueco donde estaba el grupo de robots preparando sus instrumentos, los ve√≠a limpi√°ndolos con varios estropajos, se fijo en los m√∫sicos y en los instrumentos que llevaban consigo, hab√≠a uno con un saxof√≥n, un clarinete, una bater√≠a, una guitarra el√©ctrica, y otro que parec√≠a estar tocando con una arm√≥nica. -Caballeros, les presento a Herbert Hojalata, √©l ser√° el sustituto de Peter, es el padre de Rodney Hojalata, y tambi√©n sabe tocar la trompeta, ¬øse la pod√©is ense√±ar? El del bater√≠a agarro la trompeta que estaba metida en su caja, la levanto y se la ense√±o. -Fabuloso -exclamo el hombre encantado con el grupo, le dio un golpe de palmas en el hombro-. Si desea algo, solamente salga y busqueme por donde vino antes, ¬øde acuerdo? -Si -acepto. -Bien, le deseo suerte, tocamos dentro de un rato -le aviso con tono confiado y entonces se marcho dandose la vuelta por el mismo lugar por el que vino. Herbert se quedo ah√≠ solo sin saber que hacer, entend√≠a lo que quer√≠an que hiciera pero ahora sent√≠a que no estaba preparado para esto, miro al grupo que se levanto de donde estaban sentados y se acercaron hac√≠a √©l mostrandose con una expresi√≥n de orgullo y admiraci√≥n. -¬øDe veras es usted Herbert Hojalata? -le pregunto el m√∫sico de la guitarra ac√∫stica. -As√≠ es, ¬øhabr√©is o√≠do hablar sobre mi hijo no? -les estrecho la mano para presentarse. Todos se miraron ingenuamente al o√≠r ese comentario. -Ni falta hace escuchar sobre ello, todo el mundo sabe quien es Rodney Hojalata -espeto vacilante el m√∫sico que ten√≠a la arm√≥nica en la mano. -Ya, me lo imaginaba. -¬ø√âl esta aqu√≠? -pregunto el m√∫sico de la bater√≠a. -No, √©l esta ocupandose de otra cosa, solamente estoy yo con mi mujer. -Vaya -se quedaron todos disgustados con eso. -Pero al menos sabe que esta haciendo lo correcto, ¬øno? -objet√≥ el del saxof√≥n. -Si, de eso estoy seguro -dijo Herbert sintiendo que ahora le resultaba imposible pensar en algo malo de toda la situaci√≥n, todos estaban verdaderamente entusiasmados con Rodney, tanto que ahora ya no pod√≠a quejarse de seguir teniendo dudas sobre ese tema. -Esta de aqu√≠ es la trompeta -se la entrego el que tocaba el clarinete. Era una trompeta de plata de tama√±o medio, le cab√≠a en ambas palmas de las manos. -Oh vaya, se ve que esta no es la misma -espeto ir√≥nicamente. Los otros se rieron por ese insulso y absurdo comentario. -¬øEsta es la trompeta de... ¬øcomo era que se llamaba vuestro amigo? -Peter, el pobre no va a poder tocar esta noche -dijo disgustado el de la bater√≠a. -Siento mucho que se haya quedado af√≥nico -se disculpo ante ellos, sent√≠a una gran verg√ºenza por tenerse que meter con ellos ya que este no era exactamente su lugar, pero ten√≠a que hacerlo ya que Rodney habr√≠a hecho lo mismo por ellos si alguien se hubiera roto en alg√∫na parte. -Bueno, en realidad no es que se ha quedado \"exactamente af√≥nico\" -indico expresamente el de la arm√≥nica, puso un tono como indicando que hab√≠a algo mas que no le hab√≠an contado hasta ahora. -El pobre se ha atragantado con uno de sus dientes de bronce -confeso el del saxof√≥n. -Que horrible. -As√≠ es, le dijimos al muy idiota que no se cambiara los dientes por unos de bronce, esos siempre se salen de su lugar, y fijate lo que ha pasado -indico el del clarinete. -Seguramente despu√©s de esto no se le ocurr√≠a volver a cambiarse las dientes -opino. -Y obviamente no -indico el del saxof√≥n tom√°ndoselo como una ret√≥rica respuesta. Justo en ese momento llego un robot t√©cnico con enormes auriculares en las orejas del otro lado. -Chicos, sal√≠s en dos minutos -les aviso susurradamente. -De acuerdo -le confirmo el de la guitarra. El t√©cnico se marcho y los m√∫sicos fijaron su mirada en Hojalata de nuevo. -¬øEstas preparado para tocar se√±or Hojalata? -le pregunto. -Lo estoy, aunque no se si esto va a tener el mismo afecto que mi actual trompeta. -No se preocupe, siquiera le doy un ultimo arreglillo -se dispuso el del clarinete a volver a cogerla. -¬°No! -rechisto neg√°ndose a dejar que lo tocara-. A un instrumento nunca hay que cambiarle nada que lo afecte, solamente lo esencial, nada mas. Todos se les quedaron mirando at√≥nitos al ver como reaccion√≥ ante ese acto desprevenido. -Pues supongo que usted es el maestro -objet√≥ expresamente el de la guitarra. Mientras afuera, Lydia continuaba esperando a que Herbert saliera, se estaba aburriendo un poco al estar cenando sola, pero eso le daba igual, iba a ver a su marido volver a tocar delante de todo el mundo una vez mas, y seguramente con un grupito de m√∫sicos de mala muerte a los que iba a dejar en evidencia, le resultaba gracioso pero al mismo tiempo algo cruel, ning√∫no se merec√≠a llevarse el protagonismo de otro por mucho que fuera bueno, incluido Rodney, que a pesar de ser el mejor inventor del momento, le segu√≠a dedicando todo su ingenio a Gran Soldador, su heroe de toda la infancia, pero su mayor heroe siempre ha sido su padre, que sin √©l, Rodney no se habr√≠a convertido en lo que ahora, y eso era algo que Herbert ya lo sab√≠a de sobra. -Damas y caballeros, con todos ustedes, nuestro equipo de m√∫sicos de jazz -el due√±o del local se puso en medio del escenario que estaba tapado bajo unas lonas de color carmes√≠, ten√≠a agarrado un micr√≥fono conectando a un cable y empezo a decir-: Pero ademas hoy tenemos algo especial que anunciaros, algo que seguramente os entusiasmara bastante. Aquello hizo que toda la sala quedase en un terrible silencio y todo el mundo se pusiera a murmurar como locos, era evidente que esto no era algo que suced√≠a habitualmente en el restaurante. Lydia se preparo sabiendo muy bien lo que iba a pasar, ah√≠ ven√≠a √©l. -Tenemos un invitado especial, y no es ni mas ni menos que: ¬°Herbert Hojalata!, ¬°padre de Rodney Hojalata!, ¬°nuestro salvador y el mayor inventor del mundo! -se hizo a un lado y entonces las lonas se levantaron por arriba y se mostr√≥ a todo el grupo de m√∫sicos puestos en una posici√≥n pentagonal sobre el escenario que estaba dividido por varias secciones circulares que se elevaban varios metros hac√≠a arriba, en la punta se encontraba Herbert teniendo en sus manos la trompeta. Todo el mundo se puso a aplaudir mientras √©l hac√≠a una reverencia formal delante de todo el publico que le vitoreaba como si fuese un heroe cuando solamente ten√≠a la gratitud de ser un buen m√∫sico. -Algo que decir -le entrego el micr√≥fono a Herbert. Herbert no sab√≠a que decir, esta no era una de sus funciones, ve√≠a a toda la gente y eran personas que apenas conoc√≠a, excepto una, su mujer Lydia que la miraba confiada, aquello que se motivara mucho mas y supiera muy bien lo que ten√≠a que decir. -Esto. Se lo dedico a mi hijo Rodney, que a pesar de no estar aqu√≠, le dedico lo mejor para √©l y toda nuestra familia, juntos -esbozo con total sinceridad. Todos le aplaudieron sinti√©ndose conformes con ese discurso emocional. Le devolvi√≥ el micr√≥fono y ah√≠ entonces todos se pusieron a tocar, el del bater√≠a fue golpeando primeramente todos los pasillos y de ah√≠ todo el resto se puso a tocar los instrumentos creando una m√∫sica ac√∫stica de jazz que reson√≥ por todo el restaurante. N/A: No tengo ni idea de como describir esta escena, as√≠ que podemos asumir que Herbert esta tocando la trompeta con total euforia mientras el resto hace lo suyo y esto lleva a varios minutos adelante donde todo el mundo ya ha quedado mas que satisfecho con la actuaci√≥n. La canci√≥n termino y todo el mundo se puso a aplaudir sintiendo que hab√≠an tenido uno de los mejores espect√°culos de toda la noche, Herbert se puso a saludarles mientras √©l iba mirando entusiasmado a todos los espectadores que estaban delante suyo, los m√∫sicos que ten√≠an detr√°s se pusieron a darles palmadas en la espalda al sentirse orgullosos de que hubiese participado con ellos, les estrecho la mano y √©l sigui√≥ sintiendo que hoy era el hombre de la noche. Su mujer Lydia le saludaba feliz de ver que pudo hacer un autentico espect√°culo inigualable a todos los que hab√≠a hecho anteriormente, pero sin duda este le parec√≠a el mas personal de todos, y por una buena raz√≥n, lo hac√≠a por Rodney, y por demostrar que no le ten√≠a miedo al futuro. Despu√©s de aquella cena y el espect√°culo que se monto Herbert, ambos decidieron marcharse a pie para as√≠ tener un momento a solas sin tener que depender de nada, tardar√≠an mas pero al menos tendr√≠an el tiempo suficiente como para poder hablar de lo que fuera. -Ha estado bien -dijo ella mientras soltaba una peque√±a risa de entusiasmo. -Lo se -reafirmo sabiendo muy bien a que se refer√≠a. Iban por la acera mientras √©l la sosten√≠a con el brazo por encima de su cuello. -¬øCrees que Rodney se enterara? -le pregunto dudosamente. -Se enterara -le miro a la cara-. ¬øPorque dudas tanto? -No se, ¬øtu crees que alguien lo ha grabado y lo habr√° metido en la web? De pronto Lydia se solt√≥ y puso delante de √©l con una mirada seria. -¬øQue te ocurre? -Ah -asinti√≥ amargado al ver que ahora ya no pod√≠a ocultar sus pensamientos. -Me habr√≠a encantado que toda la familia hubiese estado con nosotros para verme -declaro. Aquello fue algo que a Lydia le resulto bastante extra√±o pero al mismo tiempo lo comprend√≠a y por una muy buena raz√≥n en especial. -¬øTu quer√≠as que Rodney te viera, verdad? -le pregunto con total sinceridad. -No lo se, quiz√°s si, y quiz√°s no, pero... al menos algo. -Herbert, no necesitas que tu hijo este aqu√≠ para ver lo que puedes hacer, √©l ya lo sabe, tu eres su heroe, siempre lo has sido -le consolo cari√±osamente mientras le pasaba la mano por la cabeza. -Por encima de Gran Soldador -agrego ingenuamente. -Que eso ya es algo -indico ella sigui√©ndole la corriente. Ambos se quedaron ri√©ndose al reconocer lo ir√≥nico de toda esta situaci√≥n. Herbert sigui√≥ riendo hasta que volteo la cabeza a un lado y se fijo en algo que le llamo la atenci√≥n, Lydia no entend√≠a hac√≠a donde miraba hasta que ella volteo la mirada tambi√©n. Estaba mirando el escaparate de una tienda de vestidos de novia, hab√≠a dos maniqu√≠es que ten√≠an puestos dos tipos de vestido de novia mientras sujetaban varios ramos de flores mec√°nicas. -¬øTe acuerdas de cuando nos casamos? -pregunto √©l. -Si, me acuerdo perfectamente. -Yo estaba en el altar, a mi lado estaba el tonto de mi amigo Paul como mi padrino que no paraba de hacer cosas raras con la cara para distraer a la gente, entonces llegaste tu siendo acompa√±ada por tu padre, llevabas puesto ese vestido blanco que te hac√≠a parecer como si hubieses salido de una fabrica de manufacturac√≠on -argumento relatando toda la historia tal y como se contaba. -Y tu pareces uno de esos mu√±ecos de consuelo por encargo. -Solo que por aquel entonces yo era mucho mas feo que uno de esos mu√±ecos. Ambos volvieron a reirse al resultarle ir√≥nica esa situaci√≥n. -¬øTu crees que Rodney ya le habr√° pedido matrimonio a su novia? -¬øTe refieres a Cappy? -Exactamente, esos dos est√°n tan juntos todo el dia trabajando en lo que √©l tiene que no me resultar√≠a raro pensar que se casara pronto con ella. -Quiz√°s lo haga dentro de un tiempo. -Pues en ese tiempo yo estar√© ya muerto. -Venga Herbert no pienses mal, Rodney te curo para que pudieses vivir un poco mas, deber√≠as aprovechar esas nuevas actualizaciones para tener buenos pensamientos. -Y los tengo, pero vienen estas dudas en la cabeza y no se si aceptar todo lo que me pasa a mi alrededor o sentirme mal conmigo mismo, es como una regla de padre. -¬øRegla de padres? -Si, las reglas que hacen que un padre se de cuenta de que es lo mas importante en su propia vida, sin ellas no te dar√≠as cuenta de lo que estas haciendo contigo mismo o lo que aportar√≠a que le hiciera a los dem√°s, y hoy esta noche me parece que he violado una de esas reglas. -¬øCual? -La de sentirme demasiado orgulloso por lo que soy. -Esa no me parece una regla de padres. -En realidad si lo es, pi√©nsalo bien, mi propio hijo me ha convertido en lo que soy, me ha hecho sentirme mucho mas orgulloso que cuando √©l trabajaba conmigo lavando platos, me ha convertido en el m√∫sico que siempre quise ser, y a pesar de todo eso, no me siento orgulloso de eso, ¬øporque? ¬øPorque tengo esta duda en mi cabeza que me obliga a no sentirme satisfecho conmigo mismo. -Quiz√°s el problema sea que tienes demasiado miedo a aceptar que han cambiado mucho las cosas: Rodney se ha convertido en el propietario de Industrias Gran Soldador, su heroe, ahora se venden actualizaciones a todo el mundo, nadie va al basurero, y ahora a nadie le falta nada. Aquello hizo que Herbert se detuviera quedandose r√≠gido al instante. -Ah√≠ esta -dijo murmuradamente. -¬øQue esta qu√©? -Ese es el problema, hay demasiadas cosas buenas en medio. -¬øDe que estas hablando? -Antes todo iba mal, pero ahora que Rodney lo ha restablecido todo, se siente como si todo esto fuese un producto de fantas√≠a, no es real. -¬øQue quieres decir con eso? -Me resulta imposible vivir ahora en un mundo tan perfecto como este. Lydia se le quedo mirando con una expresi√≥n at√≥nita al no entender a que se refer√≠a con eso. -¬øVerdaderamente piensas eso de todo esto? -No lo se, pero... quiz√°s sea ese el problema que he tenido hasta ahora. De pronto le dio una inesperada bofetada en la cara que lo dejo atontado. -¬øA que ha venido eso? -le reprocho sin entender porque le abofeteo. -Por estar pensando como un tonto. -¬øQue? -no comprendi√≥ esa confesi√≥n tan conflictiva. -Herb, no puede ser que por mucho que pienses que como el mundo ha cambiado, tu tienes que echar de menos los malos tiempos de tu vida pasada, dime: ¬øDe veras quieres volver a trabajar para el se√±or Gunk despu√©s de lo mal que te trato durante estos √∫ltimos? ¬øO a Rodney? ¬øRecuerdas lo que le dijo cuando le despidieron aquel dia que decidi√≥ marcharse a Ciudad Robot? -le concreto todas las preguntas que se le ven√≠an a la cabeza para que viera que era una estupidez que pensara de esa manera tan fr√≠vola y contradictoria a su situaci√≥n actual. Eso fue algo que le hizo entrar en raz√≥n, no pod√≠a seguir pensando as√≠, antes no era nada, ahora era y ten√≠a que sentirse orgulloso por eso, tanto para √©l como por su hijo. Se llevo las manos a la cara y se las paso de la verg√ºenza que ten√≠a por hab√©rsele ocurrido esa conclusi√≥n. -Lo siento mucho Lydia, he arruinado la velada. -¬øQue has arruinado la velada? -Si, he estado todo el tiempo con dudas sobre quien soy y porque soy as√≠, pienso en no sentirme orgulloso de lo que soy y de lo que no es Rodney, y encima tu me has abofeteado, por primera vez en la vida haz hecho que hasta ni siquiera nuestros respectivos se nos ocurrir√≠an haber hecho -aclaro sincerandose con ella para que viera que se sent√≠a mal por todo lo ocurrido hasta ahora. -Herb, no has arruinado nada, a√∫n -dijo eso ultimo con incredulidad. -¬øQue pensara Rodney ahora de esto? -se puso nervioso de pensarlo. -Mejor que no sepa nada, vale, no tiene porque saberlo, simplemente deja que esto suceda, ¬øde acuerdo? -le propuso Lydia con tal de que no se siguiese sintiendo mal consigo mismo. Reflexiono pensativamente sobre esa propuesta hasta que entonces dijo: -¬øCrees que Rodney se dar√° cuenta? -se lo sigui√≥ cuestionando. -√âl no se dar√° cuenta, esta demasiado contento con su vida como para pensar en eso. -Cierto -reafirmo reconociendo que ten√≠a raz√≥n en esa cuesti√≥n, Rodney estaba tan entusiasmado con lo que ten√≠a que le resultar√≠a imposible ver a su padre teniendo dudas sobre su vida. -¬øQuieres que hagamos algo mas o... -No, solamente volvamos a casa, estoy cansado. -Tienes raz√≥n, yo tambi√©n. Acepto y entonces ambos marcharon lentamente tomando el camino de vuelta a casa sin ning√∫n problema, Herb volvi√≥ a apoyar su brazo sobre el cuello de su mujer y aquello hizo que ella apoyase la cabeza sobre su cuello de lo encantada que estaba por tener a su marido al lado. -Ha sido una buena velada -dijo ella. -Lo se -afirmo murmuradamente. -Deber√≠amos de repetirlo, quiz√°s con toda la familia. -Vale, pero como Rodney traiga al revoltoso de su amigo rojo juro por dios que la pr√≥xima cena la hago en el despacho de Rodney, creo que nadie se dar√° cuenta de eso -decreto ir√≥nicamente. Se puso a re√≠r Lydia al resultarle divertido como se quejaba de esas cosas. Al cabo de menos de una hora regresaron a casa, Herb abri√≥ la puerta dejando que Lydia pasara primero pero antes siquiera de dar un paso mas la detuvo al instante. -Espera un momento. -¬øQue pasa? -Quiero hacer esto -la agarro por detr√°s y la levanto sosteni√©ndola por el cuerpo mientras ella se quedaba asombrada al ver la tonter√≠a que se le ocurri√≥ hacer. La fue llevando al interior de la casa mientras Herb se re√≠a de lo entusiasmado que estaba por haber hecho esto, la sigui√≥ llevando mientras se aguantaba de no intentar que se le cayera. -Como una pareja de novios -exclamo √©l. -En su primer d√≠a de casados mas bien -indico ir√≥nicamente Lydia. -Aqu√≠ te dejo -la apoyo sobre el sof√° mientras suspiraba aliviada del cansancio que ten√≠a. -Me parece que me quedare aqu√≠ un buen rato -dijo ella extendiendo los brazos hac√≠a abajo. -¬øSeguro que no quieres que te lleve a la cama? -No, d√©jalo, me ir√© yo sola cuando consiga recomponerme. -Bueno, si te apetece estar√© duch√°ndome, me parece que voy a tener que irme a me pulan un poco antes de que todo esto se oxida -aviso ir√≥nicamente mientras se alejaba de la habitaci√≥n. -Tu ya no puedes oxidarte. -En realidad si que puedo, pero no como antes -indico asomando la cabeza y se marcho. Se quedo Lydia soltando una peque√±a risotada sarc√°stica al ver que su marido siempre ten√≠a algo que decir al respecto sobre lo que iba a hacer, le resultaba imposible verle de otra manera, siempre era tan extravagante como ingenuo, y eso le gustaba de √©l, no lo cambiar√≠a por nada del mundo, cosa que seguramente Rodney pensar√≠a lo mismo, no hab√≠a mejor padre que √©l para haberle ense√±ado todo lo que necesitaba para haberse convertido en quien era. Pasada una hora, Herbert termino de ducharse, se limpio puli√©ndose todas sus actualizaciones y entonces cerro la canilla del cual sali√≥ un chorro de aceite puro, sali√≥ de la ducha mientras manten√≠a una toalla atada sobre la mitad de su cuerpo, se meti√≥ en el ropero y se puso a buscar sus actualizaciones secundarias para irse a dormir, dejo las viejas amontonadas en un rinc√≥n del armario que hab√≠a al lado, se puso a buscar cuales actualizaciones ponerse ya que la mayor parte eran todas iguales y no ten√≠an nada distinto, aquello hizo que se pusiera a dudar sobre lo que ten√≠a, le dio igual y cog√≠o la que ten√≠a mas cerca, luego cerro de un portazo el armario. -Cari√±o, ¬øte vienes a la cama? -llamo a su mujer. No se oy√≥ nada, no le contesto, aquello lo extra√±o bastante. -Lydia, ¬øestas ah√≠? -le pregunto intentando de llamar su atenci√≥n. Segu√≠a son o√≠r nada, era como si su mujer hubiera desaparecido de repente mientras estaba distra√≠do metido en la ducha, decidi√≥ ir al sal√≥n para ver lo que ocurr√≠a, fue yendo hasta ah√≠ cuando de pronto se percato de algo, o√≠a un sonido, un sonido de voces inintendibles pero no parec√≠an venir de un robot, era una voz que le sonaba familia, se meti√≥ en el sal√≥n y observo que si estaba Lydia, solo que en este caso estaba sentada delante de la mesa del comedor con una grabadora en sus manos, estaba encendida y miraba algo que parec√≠a estar grabado en su interior. -Lydia, ¬øque estas haciendo? -le volvi√≥ a preguntar ahora que la ten√≠a delante. -Herb, ¬øte acuerdas de esto? -le pidi√≥ que se acercara para que viera lo que hab√≠a en la grabadora. Se acerco lentamente para ver que era lo que estaba viendo, se puso delante de ella y observo que se trataba de un video en el que se ve√≠a a Rodney con 10 a√±os, estaba sentado en una silla reclinable negra y el fondo era blanco, como la pared de una psiquiatra. - ¬øY dices Rodney que un dia conocer√°s a Gran Soldador? -No solamente le conocer√©, le presentare todos mis inventos. -¬øDe veras? -Si, as√≠ es, le demostrare que soy el mayor inventor del mundo. Herb se quedo mirando fijamente el video y supo reconocer exactamente de que se trataba. -Un momento, ¬øesto no es de esa entrevista que nos hizo aquella psiquiatra a la que fuimos a llevar a Rodney? -inquiri√≥ sorprendido al ver que se trataba de eso. -As√≠ es, es el mismo. -Incre√≠ble, ya ni me acordaba de que esto exist√≠a. -¬øComo es Gran Soldador? -Grande, como una bola. -¬øEs una bola? -No, la bola no. Es... La Bola. -Ah, entiendo. -Estaba revisando las cosas y me encontr√© con esto escondido en el arc√≥n de al lado. -¬øPorque ser√° que lo escondimos ah√≠? -Quien sabe, quiz√°s paso el tiempo y ni nos acordamos de donde dejamos las cosas. -¬øCrees que Gran Soldador es tu heroe porque... -Bueno, porque inventa cosas √∫tiles, aunque... -¬øAunque? Se quedo el Rodney joven mirando para otro lado como pensando detenidamente lo que iba a decir. -Yo tengo a otro heroe mas de mi lado. -¬øAs√≠? ¬øY cual es? -Me parece que se refiere a mi . Surgi√≥ un Herbert Hojalata un poco mas joven metiendose en la imagen del video, se sent√≥ en la misma silla donde estaba su hijo y volvi√≥ a sentarse, √©l se sent√≥ encima de su regazo. - Espero de que esto no estropee la sesi√≥n, ¬øeh? -No, esta bien que usted interactue con su hijo, ¬øle parece bien? -Si, ¬øa que si eh Rodney? ¬øYo soy tu heroe? -Por encima de Gran Soldador. -Lo ve, yo soy su heroe. Se puso a abrazarlo mientras √©l se re√≠a de una forma coqueta. -Es incre√≠ble lo mucho que ha cambiado desde ese momento -Lydia no pudo evitarlo y acabo llevandose la mano a la boca al no poder contenerse de lo agradable que era estar viendo eso. -Lo se -estrecho fuertemente su cuello mientras apoyaba sus manos encima de su mujer, le dio un beso por la nuca y se quedo mirando el video que todav√≠a segu√≠a. -Dime Rodney, ¬øcrees que alg√∫n dia tu padre se convertir√° en alguien parecido a Gran Soldador? -No le hace falta. -¬øPorque no? -Pues porque √©l es mi padre, y mi padre siempre ser√° el que es. Abrazo fuertemente a su padre mientras √©l re√≠a de lo entusiasta que era su hijo con su padre. -Hiciste bien Herbert -le echo una mirada de reojo de lo contenta que estaba con √©l. -Lo se -le dio un beso en los labios y ambos continuaron el video. Se quedaron toda la noche viendo la grabaci√≥n sin importar el tiempo que pasara, al ver eso, les dejo bien claro que ambos estaban verdaderamente orgullosos de haber tenido a Rodney y eso era algo que nadie les pod√≠a quitar. Rodney Hojalata era la mejor persona que hab√≠a en el mundo ya que √©l era capaz de cambiar las cosas de la mejor manera posible. A menos que... algo malo sucediese.

I just wanted to thank Foxcat93 soooo much for the review! It means so much. I wish I could just hug you!~ Love you... ^^ ~Harpo Marx~ \"Harpo was exactly what harp means: Angel. You know, there's a church in Brussels, and on top are all little cherubs. And they all look like Harpo Marx.\" -George Jessel \"He was an angel. There was nobody like him, there never will be anybody like him. He was just simply wonderful.\" -Gummo Marx \"Harpo was almost not of this world, he was saintly, ethereal. He was my favourite person.\" -Miriam Marx \"Comedy is gentle and sweet and good and intelligent and honest, and that is what Harpo Marx was. Comedy makes you feel good, and that is what Harpo Marx did. And when I met him, I found out the best thing of all: That the man, the person, was even more beautiful than the image.\" -Alan Sherman My name is Norah, and one day, my day off, I went for a walk in the park and came back home with a person whom God sent just for me. I'm homeschooled, so I spend all day indoors, except for when I have to do gym, and I make my own schedule, meaning I don't necessarily get weekends off. The day I met, \"Him,\" was a Wednesday. I was staring out the window and biting my pencil so hard I could hear the crunch in my head and ringing in my ears. I sat it down and flipped it back and forth impatiently. I was going to go crazy. I couldn't do this for one more minute. The park down the street was usually the place I went when I had to calm my nerves. I got jumpy and restless pretty easily, a trait that doesn't help when you're a homeschooler. Sun was shining through the tress above my head. I never walked with my head up; I always looked at my feet. My mother told me this wasn't a good thing. Said it means I needed more confidence. I didn't tell her I don't quite know what \"confidence\" was. But the whole matter didn't seem important; I let it drop. Obviously, walking without looking where you're going has its consequences. While heading down a winding path I bumped into something warm and purple. I took a step back, startled, and seen the funniest looking person! He was short, very short, with a bent over top hat sitting on a brilliant shock of curly red hair. His hair was so beautifully curly it looked like a bowl of noodle soup. He wore odd clothes- a long, dark purple trench coat covering mismatched attire, such as stripes and polka- dots. And yet, despite the overall strangeness of him, he was gaping at me as if I'm the one who looks crazy. In his hands he held a way over-sized taxi horn which he honked at me and smiled. Probably a few times in your life, something will happen and the very second it does, you know it means something of great significance. Take this moment, for example. As soon as he smiled at me, I knew for sure that God had listened, that he had at long last sent me a friend. I smiled back. Noodle Soup suddenly whirled around and skipped off merrily. I opened my mouth and almost screamed. My savoir was getting away! Deciding not to run after him, I followed him casually, trying to not appear as a stalker or something of the sorts. He stopped in front of someone pushing a cart selling balloons. I leaned against a tree, twirling my hair as I watched my savoir pull out a pair of scissors from his pocket. I blinked as I realized Noodle Soup just pulled out a pair of scissors! Who the heck carries around scissors in their pockets? He then grabbed five balloons before the man selling them coud do a thing and swiftly snipped them. The balloon vendor's face became red and he looked very angry and embarrassed. He yelled, \"What do you think you're doing?\" Before I could stop myself I had taken out some money and held it out to the poor balloon man. He yanked it from me and said, \"Thank you.\" That was the last of my ten dollar allowance , I thought sadly. He pushed the cart away from us, grumbling to himself. My savoir had his head tilted all the way back, holding his top hat in his hands, so I could see the entire, gorgeous head of hair he had. The balloons, three blue, one yellow, and one red, floated way up, all reaching for the cloudless blue sky. I said, equally entranced as him, \"You're welcome.\" Noodle Soup honked his horn and did something I totally didn't expect. He jumped at me and smothered me in a hug. A very quick hug at that; he let me go in only a couple seconds. He gave nice hugs. Not one of those skimpy hugs where the person clearly doesn't want to touch you, but one where they put everything into it. A warm and fuzzy hug. Looking into his blue eyes, I asked, \"What's your name?\" I wasn't sure he would give an answer, since he hadn't spoken a word up to this point. He pointed to himself, indicating, Me? , and I nodded. My savoir shrugged and honked the taxi horn slowly, sadly. This was just what I wanted! I always dreamed of giving my friends names, I just never thought the opportunity would arise. I looked him up and down, trying to not seem judgmental. His hair reminded me of a giant dust bunny, so I told him,\" Your name can be Dusty.\" \"Dusty,\" beamed, proud of his newfound identity. He poked my stomach with the other end of his horn. I said, \"Oh, I'm Norah. Pleased to meet'cha.\" I performed a extravagant curtsy for Dusty. In return, he bowed, nearly tripping over his own feet, and I laughed. Dusty linked arms with me and tried leading me the other way, but I dug my heels into the ground and said, \"Home's this way.\" I expected a fight, because all saviours, even if they are sent from God, are not perfect. But instead, this one simply gave up and followed me right to my house, skipping happily. He was spellbound by practically everything, from the dandylions to the birds to fire hydrants. He honked every now and then, each time causing me to smile wide.[Chapter 2] Because I had been so caught up in the moment, I didn't even think a single thought of what I would do with Dusty. Luckily, I knew Dad was at work and my sister was at school, so that took care of two people. I would have to get Dusty past Mom, who has eyes in the back of her head...My stomach did a flip flop as we walked onto my street. I looked over my shoulder at Dusty, who was following closely behind me, taking in the scenery. I said, \"When we get there, you're gonna have to be quiet, 'kay?\" Dusty perked up. He pretended to lock his lips, throw away the key. I smiled weakly.\"Good.\" Once we were at the front door, and Dusty had ran his fingers all across the front of the house, I heard some loud noises from the backyard. I thought it was Mom, which would work out perfectly. \"Dusty,\" I told him, \"stay right there. Don't move until I get back.\" Dusty saluted me, but on my very first step, he was right behind me again. \"I said stay here.\" I went around the back of my house, and this time Dusty stayed. Mom was sitting on the dirt in her garden, a large white bucket beside her, filled halfway up with weeds, and a trowel in her gloved hands. She gave me the original Where-Have-you-Been-Young-Lady look, which I dreaded. \"Hi, Mom,\" I said nervously. She wiped her hands on her jeans, which were already caked with mud. \"Hello, Norah. What's up? How's school?\" \"How's school,\" is the most-asked Mom question there is. She asks me it constantly. \"I needed a break,\" I said truthfully. I explained to her how I was stuck on a math problem and how I chewed my pencil so hard it could have broken in half. \"Oh,\" she said. She pulled out a couple more of those evil green leaves and dropped them in the pail. \"Go back in and finish it, then, and you can be done today.\" Mom went back to pulling weeds, and I left. To my utter shock, I couldn't find Dusty. Then I heard what sounded like somebody falling and doing a face-plant into the floor. Sure enough, the window to my sister's room was wide open... It would be pointless to go in through the door now , so I crawled through Natalie's window, too, landing on my butt. When I opened my eyes, I seen Dusty sitting in the middle of the floor, the contents of Nat's garbage bin surrounding him. He was holding it upside down and shaking the last bit of mascara-covered cotton balls out. He seemed quite determined. \"Dusty!\" I said, instantly panicking. \"What did you do?\" I scrambled over and started grabbing all the pieces of homework and broken eye shadow applicators and throwing them back where they belonged, and Dusty watched with great curiosity. I sighed in relief as I cleaned the last bit of it up. Dusty honked. Leading him up the stairs to my room, the door opened and Mom asked if I was done school yet. \"All-almost!\" I said, feeling light-headed as I yanked Dusty into my humble abode. I slammed the door behind us and dove to the floor to look under my bed. It was, sadly, too crowded for him to fit. Boxes of key chains, what I collected, were taking up all the possible space. Dusty was looking intently at the spines of the books on my bookshelf. I was going to take one off the shelf and give it to him, but there was no time. Frantically, I jerked open my closet and shoved Dusty in, pressing a finger to my lips before closing it. He banged on it twice and I hissed, \"Shh! Shush!\" I hoped I could trust my savoir, Dusty, to be quiet as I covered up. Mom stood with her hands on her hips, suspicious.\"Finished?\" \"Uh, no.\" \"Well, hurry up.\" \"Okay.\" Stiffly, I went back into my room and closed the door silently. Thank goodness, Dusty was still in the closet. The only problem was he had on my pink sun dress. I couldn't help but smile. \"Nice fit,\" I said, even though he only had half of it on. It sort of suited him, to be honest. Dusty tipped his hat and attempted pulling the dress off, but it was much too small, making me wonder how he had gotten it on in the first place. \"Here,\" I said. I carefully lifted his top hat off his head, my fingers brushing slightly against an amazing lock of hair. This time it was a little easier. When Dusty finally got the stupid thing off, he banged his elbow on the wall. Of course, being myself, I screamed bloody murder, dropping the hat. Dusty visibly jumped. Bending down and picking up his hat after the initial shock, he brushed it off like it was dirty or something. He glared at me and boldly put it back on. That thing was like his only child.[Chapter 3] Once I had Dusty settled, I went straight back to work. Honking the large taxi horn thoughtfully, Dusty continued examining my books. I stood beside him and said,\" You can look at one if you want.\" I didn't know why he hadn't helped himself already. He had to practically everything else. Dusty raised his hand and held his chin, trying to decide. He closed his eyes and randomly picked one. He looked down at it, then handed it to me. It said in bright blue block letters: \" Electronic Media and Industrialized Nations; A Comparative Study .\" The author was Donald R. Browne. I didn't even know I had this book. I gave it back to Dusty, saying, \"Do you want to read it?\" Dusty sat down on the floor. He scootched over and leaned against the wall. I plopped down beside him, my butt still hurting from when I had landed on it earlier in Natalie's room. He fanned his face with the pages, and only then did I realize this book had to be at least five hundred pages long...Dusty fanned it faster and faster, making his hair blow around from the wind and to blink like crazy. Annoyed, I snatched it from him and said, \"Do you wanna read it?\" Dusty frowned, sadly, giving his horn a long honk; a sigh. \"Something else, maybe? What's wrong, Dusty?\" I scratched my head a bit, tangling my dirty blonde hair even more. He took it from me slowly and held the thick book very close to his face, his eyes scanning the words with enormous concentration. It suddenly occurred to me. I fiddled with my socks, trying to figure out how to put it. \"You-you can't read, can you?\" I said quietly. Dusty's eyes filled with tears, but none came out. He brushed imaginary ones away, nodding. \"Oh,\" I said. I can't imagine not being able to read. Reading was everything to me, I read all the time. How would I do work? How would I graduate? How would I do anything ? How could I truly succeed in life? I couldn't even get a job at McDonalds! Dusty continued fanning the book's pages. Patting his arm, I said, \"We could read I-SPY?\" I went over to the shelf and grabbed the huge book, the one I had since I was three, and sat down and opened it, so one side was on Dusty's leg and the other on mine. Dusty's shoulders, which were slouching, suddenly went back to where they were supposed to be, and he chucked, Electronic Media and Industrialized Nations; A Comparative Study, across the room. It banged against my wall loudly. I cringed, praying Mom didn't hear that. Good thing I locked the door, something I regularly did, so at least she wouldn't be suspicious. People say I'm paranoid, but I disagree. I enjoy my privacy is all. Honk honk. \"What?\" Dusty pointed to the elastic band in the picture, and I was shocked. That was the one item I couldn't find on this page! Naturally, I held up my hand for a high five, but I guess Dusty didn't know what a high five was because my only gesture turned into a game of Patty-cake. I started laughing. And laughing. I couldn't quit, and I put my hand in my mouth to stop myself. Dusty was pretending to laugh, no sound was coming out, which was, trust me, a lot funnier than you think it would be. Finally, I calmed myself down, taking a deep breath. Me and Dusty flipped the page and started on the next one. All I could think about was poor Dusty. How he couldn't read. And poor Donald R. Browne, whom we ditched to play I-SPY, as he laid there, face down on my bedroom floor.[Chapter 4] The next few days consisted of me locking myself in my room; eating meals in there, doing school in there, doing almost everything but the bathroom. And what was supposed to be the best time in my life-my savoir had arrived!- was honestly very boring. Well, maybe not boring . Nothing could be boring with Dusty around. But, yet, I hadn't transformed into the beautiful butterfly I thought I would be. Life continued on as always, besides the fact I had a person, a person from God, living in my closet and under my bed. A person who would, when I least expected it, reach over and steal handfuls of food off my plate. I shouldn't complain, though. He had to eat, too. By now I had accepted this lifestyle as the way it was always going to be until I grew up and left home. Got married and had kids. Grew old and died. That would be that. I would go up to heaven, if I were good, and maybe one day I would be sent to Earth to save someone. Doubt it, though. I didn't even want to think of it. Just like Dusty, I must live in the moment. One day Mom came up to me as I was taking lunch up to my room and said,\" Norah .\" I ignored her, biting my cheek because I knew I was in for a classic, \"Talk.\" I kept on going up the stairs until Mom said, \"Norah, come here, please.\" Like I didn't hear her the first time. I would be in a heap of trouble if I continued ignoring her, which made me stop and turn around. She stood for a few seconds, just looking at me and at the cheese and crackers in my hand. I couldn't help but wonder what she was thinking of me that moment. If it was good or bad. \"Norah,\" she said using my name the third time, \"I'm worried about you.\" \"Why?\" I asked, a fever breaking along my neck. Haven't I been careful enough? \"You're becoming a recluse,\" she stated in a motherly tone. \"You spend all day by yourself.\" If only you knew, I thought, smiling on the inside. \"So I want you to get out a bit. You don't even go to the park anymore.\" \"But-but I'm getting a ton of work done,\" I said, rather lamely, although this was the truth. I was an entire week ahead of where I should be, and I felt strangely proud. Mom nodded. Nodded and nodded and nodded. \"Tomorrow I want you to go for a walk, get some fresh air. Mmkay?\" I didn't realize until then, but I was digging my nails into my palm. I let up and said, \"Alright.\" For the remainder of the day, I stuck like glue to Dusty. I let him eat over half the cheese and crackers and let him play with my collection of erasers. Dusty honked at me, just as I finished question #18 in math. \"Yes?\" I asked, not looking up from my paper. He held up a smallish green eraser, the one I had last year in grade three. It was stupid, but a single eraser could bring back a flood of memories. \"I had that last year, \" I told him. \"It's one of my favourites.\" Dusty held it up in the light and whistled. I thought about it, then said,\" You can keep it if you want. Like a good luck charm or whatever.\" Dusty kissed it, then put it in his pocket. \"Do you have anything interesting in there?\" I asked, remembering the scissors he used to snip the balloons off the vendor's cart, freeing them to the sky. Vigorously shaking his head yes, Dusty stuck his hand in his trench coat pocket. I was anxious to see what he would pull out this time. I started rocking back and forth in my chair. Triumphant, Dusty showed me a...white piece of wood. Looking closer, it was actually a piece of a baseboard. I wasn't too surprised. His pockets were bottomless, just another reason I knew god sent him. I turned back to #19, trying not to laugh. That night, when Dusty, who slept on a big pile of pillows and three blankets on the floor right beside my bed, was asleep, I had a good cry. I don't feel like life is getting any better. I was doomed to misery. I simply felt like me , and I couldn't stand me. But mostly I cried because Mom was right- I was becoming a recluse. I did need to get out there more, but what would I do with Dusty? Gosh, I wish I had thought these things out. Not five minutes after I gave myself a stern talking to, did Dusty honk, followed by a sigh. I wiped my eyes and sniffed. Hooonk. It scared me so much I pictured my eyes bugging out the way they did when something scared me, according to Natalie. \"Shh! I mean...\" My voice sounded like I had a cold. \"It's nothing, Dusty. I'm okay.\" In the darkness, Dusty reached up and took my hand in his and squeezed it, not like he didn't want to, but not with the forcefulness Mom used when we were shopping and I acted up. Most people have familiarity with this. Parents grab your hand and grip you with ferocity , giving you a silent warning to stop whatever the heck you're doing that's considered disgraceful in public. There's some things you never forget, even if the action were as trivial as holding someone's hand. With just me, Dusty, and the pale moonlight creeping into my room, something was telling me things were going to be fine the way they are.[Chapter 5] My friend Daisy is turning 92 today! January 13 th , 1918 I decided to get out, like mom told me. Something as normal and every-dayish could work wonders, I thought. All morning was spent pacing, wondering what to do. Bring Dusty or leave him? If I brought him, how would I get him out of the house without anyone seeing? I had done such a good job of keeping him a secret, but it won't last much longer. Part of me was always braced for his discovery. One time Mom would wonder why my plate was empty frequently, without a scrap left. Forgetting to lock the door, Natalie would waltz right in without knocking, not caring that I never enter her room without knocking. Most of all, I was scared Dusty would do something embarrassing or get us in trouble. But I realized I would be being selfish, locking Dusty up all day. He needed some fresh air as much as me. That's how I ended up leaping out of my bedroom window and coming this close to sure death and perhaps a broken limb. I'm more than grateful Dusty was there to break my fall. Then again, I could have walked out the front door as a normal person, and not have to jump out a window like an insane one, if Dusty had stayed behind. After that I pinched my arm for thinking such things. Dusty didn't walk with me, he walked behind me. I didn't really have much of a problem with that. So long as he was with me, I felt alright. We went all over. Around the block, once stopping to throw pinecones at a tree, accidentally almost hitting an old lady. We went through the park, the red-faced balloon vendor running off as soon as he got a look at Dusty and I. We stopped for ice cream cones, but it was too late when I found out I had no money; Dusty's toppled to the ground. I imagined the ants down there, those poor, hard-working ants who never did anything to anybody, swimming in a vanilla ocean. We had to run for our lives, and, luckily, we lost the guy in an alley. Then we went down the street, window shopping, in all the crowds of people. Dusty stopped at one, but I kept going. He honked and stamped his foot. I came back to him and looked through the window at what he was looking at. It was a harp. \"Wow,\" I said, sincerely. Dusty, though, was gawking at it as if it were the most beautiful thing in the history of the world. He pressed his face flat against the window and I had to pull him away. Honk honk . \"It's nice,\" I told him, \"but what about it? Harps-\" Before I was done, Dusty had swung open the door, honking three times, and rushed inside. I was right behind him, as he was usually right behind me. The woman at the counter looked up with a puzzled expression, her eyes focused on Dusty, then on me. \"Hello,\" she said. Her blonde hair was tied back in a loose braid. She had pale blue eyes and a nice smile. A guitar sat on a desk beside her. She had a cloth in her hand, and I assumed she's polishing it. Dusty took one look at her, and instantly struck fear into the woman's heart. I could tell because she dropped the cloth and screeched, throwing her hands over her face. I started sweating all down my back and to my knees. I stood there and stupidly watched as Dusty honked and chased her madly all over the room, knocking over anything in his way, which was, I'm still thankful for, not much. Still screaming in absolute terror, the blonde dashed through a door in the back and I seen a glimpse of tall piles of boxes and a very shiny red piano before the door was almost slammed off its hinges form panic. Dusty stood in front of it for a few minutes, though it felt like much longer. It was almost like he could burn a hole through the wood with his eyes. And, for a split second, I believed it. I'd never seen such eyes as Dusty's, so full of determination, and..something cloudy. When he turned back to me, he was smiling, forgetting anything had happened. I tried to smile-but failed. He laced his fingers together, held them out in front of him and loudly cracked them. Looked at the harp, then me. \"I don't know, Dusty. It's big and you might break it or something.\" Dusty waved his hand, like he was telling me to go away; I didn't know anything. I humphed . I crossed my arms and sat on the floor, since there was nowhere else. I tapped my foot impatiently. \"Dustyyyyy...\" I knew how annoying my whining was, but I didn't want to get more embarrassed than I already was. If that poor lady came out and seen Dusty... Shushing me, Dusty closed his eyes, then opened them quickly, as if he were all alone and I wasn't even there. He took off his top hat and fiddled with it awhile, like he was deciding what to do with it. The clouds in his blue eyes cleared and he was back to his old self, like he was now in his comfort zone. The hat ended up being sat scrupulously on the harp, and there it rested. It was so puzzling, the way it fit. Dusty's hat was made to be a part of this harp. His face softened as he positioned the harp between his knees and rested the end on his shoulder. I held my breath, going as far as blowing my cheeks out, my mouth so full of air. What came next was unlike anything I had ever heard. I forced myself to stand up because there was turning inside of me and I felt like I needed to stand and hold onto something to make it stop. And his face! It was the first-and only?- time he was even remotely serious. Something electric slid down my spine, seeing Dusty be serious and not smiling. Maybe it wasn't seriousness now that I think back on it- it was more peacefulness. A break from the mayhem. He threw a very quick glance at me, then I looked away because I was worried I was throwing Dusty off. He played a little while longer, and it wasn't till I heard a sob beside me, something wet on my cheek, and a tissue in my face did I realize the blonde woman had come back out. She was standing beside me, crying. I must have been, too, because she offered me the Kleenex, and, waving it at me, said, \"Beautiful.\" I took it and wiped my cheeks. Dusty, once he was done, planted his top hat where it belonged, grabbed his horn which was propped up against the wall and honked it three times, happier than I'd ever seen him. Tipping his hat at the lady he previously scared half to death like the gentleman he most certainly was, we left for home. Dusty was playing that harp like it were as easy as anything. I pictured golden honey dripping off the strings, it was so amazing. Sometimes things of enormity dawn on you long after they should have.[Chapter 6] I made a Cajun hamburger casserole for Social Studies today! It was good, but I burnt the rice a bit. And thank you LadyMallard a lot for the reviews!~ God bless you for reading. \"Dusty?\" I asked one day, as we sat on the grass in my backyard. The sky was a big mix of white, pink, and orange. Honk , he honked in reply. I looked over at him. \"I'm hungry.\" He made an 'O' shape with his mouth, went into his bottomless pocket, and pulled out a Hershey's cookies and cream chocolate bar. He handed it to me, and I took it gingerly. \"Thanks,\" I said as I watched him pull out a big red apple. I blinked, much as I did when he yanked out the scissors. My stomach did a summersault. I was still getting used to the fact God sent him and that's the only reason he was so weird and had everything imaginable always with him. I unwrapped my chocolate bar and munched away, and Dusty took huge bites out of his apple, crunching loudly. He laid down on his back, facing the brindled sky, sighing. Grinning, I gasped and pointed at him. I had finally done it, after all this time, and I wasn't' even trying! Dusty reached above his head to grab his horn. Honk ? \"You know what,\" I said smugly. He honked once more. \"Don't try that!\" I laughed. I uncrossed my legs and laid beside him on the soft, warm grass. I placed my arms behind my head like pillow. \"That's the closet you've ever-\" Honk honk. \"-Come to actually talking. Actually saying something.\" I chewed and swallowed the last piece of my chocolate bar, savouring it. It somehow tasted better, knowing Dusty gave it to me. I then turned over and sat my chin in my hand, so now I was directly facing him. \"Well, what do you have to say for yourself?\" I asked, cricking my nose. Dusty turned over on his side like me, held his head up as I did. He opened his mouth and began forming a word, and my heart was in my throat, hardly containing my excitement... ...And he took a deep breath and blew it in my face, my hair flying back, my eyes automatically closing. I rolled back over and broke into a hysterical fit of laughter, all while Dusty honked numerous times, then threw the apple core over the fence into my neighbour's yard. I didn't care. I didn't like them, really. They made me put the sprinkler I would run through in the summer away because it petrified their stupid Pomeranian. A fuzzy ball of evil was all she was. I laughed until it hurt to breathe. I started choking and Dusty patted my back until I recovered. \"Dusty?\" I said now that we were both sitting upright again. He honked in question. \"Have you ever been in love?\" Dusty playfully shoved me , not really trying to hurt me, and I came back over and shoved him, too. With a flourish he fell to the ground, clutching his heart. One leg twitching a bit, he died. Trying to appear serious, I sat on his stomach and said,\" Oh no...Dusty's dead now, so I guess I can do this.\" I took his beloved top hat and firmly adjusted it on my head. Then-miracle of miracles!- Dusty came back to life and snatched it right off of me. In one swift motion, he had me in the air and on his shoulders. I yelped because he had never done such a thing. What if he drops me? I frantically threw my arms around him as he marched me around the yard then safely put me back to Earth. I had that stir of when you spin around in circles and aren't able to walk in a straight line afterwards. Like you've gotten up much too fast. \"As I was getting to,\" I repeated dizzily, \"have you ever been in love?\" Dusty was blushing. I poked him.\"Have you?\" The sun was showing no mercy and I was practically dying from the heat. I didn't know how Dusty seemed fine in that heavy, purple coat. Dusty blushed harder, but stuck his hands in both his pockets, and, out of the left one, drew a picture. He had the back of it facing me so I couldn't see. I tried grabbing it, but he held it way up in the air so I couldn't reach it. \"Let me look!\" I said. Dusty shook his head, admiring what I guessed was his love. When he seen my pleading eyes he finally gave it to me. \"A-a horse?\" I asked in disbelief.\"You're in love with a horse?\" Blushing madly, Dusty seriously nodded. He stole it back from me and gave it a big, sloppy kiss. He looked at it with round, love-filled eyes a little longer, then returned it to the deep depths of his pocket. \"A horse,\" I said again, my hands on my hips. \"My, oh my..\" Honk honk . \"I once fed a horse an apple and it almost bit me, but I moved my hand before it could. My Dad said, 'You better be careful, Norah, it's gonna eat you,' except I didn't believe him. Should I?\" I asked Dusty, thinking perhaps he knew a lot more about this than I did. Dusty crossed his eyes. He shrugged his shoulders. He honked. \" Would it ?\" He shrugged another time and spun around in circles before plummeting straight down to his knees, then onto his heels, then onto his face. I stared down at him and blinked. \"Dusty?\" I said, unsurely. He wasn't moving, so I just toppled down beside him and we stayed like that awhile, musing over the subject of horses and love.[Chapter 7] For the last two days, I think I had been catching the flu. I felt dizzy all the time and had a stomach ache like when I ate too much ice cream at Christmas that one time, and to top it all off I had a small headache when I laid down. Mom told me I was being dramatic again. She said I'm a hypochondriac, but I really don't know what that means. It sounded like a clothing line, but that's sort of dumb on my part. It was a Saturday. I look back now and believe that day had the feeling more of a Sunday. But that couldn't be. Mom and Dad had to go to work, even though they had started early every day of the week. I decided I would bake them some cookies, since they had been working so hard. Dusty could help, if only he would get his butt out of bed when he was supposed to. I felt fine and well-rested, thinking I was miraculously cured, until I sat up in bed. A sharp pain erupted in my head and it straightaway began aching. I started sweating ice-cold buckets of water, and, with creaking bones, I got out of bed and stumbled over Dusty, trying hard not to wake him up, to the door. I fell right into it and was shaking so badly I couldn't even wrap my fingers around the doorknob.\"D-dusty?\"I asked, leaning against my bookcase. I could barely stand. My legs were like blades of grass, desperately endeavouring to hold all 73 pounds of me.\"Dusty?\" I said again, louder. Honk. He was awake now, curiously looking up at me from his bed on the floor. He fiddled with the corner of one of the three yellow, pink, and white blankets. \"Dusty, \" I said, my head aching so I didn't know what else to actually say. I couldn't think. In seconds he was up and beside me, without shoes, just argyle socks, without his coat, just a polka dot shirt. He gently shook my shoulder. I looked at him with watery eyes. I shook all over and yet I was burning hot. I gasped, \" I'm not feeling so good. \" Dusty tssked and rested his hand on my forehead. I knew I had a fever. He took it off and wiped it on his pants. He then scooped me up right into his arms. I didn't struggle or try to get loose; I was so tired. He carried me to the kitchen and sat me on the counter very mindfully. I felt heavy. And I couldn't help myself; I cried. Not like the sobbing I had done earlier, just the kind where tears spill out beyond your control and it's impossible to turn off the stupid faucet. Dusty threw open and the drawers and cupboards noisily, and then looked to me for help. Because he and I virtually share the same mind (we were soul mates) I knew exactly what he wanted. I pointed to a cupboard beside the window. \"There,\" I said in a scratchy voice. I sounded unfamiliar to myself; I didn't sound like I thought I regularly did. People never do , though. Someone told me our own voices sound different to everyone, but that dosent seem possible if you ask me. He nodded fiercely, opened it recklessly, then came back over to me with a thermometer. But not the one I truly thought it was. Dusty stuck a meat thermometer in my mouth, the one Mom sticks in the chicken to make sure it's eatable. He put his other hand behind my head and with his free hand tapped the front to make sure it worked properly; it didn't. \"No!\" I slapped it away, out of my mouth. Dusty shrugged, about to turn to grab some other crazy thing to stick in my mouth when a call of, \"Norah!\" could be heard from downstairs. Fudge. I am stupid. I am the stupidest girl on the Earth. And I think I deserve a savoir such as Dusty, the most brilliant person around. I am so, so stupid. Dusty honked at Natalie, then came over and stood beside me, telling Nat in his own way I belonged with him , not her . Natalie's face was the palest I had ever seen it. I contemplated she was going to faint. But, hey, I thought I was going to faint. Luckily, neither of us had so far. She stumbled forward and held her hands out in front of her. Like she was in a dark room, not a room flooded with early morning sunlight. Instead of asking the dreadfully obvious question, she said in a strange, whispery voice, \"Why are you crying?\" Her black hair was put up in a messy ponytail and she wore her fuzzy blue pyjamas. I stared over the top of her head at the wall as I felt the hot tears continue tumbling down my cheeks, off my nose, onto my folded arms. The kitchen was spinning. I had the oddest sensation, like falling. Natalie screamed,\" Why are you crying ?\" She said this so loud I felt Dusty jump in surprise beside me. \"Why are you crying?\" Natalie was asking this for only one reason I could fathom, which was for the reason that she wanted to act like Dusty wasn't there. That's how scared she was. She had to pretend my savoir wasn't even there ; she pretended she couldn't even see him... I jumped off the counter with more strength than I knew I had, especially in my current nearly dying condition. How dare she! \"I'm-I'm not crying.\" Natalie's green eyes were wild with fear. Her whole body was visibly trembling. I felt bad for her, rather than angry. I found it so simple to slip off into a place in my mind where I was mean, where I turned against my own sister. Dusty may have been an angel, but this was my flesh and blood, my blister of a sister. So I took Dusty's sleeve and he shuffled over to Nat with me. My hands were slick with my tears and sweat and I laced them together and held them out in front of me. \"This is Dusty,\" I said very quietly, afraid of her reaction. Dusty honked his over-sized taxi horn and smiled his charming smile. He waved. When Natalie just stared, he scratched his curly hair, glanced at me, shrugged. Then he turned around, took a deep breath in preparation for I didn't know what, and did a cartwheel. Well, half a cartwheel. It is a kitchen, after all; a smallish kitchen at that. He only was halfway through it when he collided with the wall- that put an end to that. Natalie screamed, \" Norah !\" and pointed to the dent in the wall. \"What about it? It's not that big .\" The aching in my head returned and I think to this day still, I literally stepped out of my skin and let someone crazier than Dusty obtain control over me. I took advantage of Nat's moment of weakness and grabbed both her arms and marched her to the closet in the hallway across from my room. It was Mom's \"Cleaning closet,\" meaning it contained stuff like paper towel, Mr. Clean, Vim, toothpaste, even, for when we used ours up. Natalie was too shocked about Dusty so she couldn't really help herself when I locked her in with the help of a broom Dusty handed me. Nat started yelling and pounding her fists on the door. \"Norah! Norah, please , look at yourself, look at you!\" Look at yourself. Yuck. I probably looked like a horrid mess of over worn P.J's and a nest of uncombed legs buckled and I fell to the floor. I sat with my back against the wall and pondered as I heard Dusty in the kitchen, opening the fridge, breaking out the pickle jar, chomping away. I was going to throw up, I knew it. I ran to the sink, barging past Dusty, and turned myself inside out. Puking was something nobody particularly enjoyed doing, but I somehow felt relieved when it all came out. For two reasons: I knew I wasn't a hypo-whatever; I wasn't dramatic, and secondly , I must have lost a pound. Dusty put the pickles back. He came over to me and shook me gently, to make sure all of it was out of me. I talked to Dusty then, differently than I ever had. \"I've done something awful,\" I told him, my voice only above a whisper. In the background we could hear Natalie trying to get out of the, \"Cleaning closet.\" I'll bet it smelled in there, smelled like Windex and strong cleaning products. Shivers chased each other up and down my spine. I said,\" We have to leave.\" And I was running around, stuffing cookies in my pocket, giving oranges and cheese strings and crackers to Dusty, and he put them in his pockets. And we went out the door after Dusty had put on his shoes and his trusty purple coat, slammed it (and forgot to lock it!) and in less than a minute, we were off.[Chapter 8] At first I just walked as fast as I could without running. Down the trying street, away from my locked-up sister. I was walking as fast as I could, trying to run-unsuccessfully. I knew I could go faster. Like when you're in water and you're to get somewhere in it, but to heck with how hard you try, you can't go faster. You know you can, but your body won't listen and you simply can't . My legs finally gave and I crumpled to the side of the road. A winding, long road with nobody on it. No people, no cars. Just us and a grassy field on either side of us. Dusty was soon with me. He tapped my shoulder, then gestured to what I was wearing. I looked down and nearly sobbed. I had my pink pyjamas on, the ones with little ice cream cones scattered on the pants. Natalie had blue ones. They were a present from our Aunt Betty for Christmas. I ran my fingers through my knotted hair, fighting with myself not to yank any out. Admiring our surroundings, I came to realize I didn't know where we were. But I wasn't in a predominantly caring mood; I felt sick again.(Not that it had ever really gone away.) I said, \"Can I eat something?\" Dusty wasn't listening. Instead he was staring at me. I tried to stare back, but it felt too awkward; I looked away. Spread my legs out in front of me and studied my shoes. My cheeks felt hot and I couldn't tell if it were because I was ill, or embarrassed. Probably either or. I didn't like Dusty seeing me in a mess like this. I could tell Dusty was smiling. I snapped,\" I haven't eaten yet, I'm starving.\" Then I remembered I had Oreos in my smallish pocket, so I yanked one out with such force it broke in half. Tears immediately filled my eyes and I shrieked, \" Fudge !\" I chucked one half of the stupid thing as far as I could. We watched the Oreo land softly on the grass on the other side of the road. Honk honk . I said to Dusty,\" Gosh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I got mad over a cookie.\" I raised my hand to my face and felt my forehead. I still had a fever, hot to the touch and it wasn't helping that the sun shone brightly. Most people would think that living in a naturally sunny area is nice, but I would tell them it most certainly is not, especially when you're dying. Holding the Oreo to my mouth, I said,\" Well, shouldn't be a total loss.\" I popped it in, chewed, swallowed thickly. The simple action of eating hurt my throat so much it made me change my mind. I didn't need food. Not now, anyway. Apparently Dusty did. He had a pile of crackers on his legs and was occupied peeling away an orange. I watched in fascination as he set each piece meticulously on each cracker until he had a whole meal consisting of-not cheese and crackers- oranges and crackers, placed one by one down his legs. He held one out to me. I said, \"No thank you, I'm not hungry.\" He honked in agitation, telling me in the style only Dusty could that I was just complaining about starving a minute ago. In the end, he left the matter by itself and ate every single one of his crackers and oranges. I had my knees drawn up to my chest and placed my chin on top of them .I confessed to Dusty, \" I don't know where we are.\" The sky was grey and blackish, all of a sudden, and the sun was being blocked out. It was a relief, really. But not enough of a relief to make me feel less sick. I picked off a little fuzz ball from my pyjamas and sat it in the grass between me and Dusty. It didn't stay long, though; the wind blew it away. I couldn't see where it went since it was so small. That one thing- that piece of fuzz that came off from my jamies- made my mind swirl. All my life I felt trapped, stuck in my own diminutive world with my books and math and frequent walks in the park. That was it. That was my entire life, right there. And then Dusty, my savoir from God comes along, and look where I end up. I should have hated him, loathed him for what he's done. Hated that he took me away from my perfect life and taught me the importance of not caring at all what people thought of you. I should have, so why didn't I? \"Oh, Dusty,\" I mumbled, holding my head. It hurt so much.\"Dusty?\" He honked twice. Thinking of Natalie, thinking of what poor Mom and Dad would say when they came home from a long day's work and found her locked in the, \"Cleaning closet,\" I said, just above a whisper,\" I made a mistake.\" I ran my hands over the grass, taking notice how it didn't shine like it did when the sun wasn't hiding behind clouds. I said it again, louder , in case Dusty wasn't listening. \"I made a mistake.\" Dusty didn't honk, didn't touch me, didn't do anything. He merely gave me a face, as if to say, Everyone makes mistakes .[Chapter 9] The sky grew so dark it looked like someone took a paintbrush and stroked black and grey paint all around me and Dusty. We walked down the road and a car drove by, the first one yet. It was small and yellow, a punch buggie. The sound of it driving by amazed me. How one car, it seemed, could disturb the silence of the whole world. I half-heartedly punched Dusty's arm. \"No returns.\" There's some things in life that cannot be ignored, despite the circumstances, and this is one of them. Dusty honked and shook his head. He could not believe he missed that one. The fields were endless, the road was endless. I started babbling to Dusty about a dream I had last night. \"Me and you were eating Corn Pops in my bathroom. You were on the floor and I was sitting on the side of the tub, except it was green...\" I was interrupted as Dusty bent over, lifted me onto his shoulders, and continued marching onward. I was glad. My legs were hurting almost as bad as my head. My head was probably why I was in such a talkative mood. My chin atop of Dusty's frizzy afro, I went on, \"It was green, and then it was actually Jell-o . So I took a piece off and ate it, and then it broke. I fell through the floor...\" Dusty tightened his grip on my legs as if I really were about to fall-\" and fell into a big orange box . That was Jell-O, too. And you were there, all of a sudden, eating it apart. I said,' Don't, the hippos are coming.' And you kept right on stuffing your face.\" Dusty dragged his teeth back and forth across his bottom lip, seriously considering himself doing such a thing. Such a thing as eating an orange Jell-O box. Now that I knew he was listening, I rattled on, \"Suddenly we were at Wal-Mart , and you were buying a Jell-O pudding . And I was playing with a Jell-O hippo. But not eating it.\" Honk . \"Yeah.\" I twisted my finger around in a lock of his noodle soup hair. A white car drove by, a second, this time facing us. The man driving didn't even look our way. We went on in silence awhile. I tried not to think of how hopelessly lost and alone we were. There wasn't a soul that could that could help us. I felt painfully alive, still, because this is for sure the most exciting thing that's ever happened in my entire nine years of living. Dusty must have felt the same way or close to it. He was skipping, and I was just bouncing along. I felt a raindrop plop on my arm. I stared at it, then wiped it off as I dared to let go of Dusty. I told him,\" It's raining.\" Suddenly, as if I were being punished for mentioning this out loud, it began pouring. I kicked Dusty's side, maybe a little harder than planned, saying, \"Can I get down?\" and he sat me back on the wet gravel. It was raining so hard. The kind of rain when you were soaked through and through in the span of measly seconds . My uncle was a mailman, though, and he says whether rain or shine, he gets out there and does his duty for humanity. Dusty and I may not be doing humanity any favours, but a little rain won't stop us. God sent Dusty, so a downpour shouldn't hurt him. Or me. We had probably been gone three hours, give or take. And way in the distance- way , way in the distance-I could see lights. I smiled, pointed, my body shaking uncontrollably from the coldness.\"Look,\" I said. Honk honk . Dusty appeared happy as could be, and I watched his hair, how it didn't frizz out more like I expected, but flattened out a little. It fell down so it looked more like girl's hair than his regular afro. I smiled more, and I guess I smiled so wide it made me sneeze. Dusty stopped, bent down in front of me and stared hard at me awhile. I again had the unpleasant feeling of him seeing me sick like this. I looked down at the ground, at raindrops filling up small depressions in the road, forming puddles. I sneezed again, breaking the thick air between us with a shatter. Dusty, quick as ever, produced a dainty white handkerchief. He took my clammy hand and sat it in my palm, then closed my fingers around it as I sneezed. He did his.. .pantomime , I suppose you could call it, laugh, and stood back up and kept walking on. I opened my hand and took the handkerchief and blew my nose. As I was about to catch up to Dusty, give him it back, I noticed there was a purple N embroidered in the fabric. N for Norah. \"Dusty!\" Honk ? He turned to me. I held it up and waved it around. \"For me?\" I asked. The only reply I received was a nod and the continuous thud of the rain. \"Thank you, it's nice.\" Side-by-side once more, Dusty and I drew closer to whatever possessed the light in front of us. I said more to myself than anyone,\" I wonder if we could get some Jell-O there.\" Dusty mouthed the word Jell-O three times, then raised his head, leaning so far backwards he almost fell. Rain streamed down his face, and I wondered if he was searching for some divine guidance above from the god of Jell-O, praying that he and I could eat some.[Chapter 10] The town was small and sleepy; a bump in the road. The instant I saw it's name on a wooden sign painted green, Blueberry, Freedonia; Population: 935 , I knew I had been there before. Shaking Dusty's arm I partly lied, party told the truth, \" I can tell I've been here before.\" Dusty nodded. The place was so sleepy, though. We walked past only a few people. One man with a fedora tipped his hat and Dusty excitedly returned the gesture, probably not used to seeing such an old-fashioned thing. When I seen a street sign, Cherry, every instinct I had was screaming at me to go that way. I just didn't know why . I stopped dead in my tracks and took a good look around. I knew for sure I've been here; I racked my tired brain trying to remember. I finally said, \"Come on.\" I started off that way, but Dusty grabbed my wrist and pulled me back. I dug my heels into the pavement and said,\" What are you doing?\" This moment reminded me of when I first found Dusty and he tried dragging me in the opposite direction, but gave up. Not this time. He was determined, as usual. \"Dusty,\" I hissed as he yanked me forward, causing me to nearly fall flat on my face. \" Dusty , people are watching you.\" Both he and I stood still and noticed there were, in fact, nobody in sight. Fudge . I was getting so mad, anger was crushing my lungs and it felt hard to breathe. \"I know where we're going!\" I shouted. Dusty wasn't getting mad back at me, which annoyed me even more, and he darn well knew it. I felt the handkerchief he had given me was still in my numb hand, so I took a few steps ahead, to a person's front yard. There was a small built-in pond, with a small red bridge over top of it that seemed like it could snap at any moment. I tossed it in there and glared at Dusty, daring him to outdo that . He took out the green eraser I had given him awhile back and bent over, dropping it in a sewer grate. Against my better, sophisticated judgement, I stamped my foot.\"Fine, then! I don't need you.\" I walked to the other side of the street, Cherry . \"You find your own way from now on, Dusty!\" I didn't want to be on the same planet as him, let alone the same side of the road. I stomped off until I came to a yellow house, 1304, that had a garden surrounding the white steps leading up to the red door. I knew exactly where I was then, for that house was the only house besides my own I would recognize absolutely anywhere. It was Grandma's. A flood of relief rushed through me and I spun around, expecting to see Dusty, but he wasn't there. I instantly felt emptiness, getting rid of that calmed feeling. I desperately needed something to hold. I was fumbling with my hands, like they had a mind of their own. Having nothing to lose, because Dusty was gone, I knocked on Grandma's door, sort of hoping she would answer so I could talk to her after four years, and sort of hoping she wouldn't answer in case Dusty came back.[Chapter 11] This is dedicated to my real Grandma, my dear Grandma Butt. (Yes, you read that right. Don't laugh at her.) Although she is not this old and hates cooking, she does adore the colour purple and has a room in her house dubbed, The Purple Room. Every time her grandkids visit, we go on a shopping trip and get to pick five things from the legendary room. Then Grandma goes out and buys more purple random objects to fill the room for the kid`s next visit. It`s a family tradition. Love you Grandma! ^^ The door opened barely after I pulled my hand away, and it startled me. Grandma Tataryn stood there, just as I remembered her, only her face was more crinkly. She wasn't smiling-it was quite the opposite, in fact. I found my voice. \"Hi, Grandma.\" Her frown was gone, as soon as it appeared, replaced with a cute old lady smile. You know the one. \"Norah, darling, come in!\" I came in. Her house was small, but neat and tidy. Not a thing was out of place. The walls were painted a soft purple, her favourite color. It smelled like cookies. I'm not trying to make my Grandma sound stereotypical, but it's true. She baked all the time. She walked slowly. Very. Slowly. I shuffled along to the living room behind, literally not being able to lift my feet. Grandma's slowness was making me dizzy. She set herself down in a rocking chair, and I sat in a smaller version, across from her. It couldn't have been more awkward . The clock ticked so loudly I wanted to rip it out of the wall. The pictures hanging and placed on the mantle were staring at me hard; it felt like they were living, breathing people. Grandma's and I's rocking chairs creaked, and as I looked at her, she appeared fine, as if this something that happened to her daily. She ran her fingers through her white hair, which reminded me of a cotton ball. Almost like Dusty's, just less curly. \"So,\" Grandma said. \"How are things, Norah?\" How are things ? \"Um, things are good. How are things with you?\" I folded my hands in my lap; polite. Grandma licked her lips, deep in thought, like this was a deathly serious question. She didn't answer for a few moments, then said, \"Well, things are very...nice.\" \"That's good.\" I wondered if she was going to ask where the rest of my family was, and she did, right on cue. \"So where's your sister? Where's your-\" \"I got here by myself,\" I interrupted, feeling guilty deep down. Grandma wrinkled up her forehead, even more so.\"How?\" Fudge . \"Uh, I-I walked,\" I said, praying with my fingers crossed she would believe it. Then she just nodded. Maybe she didn't realize it was one, almost two hours away. I barely realized it. Grandma scrunched up her nose and stared at me. \"You're sick.\" I wiped my nose with the back of my hand, bringing to mind how runny it was. \"Actually-\" Before I knew it, she was leading me with her hands on my shoulders down a purple hallway and into the room I would stay in the odd time we visited her. I sat on the squeaky bed and she sat beside me, putting her arm around me. Wow, and she was stronger than I thought. This was the only room in the house that wasn't purple- it was green. And I mean everything was green. Green walls, green carpet, green curtains, green lamp shades, green picture frames, green blankets, sheets and pillows. Grandma closed her eyes, mulling over something unknown to me, then said, \" What's the trouble, dear?\" I felt like I was dying , but I said,\" I don't know.\" \"Boy trouble?\" Holy heck . I wanted to snap at her and say, What , Grandma, I'm nine years old! , but I held it in. I sighed. \"Maybe. I'm just...so cold.\" \"Yes, yes, yes, \" she muttered. \"It rained, yes...\" She stood up, slowly , I might add. \"I'll get you some cookies, I think I have some from this morning...\" Grandma wandered off, into the purpleness. My shoes were caked with mud and I kicked them off. I sprawled out on the bed. My mind was numb. I tried not to think of you-know-who , but it was impossible not to. So I had Grandma, I had cookies, I had a place to get out of the cold, wet, dark world. But I had no Dusty. It all seemed so pointless without him. I would have given anything to be back out on that lonely road in the drenching rain, sneezing my head off, as long as I was with Dusty.[Chapter 12] My little cousin Chaucer is turning nine today! ^^ Same as Norah! I laid there in my own self-pity and sorrow for I don't know how long. Grandma waltzed in with a large plate of cookies. \"Chocolate chip,\" she grinned, handing me one. I sat up and ate it in three bites. I asked for another. Grandma gave me four others. I ate them way faster than I should have, too. Grandma just shook her head, but I was so hungry I didn't care. After my seventh, she said, \"Norah, honey, why-\" she struggled for the right words.\"Why are you in pyjamas?\" \"Well...\" I hadn't improved my mood at all since I was no longer hungry, unfortunately. \"See, Grandma, it's a long story.\" \"Oh, no, no. I'll have none of that.\" \"It's because I just am ; because I...forgot to change.\" \"How could you?\" \"Barely got any sleep.\" \"Well, so?\" she said. \"So I wasn't thinking straight,\" I said. \"Oh,\" she said, concluding that conversation. Grandma paced the room. Her fuzzy yellow slippers slid along the floor. She was so slow, I again felt dizzy and had to divert my attention to a picture of an orange, fat cat that used to live here. He reminded me of Garfield. \"That's too bad,\" Grandma commented suddenly, not noticing I had moved on. \"Mmhm.\" I had another cookie, realizing there was no milk. How could that be? \"I guess you have no milk, do you, Grandma?\" \"Oh my you're demanding,\" she said, and I couldn't tell if she was serious or not. She sounded like she meant it, but she was wearing a smile. \"Really, though, can I?\" I asked. I was getting that milk one way or another. Grandma let out a huge sigh, giving in.\"You know where it is.\" I plopped off on my quest for milk. I went into the kitchen and looked out the window, behind purple polka-dot curtains. My heart sank, thinking of polka-dots. They made me think of Dusty. I climbed up on a chair and grabbed a glass, blah, blah, blah, drank the stupid milk. It was 2%. I usually had 1%. I came back to the green room and grandma was gone. \"Grandma!\" I called. \"On the phone!\" she called back. Step by step I dragged myself into the green bed and pulled the covers all the way up, over my head. It's scent was that of dustiness and Sunlight Detergent. I closed my eyes against the nauseating jade colour. Some time went by before Grandma was standing in the doorway. She talked with who I guessed was my mother. I think she must have thought I was sleeping, with me being a silent lump under a blanket. I heard bits of the conversation. Words such as, \"Walked, Natalie, cartwheels (my Dusty),cookies, ill, pajamas,\" and ,\"hour,\" stood out. Grandma popped her head in. I had been peeking out from under a corner of the blanket, straining to hear better. She patted me and said, \"For you, dear.\" I unravelled the blankets, which were becoming heavy, and carefully took the phone form Grandma. \"Hello?\" I said. \"Norah, \" Mom said. \"Where are you?\" She was so angry she didn't even sound angry, and that's when it's the worst. \"At Grandma's, \" I said, but I knew she knew it. I twisted my finger in my hair. \"What are you doing there? And what is this; Nat was telling me about you doing a cartwheel in the kitchen?\" I was practically twisting it right out of my head.\" I was sick, I wasn't thinking.\" That seemed to be my excuse for everything I screwed up lately. \"You were sick? You are sick. Listen to you.\" \"I might have something, I don't know.\" My eyes filled up. Mom went on, \"I've been looking all day for you, we were so worried. And Natalie's fainted. Did you know that? She's never fainted in her life before.\" I was about to say that's not true, she fainted one time at the water park when I was two, but what came out surprised me. \"And she was hallucinating.\" Mom said nothing, but I could picture her nodding. Poor Natalie. She was telling the truth and I was making my sister out to be crazy. How did I get so mean? Mom continued, telling me she'd come pick me up tomorrow. I wanted to tell everyone that, No, I must wait for Dusty, get him to forgive me , but they wouldn't know what I meant, so I just said, \"Okay.\" I buried my face into the fluffy lime green pillow. \"Okay.\"[Chapter 13] I fell asleep on the way home, and didn't wake up for another four hours when we arrived. At least that's what they say. Something was shaking me. I had that heavy feeling all over. I didn't open my eyes. I would just stay in this warm place as long as the outside forces allowed me. I suddenly felt something that smelled like bubble gum wash across my face and heard a gasp; of course, Natalie. I felt the pressure on my legs ease off and listened to Nat running out of the room, saying, \"She's awake!\" I didn't want to be. How long had Nat been sitting on my legs? They were all tingly. She must have been like a hundred million pounds. Mom and Dad came rushing in, so now I felt obliged to open my eyes and look at them. I was prepared for a, \"talk,\" a lecture, a disapproving glare from my father. But I got none of that. Instead they just hugged me until I couldn't breathe. The next few days I was confined to my bedroom. My cold appeared to not be letting up any time soon. No visitors but my immediate family. If I recall correctly, I am naturally jumpy person, therefore, I am not the type to lie around all day. Not to mention I missed Dusty. If Dusty were only here with me, I'm tremendously sure I would have recovered a long time ago. Every day for six days, I woke up sick, miserable, and aching. On the bright side, which I struggled to see, was that I was getting better. Slowly, but surely. I lost track of what day it was. I spent all my time in the backyard, mechanically doing math problems. When I did come inside, I didn't sleep in my bed, but on the floor where Dusty slept. I would curl up in a ball, snuggle into the colourful blankets he used to snuggle into . In a way, this was good for me. Me, Norah, was the nerdy girl who finally got a friend from God, and ended up losing him. The whole world should feel sorry for me. What a case I am. Natalie would come outside and bring me food. \"Hi, honey,\" she would say. She would give me a lop-sided grin, bend down and sit a plate in front of me and occasionaly a juicebox, then ruffle my hair. She never mentioned what she's supposedly, \"seen,\" that morning; my Dusty, my angel. Maybe she really did believe it was just her imagination. Nat didn't say a word about it so neither did I. After she goes back into the house, I throw the sandwich or hotdog or whatever Mom made over the fence, into the evil neighbour's yard. I had no appetite at all. I hoped their stupid Pomeranian would see it, eat it, and choke on it. Fairly soon, they started throwing the food back over. Obviously, us and them have no communication skills with each other. I should have felt guilty, but I felt the exact opposite. I took out everything on those around me. I couldn't stop it. Dad came out one day and sat on the grass beside me. I looked up from my English assignment. \"Yes?\" I asked, the dreadful sun making me squint at him. Dad said, \"Baby girl, you gotta cut it out.\" I sniffed and turned away. This is exactly what I'd been frantically trying to avoid. Fudge, fudge, and fudge again. \"Whatever it is,\" he told me, \"it'll get better. Things always get better.\" He put his arm around me and side-hugged me. \"Dad, you're squishing me,\" I said through gritted teeth. He smiled, a fake one, then went back inside, out of the nagging, scorching heat. At last I had to go inside, just after five. The sun started going down and I packed up my textbooks and notebooks and headed in. \"Hey, babe,\" said Nat cheerfully, wriggling her fingers at me in greeting. She skipped around after me as I tried to get to the kitchen and grab my secret stash of chocolate. I hid a bunch of Hershey's Kisses in an old antique cookie jar Mom kept on the top shelf that everyone but me thought was dusty and old and empty. \"What do you want?\" I asked anxiously, wanting her to leave; I needed my sugar fix and would die if she found out my stash. \"Nothing,\" she said, just as happy. Why the heck was she not being a typical teenage puke? \"Don't you have something to do?\" Nat shrugged and popped her gum, looking a little hurt. \"Just wanted to say hi.\" \" Hi , Natalie.\" She sighed. \"Hi, Norah.\" I crossed my arms and tapped my foot until she got the message and went off. I knew I had hurt her feelings, but chocolate mattered the most right now. Dragging a chair across the floor to the very top shelf, I watched as Natalie forlornly climbed the stairs to her room. I reached for the jar and pulled out a Kiss. At the last moment before I unwrapped it, something made me sprint after my sister and throw my arms around her. As expected, we both toppled over. \"What the hell?\" Natalie asked, coughing, laying on her back on the stairs, me on my back beside her. I shouldn't have done that; it knocked the breath right out of me. On the other hand it made me happy because this whole thing reminded me of when we were younger and wrestled each other until Mom screamed at us. Nat usually won, since she bit me, which was against the rules. Not like I could stop her. \"You made me swallow my-\" I held out the Kiss to Nat. \"For you,\" I said. She sat up and clutched her throat with one hand and accepted the chocolate with the other. \"That's gonna take seven years, you know.\" But she ate it anyway. \"Thanks.\" \"You're welcome,\" I said,\"and I'm sorry.\" I really meant it. She put her arm around me and we sat on the stairs together like that until Mom and Dad came home from work. We didn't speak; she and I had said and done enough to make me feel like something between us had somehow been fixed.[Chapter 14] God bless LADYMALLARD and Foxcat93, my dearest readers, for everything! I honestly can't thank you enough! I mean holy crumb cakes, you've been here the whole time! ^^ Ti amo...(Italian for I love you !) Believe it or not, once in a blue moon, rain visited us. On the day it did, I had no choice but to lock myself in my room and stay there. I didn't do any school. I tried, but my mind wouldn't focus. It kept going back to Dusty and me, walking, skipping, in the rain. And I hated myself for thinking it. Whenever a single thought of him popped in my head I would get angry at me. I would try so hard to forget it. It's over now , I'd say in my head. It wasn't, though. There was just now , just the moment. I'd walk down the stairs. Dusty used these . I mentally slapped myself. I was starting to be nicer to people. Mom said it was about time I stopped acting like a PMSing teenage girl, but before I pointed out I had four years left of child and non-teenager hood, and that I didn't know what PMSing meant, she was laughing too hard to listen to me. I got my appetite back, thank heavens. I chewed on a piece of liquorice and gazed out the window. There was a rainbow over the mountains. I turned my back on it and looked at the bookcase I had that's collecting dust. I experienced one of those dramatic moments, where I could break into song, singing Somewhere Over the Rainbow . I had the urge, but I didn't. I heard a knock on my window. I ignored it. Still, I look back and wonder why I didn't know who it was yet. Another knock I continued to leave alone. When one more came, I either got annoyed or creeped out, and went over to the window and looked down. Earth tilted under me. There Dusty stood, with his purple coat and bottomless pockets and accordion-like top hat. He held something wide and green, but it was too hard to see from up here. Sunlight bounced off the wet grass and made everything sort of shine. I smiled. I tapped the glass and then took off out of my room, shoved past Natalie, down the stairs, through the door. My legs were going so fast I couldn't keep up with them. Dusty now had an umbrella, despite the fact the sun had come out (mostly) and the rain stopped beating down. He was looking at me wearily, and I found it so amazing what the green stuff on the plate was. Jello . I must have appeared pretty stunned; Dusty grinned and honked, and when he did, I thought, Fudge, I would have given anything to hear that just a week ago. Dusty walked slowly up to me, the Jello outstretched. He took each step as if he wanted to make a lasting impression in the land. He held the plate out to me expectantly, bubbling over with excitement. He was shifting from foot to foot, and his hair, his noodle soup hair, glowed. I did something I wasn't willing myself to do. I wrapped my arms around Dusty's middle and hugged him like this was the last chance in my life. I again surprised myself, blurting out, \"I love you.\" Dusty and I went back to the park where God initially sent him to me. Dusty was clearly searching for someone-the balloon vendor. He never came, though. And Dusty was in such a good mood, even if Mr. Balloon man was nowhere around; he took out his scissors and was cutting everything. He cut pieces off people's coats, stuffing them in his pockets and even giving one to me; it was a yellow raincoat that belonged to a brunette woman I sometimes see at Wal-Mart . Then we sat cross-legged on the grass, our knees touching, eating green jello. I was so happy. Joy spiralled throughout me; that feeling when you put on warm pyjamas from the dryer. Speaking of pyjamas, the ones I wore a couple weeks ago are neatly folded and sitting on top of my bookshelf. Washed . I begged Mom not to wash them. They were the only part of Dusty I had left. When she refused, I demanded . Still, there they are, clean as clean can be. I was so upset about it, I haven't worn those pink P.J's since. Maybe I should now. And maybe I should apologize to Mom for getting mad about her washing them. In reality, she's only trying to keep me clean. Dusty's umbrella was back in one of his pockets. I asked him to put it away when he began closing it, then opening it quickly and loudly in passerby's faces. He glared at me, shook the umbrella at me, \"laughed,\" and tucked it into the inside of his purple coat. The jello was much needed. Maybe that's the reason I felt so happy. Or possibly because I was in the company of an angel. I don't know. Probably both. I stared at Dusty and felt more thankful to him than anyone else. I smiled until my cheeks ached. Honk honk . Dusty took off his hat and sat it-I can't believe this was happening to me!- on my head. I laughed out loud as it fell over my eyes, blinding me. I tipped it back up and patted it, letting him now I loved it as much as he loved it. I felt this was like an initiation of sorts, that this sealed our fate, our friendship. I knew when all angels like him(not quite like him) were gone, he's still be here. That was one of the beautiful things about Dusty. How he didn't speak, but talked with his eyes, his honking . How he made anyone smile. How he found beauty in everything and everyone. How he would find somehow, someway, to get you whatever you wanted, whether it be a baseboard or jello. But mostly, how he followed you around, to the ends of the Earth. The End HARPO ADOLPH(ARTHUR) MARX - R.I.P. ","Summary":" My first FF ever, really. VERY SCARED. I just wanted to thank Foxcat93 soooo much for the review! I"},{"Movie":"Magic Mike","Title":"Bringing the Magic","Author":"thomthom830","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11431752","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hello all: this is my first Magic Mike fic. I just had an inkling of an idea that brought the worlds of Magic Mike and Burlesque together and this is my grand attempt at making it work. It takes place six months after the guys went to Myrtle Beach for the convention. Mike has relocated himself and his business to try to make it work. He ends up living across the hall from Ali and Jack, employees of the Burlesque Lounge. I've taken some creative license with some of the characters, but all of your favorites from the films will be included. Please read on and leave a comment/review. I would love to know what you thought when you're finished‚Ä¶should I keep going? Thanks! Chapter One Mike carried the last box of his belongings into his new apartment building. He was sweating and his muscles were ready to give out. It was effing hot and he was starting to really reconsider this move. He was Mike Lane, but he would put money that most people knew him as Magic Mike. He'd done a variety of jobs throughout his life, but the one that lasted the longest was male entertainer (aka stripper). But it had been almost four years since he'd done it all professionally. Six months ago, certain life events had unfolded and had given Mike reason to reconsider everything. When he'd quit stripping, he'd been working on his custom furniture business and his relationship with Brooke. But the relationship was pushed to its limits when he proposed and his furniture business was at a very critical point. He'd gotten a chance to go to the annual stripper convention with the other guys from Club Xquisite. And despite a few setbacks on the way, they'd killed it in Myrtle Beach. But now all the guys had moved on. Both Ken and Andre were 'discovered' at the convention. A record exec's wife and her friends were there and had made sure that they'd gotten meetings with the company. They had both gotten deals and now Ken was working (and living) in New York and Andre was on tour opening for Nicki Minaj. Tito and Tobias (who was now fully-mended) were actually making a go of the artisanal frozen yogurt truck. They'd not only gotten a brand new truck, they were developing a mall kiosk. Tarzan was pursuing his art. The ladies they'd met in Savannah had made sure he'd gotten a few commissions and he had steady work. Mike had heard he was also getting some training as a marriage counselor. That left Richie. When they'd dropped the borrowed car back to Nancy, they'd all left and Richie moved in. He was now enjoying being a kept man. He was also Nancy's arm candy; she liked to take him to all kinds of parties and events. And it didn't seem like he minded. Mike initially had planned on staying in Florida but the furniture business wasn't picking up. He did a bit of research and found that the market for his work was going to drastically increase if he moved to either New York or California; he also found that those two states made up 75% of his out of state shipping. Mike had zero interest in living either place, but the lesser of two evils (and one that was much warmer) was California. He'd settled on LA when he'd read the map. He rented an apartment having only seen online pictures; it ended up being a decent space. Once he got settled, which he hoped didn't take long, he'd find a store front. He had pocketed the cash from the sale of the house in Tampa and planned to use it as a down payment. He stood outside his now-closed apartment door and tried to open it without setting the box down. He struggled, but his ego and pride wouldn't let him cave and put the box down. That was when he heard the door across the hall swing open. \"I'm going to check the mail. I'll meet you out front‚Ä¶\" a female voice called back into the apartment. He'd been moving his shit in for what felt like hours and he'd met a few of the folks on his floor. However, this was the first sign of the life he'd had from his direct neighbor. The door closed and the woman turned. \"Hold on; let me help you with the door,\" the woman said. He caught her scent and it immediately drove him crazy. Then his eyes met her blue ones. She was petite and blonde and she had moved in close to him to turn the doorknob for him. The door swung open for her and she moved to allow him into his space. \"Thank you,\" he said as he set the box on the floor just inside the doorway. \"I could have set it down, but‚Ä¶\" he said as he wiped his dirty and sweaty hands on his shorts. She smiled. \"But that's more work because then you have to pick it up again,\" she laughed. Mike focused on the woman before him. Her blonde hair was in a high messy bun on the top of her head and if she was wearing make-up, she was an expert at making it look natural. She had pale skin that set off her blue eyes. The only jewelry she wore was a pair of small silver stars in her ears and a patterned ring on her middle finger on her‚Ä¶right hand. \"Hi, I'm Ali,\" she said while she offered her hand to him. He couldn't help but notice that she didn't have any rings on her left hand at all. \"Welcome to the building. You are new to the building and not someone coming to murder me, right?\" she laughed. He shook her hand. \"I'm Mike. Thank you for the welcome. And no, I'm leasing this apartment,\" he pointed behind him. \"Well, that is good to hear,\" she continued to smile. \"And not a problem. If we don't look out for each other, who will?\" \"That's a good point‚Ä¶\" The door Ali had come out of opened once more and Mike felt a pang of disappointment. It was a dude coming out. Dark, blondish hair, sort of tall. He wore jeans and a white t-shirt with a leather jacket over it. He carried a black vest and bow tie in his hand. Mike's eyes moved to the guy's ‚Äì they were rimmed in black eyeliner and it took every ounce of self-control not to laugh. The guy realized what he thought what was happening and put his arm around Ali's waist to mark his territory. \"Mike, this is Jack, my boyfriend. He also lives here. Jack, this is our new neighbor, Mike.\" The men surveyed one another warily. Jack knew how gorgeous his girlfriend was and seemed to get jealous pretty damn easily. \"It's nice to meet you, Mike. I wish we had more time right now, but we're in a rush for work,\" Ali said genuinely. \"Yeah, damn,\" Jack added sarcastically. \"If we don't get a move on, Iowa, Tess'll tan both our hides,\" Jack smiled playfully at her. \"Not a problem,\" he echoed Ali's reply from a few moments ago. \"I should quit procrastinating and unpack. Nice to meet the both of you.\" \"Yeah,\" Jack said curtly. Ali had turned to lock her apartment door and there two men shared the most intense twenty seconds. Mike smiled slightly; he had no intention of breaking up a happy couple. But he could see that Jack found him competition. Ali turned and smiled politely once more. She wasn't flirting; she just seemed to be a nice person. \"Good luck unpacking. And if you need a pick-me-up later, there's a diner around the corner. Tell 'em Ali sent you and they'll get you all fixed up.\" Mike rubbed the back of his neck and flexed his muscles inadvertently. He was going to need coffee; he had no idea if he had even packed his old coffeemaker. \"Thank you, Ali. It's nice to meet you. You too, Jack,\" he said while wearing a slightly cocky grin. \"Have a good night at work.\" Jack gave a curt nod and Ali smiled apologetically. She knew Jack was being an ass on purpose. Jack was walking down the hall and Ali quickly followed behind. A second later he heard a motorcycle start up. Of course this dude had a bike; he was trying way too hard. Mike stared at their door for a second and smiled. His general practice was to avoid women in relationships. He'd come in to a lot of chances in his former line of work and it always ended up too messy. He really hated drama. He had no intention of moving in on Ali. She'd made it clear that Jack was her boyfriend. And Mike figured that he hadn't made a friend in Jack. ‚Ä¶ The couple had made their way silently into the Burlesque Lounge and were now standing in the middle of the floor. \"Why are you being so childish, Jack? The silent treatment, really?\" Ali said into Jack's smug face. \"Childish? You were the only openly flirting with that guy!\" Jack said from behind the bar. Little did the two of them know, they had a small, but curious audience forming. Tess and Sean were on the stage behind the curtain. \"We shouldn't listen‚Ä¶\" Sean stated. \"The hell we shouldn't,\" Tess smirked. \"Now, shut up so I can hear.\" \"Flirting, Jack, really? I smiled and was friendly.\" \" Tell them Ali sent you ,\" he said in an imitation of her. \"Obviously he's new to LA. I told him where to go to get some coffee, Jack. Relax. I'm thinking of telling you where you can go, now, too.\" \"If he was obviously doing anything, he was checking you out.\" \"Geezus, Jack. Not every man on the planet that looks at me is your competition. You're being totally ridiculous. You know how I feel about you. And you know you have nothing to worry about.\" \"O-kay, Ali,\" he agreed in a highly sarcastic way. \"I am so done talking to you, Jack. I am allowed to speak to men that aren't you. You do not get to tell me who I can and can't be friends with.\" \"Men and women can't be friends, Ali. He took one look at you and decided he wanted you.\" \"You weren't even there! And didn't you do that, too?\" Ali argued. \"I had no idea you were so insecure. I am not going to cheat on you, Jack. Whatever! I am going to get ready. Don't punch any of the customers for looking at me tonight,\" she told him with a lot of sass and a flip of her hair. Ali turned on her heel and moved to get to the stairs so she could get ready for that night's show. She was the headliner at the newly improved Burlesque Lounge on the Sunset Strip. Jack, her boyfriend, was the head bartender. The two of them, along with two dozen other people or so, worked for Tess, the club's owner/matriarch. It had been a challenging year with some definite highs and lows, but Ali had helped Tess save the club from being bought out and torn down and they had revitalized it's patronage. Ali had a significant set of vocal chords; she'd been an untapped talent until she'd accidentally revealed it when she was trying to save a performance a long time ago. Ali could not only belt it out, she had a knack for doing some dead-on impersonations of other singers. Tess re-worked the entire show around Ali's singing abilities. She had become a local celebrity and even though she had been offered a very large record deal (somewhere in the vicinity of six figures) she couldn't imagine leaving the club now or Tess, Sean or Jack. But she had no idea that Jack was so insecure and possessive. She wondered how he was reacting to the audience of men and women that filled the club four to five nights a week ‚Äì was he jealous of everyone all the time? ‚Ä¶ Mike had spent the last few hours unpacking. He went until he couldn't ignore the angry rumbling. He was going to hit up the diner that Ali had suggested. Mike walked down the street to the small diner. They likely served nothing healthy and honestly after the long day he'd had, he felt like something greasy. He sat in a corner booth and a pleasant looking waitress came over. \"Hi honey. Can I get you something to drink?\" she smiled. She had bright red hair that was more than likely from a bottle and a soft and familiar southern accent. It made Mike feel closer to home in that instant as she spoke. Mike relaxed into the plastic seat. \"Well, your coffee comes highly recommended and I could honestly use some caffeine.\" \"Well, the only person who raves about our coffee is Ali, so I'll get ya all fixed. Do you need a minute to look through the menu, sugar, or do you know what you want?\" He thought for a minute. \"Do you have a recommendation? Or maybe whatever Ali orders, since she told me to come here‚Ä¶she's probably an expert.\" \"Well, she always orders pancakes if she comes in after the late show. I'll bet she'll be in tonight around one thirty with the other ladies,\" the red-haired waitress said. Mike's confusion must have read on his face. \"You know, when they all get done at the club‚Ä¶the Burlesque Lounge. Its a few blocks from here on Sunset. Didn't you say you knew Ali?\" she said with confusion. She didn't want to be giving a stalker such information. \"I just moved into her building. I live across from Ali and Jack,\" Mike explained. The waitress' smile became a frown quickly. \"I take it you don't like Jack?\" Her face changed back into a smile. \"No, no. Jack is just‚Ä¶just fine.\" Mike always had the knack for being able to read people. He could always tell when someone was hiding something. And this lady, she was definitely hiding something. \"He seemed like a nice guy,\" Mike lied. \"I've known him a long time. He's been out in California a lot longer than Ali. He works down at the club, too. He's the head bartender,\" the waitress said. She smiled but it was now an uneasy one. \"I think he's‚Ä¶\" Mike waited for her to finish her thought. \"It's nothing,\" she waived her hand and forced a laugh. \"It's just paranoia and conspiracy theories.\" Mike laughed. \"About what?\" \"I've just always thought he was using Ali. Listen to me‚Ä¶I‚Ä¶\" she rambled. \"I just think I saw him with another woman. I don't think he's faithful and he doesn't treat her very nicely when he thinks no one is watching,\" she wore a concerned expression. That wasn't what Mike was expecting to hear. \"Oh.\" \"Well, hun, I'm gonna get ya fixed up. I'm gonna put your order in and bring ya some of our world famous coffee. Don't tell either of them I said that, please.\" Mike made a locking motion over his lips. \"It's our secret.\" ‚Ä¶ That night Mike laid on his mattress in the middle of the living room. He was too tired to put the whole bed together. He was curious about Ali and found her boyfriend, Jack, to be trying too hard to cover something and after his conversation with Myrtle, other people thought the same thing. But he couldn't worry about all of that; tomorrow he had to get his apartment in order because after that, he needed to get his business up and running out here in California. ‚Ä¶ Author's note: okay, so I hope you didn't hate it. Let me know what you think, good, bad or indifferent.[Chapter 2] Author's Note: Thank you all for reading this! I hope this chapter is okay. Disclaimer: Okay, I don't own or claim to own any of the Magic Mike or Burlesque characters. I wish things were different, but No. Well, read on! Chapter Two It was almost two weeks before Mike ran into Ali or Jack again. He'd been getting up exceptionally early to go for a run and then he was busy meeting with his realtor or working in a small corner of the building's basement. So far he had not found any buildings or store fronts that he could picture turning into his store. He thought he'd seen at least fifteen buildings and his realtor, Lester, was remaining positive that he would find Mike his perfect space. This particular morning, he passed a grumpy-looking Jack as he was returning from his run. He'd heard the tail end of a tense conversation with Ali. The sour-faced guy passed by Mike as he left the building without uttering a word. Mike got to his own door quickly after and Ali was inside her apartment already. He showered and headed out again, this time with his toolbox to get some work done. Ali was returning from her mailbox. \"Good morning,\" Mike said politely. \"Morning. You know, I was starting to think you were avoiding me,\" she laughed. Mike laughed, too. \"Nope, only Jack.\" \"Yeah‚Ä¶sometimes he's‚Ä¶you know. Where are you headed with a toolbox?\" she asked, changing the subject. Her eyes sparkled and her interest was real. \"Come with me,\" he said. \"Are we going far?\" she asked as she was led to the basement stairs. \"Wait. Are you taking me to the basement to kill me and get rid of my body?\" \"Nah, I prefer redheads,\" he said seriously. Ali was silent for a minute and he could tell she was trying to decide if that was a joke. \"Just kidding, Ali. The landlord is letting me get some of my work done downstairs.\" Mike went down the stairs first. Ali knew that there were storage lockers down there, but this was the first that she'd ventured down. She never needed to store anything. She was a few steps behind him when he got to the bottom. \"It's legit; I promise,\" he smiled and held out his hand. Ali took it and noticed how her own fit perfectly within his hands. He led her down the hall of units, turning on the lights as he went. She passed by the locked unit that belonged to her apartment; she wondered if Jack kept anything in it. Just when Ali thought that this walk was never going to end, Mike stopped and they both realized they were still holding hands. It felt good, but they both let go immediately. Mike was setting his toolbox down on a makeshift tool bench. Around the two of them were completed and semi-completed pieces of furniture. Ali turned to Mike wearing a quizzical look. \"I have my own business. I make and sell custom furniture. The landlord is being nice enough to let me use this area until I can find a storefront and workspace.\" \"Oh, wow,\" Ali said. He liked that she sounded sincere. \"You made this?\" she asked as she stopped to inspect a low coffee table. The coffee table was made of wood painted black and was held together with old railroad spikes. The top was glass. \"Yeah,\" Mike said. \"It's something I've always wanted to do and I finally made it my priority. I'm hoping to really step it up. That's why I moved out here.\" \"Where did you move from?\" Ali asked. \"Tampa. You?\" \"Don't I seem like a California native?\" Ali laughed. \"Nope,\" Mike replied. Ali snorted. \"I'm from Iowa. I moved out here about two years ago to figure out who I'm supposed to be.\" \"Have you figured out the meaning of life yet?\" \"Hell no,\" Ali replied. \"But I never really thought California would solve all my problems. It's helped a lot though.\" \"If you do figure it out, let me know.\" Ali nodded and then moved to inspect a few pieces she could tell were drift wood. \"What are these going to be?\" \"A headboard for a king-sized bed. I found them on the beach last week.\" She turned back to look at him. \"So you do just pick up pieces you find and figure your shit out later or do you see things and just know what they're meant to be?\" \"It depends. I do both. Some pieces naturally lend themselves to being specific pieces of furniture. Other times, I'll happen upon scrap metal or wood, like these, and just save them. I've got a box full of hinges and old doorknobs in my truck right now. I feel like a hoarder, but I stopped at scrap yards and antique places on my way out here.\" \"That's awesome.\" \"A client wanted an abstract metal nightstand. I found these pieces and did the welding before I moved out here. It's going to have a black marble top ‚Äì some things I have to buy. Marble doesn't exactly wash up on the beach. But when I make something to order, that's the way it goes. I get emails from all over the US ‚Äì not as much as I'd like, but enough. I'm hoping having an actual store where I can consult with people is going to help. Right now, I can only rely on my website and word of mouth.\" \"At least you have a solid plan. You must not have been able to find anything yet since you're still here‚Ä¶\" He laughed. \"I think I'm being too particular.\" \"I don't think that's a bad thing, though. It's how you're going to make a living; it needs to be up to your standards and it needs to be your vision,\" Ali explained. \"You took the words right out of my mouth,\" he replied. \"When you do find it‚Ä¶I'm pretty handy with a paint roller‚Ä¶something I did in my past life.\" \"I appreciate the offer, but‚Ä¶\" She put her fists on her hips. \"But what?\" \"I don't think Jack is going to like you to spend too much time with me. I mean, I don't mind‚Ä¶\" \"Jack does not own me. I'm going to do what I want and help whoever I want to,\" Ali affirmed. \"Besides, he's just jealous. He's so used to being the resident go-to handyman around here ‚Äì he doesn't want to share the attention of the women in the building with another guy. Since we have a lot of older ladies that live here, Jack helps out as much as he can,\" Ali explained. \"Oh, I see,\" Mike said. He hit 'play' on his phone and the music player on shuffle started playing a familiar tune. He smiled when he was caught off-guard by Pony . He followed the beat with his movements, not breaking into any real choreography, but realized Ali was watching him intently. \"The song brings back some memories,\" he replied to the question that she hadn't asked yet. She smiled in return. \"I see.\" \"So, now you've heard about me, Miss Ali‚Ä¶\" \"Monroe.\" \"Miss Ali Monroe,\" he said her full name. \"So what about you?\" \"I'm Ali, just Ali. I was a waitress in a dead-end town, but when I had enough money saved, I bought a one-way ticket out here to LA. In my attempts to find a job as a singer, I stumbled upon the club and never left; I'm lucky Tess hired me.\" \"That's right ‚Äì Myrtle told me you worked at the Burlesque Lounge.\" \"Of course she did. What did you think of the diner?\" \"You were right; great coffee. I've been there a few time now. Myrtle has a lot of stories. Did you know she was a showgirl in Vegas?\" Ali laughed. \"Yeah, she's told me those stories, too. She also claims that she's met Elvis but she is nowhere near old enough to have met the Elvis.\" \"Unless she's one of those people that believes he never died.\" Ali's phone chimed and she pulled it from her back pocket. \"Oh, I've got to go; my ride's two minutes away. Thanks for showing me your work. It's fantastic.\" \"Thank you. And you're welcome. Come visit me any time.\" She made it to the end of the hall and turned back to him. \"Thanks for not murdering me, too,\" she called. \"No problem!\" he called back. ‚Ä¶ Over the next few weeks, Mike and Ali continued to build their friendship. Mike had initially been worried about pissing off Jack, but Ali explained that he was headed back to Kentucky for a few days for a family reunion. That was two weeks ago. Apparently he'd extended his stay when the family was happy to see him home. Mike's routine remained basically the same during that time expect he now had Ali as a running buddy. And he also made frequent stops at the diner. On her days off from the club, sometimes she would show him around the city and they'd gotten dinner or gone to a movie a few times. On Monday morning, the last day they had before Jack was due home again (after being gone for a solid three and a half weeks), Ali stood outside Mike's door and knocked. He opened the door in only his running shorts and he smiled at her, even though he was a bit bleary eyed. \"Good morning,\" she sing-songed. \"Let's go! I have something to show you.\" She then realized that she was still staring directly at the shirtless Mike and clammed up. \"Am I allowed to finish getting dressed first?\" he asked. Ali almost told him no and jumped into his amazing arms. He looked damn good. \"I mean, I guess,\" she smiled and tried to cover her clear admiration for his body. However, she knew that he knew that she was admiring him. \"Well, come on in,\" he said and moved back to allow her into the apartment. \"Let me go find my shirt and shoes.\" She closed the door behind herself while Mike headed back to his bedroom. \"So where are you taking me?\" he called. \"Um, duh, it's a surprise.\" He popped his head out of the room. \"I should tell you that I hate surprises,\" he grinned. Ali put her hands on her hips and attempted a stern look. \"Well, mister, you will like this one. Scout's honor.\" \"I don't believe that you were a Girl Scout,\" Mike told her. \"I wasn't. But I promise you'll like this one.\" Ali wandered around the apartment. He only had a couple unpacked boxes left and they were pushed into a corner. He'd bought a couch and it was siting opposite a large flat screen TV. On the mantle of his fireplace was one framed photo: Mike and bunch of smiling guys. Mike walked out of his room, with shirt and shoes this time. \"I'm ready,\" he said while he put his phone and keys into the zippered pocket of his sweatshirt. \"Your family?\" Ali asked. \"Yeah,\" Mike replied. \"Ken, Richie, me, Tito, Tarzan and that's Tobias,\" he pointed. \"They're guys I used to work with; basically they became family.\" \"They look like a bunch of great guys,\" she said sincerely while she put the photo down once more. \"They are.\" \"Okay, well, let's get going,\" she smiled and tugged on his arm. They went running, as usual, but Ali took him somewhere different than where they usually ran. They went down Sunset Boulevard and Ali brought them down by the club that she worked in. She still hadn't invited him into it, so he was avoiding a scene with Jack by simply showing up. Besides, Mike knew the last thing that a waitress needed was some kind of idiot dude bothering her during her shift. He wasn't going to be that desperate to get her attention. She hadn't come right out and said she was a waitress, but he'd made the assumption early on and neither had mentioned it later. Running just past the club, they stopped on the other side of it. It was an old two-story grey cement building that looked as if it had gone unused for a long time. \"Ta-da!\" Ali said as she stood in front of the door. Mike must have looked confused, because Ali launched into a mile-a-minute explanation. \"I was talking with Tess and Sean the other day about what you were looking for and then Tess said that they had this building ‚Äì it had come with the purchase of the club and the last tenants moved out about ten years ago. I think Sean said it had been a shoe store or something. But Tess was just going to leave it empty and I asked if we could take a look around and she gave me the key.\" She held up the key while Mike smiled. \"She brought me in last night but it was hard to see since there is no electricity currently. Do you want to see it? I hope you can forgiving me for overstepping‚Ä¶\" He put his hands on her forearms to stop her. And it was taking every ounce of self-control he had not to kiss here right then and there. \"Let's go in and see.\" The first floor was floor to ceiling windows that were papered. But even through the brown wrapping, Mike could tell it would get a ton of natural light. The room's internal architecture was a bit dated, but it was all cosmetic work that would be needed. \"Tess said this is about 850 square feet,\" Ali said. Mike was walking around the space. While unused and in need of a good and thorough cleaning, he could imagine using this space. It was the first time he'd seen a building that he didn't immediately hate. He could see putting show pieces in and where he wanted consultation tables. \"What do you think?\" Ali asked. He was being awfully quiet and that was making her nervous. \"SO far, I really like it,\" he smiled. Ali smiled and moved to a door at the back. \"Follow me,\" she said. It was like following the white rabbit; he didn't know where he was being led, but he definitely wanted to go. The doorway in the back right corner of the room led to a short hall. There were two single person powder rooms on the left that were going to need a lot of work, if not all new fixtures. The hall then led to a door and through the door they went. It led to the store's original stockroom. \"I was thinking that this could be your workshop. You could have clients come back here and see what you're working on if they don't know what they want or if they want to see the progress of an in-progress piece‚Ä¶if that's what you wanted to do.\" Mike was stunned. It had at least ten foot ceilings back here and there would be plenty of space to work. A desk-area was built into the wall and he knew he could have the electrical upgraded to accommodate the use of his power tools. He moved around and found another door. Inside, he found a small office that stuck like cat piss, but was pleased to know he could even have an office for his business instead of using his kitchen table. \"So, Mr. Lane, what do you think?\" she asked. \"I think Lester is going to be pissed that you'll be getting his commission,\" Mike laughed. \"You really like it?\" Ali asked. \"It's exactly what I had pictured. Ali, thank you. No one‚Ä¶\" They were kissing before either of them realized it and after taking a moment to enjoy it, they jumped apart and looked at one another for a beat. \"Well, I uh‚Ä¶\" Ali stammered. \"I should‚Ä¶\" she was trailing off, but was still wearing the smile on her face. \"Maybe we don't tell Jack that happened‚Ä¶\" \"I agree,\" Mike said. \"I don't think we should.\" \"Well, I think we should head back to our building. I'll call Tess after lunch so I know she's awake. I'll see about scheduling a meeting with her for you. Is that okay?\" \"That sounds really good. Thank you, Ali,\" he said. The two were silent as they walked through the building again. Mike's vision was clearer to him more now than ever before. Ali locked up the front door once more and the two began to silently walk back towards their apartment building. He turned his head as they strolled past the Burlesque Lounge. It was quiet and dark in the early hours of the day. A poster next to the door caught his attention. It had a woman in costume that left very little to the imagination while she stood in a provocative pose. No doubt about it; it was Ali. The poster reminded him of the French poster art he'd studied in school a long time ago. It appeared that she'd left some information out in their conversations, but for now, it seemed like he and Ali had more in common than either of them had thought originally. ‚Ä¶ Author's note: Thanks to everyone reading! Thank you thank you thank you ![Chapter 3] Chapter Three Ali checked her make-up in the mirror of her vanity table once more. She was more anxious than normal and she couldn't figure out why. She was due on stage in ten minutes and she was full of butterflies that she normally didn't have. \"What is the matter with you?\" Tess asked. She was standing beside Ali and talking to her reflection in the mirror. \"I don't know. Just anxious tonight, I guess,\" Ali said. \"I met with your Mike earlier today,\" Tess told her. Ali's eyes shot up to the \"real\" Tess net to her. \"You did?\" \"Yes,\" Tess smirked. \"You should've told me how cute he was so I could have been prepared.\" \"Were his looks that important to your decision?\" Ali asked. \"No,\" Tess replied. \"Well‚Ä¶it helped a little. Oh, and I invited him to the show tonight. He told me you've never invited him. Are you ashamed of us?\" Tess was still smiling. Ali knew she was teasing about the last part. \"He's at the back table. He's our guest, so I told the bar to get him what he wants,\" Tess told her. Ali eyed her boss/mentor cautiously. \"Did you rent him the building?\" \"Sold it,\" Tess said as she started to walk away. Ali jumped up and dashed behind her long-legged leader. \"Sold it?\" Ali repeated. \"He bought the building from you?\" \"We worked out a deal.\" \"You slept with him,\" Ali said. Tess rolled her eyes. \"Little girl, you have got a lot to learn. And no. He's a tad young for me.\" \"Does Jack know Mike is here?\" Ali asked. Tess stopped walking and Ali bumped into her when she stopped abruptly. \"Jack went home sick an hour and a half ago. He didn't tell you?\" Tess asked. \"No,\" Ali said glumly. \"He didn't. Did he‚Ä¶?\" \"Said he must have gotten food poisoning,\" Tess explained. Ali nodded and was headed back to get her phone. She didn't like that Jack didn't feel well enough to stay at work and she didn't like that he didn't tell her. But Sean caught her by the elbow. \"Where are you going?\" Sean asked. \"Two minutes.\" \"But I‚Ä¶\" \"No. C'mon!\" Sean said. He led Ali up to the stage and made sure her hair, make up and costume all were working together. The performance tonight was a medley of songs that she'd done several times before. They were all mostly from the original run of Ali's career there. Once the music started, she had forgotten about Jack and Mike. However, when she was done and was backstage gulping down water, the reality of it all it her. She'd not had the discussion of what she did at the Burlesque Lounge with Mike yet. And she had hoped that when she asked Tess not to tell him, she'd honor that. But clearly, she hadn't. Ali knew that because Mike was seated in the audience. She really hoped he wasn't mad. And then she thought of Jack. He was probably back at the apartment, sacked out on the couch watching Back to the Future like he always did when he didn't feel well. She thought of calling Jack, but she had no messages or calls from him. She decided not to bother him. \"You were terrific tonight, dear,\" Sean said. \"But I expected nothing less. You need to touch up your hair and make-up and go chat with your Mike.\" Ali gulped down more water and smiled. \"You remember Jack ‚Äì my boyfriend?\" \"Well, Mike seems charming. And he seems totally smitten with you,\" Sean said to her. \"Sean, Mike and I are friends only.\" \"Darling, I know that. But I also know that keeping your options open isn't a bad idea either.\" \"Did Tess sleep with him? Is that why he's here?\" Ali asked. \"I was at the meeting, Ali. And no, no one slept with anyone at the coffee shop,\" Sean smiled. \"He's here for you. He's totally hung up on you,\" he said, gently poking her in the nose. \"You do remember suggesting that I start seeing Jack, right? That you thought we would be a cute couple?\" \"I remember. And when I said that I agreed with that. But now.\" \"But now what?\" Ali asked. \"Now isn't the time to talk about this,\" Sean said. \"Let's get your make-up touched up and you can go celebrate with Mike. He was hoping he could talk with you after the show. By the way, how come you've never brought him here?\" \"He and Jack don't get along all that well‚Ä¶\" The two of them continue to walk from the backstage area to Ali's vanity table. Sean and Ali fixed her make-up and her hair that had frizzed a bit during the dance numbers. \"I just‚Ä¶\" Ali started to explain. \"I've told other people that I'm a Burlesque dancer and they automatically assume stripper. I didn't want to scare Mike away.\" Sean stared into her eyes in the mirror while he stroked his beard stubble. \"So you do care about him.\" \"Sean‚Ä¶\" Sean smiled and then bit it back. \"Okay, kiddo. You go talk to him. But we should talk soon. Okay?\" Ali was slightly weary of the pep talk she'd just received from Sean. Something was going on and she didn't exactly know what that meant. The costume she wore wasn't one of the most extreme pieces she'd worn and it offered a lot of coverage ‚Äì especially compared to the pearl bikini and a few other pieces. Ali made sure she was appropriately covered and then made her way out onto the floor. Mike was talking with someone but excused himself as he saw Ali making her way towards him. \"Wow,\" he smiled as he led her back to his table. \"That was‚Ä¶amazing.\" Ali smiled shyly. \"Thank you. And‚Ä¶I should congratulate you, Mr. Building Owner,\" Ali told him. \"Thank you. I guess we both have something to celebrate,\" Mike said. \"We do?\" Ali asked. \"Well‚Ä¶I think we should celebrate what you just did up there. How come you never told me you could sing like that?\" he smiled. A waitress came over and brought Ali a drink and a refill for Mike. \"Thank you,\" both Ali and Mike said together. \"I just don't use it as an opener when I meet people. I've met some people who‚Ä¶who aren't as nice and receptive as you are. Some people think I'm a stripper, which there is nothing wrong with. And others think it's some kind of prostitution thing‚Ä¶And then I've had a couple people who just want to use me.\" \"Well, I'll be honest, I didn't know what burlesque was. I Googled it,\" he said. \"I only knew what I knew was through a friend of mine. He was kind of obsessed with becoming the male version of Dita Von Teese,\" Mike explained. Ali laughed and sipped at her drink with the straw that came in it. \"I started as a waitress here when I moved from Iowa. I worked my way up to chorus dancer and became the main show by accident.\" \"Where did you learn to sing like that?\" he asked. \"I don't know, really. I just sang along with music growing up,\" Ali replied. Mike was in disbelief; that sound came out of Ali. It was amazing; when she'd started to sing every eye and ear was on her. And it wasn't just Ali that was talented up there. While Ali was clearly a singer and dancer, the other ladies up there were holding their own. They were impressive on their own and as a group. Now that he'd seen the show, Mike could totally understand why the place was packed. \"So, is Jack going to show up from somewhere and fight me for keeping your attention?\" Mike asked her. \"He is actually home sick,\" Ali said as someone came up with a pen and napkin for her to sign. \"I'm so sorry, but Ali, can I have your autograph?\" the woman asked. The woman held out the pen and waited. Ali smiled. \"Of course. What's your‚Ä¶?\" \"Oh my gosh!\" the woman squealed as she looked at Mike who was taking a drink of his beer. \"Aren't you Magic Mike?\" Ali turned her head to Mike and gave him a confused and amused look while he looked at her out of the corner of his eye. \"I saw you while I was on spring break a few years ago! You came out in the crowd and picked up the chair with‚Ä¶\" He smiled. \"Yes. That's me,\" he cut her off before she could detail that particular dance routine. \"My friends and I still talk about that show. We were thinking of going back,\" she said, attempting to bat her eyelashes while he signed the napkin. \"Well, it's nice to meet you,\" Mike said. The woman giggled and hovered for an awkward moment until she walked away. Ali finished her drink and waited for Mike to give her an explanation. \"Magic Mike?\" Ali asked. She didn't know what to think, but she was getting a bit of an idea. \"Well, you know how we talked about how I'd done a bunch of different jobs? Well, male entertainer was one of those jobs. Magic Mike is‚Ä¶was‚Ä¶my stage name.\" The alcohol in Ali's drink had gone straight to her head and she couldn't help but giggle. She immediately stopped, though, when she realized what she was doing. \"Eh, I've got thicker skin than that, Ali,\" Mike said. \"And I've heard a lot worse.\" \"So‚Ä¶you're a former male‚Ä¶stripper?\" Ali asked. He laughed. \"Yes. Do you need some water?\" he asked her as he noticed she was into a second drink that had been brought to the table. He signaled over her head to the waitress for water. \"What kind of stripping did you do?\" she asked. \"Well, it wasn't‚Ä¶\" Mike started. \"With male stripping it's pretty much just the one kind,\" he said through a smile. \"Wait, wait, wait‚Ä¶\" she said a bit too loudly. \"Have you gone down to those teeny-tiny little man-thongs?\" Ali giggled, as the alcohol shut down her mouth's filter. The waitress arrived with the glass of water and wide eyes. She laughed and set down the water and turned and left once more. \"Here, singer-girl, drink some of this water,\" he laughed. Ali giggled and didn't drink the water. She, instead, poked him in the chest. \"So we both take our clothes off for a living and neither of us wanted to tell each other,\" she said. \"You could put it that way,\" Mike said. \"I want to go to the beach. Let's go to the beach,\" Ali said. Mike smiled. \"It's about ten at night and it'll be at least an hour drive,\" Mike said. \"I don't care. I'll pay for gas,\" Ali said. \"You really want to go?\" Mike asked. She nodded emphatically. \"I think we should!\" Mike thought of all the possibilities. He'd love to go to the beach with Ali. But it was late, and she was tipsy. And she had a boyfriend. There were so many reasons why they shouldn't go. But she looked like she really wanted to go. \"All right. You should go get changed and get your stuff. We'll swing by the apartment to check on Jack‚Ä¶\" Mike said. He figured by the time they got back, Ali would be too tired to want to go and seeing Jack would remind her that she didn't really want to go to the beach in the middle of the night. \"Really?\" she asked. She was up and out of her seat a moment later. \"I'll be right back.\" ‚Ä¶ Ali was sobered up by the time they stopped back at the apartment building. But she still wanted to go to the beach. She had steeled herself on the ride home for the fight she was inevitably going to have with Jack, but she wanted to go to the beach with a friend and hell, she was going to go. However, what she found was a totally empty apartment. A totally empty apartment when supposedly her boyfriend went home sick from work. Ali dialed his number for the fifteenth time that night and this time, and it went to voicemail again. She was suspicious and she decided to send a text to him to see if he'd reply to that. Ali: Do you need me to bring anything home? Tess told me you went home sick. A minute passed, and then another two, before she saw the \"‚Ä¶\" appear on the screen. Jack: I'm doing okay. Just watching movies on the couch. I'm pretty sure it's just food poisoning. You getting home at the normal time tonight? Ali was filled with so many emotions. He was outright lying to her. She knew that something was up with him, but now she was sure. And she was pretty sure what was going on. Ali: Not sure. Might have plans when I get out. Don't wait up.[Chapter 4] Chapter Four As Mike had suspected, the beach was deserted when they arrived. They'd stopped at a liquor store on the way and Mike carried a couple of blankets and a six-pack of beer as he walked next to Ali on the cold sand. He'd known she was upset, even though she was pretending nothing was wrong. Ali had gotten a few texts and a couple of calls while they were driving and Mike could tell by her demeanor that it was Jack. But he didn't want to pry; she'd talk when she felt like it. \"Do you think we'll find a place?\" Mike asked. Ali laughed. \"I think we're going to have to fight for it,\" she answered. They continued out towards water; Ali wanted to be close to it. She stared ahead, fixated on where the dark sky met the water. She stopped about fifteen feet from where the waves were washing up on the sand and dropped her tote bag into the sand. She removed first her sweater, then her leggings before tossing both into her tote. Mike watched as she threw caution to the wind and dashed out into the black as ink sea. Mike chuckled at first, when she yelped at the icy water hitting her body. Then watched as she dove headfirst into it and disappeared. He, then, dropped the beer and the blankets, quickly removed his own shirt and ran in after her. \"Ali?\" he called. She surfaced a second later. \"Shit! Don't do that!\" he said. \"What? Did I make you nervous?\" Ali teased before she splashed him a bit. \"No, you scared the hell out of me,\" Mike replied seriously. He reached out and brushed the wayward hair out of her face. The two of them stood in waist deep water and looked at one another. \"We should get out of the water; we're going to end up with a double case of hypothermia,\" Mike told her. Ali rolled her eyes at him and splashed him. Mike got a face-full of cold ocean water and he blinked at her. \"Do you know what you're starting?\" \"Is that a threat?\" Ali replied. \"It's a warning. Be careful of the war that's about to begin,\" he told her.\" She splashed him again. \"Bring. It. On.\" They both started splashing each other unrelentingly and after ten minutes, the both of them were down in the water and laughing to the point where it was hard to breathe. \"Okay, okay, white flag!\" Ali shouted. They both stood up, still shaking from laughter. \"Race you to the shore!\" Ali said before dashing towards the beach. Mike ran behind her and picked her up as he was running. He carried her over his shoulder all the way back onto the sand. \"It's a tie,\" he said as he set the shivering woman back down in the sand. They quickly grabbed their towels to dry off and Mike tossed a blanket around their shoulders as they sat on the one he'd spread out on the sand. \"There are a lot less seagulls here at night,\" Mike said as they sat shoulder to shoulder under the fleece blanket. Ali nodded. \"So, why did you want to come all the way out to the beach tonight?\" Mike asked. \"Why did you agree to come all the way out to the beach tonight?\" Ali asked. \"I asked you first.\" \"I just like the beach. And it makes me feel better,\" she said. \"This is where I like to come to clear my head. I really appreciate you driving me out here, Mike. I thought I would be more fun than I am right now‚Ä¶\" \"Did you at least text Jack that you were coming out here with me? Is that why you're so quiet? Because, Ali, I'm not going to get in the way of what you and Jack have. I don't want to be that guy; especially not to you. I think it's clear that I have an interest in you, but if we can only be friends, I'm going to figure out how to deal with that.\" \"Jack wasn't really asleep when we got back,\" Ali said quietly. Mike turned toward her. She was shivering still, and he put his arm around her waist to pull her closer to him. He wasn't lying when he said that nothing was going to happen between them, nothing would. But he wasn't going to let her freeze either. \"Okay, what did he say when you told him you were going out to the beach? Or did you not tell him?\" Mike asked. \"Because, Ali‚Ä¶I don't‚Ä¶\" \"He wasn't even home, Mike. He told our boss that he was sick and going home. I texted him when I was in the apartment and pretended like I was still at work. He said he was just sleeping on the couch and watching movies. But clearly that was a lie,\" Ali said. \"I have no idea what he's actually doing.\" It was no secret that Mike didn't like Jack. He'd always felt like something was up with this guy, but because he was Ali's boyfriend, he tolerated his existence. But now that he was lying to her. \"Do you think that people that cheated before will cheat again? Or do you think that once they find the person they're meant to be with, they settle down?\" Ali asked. Mike shook his head and opened one of the beers before passing it over to Ali. He then picked up another and opened it for himself. He took a healthy drink. \"I don't know. I would think that the person would probably always have that mindset. But I guess people can change ‚Äì but if they want to. Did Jack cheat on you before?\" Mike asked. \"I mean, you don't have to tell me that, but‚Ä¶\" \"He cheated with me. But he had told me that he'd broken things off with his fianc√© already. Nothing happened other than a little flirting until he told me that they'd broken up,\" Ali said. \"And then we'd gotten together. But apparently, they weren't really broken up until later. When Natalie came home from New York to find me sleeping with her fianc√© in her bed.\" \"Ooh,\" Mike flinched. \"That's rough.\" \"I thought that he'd changed, though. I really thought that it had been a fluke and that we'd wound up together for a reason,\" Ali replied. \"That just makes me stupid, doesn't it?\" \"Nah, it just makes you a romantic,\" Mike told her. \"Nothing wrong with that.\" Ali was silent for a minute. \"So, tell me about you, Mr. Magic,\" she said. \"When did you decide to start your own business? Did you always want to have your own? Or‚Ä¶I don't know.\" Mike nodded and stroked his thumb on Ali's side semi-inadvertently. She reciprocated by putting her head on his shoulder before drinking from her bottle of beer. \"I'm pretty sure I changed my mind about a dozen times growing up. I know I wanted to be a veterinarian and a paramedic for sure, but I'd gone through a zillion more thoughts‚Ä¶like you did‚Ä¶\" \"I never did that.\" \"Never did what?\" \"I always knew that I was going to have to do something with singing. My nana wasn't fond of the idea, but I always knew it was what I was going to do. I never wanted to do anything else. Then I spent most of my life until this point not doing anything involving singing,\" Ali said. \"Well, you're doing it now, so I feel like that counts for something,\" Mike said. \"I'd done all those jobs trying to decide what I wanted to do for a career. I knew I'd liked to be creative; building things. I'd designed and built a dollhouse for my little sister for a high school project and after that, I'd find random bits and pieces and you know‚Ä¶it just started from that.\" \"How did you end up as a‚Ä¶a‚Ä¶male entertainer?\" Ali said as she finished her first beer. \"Well, I'd moved away from home, as one does‚Ä¶\" \"Right.\" \"And I had taken all kinds of jobs. I'd been a waiter at several restaurants, an usher at a movie theater and was doing construction,\" Mike said as he opened another bottle and passed it along to Ali. \"And while the construction gigs paid okay, I'd met a few guys who had told me they were dancing on the side and they introduced me to my first boss. And while it had worked out pretty well there‚Ä¶\" \"I'm going to have to see these Magic Mike moves at some point‚Ä¶\" Ali interrupted. \"Maybe someday,\" he replied wistfully. \"Maybe?\" Ali said, bumping him slightly with her hip. Mike set his empty bottle down and he pulled another from the package and opened it. \"While I was working for Rome, I sort of got involved with her. And that didn't turn out so well. And, I ended up leaving her establishment and going into business with a guy named Dallas‚Ä¶\" \"Who are these people? Rome and Dallas?\" \"Do you want to hear my story?\" Mike asked, teasing her. \"Sorry,\" Ali apologized, but it was clear she wasn't all that sorry. \"I met Dallas and we hit it off ‚Äì he was leaving Rome's place to open his own in Tampa and I left to go with him. I worked construction during the day in Tampa and worked on routines in the evening. The club did all right but I was trying to make a go of my furniture business and then I met a girl‚Ä¶\" \"The plot thickens‚Ä¶\" Ali said mysteriously. \"Ha-ha,\" Mike laughed sarcastically. \"Brooke and I were together for almost three years. When we started seriously dating, it gave me the final push to get out of the entertainment business and work on my furniture full time. She was a nurse, so we had a steady income. We had a house. Things had fallen into place. I thought it had. But I proposed, she laughed, thought I was joking and then we broke up. She said she loved me but she just wasn't ready to get married. I thought we'd talk about it and get back together and she moved her stuff out and that was that.\" \"Wow. What a bitch,\" Ali said. Mike had genuine laughter for that comment. \"We had good times together. The ending did suck, though.\" \"You proposed and she thought you were joking? After three years together?\" Ali asked. \"That's effing harsh.\" \"At least I was able to win my friends back. They became my family after working with them so long. And when I left the club, partially because of my business and partially because of Brooke, they all gradually stopped calling. But right before I moved here, we went on one last final road trip and went to the convention in Myrtle Beach.\" \"Convention? Oh, the stripper convention! Nikki keeps trying to get us to go each year, but Tess won't pay to fly us out there and she said that because technically we aren't strippers, they won't count us as performers there,\" Ali said. \"We actually almost went to this last one on our own,\" Ali said. \"I could have seen you in action.\" \"You should slow down on the alcohol, there,\" he said. \"Hey! I've only had half of this bottle, for your information,\" Ali asserted to him. \"What's the worst thing a woman has whispered to you while you were performing?\" Ali asked. \"What?\" Mike laughed. \"No.\" \"No, I want to know,\" Ali said. \"I'm sure women have said all kinds of things to you while you were doing your thing.\" \"You really want to know?\" Mike asked. \"Uh, yeah, I wouldn't have asked if I didn't really want to know,\" she said. \"Spill.\" \"I had one middle aged lady, while I was‚Ä¶giving her a lap dance‚Ä¶pull me in close to her lips and she whispered that I reminded her of her son,\" Mike cringed. \"And there was no irony in her voice what-so-ever.\" Ali squeezed her eyes shut. \"Ew. I mean, ew,\" she said. \"Really?\" \"Yup. I kind of prefer the women I dance that closely to lose their ability to speak, because of things like that,\" Mike smiled. \"You can make women lose the ability to speak with your dancing and you won't show me? That is so unfair,\" Ali pouted. \"You embarrassed? Or don't you think your moves can impress me?\" she asked. \"Sand isn't really a good showcase for what I can do, Ali,\" he said in a low and serious voice. \"Ali, I really like you. And I'm not saying that right now to confuse things for you. I say this and I mean it, I am not going to push for you to make a decision about Jack. I will support whatever you decide; even if that means backing off. I'll take you as a friend in my life if that's how you can stay here,\" Mike explained. She turned her head away from the water and met his eyes looking down into hers. \"My gut says he's cheating. If I confront him and he isn't, I'm a bitch. If I ignore my gut, pretending nothing is wrong, then I'm na√Øve. And then I end up stuck in a ticking time bomb of a relationship,\" Ali said. \"It kind of sounds like you've already made your choice,\" Mike said to her, his lips almost touching hers. \"Maybe I have.\" To Be Continued‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ Author's note: Thank you all so much for reading my story! Please let me know what you think if you can! I'd love to have opinions! You're all awesome! I'll try to get the next chapter posted ASAP! Thanks! -thomthom[Chapter 5] Chapter Five Mike and Ali drove down the dark roads in silence. It was after two in the morning and the streets were mostly deserted. Ali would have been content to stay on the beach all night, if not for the fact that they would likely have been kicked off for trespassing. They were within a block of their apartment building when Ali final spoke. \"I want to thank you, Mike,\" Ali said. \"You don't have to thank me for anything, Ali.\" \"I just‚Ä¶I have felt more like myself with you than I have in the last several months with Jack,\" Ali said. \"Well, I'm glad to hear that,\" Mike said. \"You know you're great, right, Ali?\" Mike parked the truck in the parking lot and they spotted Jack's motorcycle in its parking spot across the lot. Mike turned to look at her after turning off the engine. \"You do what you need to do, Ali. I know I've only known you for a short time, but I feel a connection to you, and whatever you decide to do with Jack‚Ä¶I'm going to support you. I'm always going to be there for you.\" A single tear formed in the corner of Ali's eye; this was the nicest thing she'd been told in a very long time. \"Thank you,\" Ali sniffed. She was determined not to cry. \"I just put this off for too long. It's been time for months and months.\" They left the truck and Mike walked Ali down the hall to their respective apartments. He was reluctant to let her go inside; he didn't want to let her go right now, or ever. But in reality, Mike knew he needed to let Ali fight this battle; even if he didn't want her to have to, even if it wasn't really a 'battle'. Ali turned to put her key in the lock, but Mike reached out and stopped her. \"Are you sure you're going to be all right?\" he asked her. Ali nodded. \"I'll be fine. I mean, it's not going to be fun, but‚Ä¶\" \"I know,\" Mike said. \"I know. Well, I'm just across the hall if you need me.\" He squeezed her hand. \"Thank you.\" \"You go get some sleep, Ali. Text me if you need anything,\" he said. She nodded and fought the urge to follow the man into the other apartment. She would have preferred to just stay with Mike; even though she really needed to end things with Jack first. She had to end things. She needed to be herself again. Jack was under a blanket on the couch when Ali quietly stepped into the apartment she shared with him. The only light was from the TV and Jack's phone and that was gone as soon as Jack finished texting. \"You're home awfully late,\" Jack commented. \"Yup,\" Ali replied as she moved to the kitchen. She flipped on the light that was over the sink and waited a moment for her eyes to adjust. She turned on the tap and let the cold water run for a second before filling a glass and taking a healthy drink. Jack sat up and watched her. \"Where were you?\" \"Late night at the beach,\" Ali said. \"Where were you tonight?\" she asked in a light tone. Jack looked at her. \"Home. Sick. You know that, Ali.\" \"No. No, I don't, Jack,\" Ali said before finishing her water and putting the glass in the sink. \"I don't believe I saw you here when I stopped home to change tonight,\" Ali said. \"But for some reason, you told me you were here. On the couch. I wonder why that is, Jack‚Ä¶\" \"Ali, we should talk.\" \"I think that's an understatement.\" \"I think you and I‚Ä¶we need some time apart,\" he said. \"You're so busy all the time and you are always being ogled by the dudes that come in to the club. And you've changed. You aren't the same Ali that I fell in love with.\" Ali let out a small chuckle. \"Oh, you've got to be kidding me. You're breaking up with me? Oh, no‚Ä¶\" \"I don't think it was good for us to live together so soon into the relationship and‚Ä¶\" Ali held up a hand. \"No‚Ä¶\" \"I need you to move out, Ali. I need space. We can't break up and both live here and besides‚Ä¶I'm the one on the lease.\" \"The lease that I've been paying for,\" Ali announced. \"Jack, you can't be serious.\" Jack's face was screwed up in sadness and tears were brimming in his eyes. \"I wish it were different, Ali. But‚Ä¶we need a break. I need a break...from you.\" \"Newsflash: I changed for you . I work all the time because you keep spending the money on shit you don't need. Oh‚Ä¶I've been keeping the roof over your head and paying for health insurance so you don't go into bankruptcy for the musical equipment you needed . Which, why haven't you written anything in months? Oh, yeah, it's because you sold the keyboard you bought for weed. I'm not stupid, Jack. I just thought if I turned a blind eye towards it, if I just made it work, things would end up okay. I thought you'd get through your phase and things would go back to the way they were. But I just ended up resenting you more and more each day.\" Jack's phone chimed; announcing that he had received a text message. Who was texting him at three in the morning? He started down at it and his face went pale. \"We weren't perfect, Jack. But it was both our faults. Not just mine,\" Ali said. She gave the man one last look before going into the bedroom to pack her things. Ali had always been hesitant to lay down roots anywhere and this time, it finally paid off. She had packed all of her essentials in ten minutes. Ali could come back in the daylight hours when Jack was gone so she could pick up everything else. \"You don't have to leave tonight, Ali. It's the middle of the night,\" Jack said. \"I'm not tossing you out into the night.\" \"I am getting the hell out of here,\" Ali told him. \"I wanted to get out ages ago, but couldn't bring myself to leave you. I was afraid I was throwing something really good away. I'm glad to know that I've just proved myself wrong.\" \"Where will you go?\" he asked in a small voice. \"Why the hell do you care?\" Ali replied. \"Who were you out with tonight?\" Jack said as Ali moved towards the door. \"It doesn't matter,\" Ali said. \"You can go to hell, Jack.\" Jack turned red with anger now. \"You were out with Mike, right? I've heard about all the time you've spent with him. And Tess sold him the building. Be honest with me, Ali. Have you been screwing him? You get involved with him because you think you'll have a nice little life with him? You're wrong, Ali. He'll use you and move on.\" \"I think you might be assuming too much there, Jack,\" Ali said, turning the door knob. \"I'm pretty sure the only person who used me was you.\" Ali opened the door all the way and heard the door across the hall open. Mike was joining her a second later. \"Seriously, dude? Can't you mind your own damn business? Even for like, five minutes?\" Jack said angrily. \"I'm making this my business because I do not like the way you've treated Ali,\" Mike said. \"Mike,\" Ali said in a weak attempt to stop him from going further. \"It is so not worth this. He's so not worth it.\" Jack's phone started to ring in his hand and it startled Jack, causing him to drop the phone. Ali got to it first. \"Who is Vanessa?\" Ali asked calmly as she read the display and saw the picture of a redhead pouting sexily into the camera. She didn't answer the phone; she simply handed the phone back to Jack. \"Ali‚Ä¶\" Jack started. \"Who is she, Jack?\" Ali asked. \"I don't want to be this kind of person; don't make me be this kind of person.\" She felt Mike's arm at her back; offering silent support while Ali waited for Jack's explanation. \"She‚Ä¶Vanessa is‚Ä¶I've been‚Ä¶\" Jack stuttered. \"You've been sleeping with her,\" Ali said. \"Can we do this without him?\" Jack angrily looked to Mike. \"You really have nothing to do with this, man,\" he said. \"I'll go if Ali wants me to leave, but only if she says. I don't give a shit what you want,\" Mike said. Ali shook her head. She was trying to decide how this much drama entered her life. She's had her fair-share of dramatic moments in life, but this was melodramatic. This was stupid. This was bordering on the asinine. \"Ali‚Ä¶seriously. I just want to talk with you alone. I need to explain some things to you,\" Jack said. \"Alone?\" \"No,\" Ali said. \"Tell me what you have to say, right here, right now. I don't want Mike to leave. I want someone else to hear how much of an asshole you are,\" Ali told Jack. Mike's hand on Ali's back moved down to encircle her waist. She knew she didn't need Mike, but it was nice that someone had her back; literally and figuratively. \"So‚Ä¶how long have you been sleeping with this Vanessa person?\" Ali asked. Jack closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose, as though he had a headache. In fact, the tears had started again. \"Ali, I'm so sorry,\" he said. \"The first time‚Ä¶it was a stupid, drunken mistake.\" \"How long ago?\" \"Three months or so,\" Jack told her. \"I originally told her that it couldn't go anywhere and it was just a mistake. But‚Ä¶something kept pulling us together. I ran into her at a party that I went to with a few of the guys again and‚Ä¶\" \"And we've been getting together ever since. She's my girlfriend,\" Ali said. She resisted the urge to reach out and slap him across the face. Until a few hours ago, when she really stopped to think about it, she thought she was the girlfriend. Apparently, she was wrong. \"Have you brought her here? Does she know about me?\" Ali asked. \"She thought we'd broken up,\" Jack said quietly. Mike laughed under his breath and shook his head. He'd been in enough shit in his past to know that by his age, Jack should know better. But clearly, he'd missed this lesson when it came to life. \"Are you ready to go?\" Mike asked. \"Sure, Ali, just go revenge-screw the guy across the hall,\" Jack said. \"Classy.\" This time Ali didn't hold back. She brought her hand up and connected with Jack's cheek. Her hand stung instantly, but before she could nurse it, Jack slapped her back. Ali recoiled, luckily supported by Mike. Ali's free hand moved to her face while Mike released her and went after Jack. \"Why don't you pick on someone your own size, Jack?\" Mike asked. But before Mike could swing at Jack, Ali had swung again and clocked Jack hard enough that she sent him reeling backwards. He fell to the floor of the apartment, out cold. \"Damn,\" Mike hissed. \"Where'd you learn to hit like that?\" Ali stared blankly at him for a second. It was instantly clear to Mike that she was in some kind of shock. \"Come on, Ali,\" Mike said. \"Do you have everything you need for a few days?\" he asked her. Ali was still trying to process everything that had just taken place in the last five minutes. When she didn't respond, Mike said her name again. \"Ali?\" he said. \"Do you need anything else while we're here now?\" Ali shook her head. \"I only have a few decorative pieces left around the apartment, a few blankets, those kinds of things,\" Ali explained. \"Everything else is his.\" \"Come on, then,\" Mike said. \"Let's get out of here.\" \"I will call Sean; I'm sure he won't mind me staying with him for a few days until I find a place of my own,\" Ali said. \"I'll call a cab.\" Mike led Ali out into the hallway and closed the door behind them. \"Let me just grab some things and put them in a bag,\" Mike said as he pulled her into his apartment. Ali stood nervously while Mike packed a duffel bag for himself. \"How are you doing over there?\" Mike asked while he finished putting his things in a bag. \"Oh, I'm trying not to hyperventilate.\" Mike walked over to Ali and put his hands on her upper arms. \"You were amazing,\" Mike told her. \"You did terrific.\" \"What if he calls the police?\" Ali said. \"What if he tries to press charges?\" Mike grinned his cocky smile. \"I don't think you're going to have to worry about that. No offense, but I really don't think he stands to gain anything by telling a cop you punched him other than embarrassment. Even if he did, I'm a witness. It was self-defense, Ali. How is your hand and cheek?\" he asked her. \"Sore,\" Ali said. \"Am I bruising?\" she turned her face towards the light so Mike could see. Mike took a step back to look at the affected area. \"A little,\" Mike said. \"We'll get you some ice when we get checked in at the hotel,\" he said. \"Hotel?\" Ali asked. \"You deserve a stay at a nice hotel, Ali, especially after tonight. I'd have you stay here, but since it's just across the hall from Jack, I don't think it's necessarily a good idea,\" Mike said. Ali took a deep breath. \"Okay, okay,\" Ali said. \"I am so sorry I dragged you into this, Mike. You've been nothing but kind to me and this now‚Ä¶\" He stopped her by closing the space between them once more, put his hands on her waist and pulled her to him in a kiss. \"Everything is going to seem a lot better after a good night's sleep,\" Mike said to her. \"I hope you don't mind that I just did that.\" Ali shook her head. \"Nope,\" Ali simply said. \"Nope.\" Things just got way more confusing for Ali, but that confusion wasn't entirely unpleasant. She just hoped she didn't regret everything in the morning. ‚Ä¶ Author's note: oh man! So much drama! Hopefully I've still got your interest. I'm sorry it has taken me so long to get this posted. I've started this chapter about six times and this is finally where I decided to go. Ali definitely isn't a wilting flower that needs to be rescued totally‚Ä¶haha. Anyway, please let me know what you thought! And I will try to get the next chapter up sooner than this one was done. (Real life gets in the way ‚Äì for some reason bosses expect you to work while you're at work‚Ä¶haha) Thanks everyone![Chapter 6] Bringing the Magic Chapter Six Mike laid awake on the couch in the suite that he and Ali had found for the night. It was now seven-thirty in the morning and he could hear Ali's soft breathing from the other side of the room. Last night certainly had taken a turn to the almost-absurd. Mike could hardly believe that someone would even consider cheating on Ali, let alone actually do it. Ali was definitely an upgrade for Jack, for sure. Maybe he was biased because of his own feelings for her but Mike definitely thought Jack was crazy. He also couldn't believe that Ali had clocked him. Actually, not only had she socked him good, Ali had knocked the asshole out cold. Mike couldn't imagine a better climax to the evening. Well, maybe he could‚Ä¶ The two of them were now staying in a suite ‚Äì Ali insisted on putting her credit card on file ‚Äì and resting up from the night's events. Mike had gotten her a couple shots of whiskey and an icepack; she'd quit worrying and fell fast asleep. He'd fallen into an uneasy sleep and was now awake again. Mike knew rushing her into a new relationship was a bad idea. But he didn't want to lose his chance. He chuckled to himself as he lay there. He hadn't even been like this with Brooke. Although, he had always felt a deep need to help people. And Ali was certainly people. He just also found himself attracted to her on a majorly deep level. Ali had told him it was silly for him to sleep on the couch, but he insisted. He knew anything that happened tonight would be caused by adrenaline and would be a major mistake. He needed to figure out what he was going to do now. Mike lived across the hall from the ass-hat. It was fine and dandy that Ali could go somewhere else. He, on the other hand, had signed a 12-month lease that he was only two months into. He figured he would break it ‚Äì although it would likely cost a bundle. And with the grand expense that was the building bought along with all the renovations he needed to do and permits he had to get ‚Äì now was the worst time to need to pay to get out of a lease. Mike's next thoughts turned to Ali and her job. What was she going to do? She would have to deal with Jack every day. He shook his head. He suspected that Ali's boss, Tess, would probably get rid of Jack. Ali was the club's key to success and an unhappy Ali would be bad for business. Mike turned on his side again. He needed to get some sleep. He knew that the following day was likely to be even longer than the last. He listened to the rhythmic sound of Ali's breathing and slowly, he also drifted off to sleep. Ali awoke with a start and had a minor freak out. She was in an unfamiliar bed in an unfamiliar room. She turned when she looked over and someone was asleep on the couch. Ali strained in the semi-darkness and realized that it was Mike. She let out a sigh of relief. Ali climbed out of the bed and headed to the bathroom. As she stood in the mirror, she looked herself in the mirror. The bruise had begun to blossom under her eye and cheek. She touched it gently and winced. Ali wondered how she was going to cover that for the shows. And in reality, she wondered how she was going to go back to the Burlesque Lounge. Jack was always going to be at work with her. And Jack would always be the reason she'd ever even had a chance to work there. Ali groaned. Her face hurt, her hand hurt and her heart hurt. She lucked out because she had Mike. Mike had come into her life at the exact time she needed him. She would have eventually ended things with Jack on her own, but seeing it all from another perspective allowed her to push herself forward much faster. Truthfully, Ali was a tad surprised Jack had another girlfriend. He was good-looking, sure. And charming. Very charming. But that's where the good qualities ended. She knew Jack had no money ‚Äì not that it was a necessity ‚Äì but Ali paid for everything. And Jack had no ambition anymore. It had been ages since he'd written any music. And he wasn't doing anything else either. Ali's mind returned to Mike. He was not the reason that things ended with Jack, but damn if she didn't want something to happen with him. But starting something with him now would just make it end in disappointment. She finished in the bathroom and retreated out into the living space. Mike was sitting up on the couch, shirtless, reading his phone. \"Good morning,' Ali said. She was wearing a simple tank top and leggings while it looked like Mike slept only in his boxers. Last she remembered, he was fully clothed. \"Morning,\" He replied to her. \"How are you feeling today?\" Mike asked. \"Can I take a quick look at your eye?\" Ali moved across the room and sat next to Mike on the couch. Mike turned on the light and looked at Ali's cheek. It was a light shade of blue-purple. \"We should get some more ice on that,\" Mike said. \"Does it hurt much?\" \"My hand hurts worse than my cheek does,\" Ali said. She held out her knuckles and Mike inspected it. \"Can you make a fist?\" Mike asked. She made a fist a couple of times. \"Looks like my 'little slugger' is going to be okay. If anything was broken you'd be screaming obscenities each time you did that,\" he smiled. Ali nodded. \"Thank you so much for helping me, Mike.\" \"Shit, Ali. You did just fine on your own. I was more‚Ä¶\" \"Just take the gratitude, Mike,\" she smiled. \"I know you‚Ä¶well, I'm going to do whatever I can to help you because of the apartment situation that I've now caused. I don't know what Jack will do; if he'll move out or move this girl in‚Ä¶and you're in your lease‚Ä¶\" \"Take a deep breath,\" Mike said. \"I don't care about that. I'm not worried about Jack. Now that you're not dating him, he means literally nothing to me. I don't want to rush you into anything, but hell‚Ä¶\" Ali leaned in and kissed him. It wasn't some big, drawn-out kiss, just a simple one. But it was perfect. And perfectly timed. \"It's not even been 12 hours, so I don't want to jump in, but I really like you, Mike.\" ‚Ä¶ Mike and Ali had breakfast together and Ali stayed at the hotel. She was going to live there for a while, at least a few days, until she found something more permanent. She was worried about Mike going back to his apartment, but he insisted that he would be fine. He knew Jack would be smart enough not to bother him. And since he and Ali were broken up, they had no reason to communicate further. Ali would work out some time to pick up the last of her things ‚Äì some shoes, blankets and towels ‚Äì whenever she could. Nothing she'd left behind was going to be missed if Jack tossed it. But she didn't figure he would do that ‚Äì not after she'd punched him in the face. She got ready, carefully applying make up to cover her bruised face. She knew Tess was not going to take kindly to the fact that Jack had smacked her. And she had every intention of telling her boss what had happened. She just hoped Tess wouldn't go crazy. Ali walked the short few blocks from the hotel to the club. Luckily, Ali knew the night manager and she was very sympathetic. She got Ali and Mike their room quickly and discreetly. It was eleven AM and Tess' car was in the parking lot as well as Sean's. Ali was hoping no one else was around, though. Everything was quiet and dark inside the club as Ali walked in. But Ali heard Sean and Tess' voices carrying. Ali followed the sounds and joined them. \"Well, good morning, Ali-cat,\" Sean said with a smile. But his smile fell when he saw Ali's returning smile. \"What's wrong, Ali?\" he asked. Ali waved her hand. \"What? Nothing,\" she lied. \"Yeah?\" Tess said, walking towards Ali. She turned Ali's face towards the light. \"This bruise is nothing?\" \"And your knuckles,\" Sean said, picking up her hand. \"Um, Jack and I broke up last night,\" Ali said. \"He's been cheating on me for a while. And I needed to end things a long time before. We both broke up with each other, I think.\" \"And he hit you?\" \"I slapped him. He slapped me back. I punched him in the face and knocked him out,\" Ali explained. Tess hugged her. \"That's my girl. Are you okay?\" \"I'm fine,\" Ali said. \"All I have left to move out are some random things. Mike‚Ä¶\" \"Mike,\" Sean said. \"Mike was involved?\" \"He ended up helping me. But‚Ä¶\" \"Where did you stay last night?\" Tess asked. \"Mike lives just across the hall from your apartment, doesn't he?\" \"Yes, he does. We stayed at a hotel. I'm staying there still and‚Ä¶\" Ali trailed off. \"You can stay with me if you need. Hotels‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶you can stay with me,\" Sean said. \"Sean, I'm fine. But thank you.\" \"So did you and Mike‚Ä¶?\" Sean asked. \"No!\" Ali laughed nervously as she thought back to the short make out she had with him before he left her for the day. \"We think we might start seeing each other, but nothing serious happened. I don't want to rush into anything. I just can't believe that Jack has been cheating on me. How long had you both suspected?\" Ali asked. \"It was all rumors. None of us had actually seen anything incriminating,\" Tess said. \"Well, nothing that indicated that he was actually cheating on you. And as much as I would like to live your life for you‚Ä¶I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to tolerate that shit, Ali. He's done here.\" \"You can't fire him for cheating on me, Tess,\" Ali said. \"I can do whatever the hell I want; I own the joint,\" Tess said. \"Sean, he's done. Start the schedule again; shift Gary up to head bartender. And when Jack comes in, I need to speak with him.\" Tess wasn't going to get into it with Ali, but she had a ton of documented incidents on Jack and she had been putting of his termination of employment for far too long. She would buy the rights to the songs he'd written for the club and for Ali and then he'd be out on his ass. She was not going to tolerate him pulling all this shit anymore. \"So‚Ä¶where are you going to live?\" \"The hotel for a bit. Until I can find someplace else. I don't have any of my own furniture anyway. I have some savings, though. I just want to find something of my own,' Ali said. \"You just let us know if we can help with anything,\" Sean said. He patted her on the hand and left the room. \"You know, Ali, you might have not had your mom to raise you, but it seems like she raised you well, anyway. I'm glad you're not tolerating this bull shit. \"Me, too,\" Ali sad. \"Me, too.\" TO Be CONTINUED‚Ä¶ Author's note: let me know what you thought![Chapter 7] Bringing the Magic Chapter Seven It had been six weeks (four days and 19 hours) since Ali and Jack had broken up. She'd sort of started seeing Mike, but he'd been pretty busy working on the renovations of his building. The two texted often, and even though their jobs were in close proximity to one another, the hours were considerably different. True to her word, which Tess always was, she'd fired Jack and had bought the rights to the few songs that he'd written. And since then, no one had seen Jack except Mike. Mike told Ali that Jack had been moving out about a week after the break up. A few days after that, a box of Ali's things, all the things she'd left behind, were left in a box by Mike's door. And now, Dave had written a couple of new songs for Ali and the other ladies and a whole new show was going to be performed. Starting tonight. Ali was sitting in the mirror next to Jessie and the two of them were trying to make themselves up to look as identical as possible. \"We should wear a mask or something, maybe?\" Jessie laughed. \"And I'm going to need to stuff my bra.\" \"Nah,\" Ali said, waving the idea of. The two women compared each other's bodies, side by side. For all intents and purposes, they already looked a lot alike. \"Ali!\" Nikki called as she came into the mirror with them. She'd become slightly nicer, and had quit drinking, but she still liked gloating when it came to Ali. \"Hello, Nikki,\" Ali said to the dark haired woman. \"What can I do for you this evening?\" \"You will never guess who I saw today,\" Nikki smiled evilly. Ali sighed and added more mascara to her already very dark lashes. \"Why don't you just tell me?\" she said. \"I saw Mister Jack, aka your ex-boyfriend. And he was buying diapers and bottles.\" Ali spun around in her chair to look Nikki in the eye. \"What?!\" All of the ladies huddled around Nikki. Ali worked to remove her shocked expression. \"Jack was at the store‚Ä¶he tried to avoid me but I followed him. Whoever he cheated on you with ‚Äì she's eight months pregnant! She waddled up to me with this attitude, and‚Ä¶and I shit you not‚Ä¶a Big Gulp and these ridiculous pig-tails. You and I might not be the bestest friends, Ali-cakes, but Jack seriously downgraded with this one,\" Nikki said in her typically bitchy tone. \"Eight months pregnant?\" Ali repeated. She was dumbfounded. That meant he'd been cheating on her a lot longer than she'd thought. \"Wow.\" \"Ladies!\" Sean said as he came upstairs into the dressing room. \"You're all needed for the show downstairs,\" Sean told them. \"Or have you all forgotten?\" \"Sorry, Sean,\" Georgia said. \"We were getting some gossip.\" \"Gossip later, ladies. Dancing now. You, Nikki, go get into your costume.\" \"Oh, chillax, Sean!\" Nikki said. Nikki brushed past Sean and headed to her own vanity table. All of the other ladies moved to their tables before moving down the stairs. Everyone except Ali. \"Are you not performing tonight, dear?\" Sean said into the mirror and Ali's reflection. \"Because I was informed you have a sold out crowd again tonight,\" Sean explained to her. Ali powdered her nose again. \"Nikki ran into Jack tonight,\" Ali said non-chalantly. \"And we don't care about Jack anymore, so‚Ä¶\" Sean trailed off. \"He got the what's her face pregnant,\" Ali said. \"She looks like Shrek!\" Nikki called from behind the dressing screen. \"Thanks, Nikki,\" Ali called back to her the woman. \"That might be the nicest thing she's ever said to me,\" Ali told Sean. \"That's terrific, but you have to be on stage in forty seconds, so‚Ä¶\" Sean got her to her feet. \"Let's hustle, my love.\" Ali went through the motions on stage, but her mind was definitely elsewhere. She wanted to focus on doing her best, but she couldn't believe how dumb she'd been. And then, between songs, for a costume change, she found flowers waiting for her backstage. She smiled because she figured they were from Mike. She didn't have time to open the card, she just went on stage with a smile because thoughts of Jack had been pushed from her mind. \"Ooh‚Ä¶pretty flowers,\" Georgia said as she stepped of stage a while later. \"Who are they from, Ali? Mike?\" \"Um, duh,\" Ali replied with a smile. She finally had the time to open the small card and read the message. But it wasn't Mike's semi-neatly printed handwriting on the note and it definitely wasn't his name signed at the bottom. \"So‚Ä¶?\" Jessie said. \"Mike, right?\" she asked. \"What romantic thing did he write?\" Ali smiled and pushed the lump in her throat down. \"He just said that he can't wait to see me. It's been a couple of days since our schedules have worked out for a date night.\" The women around her generated a collective \"aww\". However, Ali was lying. The card and flowers were from Marcus Gerber. And the card said he'd heard she and Jack had broken up and he wanted to meet up with her after work tonight. ‚Ä¶ Mike was flipping channels on his TV. It was eleven-thirty, he couldn't sleep and he was bored as hell. Ali was working and as much as he enjoyed watching her perform, he liked having her attention all to himself (even though that was totally selfish). His phone chimed and he reached for it without looking over. The text was from Ali. And she was asking him to stay over at her place tonight. Their relationship, so far, hadn't escalated past a few very long make out sessions where a few articles of clothing had been displaced. And in the time they'd been officially dating, they had not stayed over at each other's places in an attempt to keep the relationship moving at a semi-slow pace. So, he couldn't help but wonder what had changed. But he wasn't going to say no. He knew he had to get up early, but something about Ali's message made him wonder. He got himself up off of the couch and packed a bag before leaving to pick Ali up from the club. ‚Ä¶ Ali dawdled as the other girls packed up for the night. She'd texted Mike for a ride home and she wanted him to stay with her for the night. She wanted nothing to do with Marcus and she was hoping that she could get home safely this way. Ali didn't know how Marcus knew that Jack and she had broken up and she didn't want to talk to him to find out. Ali had no need for Marcus in her life. And honestly, she figured that he'd be done with her after everything that had gone down with them, she figured he'd be out of her life for good. Mike texted her a few minutes later and she cautiously exited the building. Mike was just across the parking lot and he smiled at her when she was in sight. She looked both ways again and she didn't see Marcus, so she took a step. She was literally only two feet from the building when she heard his voice. It made her skin crawl. Ali thought at first he was just a confused rich guy. Turns out, he was kind of crazy. \"Ali, Ali, Ali‚Ä¶\" he said. \"Still wasting your time in this ridiculous little club,\" Marcus told her. \"What do you want, Marcus?\" \"You know, you really shouldn't be so hostile, Ali. You screwed me out of the deal,\" Marcus said. \"Why are you wasting your time here? You must get some sick pleasure of me turning you down over and over.\" Mike was getting out of the truck and he moved to Ali's side, kissing her on the temple and putting a protective arm around her shoulders. \"Hi, I'm Mike,\" he said, extending his free hand. Marcus grinned evilly. \"Marcus Gerber,\" he said as he shook Mike's hand. \"Oh‚Ä¶this is Marcus. He's shorter than I figured he'd be,\" Mike said. \"You talk about me, Ali? I'm flattered.\" \"Oh, you really shouldn't be. She just told me you used her. Tried to send all kinds of gifts to get close to her so you could buy out the club she loves and destroy it.\" \"I just always assumed it was because he had a small penis,\" Ali said. Marcus looked slightly miffed on Ali's insult. \"You think Nikki didn't tell everyone about you when you dropped her? Believe me‚Ä¶she told all of us. There were even visual representations.\" \"You know she was just pissed‚Ä¶\" \"I mean, no, I personally don't know,\" Ali said. \"So‚Ä¶was she just pissed?\" \"Listen‚Ä¶this has been totally awesome getting to meet you, man, but I'm going to take my girlfriend home now.\" \"Thanks for the flowers, Marcus. They were pretty, but they made me sneeze, so I had to throw them out,\" Ali said. \"Ali, why don't you go get in the truck?\" Mike said as he handed her the keys without breaking eye contact with Marcus. Ali had been totally open about the whole Marcus Gerber plot. And Mike knew that the way he was looking at Ali was more than just revenge‚Ä¶the desire for her was still there. Ali didn't say a word. She silently took the keys and headed to the car. \"Now, what could you possibly need to say to me without Ali?\" Marcus asked Mike. \"You've got this whole villain thing locked down, for real, but's more Disney villain than, like, actually scary. So quit sending her flowers. Don't be waiting for her in the parking lot outside of work‚Ä¶or anywhere else for that matter. Do not contact her in anyway. Just leave her the hell alone.\" \"Or what? And you should be careful what you say‚Ä¶a lot of charges can be brought just because of threats. And I have connections.\" \"I don't need an or what , Mr. Gerber. You're just done with trying to get with or get even with Ali. Go spend your time and money elsewhere. You can only treat someone like a prize or a whore for so long.\" \"I feel like I should tell her you said that about her. I don't think she'd been too thrilled to hear you say that.\" \"Isn't that what she wrote in the note she sent you? When she shipped the shoes and necklace back to you? That's right, buddy, I know a lot about you. And I'm a hell of a lot smarter than Jack, the dipshit. Ali is better than this‚Ä¶better than you. Leave her alone.\" Mike turned on his heel to walk away and Marcus grabbed elbow. Mike stopped and kept his tone even. \"You don't want to touch me, man. I promise that.\" Marcus stepped back and Mike continued to the truck where he got in. Ali kissed him on the cheek and the two of them drove away, leaving a quietly brooding Marcus in the parking lot. ‚Ä¶ To Be Continued‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ Author's note: thanks for the hits! I'm so happy people are actually reading this! I'm having a fun time writing it, even if real life keeps getting in the way! Let me know what you thought of this chapter too![Chapter 8] Bringing the Magic Chapter Eight \"‚Ä¶the main service counter will be here,\" he told her. \"And now, I'll have a desk over here. I'm thinking something built in over here,\" Mike told her. Mike was pleased to show Ali the progress that had come about in the last few days. The whole area had been cleared out and now it was a big open space. \"It's going to be amazing, Mike,\" Ali said before kissing him. \"Are you going to be able to stop by and do that every day?\" Mike smiled as he held Ali to him by putting his hands around her waist. \"You know I'll be here as often as I can,\" Ali smiled. \"And if you need an assistant‚Ä¶\" she trailed off. \"You have a job, don't you? Or am I mistaken?\" Mike asked. \"Well, a change is as good as a rest, I've heard,\" Ali said. \"I'm thinking I might need to avoid anything that could bring Marcus around anymore. Besides, I'd make a really great assistant.\" Mike's smile changed to a frown in an instant. \"He hasn't come around again, has he?\" Mike said. It had been three weeks since the run-in with Marcus Gerber in the parking lot. So far, she hadn't seen or heard from him again and she liked it that way very much. She shook her head. \"No, I haven't see him.\" Mike had been spending a lot of time at Ali's place, but it had been a couple of days now since they'd had any time together. \"By the way, have I thanked you today for being so amazing?\" Ali asked him. \"I'm just glad you told me about him, Ali. And you really don't have to thank me.\" \"I thought I came with a lot of baggage‚Ä¶and I clearly underestimated the amount,\" Ali said. \"Believe me‚Ä¶this is nothing.\" Ali winked. \"If you're coming over tonight, I'll thank you again‚Ä¶\" she said with a smile. Things had kind of rapidly progressed in terms of their relationship. \"And seriously, if this all gets to be too much‚Ä¶I would totally understand if you wanted out, Mike. First Jack and all that nonsense. And now Marcus coming around,\" Ali said. Mike shook his head and laughed. \"Has anyone every told you that you think too much?\" His smile was genuine; she knew he didn't mean that in a rude way. \"No. I think people go‚Ä¶ dumb blond ‚Ä¶and write me off as just that.\" \"They definitely shouldn't make that mistake.\" In a split instant, Mike had her back in his arms, close to him. He dipped her without warning and brought her back up before sending her out into a spin. She turned and came back to him. \"You always tease me with these damn dance moves, but I have yet to have gotten the full Magic Mike show .\" \"Believe me, baby, you've gotten the full show and then some. Just Mike, though,\" he said in a low, quiet voice. Ali's face heated in a dark blush. There was an intense silence for a couple beats before Ali looked up at him through her eyelashes. \"I don't know‚Ä¶it's always felt pretty damn magical.\" He furrowed his brows and looked at her seriously before they both broke out into laughter. \"That was‚Ä¶bad,\" Mike said. Ali nodded and laughed. \"I know! So bad.\" He kissed her again. \"Okay, I have to get over next door,\" Ali said. They dawdled a bit longer, kissed a bit longer and eventually Ali forced herself to leave the building. Once Ali had left for work, Mike turned on his music and took advantage of his big open space to get to work on his newest custom piece. The order had come in two days ago and it was such a good idea that he'd wished he'd come up with it himself. However, this time he would just have to settle for being the builder. An hour later, Mike was full-on dancing while he worked on a piece of metal. Sparks were flying as he continued to work and followed the beat of the music. This continued on for several minutes before he turned and saw Ali. The blowtorch was off in an instant and he flipped up the mask he'd been wearing. He saw Ali ‚Äì in her full show make-up and hair ‚Äì with a huge smile while she applauded him. He noticed her bright red fingernails; those were new since he'd seen her last. \"How‚Ä¶how long were you standing there?\" he asked. Ali walked over to him while he pouted. She put her hands on his hips and looked up into his eyes. \"You don't have to be shy‚Ä¶\" She tickled him slightly and he finally broke a smile. \"You really ought to consider a career as a male entertainer, you know that?\" Ali joked. \"Oh, come on‚Ä¶\" Ali said as Mike's smile fell. \"You know you're amazing; you don't need me to tell you that.\" Her gaze shifted from her boyfriend's pouting face over to the project behind him. \"This is beautiful,\" she gushed as she walked over to it. The only time she'd seen this project was on the first day he pulled up the order on his computer. He'd gone and bought a whole pile of metal scraps and now it was put into place. It had become a beautiful, ornate castle bedframe. \"You don't‚Ä¶\" \"You do not have to be modest with me, Mike. This is beautiful. Really.\" \"I'm working on making all the points rounded and dulling the metal edges. This guy really loves his girl and she really loves princesses.\" \"His daughter will love this!\" \"I think it's his girlfriend‚Ä¶I think. Anyway ‚Äì I'm going to go a couple steps further and turn it into a canopy bed with a matching footboard.\" \"I've always wanted one of those,\" Ali said wistfully. \"So expensive, though.\" \"Tell me about it,\" Mike laughed. \"So‚Ä¶what do I owe your return to me? Not that I'm complaining‚Ä¶but I am slightly embarrassed.\" Ali walked over past him to a table where her purse had sat previously. A memory stick was on the ground. \"Music‚Ä¶\" Ali held it up. \"Well, background vocals in case Jessie really does have laryngitis.\" \"Damn.\" \"Yup. Must've ben fate though. I got to see you again.\" \"I really am spoiled,\" Mike said before leaning down to kiss Ali. \"What am I going to do without you?\" \"I'm thinking without me here, you'll continue to get a ton of work done,\" Ali laughed. In her hand, Ali's phone buzzed. She had a text. \"Sean. He's freaking out. I gotta get back. See you later!\" Ali called as she rushed towards the door. \"Break a leg tonight,\" Mike said. \"Love you!\" he called. His eyes went wide with surprise at what he'd just uttered. He said nothing else and just waited for Ali's response. Ali turned around to him and smiled. \"I love you, too!\" Ali smiled. \"I'll see you later!\" she called before running out of the building. Mike scratched his head while he walked to lock the doors. Did that really just happen? ‚Ä¶ Mike got back to work on his piece and tried not to focus on what had just happened. He continued working while he was in the zone and before he knew it, it was after midnight. His phone started to ring and without looking at the display, he answered. He figured it had to be Ali. \"Hey, baby,\" Mike said into the phone. \"Hi honey,\" Ken's voice replied. Mike chuckled. \"Hey, Ken.\" Mike put the tools down that he had in his other hands and leaned on a saw horse while he talked to Ken. \"Hey there, bud‚Ä¶should I ask who you thought I was?\" Ken said. Mike laughed. \"My girlfriend. What's up, dude?\" Mike asked. Ken proceeded to explain that he was headed out to California for an audition in the next few days, and he was hoping that he could crash at Mike's place out there. \"Of course you can stay with me,\" Mike told him. \"Thanks, man. This audition is kind of a big deal. Maybe I'll get it and we can be neighbors?\" Ken laughed. \"Have you talked to anyone else lately?\" Mike moved around the room and thought to himself. It had been a very long time since he'd talked to anyone. \"No, man. It's been a minute,\" he said. \"So you haven't heard that Tito's gonna be a dad!\" Ken said. \"No way! That's crazy. Who's the mom?\" \"Oh! Megan.\" \"They're still together?\" \"Yup,\" Ken replied. \"Twins. Girls, supposedly. \"Damn,\" Mike hissed. He couldn't help but smile into the phone. The thought of any of them from the group being a father was pretty hilarious, but it was good that Tito had this going for him. \"Well, I should get going. Thanks, man,\" Ken said to him. \"You're sure it's okay if I crash with you?\" \"Of course. I doubt Ali‚Ä¶\" \"Ali,\" Ken said. \"Ali.\" \"You'll like her. She's great.\" \"Are you guys living together? Am I going to be stepping on toes?\" Ken asked. Mike could tell he was smiling over the phone. \"We aren't officially living together; but we spend a lot of time together,\" Mike said. \"Okay,\" Ken said, laughing. \"I'll text you when the plane touches down and you can send me your address.\" \"Sounds like a plan, man,\" Mike said to his friend. Mike disconnected the call from his friend. He was happy he'd finally connected with one of them. Sure, Ken called him , but that didn't matter ‚Äì he missed the guys ‚Äì for some reason. Ken would be out here in two days. This was the first he'd told anyone back home about Ali and he felt a slight pang of guilt. But in reality, he hadn't been in communication much with the guys back home recently, so how could he have told them? He wasn't exactly the kind of guy to run the phone and gush about his love life. Mike's phone chimed in his hand. He had a Snapchat from Ali. He hated the app, but Ali used it often, so he kept it on his phone. He opened it and smiled. It was a video of her blowing him a kiss. She hashtagged it #magic. He laughed while he watched it. It would be another hour before Ali was done next door. He planned on picking her up as often as possible. He didn't trust that Marcus would stay away forever. The dude seemed too crazy and Mike assumed he'd try something again. He got to work again and before he knew it, it was time to meet Ali. He went through his routine of making sure equipment was off and unplugged and then checked to make sure all doors and windows were locked. Next door, all of the employees' vehicles were still in the lot, so he used his code (meaning: Ali's code) and let himself in the backstage door. Mike heard the laughter and cheering and he followed the sounds into the main area of the club. All the dancers, the musicians, wait staff as well as Tess and Sean, were still there. Tess was in the middle of the group and everyone had a champagne glass in their hands. Mike walked up behind Ali. \"What? I didn't get an invite?\" he asked her. \"Mike!\" Ali smiled. \"You're here! Come toast with us!\" Sean walked toward them and handed Mike one of the two champagne flutes he held in his hands. \"The ladies were doing shots upstairs, I discovered‚Ä¶\" Sean said in a mildly amused voice. \"We're just celebrating!\" Georgia said. \"Don't be mad, Sean.\" \"Some of them hold their liquor better than others,\" Sean told Mike. Ali was giggling and goofing off with Coco. Mike watched for a moment with Sean. \"It's nice to see her relaxed.\" \"It's been a rough few weeks, that's for certain,\" Sean said. \"So‚Ä¶what are we celebrating?\" Mike asked Sean. \"Jessie's getting married!\" Georgia said. \"Yay!\" she applauded. \"Wooo‚Ä¶\" Nikki added sarcastically. Ali joined Mike. \"We had shots to celebrate. I'm not sure why we all have champagne.\" He held his glass in one hand and tugged lightly so Ali would come towards him with his other. \"So‚Ä¶I've gathered you here‚Ä¶my family‚Ä¶\" Tess began. \"We are going to be doing some amazing renovations to the place. I was approved for my loan and the building inspector approved the plans, so this place is going to get a state of the art upgrade!\" The collected group cheered loudly. \"So‚Ä¶here's to us! Without you wonderful ladies and gentlemen, I would not be here right now.\" \"Cheers!\" Everyone shouted before drinking their champagne. \"Starting in a few weeks we'll be closed down ‚Äì a vacation for everyone ‚Äì while we have the new stage built, a new sound system will be installed and a whole new lighting set up‚Ä¶the whole shebang,\" Tess said. \"That's amazing, Tess!\" Coco said. All the ladies rushed in to hug their boss and mentor. The band members did the same. Ali was back next to Mike before she whispered to him quietly. \"You should tell them your secret.\" \"How many shots did you have?\" \"Two,\" Ali said clearly. \"I'm not drunk. Not even close. And you should tell them your secret.\" Mike chuckled. He knew what Ali was referring to. \"What secret? I don't keep secrets.\" \"You know‚Ä¶\" Ali smiled at him seductively. \"That I was a male entertainer? That's no secret, Ali. I put that shit on my resume,\" he laughed. All the eyes in the group turned to Mike. \"You're a stripper?\" Tess repeated. \"No way.\" \"Yes, way,\" Mike laughed. \"But ‚Äì former. Emphasis on the was .\" \"I need to see to believe,\" Tess replied. Mike shook his head. \"No, I'm afraid that I am retired from the male entertainment industry. But thank you,\" he laughed. Some girls booed their disappointment, some people just pouted and the rest just wandered away. Ali grinned wickedly. There was no way she was drunk; and she figured out a way to force him into dancing. \"You‚Ä¶\" he said in a mock-stern voice to Ali. \"You‚Ä¶sit.\" Ali did as she was told and took a seat in the chair directly behind her. Music blared unexpectedly and Mike set down his champagne glass. In an instant, he moved toward Ali, slowly, to the beat of the music. He did a couple slick turns and soon, his sweatshirt was gone. He dropped down to his knees and rose back up with Ali and the chair on his shoulders. There were hoots and hollers behind them, but he was totally focused on the woman in his arms. One quick move later, the chair was dropped to the ground. He flipped Ali twice and then gracefully set her on the ground He smiled down at her while she caught her breath. \"Well‚Ä¶that was the show‚Ä¶\" Mike told her. \"Wow,\" Ali smiled. The assembled audience clapped and shouted. Ali got Mike to take a small bow. \"Let's get out of here,\" Ali said in his ear. \"You got it,\" Mike returned her smile. ‚Ä¶ To be continued‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ Author's note: Thanks a zillion for the amount of love you've given this story so far. Hopefully, it's still keeping your interest! And hopefully, everyone has gotten a chance to re-watch Magic Mike XXL since it's been available. Anyway, please please please leave me some love in the form of a review (good or bad). And I'm working on the next chapter, hoping to have it up in the next day or so! Thanks all![Chapter 9] Bringing the Magic Chapter Nine Mike Lane was laying back on the couch, watching Ali frantically throw her various things that had been sitting around his apartment into her tote bag. He was smirking while he reclined. \"I don't know what you're stressing out about, Ali. It's not a big deal,\" he told her. \"Your friend, which you haven't seen in months, is coming all the way out here to see you and he's staying here. One: my shit is all over the place and two: I want him to like me. I really don't think that's too much to ask,\" Ali told him. There had been a lot on Mike's mind since Ken had first called and from then until half an hour ago when he had texted an ETA, he'd totally forgotten about his visit. Mike had then sprung the news of the visit on her and she'd started to freak out almost instantly. Mike continued to laugh at her anxiousness. \"I'm not sure what you think he won't like about you. You don't have anything to worry about, baby. Come here,\" he said, gesturing for her to come to him on the couch. \"Mike, I don't‚Ä¶\" \"Please?\" Mike mock-pouted. Ali sighed and straddled his lap on the couch. \"You have nothing to stress about with Ken. He's seriously one of the most chill guys you'll ever meet. I mean, he's like a healer or some shit. And, if for some weird and unexplainable reason he doesn't like you, I'll punch him in his idiot Ken-doll face.\" Ali thought on that for a moment and her eyes went wide when the idea bloomed in her head. \"Wait ‚Äì he didn't‚Ä¶\" Mike nodded. \"Oh, indeed he did. Had a box that he popped out of and everything. Women went wild.\" \"That's commitment.\" \"That's Dallas,\" Mike sighed. \"He sure loved his themes. And when he got an idea that he thought was a good one, he had to see it through.\" \"Is he still in Europe somewhere?\" Ali asked. \"He's probably in jail,\" Mike muttered. \"If he isn't, the Kid definitely is.\" Ali's phone chimed and she glanced down to read the display. \"Coco is here; I have to go.\" \"I'll bring Ken to the club tonight and we'll grab food before coming home. That way Ken can see your show,\" Mike said. \"He doesn't‚Ä¶\" Ali started to argue. \"Yes, he does,\" Mike said. \"What happened to my confident Ali?\" \" Confident Ali is taking a sick day. Insecure and anxious Ali is filling in for her,\" Ali replied. \"Well, Insecure Ali needs to take a chill-pill. Go to work. I'll see you tonight.\" \"I can get a ride home‚Ä¶you don't have to‚Ä¶\" \"You're staying with me like always, Ali. So Ken and I will come pick you up. We will see you later.\" ‚Ä¶ After Ali headed to work, Mike decided to close his eyes and take a nap. He'd worked all morning, and then had sex with Ali, and now he was tired. He was a couple hours into the nap when someone was banging on his apartment door. Mike groaned and forced himself off of the couch. He rubbed his eyes as he walked towards the door. \"I'm coming! Shut the hell up!\" Mike yelled through the door. The pounding did not stop. He peered through the peephole and dumbfounded, he wrenched the door open. \"What the hell are you guys all doing here?\" he said as he stood in the doorway. Ken, Richie, Tarzan and Tito stood in the hall with a bag each. All the guys except Tobias were there. \"Seriously?\" Mike asked, still confused as to what was going on. He stepped back and allowed the other men and their bags into the apartment. \"I thought it was just you coming, Ken.\" \"Well, loser, it's all of us,\" Tito smiled. \"We can crash here with you, right?\" Richie laughed. \"I mean‚Ä¶\" Mike started. \"So‚Ä¶where is the girl?\" Richie asked. \"What?\" \"Where is your girlfriend? I'm going to need to meet her,\" Richie said, his hands folded across his chest. Mike put a hand up. \"You can relax. Of course you'll meet her. But she's at work right now. What are you all doing here?\" \"You seem like you aren't excited to see us,\" Tito said. \"That hurts, man,\" he said in a mock-hurt voice. Mike said nothing; he was giving all of them an annoyed look. \"Well‚Ä¶I'm getting married. And I, one: want you to be the best man and two: I can't very well get married without a trip to Vegas. I've effin' earned it, man. I've got the company card and I'm going to have a blow-out in Sin City, Mr. CEO. You're coming with us,\" Richie explained. Mike opened his mouth to say something, but the four men were now starting to make themselves at home and explore his apartment. Ken found his way to the bathroom and returned with one of Ali's missed bras. \"We're going to need to meet this Ali,\" Ken said as he held up the pink rhinestoned undergarment. \"Yeah, she'll be thrilled that I brought all of you to see her,\" Mike muttered. \"What do you mean Vegas ? You're getting married? I thought you were just going to be the kept-man for the rest of your life.\" \"She's making an honest man outta me, Mikey. She proposed. I don't know, man,\" Richie laughed while he shook his head. \"Not that I'm complaining.\" \"Well, congratulations!\" Mike hugged the tall man before him. \"I thought for sure she was just gonna keep you around as a plaything.\" Richie shrugged. \"Well, I think she's keeping me around for that, too.\" Mike smiled and turned to Tito. \"And you‚Ä¶you're going to be a dad soon?\" Tito nodded and laughed. \"Twin girls. She's due in, like, three months. I'm lucky I got to come out here,\" he said as he shook Mike's hand. \"And you‚Ä¶I heard you've had, like, what, a dozen commissions?\" Mike said to Tarzan. \"How does it feel to be a real life working artist? Just don't start talking happy trees because I will call you Bob Ross.\" \"It's good to see you, man,\" Tarzan said, shaking Mike's hand. \"It feels damn good.\" \"So‚Ä¶what do you guys want to do?\" Mike asked. He rubbed his eyes and temples and willed the headache that was starting to form there to go away. He was grateful that he was surrounded by his friends, but he was not prepared for all of them all at once without notice. He also knew that Ali would not like all of them showing up for her performance tonight. Mike had watched her spaz out over meeting one of them; she was going to be so mad. Or, he could spring the change of plans on her and hope she could get a ride home. She would understand, and prefer probably, the second option. \"So‚Ä¶you said your girlfriend was at work. It's ten at night ‚Äì what does she do?\" Richie asked interestedly. \"How come you all didn't tell me you were coming out here?\" Mike asked as a reply. Richie rolled his eyes. \"Would you have agreed to go to Las Vegas with us if we didn't come out here to make you go?\" \"I'm not sure I'm going this way, either,\" Mike replied. \"Seriously?\" Richie said. \"You're on the leash like that?\" \"You drove across the country to give me shit?\" \"What does Ali do?\" Ken asked. \"I noticed your attempt to change the subject.\" \"She‚Ä¶\" Mike started. \"She works at a club.\" It wasn't a lie. But it wasn't the whole truth. Mike just wasn't in the mood to deal with it tonight. Mike decided to fire off a quick text to Ali. He knew, based on the time, it was unlikely that she would even see it until the end of the night, but he figured he should tell her to find a different ride home. He felt guilty, but he was sure she would rather ride home with Tess or Georgia. He put the phone in his pocket and immediately felt it vibrate. It was a message from Ali. She told him she was fine with the change of plans and she could probably get something in order. She also included the 'relieved' emoji. He wasn't one to use emojis, but Ali's use of them always made him smile. \"So, Ali just texted me and told me that she was too busy tonight. I guess we'll just have to go somewhere else,\" Mike said with a shrug. Richie mirrored the shrug. \"If she says she's too busy tonight, I don't want to bother her at work. But‚Ä¶\" \"How long are you all in town for?\" Mike asked, cutting him off. \"A couple of nights. Dude here,\" Richie pointed to Ken. \"He does actually have an audition. And then we have reservations at the Palms. I wanted to get the Playboy suite, but apparently Hefner is using it this weekend. So, clear your calendar, darling!\" Richie laughed. \"We are gonna blow Las Vegas up!\" Tito said. \"He's the first of us to get married and we need to celebrate!\" \"Let's go out then,\" Mike said. He didn't know why he'd pictured a quiet night in, even if Ken had come on his own. Mike hadn't had a wild night out on the town, though, since he'd moved here. He and Ali went out, hung out with the other ladies and musicians and their significant others of Burlesque, but he wasn't drinking and partying to excess anymore. The guys all began rifling through their luggage and changing their clothes in the middle of the living room; all of them were used to being in various states of dress in front of the others. Mike shook his head and resigned himself to the fact that he was going out whether he wanted to or not. ‚Ä¶ It was three in the morning by the time they all got back to Mike's apartment. Mike was buzzed, not totally drunk, and still somehow managed to direct the cab driver back to his apartment correctly. The guys produced their sleeping bags and before he'd even removed his ever-present fanny pack, he passed out on the rug, snoring loudly. Mike bid them all a good night and headed to his own room. He thought briefly of calling Ali and checking in, but then thought better of it. He'd heard from her around twelve-thirty; confirmation that she had a ride home, but hadn't heard a word since. But since it was so late, he decided against waking her. Mike plugged in his phone and passed out, face down, on his bed. ‚Ä¶ Mike awoke the next morning and was bleary-eyed. His mouth was dry and his head pounded. Having not been binge-drinking alcohol in a long time really changed the way his body tolerated it and he hated it. With one eye, he read his phone display. It was actually twelve-thirty in the afternoon. And he had no messages from Ali. He groaned as he forced himself out of his bed and walked the short distance to the bedroom entrance of the bathroom. He returned to the land of the living feeling relieved, literally. And his next mission was to call Ali and check in. However, he heard her voice in his apartment and upon investigation, he found her standing at the stove, with a captive audience of the guys. Each one of them had a sandwich on a plate in front of them. \"Good morning,\" Mike said to them all. He moved around the men and kissed Ali on the cheek. \"Good afternoon, Sleeping Beauty,\" Ali teased him. \"Here, have some water,\" she said as she passed him her water bottle. She was smiling brightly as she stood, watching over a grilled cheese sandwich. Ali was wearing leggings and a long tank top. Her hair was in a side-swept braid and she wore no make-up and looked terrific. \"I'm too old to drink like that anymore,\" Mike said with a half-smile before drinking most of the water bottle down. \"How long have you been here?\" \"Long enough to hear some amazing stories about you,\" Ali replied. \"We went to the grocery store, Ali and I,\" Ken explained. \"She showed me a couple placed ‚Äì like where she works,\" he smiled at Mike mischievously. \"Oh?\" Mike yawned. \"Yup ‚Äì I showed him the Burlesque Lounge ‚Äì where I do a little bit of everything,\" Ali said. \"I feel like I've been there forever,\" Ali told the other guys. \"We like your girlfriend, man. She made us some killer grilled cheese sandwiches,\" Tarzan said. \"I'm thinking a food truck selling these would be perfecto,\" Tito said. \"How did you think of adding the turkey and the honey mustard?\" he asked. \"I worked at a diner in Iowa before I moved out here. I'd like to say I came up with it, but it was my loser boss' idea,\" she said. \"He didn't like to waste, so when we had leftovers from our turkey dinner nights, he would make the deluxe grilled cheeses the special,\" Ali said. She smiled while she turned away from the stove and handed a fifth sandwich to Mike. \"Be careful, it's hot,\" Ali said. \"I think we should keep her as our mascot,\" Richie said. \"I am no one's mascot, Richie,\" Ali said, still smiling. \"But thank you; I'm flattered.\" \"Guys ‚Äì I'm going ‚Äì what the hell‚Ä¶this is my apartment. Ali, come with me?\" He pulled lightly on Ali's arm and she rolled her eyes, but followed along. Mike turned to her when she was in the room and the door was closed. \"Your friends are awesome,\" Ali smiled sweetly. He looked at her with narrowed eyes. The way she was talking made him suspicious. Cautiously, he started. \"Are you all right?\" he asked her. \"I'm fine, darling,\" Ali replied. \"Just fine. I mean, I wasn't done waitressing ,\" she said with air quotes for emphasis. \"Until almost two. But whatever; I hear you guys tore up the town,\" Ali said. \"So‚Ä¶you're mad at me.\" Ali rolled her eyes. \"I'm not mad, Mike,\" Ali replied. \"I just wonder why you didn't tell them what to do. Is my being a burlesque performer a problem for you?\" she asked. \"I mean, we've talked about it before‚Ä¶\" Mike pulled her close and kissed her, effectively cutting her of mid-sentence. After a brief, but passionate kiss, they broke apart. \"You think that will distract me?\" Ali asked. \"Is it working?\" Mike asked. \"You're right; I'm sorry I didn't tell them. I just‚Ä¶they‚Ä¶ugh, everything is an excuse. I'm sorry‚Ä¶I screwed up. I'll go tell them now,' Mike said. Mike started to walk towards the door, but Ali stopped him. \"It's not a huge deal, Mike. I'm not really mad. They are your friends and you can tell them what you want or not,\" Ali said. \"How about we blow all their minds tonight and I can bring them to your show?\" Mike said, putting his hands on her waist. \"If that's‚Ä¶\" He kissed her again. \"I missed you last night.\" \"You were out and then came home and passed out,\" Ali said. \"But that's okay.\" \"No; I did miss you,\" Mike said. \"I think we should move in together. I hope you don't think it's too soon.\" ‚Ä¶ To be continued‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ Author's note: once again, my sincerest apologies for not getting this out much, much sooner. I feel like I'm writing constantly, and then real life always seems to get in the way. Anyway, please let me know what you thought![Chapter 10] Bringing the Magic Chapter Ten \"Wait? What?\" Ali said with wide eyes. \"I‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶\" Mike stammered slowly. Before Ali could say anything more, the alarm on her phone started going off. \"I have to go. Can we talk about this later? I think that would be‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶good. I mean, to talk about it later, when I have more time and you don't have an apartment full of people. Is that okay?\" she rambled. It was evident that she was in shock over what he'd said. Mike nodded. \"Of course, its okay,\" he said to her. \"I'll have a table reserved for y'all tonight; bring the guys. But I have to get going to rehearsals. I'll talk to you later, honey.\" Ali kissed him on the cheek and essentially ran out of the bedroom. Mike did not follow her and heard her saying her good-byes to the guys in the rest of the apartment. The next thing her heard was the apartment door closing. Mike had stumped himself. Somehow, with Ali, he found himself constantly blurting whatever came into his head. It came out like word-vomit that he just couldn't stop. And the worst part of it was: it was always the damn truth. And in this case, it was still true. Mike knew that they'd be rushing things. He knew that she'd just been in a relationship, living with a guy, and that hadn't ended well. But he wasn't Jack, never would be, and living with Ali just seemed to make sense. Yes, they'd both gotten into leases. And yes, their relationship was still new. But he knew he loved her, and she loved him, and why put off the inevitable? But he also knew that he would go along with anything Ali wanted. If she decided that it was too soon or didn't ever want to live with him, he was going to suck it up and deal with it. Mike ran a hand through his bedhead and went back into the main room of the apartment to join his friends. ‚Ä¶ \"‚Ä¶and then he just blurted it out,\" Ali said as she stretched. \"He just blurted it out?\" Coco asked. \"Sounds like he was still drunk.\" Ali nodded. \"That's exactly what I was thinking. It's like instead of knowing what to say, he just said words that he thought I wanted to hear.\" \"You know‚Ä¶they say that drunk people speak the truth,\" Jessie said. \"I mean, take Nikki for example,\" Jessie laughed. \"I think it's cute that Mike is nervous around you.\" \"I think it's ridiculous that he's nervous ‚Äì if that's even what it is,\" Ali said. \"I mean, that's just ridiculous. He's seen me naked‚Ä¶and he's nervous for me to see him hungover?\" Ali said as she shook her head. \"It doesn't make any sense.\" \"You're seriously over-thinking this,\" Nikki said from the other side of the stage. \"First of all, the man has zero-taste‚Ä¶but if he wants to buy you a house, you should let him.\" \"I don't think he was buying me a‚Ä¶\" Nikki held up a hand. \"Seriously, you have to take these guys for what they're worth. Eventually, all of them are going to leave; why not have some fun before then?\" Nikki said. Ali rolled her eyes. \"Perhaps you've never had a relationship work because you do that?\" Ali said. \"Maybe if you weren't just using guys for their money and sex you'd be married with half a dozen kids now?\" Nikki let out a short bark of laughter. \"I'm never having kids.\" \"Nikki, I think you're missing the point of what Ali was saying,\" Jessie replied. \"You all just have no idea‚Ä¶\" Nikki said. Sean walked in and looked at the group that wasn't rehearsing and cleared his throat. \"Shouldn't the lot of you be rehearsing your dances?\" Sean asked rhetorically. \"Except, you're all chatting.\" \"Mike asked Ali to move in together,\" Jessie said. \"You don't have to announce it to the universe,\" Ali said to the redhead. Sean put his hands on his hips. \"I realize that you all have lives outside of this place, but right now, you're on the clock and I'd like to see you be limbered up and rehearsed.\" \"Sean's wearing his big-boy pants today,\" Coco joked. \"Are you going to start handing out push-ups?\" \"No, but I might,\" Tess said as she walked onto the stage. Her high-heeled boots clicked on the polished wood of the stage floor. \"So we have half a dozen dancers that aren't doing anything.\" \"What has the two of you in such a foul mood?\" Jessie asked. \"You might as well tell them,\" Sean said. Tess shot the man a dirty look. \"Darling, they're going to find out eventually,\" Sean replied. Tess folded her arms over chest and tapped her foot while she tried to make a decision. \"Fine,\" Tess said. \"We've had some set-backs with the renovations. Our permits have been stuck on the back burner and we aren't certain as to why.\" \"I'm sorry, Tess,\" Ali said. \"So, we won't be closing down like we planned, so if any of you have had vacations planned or whatever, you'll have to postpone them,\" she said while the ladies all groaned in disappointment. \"If you have a problem with that, you can come talk to me one by one and the time off will be approved on a case by case basis. Okay? Okay. Now, get to work. Dave!\" \"Yes, ma'am?\" Dave called from the back of the dance hall. \"Start the music!\" Tess said. \"You got it.\" Tess stomped off the stage and the ladies got to their rehearsing while Sean watched over the group. ‚Ä¶ \"I don't understand why you didn't tell us your woman worked at a burlesque club,\" Richie said as they walked from Mike's truck to the entrance of the club. \"It's not that I didn't want to, it just‚Ä¶\" \"It's not like we're in a place to judge,\" Tarzan said. \"If that's what you were thinking, man.\" Mike held the door open and the others walked into the building. He walked in behind them and then led them past the long line of people waiting to pay and get in. Mike stopped at the front desk where Alexis was grinning ear to ear. \"Ahh, Michael and company,\" Alexis greeted them. \"Looks like a great turnout again tonight, Alexis,\" Mike said as he leaned on his side of the desk. \"These are the guys from back home,\" he said. \"This is Alexis; the gatekeeper to the Burlesque Lounge.\" \"Welcome to California and welcome to the best view on the Sunset Strip,\" Alexis said. \"Enjoy the show. Your table is ready, sirs.\" \"Thanks, Alexis,\" Mike smiled. \"Follow me.\" Mike led the guys down the hall and then down the flight of stairs into the lounge portion of the building. \"Wow,\" Tito said as Mike led them to the table. \"This is like one of those old-timey places. Does this remind you of your childhood, Tarzan?\" Tarzan threw the younger man a dirty look and slid into the booth. The contortionists were entertaining the crowd that was filling in the lounge area and Richie was watching with wide eyes. One of the women put her leg up behind her and pulled it over her own shoulder from behind. \"Damn,\" Richie hissed. \"That looks‚Ä¶painful.\" The other men all nodded in agreement. They all waited for the club to finish filling up. Mike was quiet as he continued to think about what had happened earlier in the day with Ali. He'd considered telling her that he'd blurted it on accident ‚Äì that it was a mistake. He'd also considered telling her that he knew it was crazy, but he wanted it anyway. And the idea of claiming that his hangover was the cause also floated through his brain. Mike still had no idea what he was going to say when he and Ali finally talked about it. He was okay with the fact that she would be too busy to talk tonight while the show was going on and too tired to talk when she was done. The lights went down about five minutes after their drinks arrived. The stage lit up and Tess walked out, dressed like a ringmaster. She performed her own music, introducing all the ladies, with the exception of Ali. The next couple performers Mike recognized as Nikki and Jessie. They each did their own things as well. Then after their own acts, a group of ladies came out and performed a dance routine. After waiting through the first part of the show, the lights went down again and the curtains opened on the stage. The crowd cheered, knowing who was on the stage before they could see her. A spotlight hit Ali, on a chaise lounge in the center of the stage. She started to sing, what Mike recognized as \"But I Am a Good Girl.\" His smile was wide as he watched the woman sing and dance throughout the entire song. \"Is that really her singing?\" Ken asked. Mike smiled and nodded. \"Um, yeah, it is.\" \"Wow.\" The guys watched the performance in stunned silence. No one said anything until the curtains closed once more. \"No offense, but what the hell does she need you for, man?\" Richie laughed. \"She seems like she's got it all covered.\" \"You've met her ‚Äì you know she isn't looking for someone to take care of her or someone to boss around. She's just‚Ä¶she's just Ali,\" Mike said. \"You are soooo far gone, dude,\" Tito said. \" You're the one having kids,\" Mike retorted. \"And I'm the one who is far gone?\" he smiled. \"Ali said you were here and you had brought friends,\" a voice said behind them. Mike turned. It was Sean approaching the table. \"Guys, this is Sean. He ‚Äì what exactly do you do here?\" Mike said to the man. \"The list of what I don't do is shorter,\" Sean said. The guys all went around the table and introduced themselves. Sean smiled at them all; clearly he was fascinated. \"So‚Ä¶you all used to be‚Ä¶\" \"Male entertainers,\" they answered in unison. \"And you ‚Äì you're the singer, right?\" Sean said to Ken. Ken nodded slowly. \"Well‚Ä¶yes.\" \"I think I saw your Tide commercial,\" Sean smiled. Mike rolled his eyes in amusement; Mike hadn't known Sean long, but he did know that the man liked to flirt. \"Is Tess around? I think the guys should meet‚Ä¶\" \"Tess is having a, well, not-so-good day and has declined making nay appearances on the floor tonight,\" Sean said with a snide tone. \"Is everything okay?\" Mike asked. Sean opened his mouth to say something, then stopped himself. \"I'll let Ali talk to you about it later,\" Sean replied. \"Ah, here the beauty is now.\" Sean took Ali's hand and kissed it. \"Magnificent show, as always, Ali-cat,\" Sean said with a flourish and making her blush. \"Thank you, Sean. You know you don't have to do that.\" \"I do so enjoy watching you blush, though,\" he said before pinching her cheeks. \"You were awesome,\" Tito told her. \"Have you always been able to sing like that?\" Richie smacked him in the gut. \"Well, duh ‚Äì she wasn't bitten by a radioactive spider or anything and suddenly she could sing. I mean, that didn't happen, did it?\" Ali laughed. \"No. One day I just started to sing and it came out like this. I'm a very lucky person.\" 'You really sound amazing,\" Ken said, his eyes bright. \"Have you taken any lessons or worked with a vocal coach?\" \"No, I‚Ä¶I just had a thought. You and I should do a duet tonight!\" Ali smiled. \"No, no,\" Ken said, waving the idea off. \"It's your show.\" Ali returned the wave. \"Nonsense! I passed kindergarten; I can share with others!\" Ali said. \"Come on ‚Äì we can get ya all gussied up,\" she winked at Mike. \"Are you sure?\" Ken asked. \"Um, duh,\" Ali laughed, pulling a full-on Valley-Girl voice for the moment. \"I know you want to‚Ä¶\" she said holding out her hand for him to take. Ken smiled, stood and took her hand. They disappeared into the back. \"She's the least diva you've ever officially dated, Mikey,\" Tarzan said. \"And that says a lot because with talent like that, she's an actual diva.\" \"Agreed,\" Richie said. \"Has she said anything about Vegas?\" \"You really want her to say no and then you can hate her, right?\" Mike said. \"Brooke would have said no.\" \"She is no Brooke.\" \"That's for damn sure,\" Tito replied. \"Brooke tried to play all cool and shit, but she actually was just playing. Ali seems like she's the real deal.\" \"Did she tell you she's from Iowa? I've never met anyone from Iowa before. Well, none that I realized were from Iowa,\" Mike said. \"You're sounding like a sixteen year old girl and that freaks me out,\" Richie said. \"So when we go to Vegas are you actually going to go? Will you be able to mentally check out and enjoy yourself?\" Richie asked. Before he could press Mike any further, the lights went down once more and all conversation in the room ceased as the curtains on the stage opened up. A spotlight hit Ali and her outfit glittered like a disco ball. \"Come on, Burlesque Lounge, let's give a warm welcome to our very own Ken Doll,\" Ali announced. The crowd cheered and Ken strutted out on stage. He'd gotten a makeover from the ladies backstage and he now looked like he'd worked at the lounge for ages. He held the mic up and started singing the Adam Levine lines of Moves Like Jagger . Ken and Ali performed the song amongst the cheers and applause of the crowd. They looked, and sounded, like they'd been performing together for a lifetime. They definitely had chemistry on stage, but it was Mike that Ali winked at when she was finished with the song. They took a bow, laughed and hugged like old friends. ‚Ä¶ \"I'm going to walk Ali upstairs,\" Mike said as he pulled into Ali's apartment building's parking lot. \"Mike, I can find my way upstairs,\" Ali said. \"Take everyone back to your apartment,\" she said. \"Have a good night, boys,\" she said in a flirtatious way. \"Aw, Ali‚Ä¶you aren't going to keep us company and come back to Mike's place with us?\" \"No offense, fellas, but sharing one bathroom with five guys doesn't sound like my ideal kind of night,\" Ali laughed. \"Touche,\" Ken laughed. \"It was an absolute pleasure to share the stage with you tonight, Ali,\" Ken said. \"Hey, don't be trying to steal my girl from me,\" Mike smiled. \"I like your friends, Michael,\" Ali smiled at them. \"They all know exactly what to say to make a girl feel gorgeous,\" she said. \"Good night, guys.\" Ali smiled and she climbed out of the truck. She closed the door and Mike pulled the keys from the ignition and followed her out of the truck as well. He walked with Ali up to the building and they disappeared inside. \"You know you didn't have to walk me up here,\" Ali said. \"I'm fine.\" \"I know‚Ä¶I just‚Ä¶everyone really likes you, Ali,\" Mike said. \"Especially me.\" Ali laughed while they waited for the elevator. \"Well, I'm glad to hear that.\" \"So‚Ä¶how did Tess like Ken's performance? Should he start preparing himself for a job there?\" Mike asked. \"Tess‚Ä¶\" Ali said. She no longer wore her smile. \"What's going on?\" Mike said. \"Sean said that Tess was having a bad day, too.\" \"She found out today that the permits for the renovation have been‚Ä¶well, they're being held up for some reason. She wasn't able to find out why or how but right now, the club is staying open and all vacations are cancelled. The show must go on.\" They walked down to Ali's apartment from the elevator and Ali stooped to pick up a note that was left on her doormat. She didn't recognize the handwriting, but she figured it was just another note from a neighbor saying she had her music too loud. Mike unlocked the door as she opened her note. Reading it, she let out a surprised gasp. \"What?\" Mike said. \"What is it?\" ‚Ä¶ Author's note: here is the latest chapter! Let me know what you thought![Chapter 11] Bringing the Magic Chapter Eleven \"You have got to be shitting me!\" Ali said. She looked furious as she read and then re-read the note in her hand. Mike moved to read it over her shoulder, but she folded it up. \"Who is it from?\" he asked. Ali sighed in disgust. \"Marcus. Of course it's from effing Marcus.\" \"What?\" Mike said. \"How does he even know where you moved to? Has he been to see you since that night?\" Ali pushed past Mike and shoved the offending note into Mike's hand as she passed by. \"DO you really think I wouldn't tell you if I'd seen or heard form Marcus again? Of course I would tell you.\" Mike read over the note in his hand and slammed the door closed behind him. \"What the hell is he doing? He says because of you, he's gotten the city to revoke Tess's permits for the club? First of all, I'd love to know how he did that. And I'd also like to know why he wants you so damn badly.\" Ali shook her head. \"He's rich and he has a lot to do with the city. He probably knows people. And he's pissed at me because he couldn't get what he wanted. You know that as well as I do. I just didn't think he'd go this far to get back at me.\" \"Get a bag together. You can't stay here alone,\" Mike told her. \"What?\" Ali said. \"I want you to come back to my apartment with me. I wouldn't feel right leaving you here all alone tonight. I don't want this dick to get anywhere near you, Ali,\" Mike said. \"You can stay with me.\" \"Absolutely not. No.\" \"Damn it, Ali,\" he yelled. \"You can't‚Ä¶\" Ali folded her arms across her chest. \"What can't I do, Mr. Lane?\" \"I'm not going to fight with you on this, Ali.\" \"Good; I'm glad to hear that.\" Mike moved past her and started stuffing whatever clothes he saw first into a tote bag that had been sitting on the floor. He turned to her next and they shared a tense moment. \"We can do this the easy way; you can come quietly, or‚Ä¶\" \"There's an 'or'?\" she asked him with an attitude. Clearly she wasn't going to go the easy route. \"Then you leave me no choice, Ms. Richardson.\" Ali watched as Mike moved towards her and in one quick swoop, he'd thrown her over his shoulder and her head dangled down by his butt. Any other circumstances, and Ali might have enjoyed the view. But today she was pissed. \"Mike! You're acting like a caveman! Put me down!\" Ali shouted. He scooped her bags ‚Äì the tote and her purse ‚Äì and Mike moved them out of the apartment. Ali continued to struggle while Mike locked the door. \"You're going to wake the whole building, Ali, if you keep carrying on like this,\" Mike said as he carried her to the elevator. She stopped speaking almost immediately but it didn't mean she was pleased with the situation. Mike loaded the both of them into the elevator when the doors opened. \"Are you going to calm down?\" Mike said. \"Are you?\" she replied to him in a snide tone. \"I don't think I need to, Ali. My concern is you and your safety. My girlfriend is being harassed by a lunatic stalker and for some reason you don't seem to care so much,\" Mike said as they descended. \"You're mad at me but you ought to be fucking pissed at this asshole Marcus Gerber.\" \"You‚Ä¶\" Ali started before taking a deep breath and releasing it loudly. \"I get that you're concerned about me and I love that. Because I love you. But look at this small picture: it's already five dudes in an apartment with one bathroom. And can you please put me down?\" Ali said. \"Nope.\" The elevator doors opened on the first floor and one of Ali's building neighbors stood in front of them wearing a confused expression. \"Do you need help?\" the woman asked Ali. Ali shook her head as Mike walked past the neighbor. \"No,\" Ali said. \"I'm fine. He's trying to be a protective boyfriend and mostly he's acting like an idiot.\" \"Are you sure‚Ä¶?\" the woman asked. \"I promise. I'm fine,\" Ali said. \"Thanks, though.\" \"Thanks for your concern,\" Mike said in a flat tone before he walked Ali out of the building. Ali mustered a smile and a small wave to the woman while she stepped into the elevator. \"She's still going to call the cops,\" Ali said. \"I don't care.\" The guys all watched from the truck as Mike carried Ali and her bags toward them. Ken hopped out and opened the passenger door so Mike could set her there. \"What's going on, guys?\" Ken asked with an amused smile. \"We were starting to think you guys were having sex up there,\" Richie called from the backseat. \"Trust me. There won't be any sex for a long time,\" Ali replied angrily. \"Can you buckle yourself in or do you need me to do it?\" Mike asked her. \"I don't know, Mike. Can I?\" \"If you continue to act like a child, I'm going to treat you like one,\" Mike said. He set her bags down on the truck's floor at her feet and closed the door. Ken climbed back in to the backseat while Mike watched to make sure Ali wasn't going to bolt while he moved to the driver's side. \"Seriously‚Ä¶what's going on?\" Tito asked. \"Oh, nothing. Ali just has a stalker,\" Mike said nonchalantly as he turned the key in the truck's ignition. \"But she apparently doesn't give a shit about that.\" \"Whoa, whoa, whoa‚Ä¶a stalker?\" Ken asked. \"Like a legit one? Has he threatened you?\" \"No.\" \"That note wasn't threatening?\" Mike said to her while he steered the truck towards the road. \"I think it was.\" \"Who is this guy?\" Tarzan said. Ali shook her head. \"It's a long story. Like a year or so ago, he was trying to buy the club from Tess and he thought he could get close to me and get information‚Ä¶he already knew that the bank was going to foreclose on Tess. But in fact, he told me something that Tess and I were able to use to save Burlesque,\" Ali explained. \"It ended up screwing him over. And while I spent a lot of time with him and he gave me gifts, I sent them all back. And apparently he's still pissed at me. I'm not a gold digger and the people that are at Burlesque are my family. I couldn't let Tess lose the club. Marcus was never anything to me.\" \"Well, I think it's a good idea that you aren't alone,\" Ken said. \"Do you have the note?\" he asked. Mike passed the folded paper back to Ken. He held up his cell phone to read the paper in the dark car. Tito and Richie also read it. \"This guy is some kind of sick bastard,\" Richie said. \"I don't need this kind of attention, fellas. It's okay. Marcus Gerber is not physical.\" \"Pardon my next question, but did you and this Marcus‚Ä¶did you‚Ä¶?\" \"Hey‚Ä¶\" Mike said. He didn't want to hear about it. \"No,\" Ali answered. \"There was some flirtation, but nothing else. Absolutely nothing else.\" \"Maybe you ought to go to the cops with this,\" Tito suggested. Tarzan took the letter and read it himself. \"Can you prove that it was actually from this Marcus Gerber? Because at this point you only have a very convenient note as to the reason behind some backtracked permits,\" he said. \"I would love not to talk about this anymore,\" Ali muttered. \"I will deal with this; it's my problem.\" \"Ali‚Ä¶\" Mike started. \"Ali, you're Mike's girl. And we are going to be there for you because Mike is our boy,\" Richie said. \"You're family now.\" Mike pulled the truck into the building's parking lot. He parked and turned off the ignition. \"Have no fear, Ali dear,\" Ken smiled while he put a hand on her shoulder. \"We'll help you sort all this out.\" They all piled into the summer and got ready for bed. The four guests made their sleeping arrangements in the living room while Mike and Ali went to Mike's bedroom. The couple silently got ready to sleep and it wasn't until it was dark that Ali said anything. She turned towards Mike in bed. \"I'm sorry,\" she whispered. \"Don't worry about it,\" he said without any emotion. \"No. I'm sorry, Mike. I don't want this to be your problem and now it is. And what happens if he comes after your building and your permits? What if he goes after your business?\" Ali asked. Ali turned into his body and he could feel the tears coming out and falling onto his bare chest. He pulled her tighter. \"It'll be okay, baby,\" he told her. \"Get some sleep. We'll sort it out in the morning.\" ‚Ä¶ The next morning, Ali had marched into the club and headed straight for Tess' office. She knew she was going to have to tell her what was going on. Sean tried to slow her down, but Ali was on a mission. \"I don't think this is a good idea, Ali,\" Sean said. \"Seriously‚Ä¶we haven't had any good news; she's in a foul mood.\" Ali ignored the man. Ali knew that Sean was right; now was not the time to talk with Tess, but she didn't have a choice now. She had to. Marcus wasn't just messing with her anymore; he was messing with everyone's livelihoods. Tess sat stoically at her desk in the dimly lit office. She was stone-faced as Ali walked in with Sean hot on her heels. \"Not now, Ali,\" Tess tried to get her to leave. Ali shook her head. \"No, Tess‚Ä¶I‚Ä¶I'm so sorry about everything. I can't believe the permits are‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶\" Ali said. \"Me, too,\" Tess said flatly. \"But it isn't your fault. It's just some bureaucratic bullshit that I always seem to get stuck in,\" Tess said in an uncharacteristically quiet voice. \"‚Ä¶But, it is.\" \"What is?\" Tess asked. \"What she said,\" Sean replied. Ali tentatively handed the note from Marcus and the dark-haired woman behind the desk picked it up and read it. When she was done, she angrily tossed it in Sean's direction. \"Marcus Gerber!?\" Tess said. \"Seriously? This is all because of whatever happened between you and Marcus effing Gerber? Oh, holy hell!\" Tess shouted as she was out of her seat. \"Damn it, Ali!\" \"A couple of weeks ago, Marcus was outside the club, waiting for me. He said some shit, but he was just blowing hot air. I thought he was just pissed because he didn't get his way; I didn't realize I caused him to have some vendetta against me. Mike was there that night and I hadn't heard from Marcus since then until last night. I figured Mike had scared him off.\" Tess stared down at Ali. \"Why didn't you tell me? Or Sean? Or‚Ä¶damn it, Ali, I could have been ready for this. I just shelled out a ton of money for an attorney to get involved and start an investigation and it turns out it was just Marcus. I could have‚Ä¶ugh‚Ä¶I‚Ä¶just get out,\" Tess said angrily. \"What?\" Ali asked in a shocked voice. \"Tess, I‚Ä¶\" Tess pointed to the office door. \"Just go; I can't deal with you right now. Get her out, Sean.\" \"Come on, Ali,\" Sean said, putting his hand on the small of Ali's back to lead her out. \"Tess, I‚Ä¶am I fired?\" she asked quietly. \"No. But we're closed down, because your pal Marcus Gerber also called the health department on us and we're close down for an indeterminate amount of time because of the investigation.\" Tess sat slowly down into her chair and Sean led Ali out. They were silent until they were downstairs. \"Closed, Sean?\" Ali asked. \"Really? I‚Ä¶\" \"You'd better believe it, baby,\" Sean said. \"When did you find this out?\" Ali asked. \"This morning,\" he said to her. \"Tess'll come around; she's just in shock right now. She knows as well as I do that you didn't do anything to provoke Marcus‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶nothing more that something she also did,\" Sean told her. \"I'll keep you in the loop, baby-cakes,\" he leaned in to kiss her cheek. \"Keep yourself safe, Ali. Based on that letter, I'd say that he's losing it.\" Ali shook her head and she tried to stop the tears from coming. \"I'm so sorry, Sean,\" Ali said. He nodded. \"I know. So does Tess.\" Ali took a deep breath and stepped out into the daylight while Sean locked the door behind her. She pulled out her phone and fired off a text to Mike. She wanted to let him know that she was on her way over to her apartment. And things hadn't gone well with Tess. Ali waited for a text back from Mike. She took a shaky breath as she looked at the Burlesque Lounge. It was the only place that would give her a chance when she moved out to LA and now there was a real chance that it was all going to go away. She thought that when she and Tess had battled Marcus for the property and they'd won, he'd moved on. Clearly, that was not the case. And now she had to figure out what she was going to do. ‚Ä¶ Author's note: hope you all like how the story is progressing. Let me know with some review-love! I do love reviews (good or not-so good‚Ä¶although I like the second one a little less haha). Thanks to EVERYONE who has reviewed, favorited and/or followed this story! More to come. Have a great weekend all![Chapter 12] Bringing the Magic Chapter Twelve Mike had dropped Ali off at the club and he'd gone to his own building. The crew had been there for a couple hours already and they'd been working hard. The place would be ready, on schedule, for the final inspection in two weeks. He was going to have the retail space he'd dreamed about for so long. He went to the back of the building; to the space that he'd kept to himself for his workshop. He set down his couple of things that he'd brought with him. The very expensive piece that needed to be finished for delivery tomorrow evening was still on the work table. The only thing he had to do today was get this done so he could get paid. The guys, Richie, Tito and Tarzan, were going to do some sightseeing while Ken was spending time rehearsing for his audition tomorrow. Mike kind of wished he could have gone with them, but work had to be done. And this way he didn't have to listen to Richie bitching about him going to Vegas. There was no way that Mike could leave Ali alone, not now. And honestly, with the renovation being almost finished, he didn't want to go to Vegas. He'd been a couple times before and he'd done the whole drunken Vegas thing. It didn't interest him anymore. He'd only been working on the piece in front of him for half an hour when he got a text from Ali. It was about the length of a short story and he wondered why she didn't just call him. Ali's miles-long text was definitely rambly. But the gist of what it was: the club was closed. And it was going to be closed for an unknown length of time. Somehow Marcus had gotten the place shut down because of health code violations. Mike was shocked that Tess had kicked her out; he knew Tess was hot-headed, but it was crazy that she sent Ali away. Ali said she was going back to her own apartment; that she wanted to be alone. That thought brought no comfort to Mike. She promised, though, that she would let him know she was home. He would finish the piece he was working on and then he'd go see her. He didn't know where this overprotective streak came from. He had never been this way with the other women he'd dated, but now Ali and her safety was top priority to him. Ali sent some other random emoji to him and he smiled before putting the phone back away and getting back to work. ‚Ä¶ Ali hailed a cab while she texted Mike. She was a five-minute walk from her apartment, but she wasn't going there like she'd told Mike. A taxi stopped and Ali climbed in. She gave the driver the address of her destination and then nervously waited for the ride to end. Yes, she felt guilty for lying to Mike, but he wouldn't like what she was about to do. Once they pulled to a stop, Ali climbed out and took a deep breath. This was really the last place she should be. But she had to end things once and for all. And she needed to do this herself. One last flip of her hair and she headed up to the building. Inside the building, Ali charged through the lobby and waited for an elevator. She rode up to the twelfth floor. When the doors opened again, Ali headed straight for the bored looking receptionist that stood as gatekeeper between her and the entire reason she was in the building. \"Hi there,\" Ali said. \"I need you to let Mr. Gerber know that I'm here and I need to speak to him,\" she said. The redhead unleashed an incredibly fake toothy smile. \"I'm sorry,\" she said in a drawn out, sarcastic tone. \"Do you have an appointment with Mr. Gerber?\" she asked. Ali rolled her eyes. \"Obviously you know I do not have an appointment,\" Ali replied with an equally fake smile. \"Tell him that Ali Richardson is here. I know he'll see me.\" The redhead tapped away on the computer in front of her. Ali watched the woman's eyes scan back and forth as she read something on the screen. The sigh that the woman gave let Ali know that she was in. The woman rose from her seat and held her head as though she had a permanent smell under her nose. Despite the woman being gorgeous, it wasn't an attractive look. \"Follow me.\" The woman led Ali towards the large double doors a short distance away and opened them. She allowed Ali to walk in and then closed the doors behind her. Ali walked in a few feet and waited silently while Marcus turned dramatically towards her in his high-backed chair. \"I have to say, I'm surprised to see you here, Ali,\" Marcus said as he rose from his chair. \"Please, take a seat,\" he indicated one of the chairs in front of his desk. Ali sat and Marcus propped himself on the edge of the large desk. \"I'm not going to be here long enough to need to sit and believe me, I'm not happy to be here. I just‚Ä¶\" \"You know, Ali, all of this could be over. This war between us; you could stop it all.\" \"Gee Marcus, I don't think you're being dramatic enough.\" \"Cut the bullshit, Ali. You owe me. You owe me for everything I taught you,\" he said as he leaned in towards her. \"In addition to all of the gifts, I got record labels to listen to you. And I educated you on business. You owe me,\" he whispered in her ear. \"Do you like treating women like they're whores, Marcus?\" Ali spat back. \"I don't owe you anything.\" \"You used me to make your now-ex jealous. You strung me along until Jack was single. And then you decided that I wasn't worth your time any more. Because you had what you wanted.\" \" You used me to get inside information about Tess and Burlesque. You tried to buy the damn place out from under Tess and you were going to tear it all down.\" \"You and I could be an unstoppable force, Ali. But you're wasting this fantastic body and mind on this new idiot. And you know he's going nowhere‚Ä¶fast. I'm sure he'll do a terrific job of putting himself out of business on his own, but I'm going to give him some help anyway. I'll give you a chance for you to help your little boyfriend's business. And, if we can't work it out‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶\" he said as he walked around her. His hands were on her shoulders. \"If you aren't willing, then I'm going to make sure Mike Lane Custom Designs is buried in so much red tape that he'll have to go back to stripping in Florida.\" Ali knew what she was going to hear, but she asked anyway. \"What do you want from me, Marcus?\" \"You'll sleep with me, Ali,\" he said bluntly. She shuddered mentally. \"I will?\" Ali asked, sarcastically. \"Because I don't think that was ever in the cards for you and I.\" \"Don't look at this as an act of coercion; you'll come to me willingly. And you'll spend the night.\" \"Marcus, you could have any other woman you want. I don't understand why you need me. I'm just a farm girl from Iowa that happens to be able to sing. I'm sorry I strung you along; it's not something I should have done. I've apologized for wasting your time and I've returned all the gifts. But that's the past; we‚Ä¶you‚Ä¶need to move on. Move forward. Leave me alone. Leave Mike alone. Leave Tess and the Burlesque Lounge alone,\" she said as she looked the man straight in the eye. Marcus had his hands on her upper arms in the instant and he crushed her to him in a violent and unpleasant kiss. She fought him and struggled out of his grip. \"You're disgusting,\" Ali said sharply. \"I get what I want. You know that. So what do you say? Do you want your little boy-toy to be unemployed, too? Or am I going to see you at my place tonight for a private show?\" \"Could you be any creepier?\" Ali asked. Marcus simply waited for her to answer. \"So you're saying, if I have sex with you, you'll leave Mike's business alone? And what about Tess? And the club?\" Marcus smiled an evil grin. \"If you come to me tonight and do as I say, Ali darling, we'll be able to work out a deal. Come alone to my house at ten tonight. Do not tell your boyfriend where you're going. I won't be happy if loverboy interrupts our fun,\" Marcus explained. \"And I'll need you to delete the recording of this conversation off your phone right now.\" Ali looked confused. \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" \"I'm not an idiot, Ali. Give me your phone. Now,\" Marcus said. Ali sighed and handed the mobile device over to the man in front of her. He quickly stopped the voice recording and deleted it. \"Did you really think that I would fall for that? I'll bet you really thought you had me sorted out,\" he handed the device back to her. \"You and I are going to have an amazing time tonight, my dear. Remember‚Ä¶ten o'clock.\" Ali glumly shook her head and headed for the exit of the office. He stopped her before she opened the door. \"Wear something low cut.\" He pressed a kiss to her temple and allowed her out of the room. Ali wanted nothing more than to be gone. She'd gone in to this impromptu meeting optimistic that she would be able to fool Marcus. The man had figured out the recording on her cell phone; but he didn't check her other pockets. As she headed out of his office, past the annoying redheaded receptionist and into the elevator, she forced herself to remain emotionless. Ali wasn't sure if Marcus had cameras and she didn't want the man to catch on. By the time that Ali made it into the fresh air outside of the building, though, she was almost bubbling over with excitement. She pulled her iPod out of her pocket and stopped the recording function. It was a long shot, but it was something she'd had to try. Ali saved the twenty minute recording and then pressed play while she waited for a cab. If this worked, and she suspected it had, she was just going to have to take this to a police officer or an attorney and things would be all sorted out once and for all. But before she could listen to the recording, Ali's phone started to ring and she jumped a little as it startled her. She removed the phone from her purse and read the caller ID. It was Mike. \"Hello?\" she said in a friendly tone into the receiver. Mike's tone was not as friendly. \"Where are you?\" he said. \"Are you okay? I don't mean to sound this pissed‚Ä¶I just can't stop it right now,\" Mike said. \"I'm fine. I‚Ä¶\" \"Ms. Richardson?\" a female voice said behind her. Ali turned around and the unhappy redhead from Marcus' company was still wearing her frown and following behind her. \"Mr. Gerber wanted you to take this key,\" she said snidely. \"He said you would know what it was for.\" In shock, Ali accepted the keyring from the woman. The redhead gave Ali one last disapproving look before turning on her stilettos and headed back to the building. Ali was hoping that Mike hadn't heard that, but she knew she was out of luck. Now she just had to wait for Mike's response and hopefully he would understand when she explained it all to him. \"Ali? What the hell is going on?\" Mike asked. \"Where are you?\" the hurt in his voice was almost unbearable. \"I need to explain this all in person‚Ä¶promise me you trust me.\" There was a long, tense pause before Mike finally spoke. \"Of course I trust you, Ali.\" Ali let out a sigh of relief. \"Good. I promise I'll explain everything when I get home. Things are going to be okay, Mike.\" ‚Ä¶ To Be Continued‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ Author's note: thank you all for your reviews! I really do love hearing from you all about what you like (and don't like) and it helps a lot! Hopefully you've liked this chapter too. Let me know but sending a little review love! I'm working on the next chapter already, too! Also, I hope you aren't too mad at Ali‚Ä¶she had to do something![Chapter 13] Bringing the Magic Chapter Thirteen Mike was sick to his stomach. He was pacing while Ali told him the story of her encounter with Marcus Gerber. And he was angrier than he'd ever been. He looked up from Ali's iPod to her, but she was staring down at her shoes. He'd listened to the twenty minute conversation twice. Who the hell did this Marcus Gerber think he was that he could blackmail women into sex? And the fact that Ali had gone alone to his office made the situation all the worse. \"Are you okay?\" Mike asked Ali. He had a thousand more questions to ask, give or take, but that was the one he needed the answer to first. Ali nodded. She had been too quiet since she'd come back to the apartment. \"I'm fine,\" she muttered. \"I'm not going to lecture you on how crazy it was to just go alone. I just‚Ä¶why didn't you just tell me?\" \"Because I had to do this. This is my problem to solve. Not yours,\" Ali replied. \"If you weren't my boyfriend, I would be dealing with this on my own anyway.\" \"Some of the circumstances exist because I am your boyfriend.\" \"It doesn't matter, Mike. Everything is because of what happened between Marcus and I. I screwed up. I'm just trying to fix things.\" \"Ali, guys like this‚Ä¶Marcus is deranged. Something has thrown the guy off the deep end. And he's blackmailing you for sex. He could have‚Ä¶\" Mike stopped mid-sentence. The both of them knew what could have happened. \"If that is the way Marcus operated, he could have done that ages ago. Like he said, he gets what he wants, through charm or coercion. I didn't want him and I still don't and that still didn't push him to violence,\" Ali said. Mike pulled Ali to him and held her tight. \"You don't have to do this alone,\" Mike said. He pressed a kiss to her temple. \"I love you, Ali.\" \"I love you, too.\" \"We need to take this to the police,\" Mike said. \"Do you think it's enough to put an end to all of this? Do you think this was worth it?\" Ali asked. \"I don't know. If it were me, I'd say throw the asshole in jail. But I don't know the laws,\" Mike told her honestly. \"I am so tired of this bullshit. I've got to finish this, Mike.\" \"I know,\" Mike replied. \"I think it's time we got the cops involved.\" \"I hope they can work fast. Marcus wanted me to show up at ten. That's only a few hours from now,\" Ali said. Mike took a deep breath and forced a non-committal look, despite the fact that he was pissed. \"Believe me, I remember,\" he said. \"I have no idea where the police station is,\" Ali said. \"That is what Google Maps is for,\" Mike said. \"Grab your iPod; let's go.\" ‚Ä¶ Walking up to the front door, Ali was nervous as all hell. She was so scared that she was shaking. But she forced herself to take a deep breath and she turned the door handle. She had her plan and she needed to finish this. She needed to deal with Marcus and get him out of her life. \"Hello?\" Ali called into the atrium of the house. The entryway had a high ceiling and her voice echoed all around her. \"I am so glad you made this decision, Ali. I trust you've come alone so we can work off the debts owed to me,\" Marcus' voice said from above her. She looked up and saw Marcus at the top of the modern staircase. \"Well‚Ä¶\" Ali said with a shrug. \"I showed up. But...\" Marcus locked eyes with her just as two male detectives, badges out in their hands, walked in and stood on either side of her. Marcus' eyebrow arched and he looked furious for a beat before he relaxed back into his \"Mr. Gerber,\" one of the detectives said. \"You are under arrest.\" Marcus finished descending the stairs and stood before the three of them like a gracious host simply welcoming more guests to a party. He didn't look the least bit concerned. \"I am under arrest? For what, exactly? You aren't seriously going to take her word over mine, are you? I assure you, if you'd just talk to Chief McNamara‚Ä¶\" Marcus said, before he was cut off. \"Unfortunately, Chief McNamara is no longer under the employment of the LAPD,\" the older of the two detectives said. \"And our newest chief doesn't take kindly to bribery or blackmailing.\" \"You have no idea what you're talking about. Do you have any idea who I am or what I could do?\" Marcus said. He'd really flipped his lid; Ali was sure of it. She looked over to the detectives and they were both rolling their eyes at the man's words. Ali was lucky. The police department was already doing a private investigation on Marcus and the influence he wielded in the city. He'd somehow managed to get politicians, members of the police department and the city inspector under his employ; mostly by bribery followed by blackmail. The fact that he'd blackmailed her for sex was the final nail in the coffin, so to speak. The department's new chief had brought Ali into questioning immediately and they'd worked out a plan. And Ali had somehow ended up as bait, but this time she knew that Marcus was done bothering her. \"Mr. Gerber, you have the right to remain silent‚Ä¶\" the younger of the two detectives began. He read the man his Miranda rights while he handcuffed the man. Marcus didn't struggle; he just let the officer click the cuffs in place behind his back. \"You are such a bitch,\" he said to Ali, while he looked her in the eye. \"I'm going to make you wish you had never done this, Ali. You just wait and see. I'm going to get through this. And you'll be so sorry,\" he said in an eerily calm voice as he was led out his own home. ‚Ä¶ \"‚Ä¶We stuck around while some of the cops went through his personal files. Apparently, he spent a lot of his time keeping ridiculously detailed records on who he'd bribed, who he'd blackmailed and all that stuff. And it seems like Ali wasn't the only woman he did this to,\" Mike said with his arm protectively around Ali's shoulders as they sat on Mike's couch. \"And he'd gotten to high-ranking politicians out here in California, as well as people in the police department, city planning commission‚Ä¶\" \"Basically, if someone had any power or influence, Marcus wanted his piece of the pie and he wouldn't stop until he'd gotten what he'd wanted. According to some of the records, no price was too big or too small,\" Ali explained. \"I saw one record about a mail-order bride for someone, but I didn't see who it was for. The officer that was indexing things for evidence snapped the file shut before I could read the whole thing.\" \"So, are you starting to feel safe again?\" Richie said. Ali nodded. \"The fact that he's behind bars means a hell of a lot to me.\" \"And if you hadn't gone in to confront him, and thought to make sure you'd had a back up recording device, none of this would be possible,\" Mike said to her. \"But I don't want you to ever do that again.\" \"He didn't have anyone he had working for him, did he?\" Ken asked. Ali shrugged. \"The detectives, just on the initial sweep of the info they had, believed Marcus has just always been doing this alone. The man got his kicks that way, I guess,\" Ali said. \"And Nikki will not be excited to find out he was keeping files on her.\" \"So‚Ä¶my man, are you coming to Vegas with us?\" Richie asked. Mike opened his mouth to protest, but Ali answered. \"Yes, he is.\" He turned to look at her. \"You were nearly attacked today.\" \"But I'm fine. Go ahead. You do not need my permission anyway,\" Ali smiled. \"Seriously‚Ä¶where do you come from?\" Richie asked with a huge smile. \"Your fianc√© paid for the trip, man,\" Ken laughed after pointing out Richie's own, fortunate situation. \"And she's currently taking care of her daughter‚Ä¶who is pregnant with your twins,\" Richie said to Tito. \"And she encouraged us to go.\" \"Hey‚Ä¶I can be clingy and needy just as well as the next girl. But there is a time to cling and a time to push. You‚Ä¶you need some time to relax, Michael,\" Ali smiled. \"You need a vacation where all you have to do is remember your name, your pants, and the fact that you have a girlfriend.\" \"Seriously?\" Mike said. \"Is this a trap? Because it kind of feels like a trap.\" \"Nope. No silly games. You go. Have an amazing time,\" Ali smiled and winked at Mike as she headed for the bedroom. \"I need to go call Tess. I'll be back in a few minutes.\" Ali walked out of the room and closed the bedroom door behind her. \"You need to marry this woman. Like, yesterday,\" Richie said in a low voice. He wasn't joking this time. Mike nodded. \"I know. I fully intend to. I just‚Ä¶\" \"You're definitely overthinking things, Mikey.\" Mike shook his head. \"You don't even know what I was going to say.\" Tarzan shrugged and leaned back in the chair he was sitting in. No one else said anything. \"Well, I can't do it and then leave town for four days. And I'm not going to do it with an audience. So‚Ä¶\" \"You have the ring already, don't you?\" Ken asked with a mischievous smile. \"No,\" Mike said before taking another drink from his beer bottle. \"You're lying,\" Tito laughed. \"You're so lying,\" Richie added. \"I don't have it. The jeweler isn't done putting it together yet,\" Mike said. Richie nodded. \"So you're not lying on account of it being a technicality?\" he asked. \"I designed it.\" Mike pulled up the image of his design on his phone and showed Tarzan. The tall man smiled and passed it to Richie. All the guys took turns looking at it and admiring it. \"Dude, she is going to love it,\" Tito said. \"You designed this? You want to make me some designer cribs?\" he laughed. \"I'm just kidding.\" \"I've already been picking up pieces. And I'm reading up on the safety regulations.\" \"Seriously?\" Tito said as he passed the phone back to Mike. \"That's so awesome, man! Thanks!\" \"Don't thank me yet. It's not anywhere near being done. Or started, really,\" Mike said. Ali walked back into the room, poured herself a glass of water, and joined the men. \"I think we ought to toast to Ali,\" Ken said. Ali shook her head. \"Totally unnecessary.\" \"I just can't believe you went after this maniac by yourself,\" Ken said. Ali shrugged. \"It was stupid. I'm just glad it paid off. And that I'm not dead.\" Mike stood and moved to stand next to her. He kissed her temple as he grabbed her hand. \"Can I talk with you? Alone?\" he asked her. \"Of course,\" Ali smiled. Mike led her to the bedroom and closed the door behind her. Ali barely had enough time to set down her glass of water before Mike had her pressed up against the door, kissing her hard. Ali matched Mike's ferocity and she pulled at his shirt. Mike pulled away for a brief second to pull the t-shirt over his head and then his hands were back on Ali. Her legs wrapped around his waist and she locked her ankles to pull him closer. Mike's mouth moved from her lips down to the pulse point on Ali's neck and she couldn't help the panting noises she made. Suddenly, there was a pounding on the door from the other side. \"Seriously?\" Mike called with an angry/frustrated edge to his voice. He still had Ali pressed against the door with her legs around his waist. \"No sex while the rest of us are out here!\" Richie called. He wasn't angry, but he also wasn't laughing. Ali laughed and slowly lowered her legs to the ground before starting to pull away from Mike. \"No, no, no‚Ä¶\" Mike muttered in frustration while Ali bent to pick up Mike's discarded shirt. \"Richie is right, Mike. You and I have time later‚Ä¶\" Ali said. \"Thank you so much for helping me today‚Ä¶and always. I am so happy that we're able to move forward without Marcus Gerber and his shit over our heads. And now you need to get packed so you can go to Vegas! You're going to have such a fantastic time!\" Mike kissed her lightly on the lips. \"You are‚Ä¶I love you, Ali,\" he said. He almost asked her to marry him right then. But he hesitated. He wanted it to be perfect and while it would have made sense, he had other plans in his head he wanted to fulfill for the proposal. So he settled for another kiss before pulling his t-shirt back over his head. \"I guess we'd better go back out there‚Ä¶they won't leave us alone otherwise,\" Mike said. \"I suppose we should. I'm going to go get some more Magic Mike stories,\" Ali smiled before smacking him lightly on the butt before dashing out of the room. ‚Ä¶ To Be Continued‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ Author's note: thank you so much to those that left me reviews! Also, HUGE thanks to everyone reading this note right now. I really appreciate that you're reading my stuff. I hope you all enjoyed this last chapter!

Have a great day! thomthom830[Chapter 14] Bringing the Magic Chapter 14 Mike Lane awoke to the sound of snoring. It echoed around him in the room and he'd wished he'd opted for his own hotel room this weekend. His head was killing him. He forced an eye open and found Tarzan asleep on the floor between the beds. It looked as though Ernie had rolled out of the bed at some point and he'd decided to stay down on the floor. Tarzan snored loudly again and Mike thought his head was about to explode. Why he'd thought drinking that much last night was a good idea, he'd never know. Mike had tried to keep up with the guys who hadn't fallen out of practice and now he was nursing one hell of a hangover. It was no wonder those guys in the movie had lost their friend on the roof. Unfortunately, he could also remember most of the things that had happened the night before. He didn't get out of bed, despite the need to pee. Mike found his phone ‚Äì somehow it had become lodged between the mattress and the headboard ‚Äì and checked his messages. He had some from Ali, Ken and Richie. And the message from Ali that was showing on the home screen read: \"um‚Ä¶thanks‚Ä¶I'm glad to hear you're having a good time‚Ä¶ttyl :)\" He unlocked the phone and pulled up the messaging app so he could find out what he'd sent that elicited that response from Ali. \"Oh, shit,\" he said out loud. He'd sent a dick pic. To Ali. In the middle of the night. He'd never done that in his life. And now he'd done it to the woman he thought he might marry. Embarrassed wasn't a strong enough word for what he felt. \"Holy shit‚Ä¶damn‚Ä¶\" he moaned. He put the phone down and pulled the pillow next to him over his face. \"You wanna keep it down, dude?\" Tarzan muttered from the floor. \"I sent a picture of my junk to my girlfriend last night,\" Mike said. \"What? Hasn't she seen it?\" Tarzan asked gruffly. \"Ugh‚Ä¶not the point, man.\" \"Just chill, Mikey,\" Tarzan said as he rose from the floor. \"It's not the end of the world. Do you think someone made coffee?\" Tarzan stretched and his back and knees cracked during the motion. \"You should have that checked out, Ernie,\" Mike replied. \"I have. No cartilage left in my knees. I'm like Batman.\" \"Yeah‚Ä¶you're the stripping and painting version of the Dark Knight,\" Mike mumbled back. He slowly rose from the bed and flipped through his other messages on his phone. He'd received an order for a coffee table and two messages from Ken. Ken was staying with someone named Danica. And the second message read that Danica lived in Henderson. \"Ken isn't even in Las Vegas anymore,\" Mike said out loud. \"What?\" \"He's with some chick named Danica in Henderson‚Ä¶isn't that an hour away?\" \"He's probably dead, then,\" Tarzan said. \"You're terribly optimistic this morning,\" Mike replied. \"At least I didn't send my girlfriend a pic of my junk last night,\" Tarzan said. \"I should call her,\" Mike said. \"Get some coffee first and wake up. Another half hour won't matter, man. And it's not even a big deal, Mike. It happens all the time,\" Tarzan said while laughing. \"No, I'm going to call Ali,\" Mike said. \"Go ahead. I'll find you all in a bit.\" Tarzan shook his head and smiled. \"Whatever, man.\" Tarzan walked out of the room and closed the door behind him as he left. Mike dialed the phone to Ali's number and waited for her to pick it up. \"Hi there!\" Ali answered in a happy tone. \"How are you feeling this morning?\" \"Hi, babe,\" Mike said quietly. \"I think I had too much to drink last night.\" Ali laughed. \"It's possible. Did you have fun? It sounded like you were.\" \"What?\" \"You called before you sent me the picture,\" Ali said. He groaned at the thought of the picture. And yet he could tell she was trying to stifle laughter. \"It's not funny, Ali,\" Mike said now trying to hold back his own laughter. \"I mean, it's a little bit funny‚Ä¶\" Ali replied. \"I think you said you were at your fifth bar of the night and I said I missed you and when we got off the phone, you said the pic was so I wouldn't have to miss you too much.\" Mike laid back down on the bed and covered his eyes with his arm while he held the phone to his ear. \"Ugh, great,\" he said in a sarcastic tone. \"I am so sorry.\" \"Mike, seriously, don't worry about it,\" Ali told him. \"It's not a big deal. And it's a bit flattering, actually.\" \"A only a bit flattering?\" Mike asked. \"And I can hear you rolling your eyes over the phone.\" \"Get out of my head, then,\" Ali said. \"Don't stress about the pic‚Ä¶it's not the first‚Ä¶anyway‚Ä¶\" Ali was saying. \"No worries. Just keep focusing on the trip and having a good time.\" \"You are way too nice to me,\" Mike said. \"I am? I can work on channeling my inner-Nikki for you, if you'd like,\" Ali said. \"Oh, man! Don't do that. Don't ever do that,\" Mike said. \"You're really great, you know that?\" \"I think that's one of a few things you said to me last night.\" \"Do I want to know what else I told you in our conversation last night?\" Mike asked. Ali's laugh filled his ears once more. \"Do you really want to know?\" \"Do I?\" Mike said. Ali laughed. \"You told me, in graphic detail, what we'd be doing when you got home. And how we would be christening your new building.\" \"Oh, my god,\" Mike said. \"Really?\" \"Yes, but I think we will have a good time, so still, no worries. Listen, I have to go. I'm having lunch with the other girls. I'll talk to you later, okay?\" Ali said. Mike smiled into his phone. \"Sounds great,\" Mike said. \"I love you.\" Ali giggled. \"I love you, too, Mike. And seriously, don't worry about the picture. I know you‚Ä¶you're going to keep stressing about it. It's really fine,\" she said. Mike rolled his eyes at her words. \"Talk to you later,\" he said. \"Bye!\" she said. The phone call was disconnected immediately and he set the phone down on the bed next to him. He had thought that he'd remembered everything from last night, but he was realizing that huge bits were missing. He didn't even remember any bars from the night before except for the first two. Ali had said it was during the fifth bar that they'd talked. Now he was wondering what else had happened. Ali was still laughing as she approached the group of ladies that were waiting for her. They were sitting at an outdoor patio, enjoying the sunshine and blue sky. \"What is so funny, Ali Cakes?\" Nikki said as Ali joined them. \"Why do you call me that?\" Ali asked. \"Where did that come from?\" Nikki's face was a mixture of confusion and annoyance. \"What difference does it make? It's your nickname now.\" Ali rolled her eyes. \"Okay, Nikki. Whatever you say.\" Nikki was the only one to call her that.\" \"Hello, my little angel,\" Ali said to the toddler in Georgia's lap. \"How are we today?\" Ali smiled. \"Hi Ali!\" the toddler squealed. The little girl jumped out of her mom's lap and dashed to Ali. Ali picked her up and hugged her tightly. \"You're practically a teenager now!\" Ali swung her around. The little girl giggled madly the whole time. \"You're gorgeous, darling. Gorgeous. Just like your momma.\" Ali sat down with Emma in her lap and she started to play with the little girl's light red curls. \"What are you having for lunch, little girl?\" \"Peanut butter and jelly,\" Emma giggled. \"Mmmm...that sounds good.\" \"You should have that, too,\" Emma said. \"I'll share mine.\" \"Oh, honey. That's so nice, but Ali will order her own lunch,\" Georgia said. \"Why don't you come here to mommy so Ali can read her menu?\" she said to her daughter. \"She's fine, G,\" Ali replied. \"So‚Ä¶is Mike having a good time in Vegas?\" Coco asked Ali. \"Wait‚Ä¶your boyfriend is in Las Vegas without you?\" Nikki asked. \"Well‚Ä¶good luck with that one.\" \"I trust Mike,\" Ali said. \"He's never given me a reason to not trust him,\" she finished. \"Well, you let him go to Las Vegas without you. He's a sexy as hell male stripper going to Vegas with a bunch of other sexy as hell male strippers. The likelihood that he doesn't sleep with at least two women while he's gone is‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶\" \"Nikki!' Georgia said. \"First, we have a child present. And second, Mike isn't going to cheat on Ali. Don't worry, Ali,\" she said to Ali. \"Don't listen to her. She's jealous.\" \"I am not jealous. What would I be jealous of?\" Nikki said in her most offended sounding voice. \"Well, the fact that she's had two steady boyfriends in the time that you've gone through about a dozen is my first answer,\" Coco said. \"And one of those two boyfriends cheated on her. You really know how to pick 'em,\" Nikki replied. \"Mike and Jack are nothing alike; which is probably why I like Mike so much.\" \"I'm just saying‚Ä¶be careful.\" \"A warning from the HBIC,\" Ali said. \"I should be so lucky.\" \"Ha-ha,\" Nikki laughed sarcastically. \"I'm just trying to make you open your crazy na√Øve eyes, Alice. This isn't wonderland.\" \"I see what you did there,\" Jessie laughed. \"Can we talk about something else?\" Jessie asked. Ali nodded emphatically. \"Yes, please!\" she laughed. Nikki made a humphf sound since no one was taking her advice and she went back to trying to decide what she wanted for lunch. ‚Ä¶ An hour into their lunch, the conversation had turned back to Mike and the rest of the Kings of Tampa and their bachelor party in Las Vegas. \"So‚Ä¶how long are they there?\" Jessie asked. \"Just til Sunday night,\" Ali said. \"Mike is flying back here and the rest of the guys are flying back to Georgia and Florida out of Nevada. I'm pretty sure they were having a pretty decent time,\" Ali laughed as she remembered both her phone conversation with Mike as well as the text message convo. \"What? You're randomly laughing again,\" Georgia said. \"Mike was so drunk last night that he‚Ä¶ugh‚Ä¶\" Ali said as she tried to figure out what she was going to say while the three and a half year old sat on her mom's lap. \"He‚Ä¶um, sent one of those pictures,\" Ali finished. The women all collapsed into a fit of laughter. \"Why do they think we want these pictures?\" Jessie said. \"I think it's an adrenaline rush,\" Coco replied. \"And stupidity.\" \"I think this was alcohol,\" Ali replied. \"Some women like to get those kinds of pictures,\" Nikki said smugly. \"Mike called me this morning and apologized,\" Ali said, ignoring Nikki's comment. \"It was kind of adorable, actually.\" \"The picture or the apology?\" Nikki asked. \"The apology,\" Ali said sternly. \"I don't think guys like it when you call them adorable.\" \"Cheers to that!\" Jessie said, raising her glass. Ali and the rest of the ladies did the same and they toasted. Ali's phone dinged, a notification sound she wasn't used to, and she looked down at the display. She was having all inquiries from Mike's website sent to her so she could make sure they were all promptly replied to. This email stated that Mike had a package to be picked up and an address. Ali was torn; she could let Mike pick up his own stuff when he got back or she could have it waiting for him when he got back. \"You wanna take a trip across town?\" Ali asked the ladies. ‚Ä¶ Jessie and Ali checked the address again and Ali's heart beat faster. \"You do realize we're standing outside of a jewelry store, right?\" Jessie said. Ali nodded. \"I have the right address, right?\" She handed the phone to Jessie who read the email and compared addresses. \"Yup. You sure do.\" \"I don't think I should go in. This must be something that Mike should do when he gets back home. Don't you think?\" Ali said. Jessie's jaw dropped. \"Are you kidding me? You have to go in there.\" \"But‚Ä¶\" \"What if it's an engagement ring?\" \"Exactly.\" Jessie stared again. \"You don't want an engagement ring from Magic Mike?\" Jessie asked. \"Of course I do. I love him. But he doesn't need to‚Ä¶I don't think I can explain myself well enough. What if it's just a necklace for his mom or a brooch for his nana?\" Jessie rolled her eyes. \"You're joking, right? Mike loves you. And ‚Äì let's just go inside.\" Jessie grabbed Ali by the elbow and hauled her into the store. An older gentleman stood behind the counter. He smiled and he reminded Ali of the guy who got Harry Potter a wand. \"May I help you, ladies?\" he asked. Jessie cleared her throat. \"Well, I received‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶my boyfriend got an email to his work email address and‚Ä¶\" Jessie pushed Ali out of the way. \"Her boyfriend is Mike Lane ‚Äì Ali is taking care of all his work related business while he is out of town. She is here to pick up a package.\" The man continued to smile at them. \"Unfortunately, my dear, without verbal confirmation and some verification, I cannot release anything to you.\" \"See‚Ä¶\" \"So‚Ä¶it's a ring?\" Jessie ignored Ali and talked to the man. \"What's your name, sir?\" \"My name is Gerald.\" \"Gerald‚Ä¶Jerry‚Ä¶Ali here has been deputized by her boyfriend to take all orders for business-related things. She saw the email in his business email box that Mike granted her access to. She's here to pick up the package that you said was available for pick up,\" Jessie said. \"Besides, we already know it's an engagement ring, isn't it, Jerry?\" \"It's Gerald‚Ä¶and I cannot‚Ä¶\" Jessie affected a bored look. \"I know‚Ä¶you can't blah, blah, blah‚Ä¶but seriously‚Ä¶\" \"Seriously, miss. I cannot release a package to either of you,\" Gerald told Ali and Jessie. \"Okay. That's fine. I'm fine with that. I will just forward the email to Mike and he can deal with it when he comes back from Las Vegas,\" Ali told Gerald. \"What? Ali, what are you‚Ä¶\" Jessie said. \"Its fine, Jessie. Even if it is a ring, I don't want it now. I want to be surprised. Does that make sense?\" Ali asked. The older man smiled warmly at Ali. \"I won't tell him that you were here,\" he said. Jessie's eyes went wide once more. He had basically told her that it was a ring. \"Thank you, sir,\" Ali said. \"C'mon, Jessie,\" she said. She took the other blonde woman by the arm and pulled her out of the building into the sunshine. \"Oh my gosh! You're going to get married!\" \"He said nothing that specifically said that Mike bought a ring. It could be a watch or a bracelet or it's probably not even for me! It's probably for someone else entirely. That guy could just be screwing with us.\" \"You are such a pessimist.\" \"I just don't want to get my hopes up only to find out that he'd bought a locket for his grandma or a cat watch for his crazy aunt.\" Jessie slung her arm around Ali's shoulders and they started to walk. \"You just keep being cute,\" Jessie said. \"And let's go get our dance on. But seriously,\" she added after a beat. \"I'd be your maid of honor, right?\" To be continued‚Ä¶  Sincerely apologetic author's note: I am so sorry for not posting. I've been so busy with work and family obligations and honestly, a major case of writer's block, that I'm just finishing this chapter. Please accept my humblest and sincerest apologies. Also, Happy New Year![Chapter 15] Bringing the Magic Chapter Fifteen Saying goodbye to the guys was hard but Mike knew they'd all be seeing each other in a month or so for Richie's wedding. And while Vegas has been awesome, he was anxious to be back home. He was ready to get back to work and he was definitely ready to be back with Ali. The last two days of the trip were great. And Mike had made it the rest of the weekend without sending any additional embarrassing pictures and had managed to avoid another hangover. {Disguising his water as vodka to accomplish this.} The flight from Las Vegas to LA was short, but he did have to contend with the busy and confusing LAX airport. Luckily, Ali was planning on being there to pick him up. All he needed to do was find his suitcase and find the right exit. And as he finished navigating the terminal, and fighting for his bag, Ali was outside waiting in his truck. He opened the truck door and smiled. \"Aren't you a sight for sore eyes?\" he said. \"You went to Las Vegas and came back an old man?\" Ali laughed at the turn of phrase he'd used. \"Terrible pick up line, by the way.\" \"That's adorable,\" he replied sarcastically. \"I even brought you these socks.\" He climbed in the passenger seat and handed her a pair of green socks that were covered in dice, chips, and slot machines. \"Um‚Ä¶thank you, honey. You can never have too many novelty socks,\" Ali said. \"I love them,\" she said in an uncertain voice. \"Well‚Ä¶I was thinking you could wear them later,\" Mike said as Ali steered through the parking lot. \"Uh, yeah‚Ä¶\" \"And nothing else.\" \"Oh,\" Ali said softly. \"Oh‚Ä¶\" \"Or we could just pull over now.\" \"No,\" Ali said firmly. \"We would get arrested in the LAX parking lot.\" \"Party pooper.\" \"I think Las Vegas went to your head.\" \"I think you're beautiful,\" Mike smiled. \"Are you still drunk?\" Ali asked as she steered them out onto the highway. He laughed deeply. \"No. I'm fine. I'm just glad to be headed home with you. So, what's new with you?\" Ali shook her head. \"Nothing. All the same since you've been gone. I've just been holding down the fort. Picked up a couple deliveries at UPS. You got an email about a package ready to be picked up downtown, but I haven't had the chance to go get it. I'm sorry.\" \"No worries,\" Mike said coolly. \"I set up a couple consultations for you. I think about a dozen orders came in‚Ä¶\" \"A dozen?\" he asked in a surprised tone. \"Yep!\" \"Wow! That is‚Ä¶\" \"Amazing, right?\" \"Yeah. Yeah, it is.\" \"I think one order was for a set of barstools. Do you work with hubcaps at all?\" \"I have been known to,\" Mike said. \"Okay. Cool. Because I think that is what they were interested in.\" \"How are things going at the club?\" Ali nodded. \"Same old, same old,\" Ali said. \"I mean, I guess Tess has finally negotiated a start date for the renovations. And I think I'm doing a new song next week.\" \"That's great! And when does the reno start?\" Mike said. \"Next month.\" \"Will you be able to go to Georgia with me? For Richie and Nancy's wedding?\" \"You want me to go?\" Ali asked. Mike was silent for a beat while he tried to read Ali's body language. \"Of course I want you to go with me. Will you, please?\" She nodded. \"Are you okay?\" Ali's attempt to not say anything was failing miserably. She was going to crack. And worse yet, she could feel her attempt to stay quiet was making her cold and semi-vicious. \"I'm fine. But I need to tell you something.\" Mike was concerned for a split second. He figured she was going to confess that she was pregnant or had some kind of gambling problem. \"I lied to you.\" Mike was confused. \"You lied? About what?\" \"I went to the jewelry store because I got the email that whatever you paid for was ready to be picked up. I didn't realize what the place was until I got there. And the guy wouldn't even tell me what the piece was ‚Äì I just ‚Äì I couldn't stand lying to you. I was just going to forget that I went and I‚Ä¶\" she babbled. \"I'm sorry,\" Ali said. \"I'm just such a bad liar. And I was going to explode. Do you hate me? I wasn't trying to snoop.\" \"Is that all?\" Mike asked. \"I do not hate you. At all. It's actually kind of a relief that you know,\" Mike said. \"It is?\" Ali asked. They got off the highway and Ali stopped at the traffic light at the end of the exit ramp. She looked at Mike to read his expression. \"I'm not sure why I'm acting all crazy right now. I don't usually do this‚Ä¶\" \"Ali, it's okay. Just promise me one thing?\" he said. \"What's that?\" Ali replied. \"You'll say yes?\" he asked. \"So he just asked you like that? While you were driving him home?\" Nikki said flatly. \"He didn't even have the ring?\" Ali had gone to work at the club the following morning. She was both elated and terrified. She was going to get married! \"Geez, Nikki!\" Georgia said. \"Way to be a party pooper. Was it romantic?\" Georgia said. \"Georgia, he proposed in a truck while they were driving. The only thing less romantic is if he proposed during sex,\" Nikki said. Georgia rolled her eyes. \"Whatever, Nikki,\" she said, before turning her attention back to Ali. \"I can't believe you're getting married! We're just all going to be old married ladies together!\" she smiled at both Jessie and Ali. \"Watch out who you're calling old,\" Jessie smiled. \"I thought you weren't going to tell him about the jewelry store?\" she asked Ali. Ali smiled. \"I tried. I really, really tried. But I can't lie.\" Nikki scoffed. \"You're ridiculous. Can we just rehearse?\" she asked. \"I don't think you're properly understanding how excited you should be for Ali,\" Georgia said. \"Do you know when you're going to have the wedding? We need to make plans to go look at dresses! You're both going to be so gorgeous in your dresses!\" \"You need to tone it down,\" Jessie said with a smile on her face. \"I've been engaged longer than Ali and we haven't set a date yet. Why would Ali have picked one? You haven't, have you?\" Ali chuckled. \"No. There wasn't much time for that.\" \"So how many strippers did he sleep with in Vegas?\" Nikki asked. \"You are such a Debbie Downer!\" Coco said. \"Take a chill pill, Nik.\" Nikki shook her head. \"I just think you're jumping into this a little too quickly. Pardon me for being concerned for you,\" Nikki pointed out. Tess and Sean joined them on the stage at Burlesque. \"It sounds to me like there is a lot of talking and not a lot of rehearsing happening going on in here,\" Tess said. \"Do you hear that, too, Sean?\" Sean grinned. \"Ladies, ladies‚Ä¶what is the hot topic today?\" Sean asked. \"What has all of you beautiful creatures distracted from getting ready for rehearsal?\" \"Ali is engaged! Mike proposed!\" Georgia exclaimed. \"Thanks, G,\" Ali smiled. Tess arched an eyebrow in surprise. \"You're engaged, huh?\" Tess said in a bemused tone. Ali nodded slowly. \"I am.\" \"Congratulations,\" Tess replied while wearing a small smirk. \"Sean, run them through the routines. I have some things to take care of in my office,\" Tess said before walking off of the stage she was standing on. The click of her heels echoed around them all as she walked off quickly. \"Woooo, that was icy,\" Coco said. Sean had watched Tess disappear backstage and then turned back towards Ali. \"Congratulations, darling,\" he said, kissing her on the cheek. \"That's amazing. Where is the ring?\" \"He's picking it up from the store today,\" Ali said. \"You let him propose without a ring?\" Sean said. \"He really must be magic. \" Ali rolled her eyes. \"No, really, that's amazing,\" Sean said. \"Congratulations, Ali-Cat.\" \"Thanks, Sean,\" Ali said. \"Okay,\" he clapped his hands together. \"Let's get to work!\" ‚Ä¶ Sean worked the ladies through their routines for hours. Ali was sweaty, gross and hoarse by the time she was done for the day. Tess has not made another appearance to watch them rehearse or to hear the newest song that Ali would be performing. So therefore Ali decided to make an appearance in Tess' office. \"Knock, knock,\" Ali said before she strolled into Tess' office. Tess didn't look up from the stack of papers she was reading on her desk. She did, however, tap her pen on the desk in annoyance. \"So‚Ä¶I'm not stupid. I can tell you're upset that I'm getting married. And I'm not one hundred percent why‚Ä¶\" Ali trailed off. Tess didn't reply. \"My first theory is that you were holding out for Mike, but I decided that wasn't it. So, my second theory is that you're thinking that I am going to quit on you because of it?\" Tess stopped tapping the pen for a second and Ali knew she'd hit the nail on the head. \"So, I'm right.\" Tess finally looked up. \"You don't know when to stop, do you?\" Tess said. \"I don't know why you're upset about this,\" Ali said. \"That is ridiculous.\" \"You've known this guy for mere weeks and you're engaged? That's ridiculous.\" Ali sat down in the chair opposite Tess. \"I'm not quitting.\" \"Do you hear me?\" Tess said. \"Are you actually listening to me? You're too young to get married. And it's too soon. Don't make choices that‚Ä¶\" Ali held her hand up. \"I appreciate what you're saying here. I really do. But I've never been more sure of anything, Tess.\" \"Three months ago you were sure of Jack,\" Tess said flatly. \"I am not planning on quitting. I don't know what the future holds for me, but I have zero plans to leave this club unless you physically throw me out. I love Mike and I love you and I love Sean and Burlesque. I will have all of these things in my life‚Ä¶whether or not I'm married. So, you might as well support me getting married because‚Ä¶.\" Tess finally cracked a smile, even though it was a small one. \"Have you ever considered that you're in the wrong career? Maybe you should be a politician,\" Tess said in a deadpan voice. \"Could you imagine me in an office job? I'd go stir crazy,\" Ali said. \"I don't even know how you do this part of the job,\" Ali said as she motioned around Tess' very non-formal office. \"Listen, I'm not trying to pick on you,\" Tess said. \"Because I am really happy for you. I just don't want to see you jumping into anything. It's really not bad being unmarried.\" \"And it isn't so bad being married, right?\" Ali said. Tess was silent for a beat. \"Tess?\" \"Listen, I know you love Mike and your Mike loves you. I just‚Ä¶maybe you all should just keep living in sin for a while,\" Tess suggested. \"Don't just jump into another serious relationship because you can. Do you understand what I'm trying to say?\" Tess said. \"You're saying that you care about me,\" Ali smiled a smug smile. Tess continued to smirk and she rolled her eyes in a sarcastic way. \"I suppose‚Ä¶\" she said. \"I just don't want you to end up like‚Ä¶\" \"Like you?\" Ali finished. \"Hell no,\" Tess laughed. \"You'd be damn lucky to end up like me, honey.\" Ali laughed. \"So what is it?\" she asked. \"You're just so young,\" Tess said. \"I just don't want to see you rushing into anything. And yes, part of that is because I care about you. The other is because I'm selfish and I don't want your wedding planning to get in the way of my shows,\" Tess smiled at her. \"I mean, that's not too selfish,\" Ali said. \"I would feel the same way.\" \"So, let's see the ring,\" Tess said. \"I don't have it yet,\" Ali said. Tess was silent. \"He's picking it up from the store today,\" Ali said. \"It was kind of a spur of the moment kind of proposal,\" she said. \"Well, I hate to sound like an overprotective parent, but‚Ä¶\" Tess said. Ali stopped her. \"It's okay. I appreciate it. I really do,\" she said. \"And I love you, too, Tess.\" Tess smirked and rolled her eyes. \"Now get outta here and go home to Mike.\" Ali stood up and headed for the door. She turned around to face Tess when she was in the doorway. \"Hey‚Ä¶I'm going to need some time off‚Ä¶you know for like, wedding planning and whatever‚Ä¶\" Ali said. \"Is that okay? Like, how many vacation days do I get? Paid, right?\" Tess threw a crumpled piece of paper from her desk at Ali. \"Get out of here,\" Tess smiled. Ali ducked the paper and it flew past her. \"You have to work on your aim.\" Another ball of paper flew towards her; nailing her right in the forehead. \"I don't have to work on anything,\" Tess said. Ali laughed and retreated away from the office. It was nice to know they were all offering such support. ‚Ä¶ Author's note: So‚Ä¶what do you think? Let me know![Chapter 16] Bringing the Magic Chapter Sixteen \"We only have this next week until the club is temporarily closed for the remodeling. I really appreciate you ladies and gentlemen ‚Äì I know, for most of you it won't be an easy time, but I really believe it'll all be worth it in the end,\" Tess told her group of employees that were assembled around her. \"So we have the week to make it count ‚Äì fill the club ‚Äì and get people excited for the re-opening. When we're all done, we'll throw a huge grand-opening party.\" The assembled group tried to make themselves look excited, but most were very on edge. They had no income while the place was closed down and there was really no way that was going to work for them. Some were going to help with the remodel, but most were out on their butts for a while. These were mostly the performers. The band had booked a couple of gigs other places, with Tess' blessing, of course, so they would be all right. The bartenders had managed to find some temporary work, too. It was the ladies that were going to have the most issues. Georgia was going to be okay ‚Äì she could stay home with her princess while Derek worked. But Nikki, Coco and the other main performers were beginning to panic. Everyone except Ali. Ali was remaining fairly relaxed about it all. She'd be assisting Mike with his business while the club was closed ‚Äì she still wouldn't have an income, but at least Ali wouldn't be bored out of her mind for who knows how long. And Mike wouldn't have to pay someone to be his receptionist for the time being. Richie and Nancy's wedding also fell during the club's closure. Ali was actually kind of excited to go to Georgia ‚Äì she had never been and she knew Mike was excited to see his friends again. As for their wedding, Ali hadn't even started doing anything. Her time was split between rehearsals, costume fittings and assisting Mike. In addition to this, she knew money was going to be an issue for a long time, so putting any planning off seemed like the right way to go. All of these things were running through Ali's mind as she stood in the shower. She'd left the club after Tess' pep-talk and their rehearsal and gone straight home. She was exhausted. She closed her eyes and willed the tension headache to go away. \"Ali? Ali? Are you all right?\" Ali heard Mike call. His voice seemed distant, almost ethereal, in her half-asleep state. \"Ali, are you okay?\" Mike asked. He was at her side in an instant. Ali was laying on her bed, still wrapped in her towel. She glanced at the clock on the bedside table. It was already seven at night. \"Holy shit!\" Ali sat up. \"Tess is going to kill me!\" \"What happened? Are you all right?\" Mike asked. Ali was up, running around and picking up clothes. She needed to get dressed and get her rear end back to the club. She was supposed to be back hours ago; she went on at eight. \"I was taking a shower and I had a migraine. I decided to lay down; it was only going to be for a little bit. I closed my eyes and now I've been asleep for hours,\" Ali explained. Mike was watching her get dressed. He was still concerned, even though she was up and moving around. She was pale and he didn't like it. \"Hey, Al, why don't you‚Ä¶\" \"I can't call in sick, Mike,\" Ali said. She knew what he was going to say. \"I'll just get a coffee. I'll be okay.\" Mike walked to her and put his hands on her upper arms. He looked down into her eyes. \"Ali, you are not okay. I think you should get checked out by a doctor,\" Mike said. \"Tess can deal without you for one night.\" \"I don't get sick, Mike. I just didn't get enough sleep last night. I'm just tired. I will be fine once I'm up on stage.\" \"You're really pale. I'm pushing you too hard to help me while you're working at the club. I'm worried about you, baby.\" \"Mike, I'm fine,\" she said again. She moved to step away and she felt her knees buckle. Mike caught her and scooped her up. She was totally passed out. ‚Ä¶ \"‚Ä¶She's moderately dehydrated, Mr. Lane,\" Ali heard someone's voice say. \"We've got her hooked up to an IV and we're putting the fluids into her. Her other vitals are fine, but we'll keep her here for the next couple of hours for observation, but she'll be fine.\" \"Thanks, doc,\" Mike said. Ali cracked open an eye when she heard the door close. \"Hey there, kiddo,\" Mike said. Ali was lying in a hospital bed, as she suspected. Mike's face was smiling, but she could see the telltale signs of worry there, too. \"What happened?\" Ali asked. \"Oh, nothing big,\" Mike said in a mildly sarcastic tone. \"You had just finished telling me that you were fine and set to go on stage and then you passed out. To be honest, you kinda looked like you were ready to re-enact the Jessie Spano-caffeine pill episode of Saved by the Bell for a minute, there,\" Mike finished. \"I'm sorry.\" \"Nothing to be sorry for. I just need you to take care of yourself, Ali. I love you. The doc says you're dehydrated.\" \"I heard.\" Mike nodded. He perched on the side of her hospital bed. He'd, admittedly, panicked, and brought her to the ER. She was awake for the car ride, but was out as he'd carried her through the doors of the emergency room. \"What time is it?\" \"Ten-thirty,\" Mike said. \"I called Sean and told him what was going on.\" \"Thank you,\" Ali said in a small voice. \"I'm going to hire someone to be my receptionist,\" Mike said. \"What?\" \"I'll get someone to help me now so they can be trained while we're in Georgia. It'll be all right. You can get the rest that you very clearly need.\" \"Michael Lane, I am just tired.\" \"You're dehydrated . You're so busy making sure that everyone else is okay and taken care of, that you aren't looking out for yourself. So, I'm going to do it,\" Mike told her. \"I am a grown woman‚Ä¶\" \"Who is passing out because you aren't drinking enough water or eating properly because you're so busy. I have no doubt that you'll be fine after some rest and making sure you are eating ‚Äì but you are officially on vacation.\" \"The club is open for another week. I need to be there for Tess, Sean and the rest.\" \"The only way I would even consider agreeing to let you go back this week is if the doctor says you can. But I suspect since you need to have your body hydrated, that's gonna be a no-go.\" It was not making Mike happy that he was telling her this and there was likely a better way to do it, but at this point, he didn't know what else to do. Mike didn't want anything worse to happen to her. \"But‚Ä¶Tess‚Ä¶\" Ali started. \"You don't think that Tess is going to understand?\" Mike said. \"Sean sounded very worried when I talked to him. I've heard from Georgia and Coco,\" he finished. \"What's going on with you?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I just ‚Äì if anything is bothering you or you're stressed out or anything, I want you to be able to‚Ä¶\" Mike stopped as there was a knock on the door and the doctor entered the room. \"Ah, Miss Richards, it's nice to see you awake. How are you feeling?\" \"I'm okay,\" Ali said. \"I'm Doctor McDaniel. Mr. Lane, if you would please step outside, I would like to talk with Ali alone.\" \"He can stay,\" Ali said. \"If he wants. He's my fianc√©.\" \"No, I think its best we talk alone.\" Ali's already pale face lost its last bit of color. \"I'll be outside, then,\" Mike said. He squeezed her hand lightly and exited the room. Ali waited until the door closed to express her concerns. \"Is this the part where you tell me I'm pregnant?\" Ali asked. \"Do you have reason to believe that you're pregnant?\" Doctor McDaniel asked. Ali almost rolled her eyes. Instead, though, she took a deep breath before she replied. \"I've thought that I've been on my normal cycle, so I wasn't thinking that I'm pregnant, but I'm having sex and I've seen that TV show about unexpected pregnancies‚Ä¶\" \"No, Ali, you aren't pregnant at this time. Mr. Lane tells me you're a singer, and quite a good one, I understand. He says you've been helping him out with work and pushing yourself really hard at your own job. It's very important that you're taking the time to have a proper balanced diet and drinking plenty of water each day. That's what has caused the dehydration, but that's only minor.\" Ali had thought she'd been drinking enough water. She had thought she had been eating a balanced diet. And she really didn't appreciate being spoken to like she was a misbehaving child. \"Is there a particular reason that‚Ä¶\" \"Stress presents itself in different ways. Even burlesque dancers can be stressed,\" she told Ali. She wasn't sure if the doctor was intentionally being dismissive of her job or it was just an accident. Whatever the answer, she was not pleased. \"So, why couldn't you let Mike stay in the room? You already told him that it was dehydration that caused me to pass out. Is there something else?\" \"Have you had any issues with scratchy or sore throats? Or hoarseness after you sing?\" \"No‚Ä¶\" Ali said. \"What's wrong?\" \"When we were examining you, Miss Richards, we think we found some‚Ä¶ vocal nodules . And if they aren't causing issues now, they could, and most likely will, lead to vocal loss. We need to do more testing and find the most appropriate cause of treatment.\" \"Wait. I could lose my voice?\" Ali said. \"It's a very real possibility, yes.\" Ali felt the tears welling up in her eyes. The stress she thought she'd felt in the past weeks, that she'd been pushing away, was nothing close to the terror she was feeling at the prospect of not being able to sing any more. The heart monitor that had been emitting a steady beep was starting to speed up. \"Ali, a lot of singers and performers go through this. We'll run the tests, do more of an examination. If necessary, we'll schedule surgery for their removal and you'll go into a vocal rehabilitation. Most that undergo this type of procedure regain their entire range,\" the doctor said. \" Most? \" Ali repeated as the tears flowed freely down her face. \"I'm sorry,\" she said as she tried to wipe the tears away. \"Sit tight ‚Äì we don't know anything for sure yet. I'll call for a specialist and we'll have that exam before we make a definite diagnose. It's going to be okay, Ali,\" the doctor said. \"I'll go call for the specialist and I'll sent your fianc√© back in.\" Ali nodded silently. She received a reassuring smile from the doctor and she exited the room. An instant later, Mike was back at her side and while he was happy to see color back in her cheeks, he was very displeased to see Ali crying. \"What's wrong?\" Ali shook her head. She didn't want to tell him. \"Ali, you need to‚Ä¶\" \"I might be losing my voice.\" Mike was confused and it showed on his face. He perched on the bed and next to Ali and looked into her eyes. \"Like laryngitis?\" he asked. \"Can that be caused by dehydration?\" Ali shook her head again. \"That doctor said while they were examining me they found nodules on my vocal cords. If left untreated, she said I could lose my voice. And she said that only most people regain their vocal ranges after the surgery. There is still the chance that I could lose my voice anyway,\" Ali said. \"This is all I have, Mike. I don't have a college education to fall back on. What am I going to do?\" \"I don't either, Ali,\" Mike said. \"But you are so good with the business stuff, though. You design and build. And you balance the books. Me‚Ä¶I only had this and now I could lose it.\" ‚Ä¶ Author's note: Okay, there was the newest chapter and the newest drama. Hope you all like it! I would love to know what you all thought. Let me know! Thanks![Chapter 17] Bringing the Magic Chapter 17 \"Do you think the dress I packed will be all right?\" Ali asked. \"You're beautiful and it's beautiful. It's perfect, Ali,\" Mike smiled. \"Didn't you go through at least a half dozen dresses to pick that one anyway?\" \"Well‚Ä¶yes. I just want to fit in. What if they think it's inappropriate? Like, what if they have those big ruffled dresses and parasols?\" \"We're going to Charleston, not back in time,\" Mike laughed. \"And the last time I was there, the women were not in the southern belle outfits you're describing.\" \"Oh yeah? What do those women wear?\" Ali asked. \"You will not trick me into this, you know,\" Mike said. The two of them were in the air, heading for Charleston, South Carolina ‚Äì for Nancy and Richie's wedding. Ali was excited about all of it; the wedding, to see the guys again and certainly for the distraction. When they got back to California, she was scheduled for her surgery. While not life-threatening, all of the doctors she'd seen, as well as Mike, Tess, and Sean, all thought it was best not to put it off. She'd told Tess and Sean not long after she'd found out, and managed not to sob through the whole conversation, even though she'd really wanted to. Tess was as supportive as Mike was. And so was Sean and all the other girls. But it was a very real possibility that Ali could never be working as a performer at Burlesque ever again, but even Nikki was nice enough not to say that to her face. \"Don't you think it's a bit late to be freaking out about your dress at this point?\" Mike asked, breaking her from her thoughts. \"You're lucky, you're a dude. A dude whose outfit is being chosen for him, might I add,\" Ali said. \"You'll be adorable in a tuxedo, though,\" she smiled. \"With Richie, I'm going to be lucky if we don't end up in the stripper version of a tux,\" Mike said. \"Besides‚Ä¶adorable? That's all I get?\" Ali smiled and shook her head. \"You're gonna look incredibly sexy in your tuxedo ‚Äì regular or stripper version. I mean, that could work, too,\" Ali said, with a wink. \"Although, I do hope Richie sides on the normal tux for Nancy's sake‚Ä¶\" \"I hope for my sake he picks a traditional style,\" Mike said. \"I think Nancy might encourage the other though.\" \"What did the guys say when you told them we'd gotten engaged?\" she smiled, changing the subject. They hadn't talked about their own plans since Mike had given her the ring and now seemed as good a time as any. \"I, uh‚Ä¶\" he stuttered. \"Wait‚Ä¶you didn't tell them?\" \"Well, no‚Ä¶not really,\" he said sheepishly. \" Not really ?\" she replied. \"So‚Ä¶you mean, no, you didn't tell them? Not one of them?\" \"No.\" \"Why not?\" \"Well‚Ä¶\" \"Okay, well‚Ä¶\" Ali slipped the engagement ring to her right hand. \"I love you but I am not going to make this about us. This is someone else's wedding; we can't be running around going: look at us! \" \"I think people will see a diamond ring on a ring finger, left or right , and see we're engaged. No matter what hand you wear that on, guys'll know you're mine,\" he said in a warm voice. He kissed the back of her hand and then stretched. He caught the very nosy flight attendant's attention, without trying, and she was suddenly at his elbow. She wore a seductive smile as she smiled at him. \"Is there anything I can get you?\" she smiled. \"Or for your sister?\" The flight attendant giggled and blushed and touched Mike's shoulder. She did not apologize for referring to Ali as Mike's sister before she left. Ali sat silently, her arms folded across her chest. \"That was a fluke,\" Mike smiled a smug, yet apprehensive smile. \"I wouldn't be so sure. I'm thinking if I got too close to the emergency exit, I might just get bumped off of the plane,\" Ali said. \"No‚Ä¶no‚Ä¶\" Mike said. Mike took the ring off of her right hand and put it back on her left hand. \"You and I can still be engaged and not detract from Richie and Nancy's wedding. This is where this belongs.\" He kissed her and Ali felt her toes curl. She was feeling much better. \"Better?\" \"Yeah, better.\" \"Since we still have a few more hours of uninterrupted time‚Ä¶\" \"I'm not doing that on an airplane,\" Ali said. Mike chuckled again. \"I mean we could talk about our wedding. We could at least pick a date. But now that you mention it‚Ä¶\" he said, brushing some hair away from Ali's exposed collarbone. He was rewarded with goosebumps and a warm flush on her cheeks. \"Mike,\" Ali said in a low whisper. \"No‚Ä¶not here.\" \"Okay, no mile high club‚Ä¶this trip,\" Mike said, resigning himself to the fact. \"I love you,\" Ali said. \"I love you, too,\" he replied. \"So‚Ä¶have you thought of any dates for the wedding?\" \"I‚Ä¶um, no. I haven't actually. I don't know the first thing about wedding planning or where to start.\" \"Me either,\" he said. \"We'll just have to work our way through it together.\" \"Or we could elope,\" Ali suggested. \"That is an option to consider‚Ä¶yes. But I like the idea of seeing you walk down the aisle to me in a white dress.\" \"You're just a big ol' softie, aren't you?\" Ali said. \"Didn't you ever think about what you'd want your wedding to be like?\" \"I told you‚Ä¶eloping.\" \"Ali, be serious.\" \"I am serious. The only options I had were: one, marrying someone who might possibly be a distant relative and being stuck in the hell-hole or eloping with someone that I could at least stand to spend time with so we could catch the first bus out of town. There wasn't anyone in that town I liked well enough for either of those options. So I eloped with myself.\" \"You really didn't think about a wedding? At all?\" She shook her head. \"Not until you.\" ' ‚Ä¶ Mike pulled the rental car to a stop in front of the grand home that belong to Nancy and soon Richie. The lawn was being landscaped and a huge tent was being erected in the back yard. Ali and Mike were pulling their luggage out of the trunk when the heavy front door burst open. \"Holy shit!\" a voice shouted. \"I'm getting married!\" It was Richie. He was shirtless and came barreling down the front steps to pull Ali into a huge hug. He lifted her from her feet and swung her around. After setting her on her feet, he kissed her cheek. And when he was done with Ali, he turned to Mike and pulled him into an embrace. \"Welcome to Charleston, Ali,\" Richie said. \"I'm sure glad you brought your better half, Mikey,\" Richie said to Mike. He pulled Ali to his side and looped his muscled arm through hers. \"You've got the bags, right man?\" he laughed. \"I can help,\" Ali said. \"No, let Richie give you the grand tour,\" Mike laughed. ‚Ä¶ \"Wow,\" Ali said as they made their way back into the living room. \"This place is amazing.\" \"Well, it was in Nancy's ex's family for generations, but when he cheated on her, she got to keep the place in the settlement. So, now it's hers. Well, ours, I guess,\" Richie said. \"Well, it's amazing,\" Ali said. \"Thanks, Nancy's got great taste.\" \"Clearly, or she wouldn't be marrying you,\" Ali replied. \"I almost forgot how much I like you, Ali,\" Richie laughed. \"So, how was the flight?\" He was stretched out across one of the living area's velvet couches, his long arms going across the entire top of the sofa on either side of him. Mike and Ali were seated opposite him on another sofa. \"It was good,\" Ali said, folding her hands in her lap. She wasn't trying to get him to notice the stone on her hand. But he did. \"Damn, that ring looks even better in person,\" Richie said. He reached across the coffee table and took Ali's left hand. He bent down to inspect it. \"I'm glad she said yes,\" Richie said. \"It was a bit of a crapshoot,\" Mike replied. \"Nah,\" his friend responded. \"You wouldn't have said no, would you, Ali? I mean, he had this ring made for you.\" \"I thought you said you didn't tell anyone?\" Ali asked Mike. \"They knew long ago that I was going to propose, though,\" he told her. \"I hate you,\" Ali smiled. \"So, Nance'll be home in an hour or so. You guys wanna go out to dinner then?\" Richie asked. \"That'll give y'all some time to settle in and relax.\" Mike turned to Ali. \"It's good with me, if it's good for you.\" Ali nodded. \"Works for me.\" ‚Ä¶ An hour into dinner, Ali wasn't so sure what she'd been afraid of. She and Nancy had hit it off and now it was like they were old friends. \"So‚Ä¶you're a burlesque dancer?\" Nancy asked. \"What does that mean in today's day and age?\" \"Well, I'm more of just a singer. Some of the ladies I work with do the whole real burlesque routine, but since Tess re-vamped things‚Ä¶\" \"Re-vamped things around Ali and her voice,\" Mike chimed in. \"I guess,\" Ali blushed. \"It's so sweet to see you both so in love.\" \"I could say the same of you and Richie,\" Ali smiled. \"I'm just fascinating the whole burlesque thing. You don't do any of the dancing?\" \"Well, I am more of a cabaret perform than a burlesque dancer, I guess. Some of the other girls ‚Äì well, Nikki does a routine to Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend , and she slides down a beaded curtain onto the stage.\" Nancy looked fascinated. \"You don't say? Well, I'm just gonna have to come see you out in California. That sounds like fun. I'm planning a girl's trip out there in a month or so when we're done honeymooning,\" she smiled at Richie. Richie raised a seductive eyebrow in her direction and she giggled like a teenager. \"So, Mike, do you have your speech ready?\" Richie asked. \"Do you have your vows done? And just a reminder, it's frowned upon to use Backstreet Boys lyrics.\" \"I thought I would start with: 'you are my fire, my one desire' was a great way to start,\" Richie laughed. \"As long as you don't use: 'Oh my god we're back again!' \" Ali laughed. \"I want it that way ,' could work. Or: 'I don't care who you are, where you're from, what you've done, as long as you love me' \" she sang. \"I'm so glad you're marrying this girl, Mikey. She knows BSB,\" Richie laughed again. \"So, you boys have your tuxedo fittings tomorrow morning,\" Nancy said. \"Ali, honey, you and I are going for massages.\" \"Oh, I d‚Ä¶\" Ali said. \"No, no, no. I insist. Brides to be need to relax. It's already booked. And then we have the bachelorette party tomorrow night and it's going to be amazing.\" \"Are you going to have strippers?\" Ali asked with a giggle. \"This big baby won't let me,\" Nancy pouted. \"Aww, that's cute,\" Ali said with a nudge to Mike with her shoulder. \" You don't care, do you?\" Mike was silent and stone-faced. \"I, um‚Ä¶\" \"What?\" Ali said back. \"Boom!\" Richie shouted. He was grateful that Mike was agreeing with him. \"I just wouldn't want any guy‚Ä¶\" Ali folded her arms across her chest. \"You just wouldn't want any guy what?\" she asked. \"I just wouldn't like it if‚Ä¶I'm just saying, if you're getting a lap dance, I'd want it to be from me,\" Mike replied to her. \"I think somewhere in there is something sweet,\" Nancy laughed. \"But, no offense to either of you gentlemen, but if we want strippers, we're getting strippers. And y'all ain't invited.\" \"Male entertainers,\" Richie mumbled. He'd realized this was a losing battle. \"Male entertainers? No, hun. We'll have strippers ‚Ä¶\" she patted his hand. \"I'm simultaneously worried and not ‚Äì all at once,\" Richie said. \"Maybe we'll get Ali up to sing. You're gonna do scores better than the rest of us at karaoke,\" Nancy told her. \"I'll just have to hum along,\" Ali replied. \"What? Hell no!\" \"She really shouldn't be singing.\" \"Why the hell not, bro?\" Richie demanded to know. \"She's got vocal nodules,\" \"What?\" \"I have nodes on my vocal cords,\" Ali said. \"Oh‚Ä¶like that chick from Pitch Perfect ?\" Richie asked. \"Yes,\" Ali nodded. \"So, you can't sing?\" Nancy asked. \"What do they do for them? What kind of treatment do they do for you?\" \"I'm having surgery when I get back to California. And then vocal therapy to make sure I can get my range back,\" Ali said. \"Okay, well, you are gonna have one hell of a time while you're here, Ali darling,\" Nancy explained before changing the subject. \"So, have you and Michael chosen a date?\" \"A date?\" Ali asked. \"For your wedding, silly girl,\" Nancy asked. Ali laughed. \"We talked on the plane, but‚Ä¶\" \"But Ali refused to set a date,\" Mike jumped in. \"Uh-oh, runaway bride alert,\" Richie joked. \"Better keep an eye on this one!\" he teased. \"No‚Ä¶I just‚Ä¶I love Mike, but‚Ä¶\" \"She's afraid that something is going to happen because of the surgery. She wants to wait until she's recovered,\" Mike said. \"Like I wouldn't want to marry her because she couldn't sing anymore? Yeah right.\" \"Well, that's ridiculous!\" Nancy said. \"You're going to be fine!\" Mike nudged Ali lightly. \"See? Nance doesn't even know about the actual procedure, and she knows you'll be fine,\" Mike said to Ali. \"I know I'll be okay, too. There's just a part of me that‚Ä¶\" Nancy took Ali's hand. You don't worry about a thing. You and me and Zoe will have our massages and we'll just relax. Sound good?\" Ali nodded while Mike went pale. She missed it because she was smiling at Nancy. \"That sounds great, Nancy. Thank you. But only on one condition,\" Ali said. \"What's that, honey?\" Nancy asked. \"I don't want to make any more of this trip about me, or the surgery, okay? I just want to ignore it for a while longer,\" she said. \"You got it, kiddo,\" Nancy smiled. \"Michael, are you feeling all right?\" Nancy asked, finally noticing that all the color had drained from his face. \"You're looking a bit pale.\" \"You said Zoe is going with you guys for massages?\" Mike asked. ‚Ä¶ Author's note: Thank you so much for always being patient with me getting things updated. My goal is to be more consistent with updates. I will try to get on a regular schedule. As always, please leave me a comment or critique; all are appreciated! Thanks! thomthom[Chapter 18] Bringing the Magic Chapter 18 \"So‚Ä¶\" Ali started while she washed her face. They'd been 'home' from dinner with Nancy and Richie for a while and had some additional drinks and conversation for a bit and now Mike & Ali were finally getting ready for bed. \"Yes?\" Mike said as he kissed her bare shoulder. He stood behind her at the bathroom sink, watching her. \"So‚Ä¶who is Zoe?\" Ali asked. \"Nancy's daughter is Megan, right? So who is Zoe?\" she asked. Mike's smile fell once more. \"Uh, yeah. Megan is Nancy's daughter and she's like seven and a half months pregnant with twins, so you won't be able to miss her. Zoe is‚Ä¶Zoe is an old‚Ä¶ acquaintance of mine. And she's friends of the Davidson family.\" \"Sounds like she's more than an acquaintance,\" Ali replied. She was still smiling. Ali certainly wasn't jealous of Mike's ex-girlfriends; she was the one that had the ring. She was even a little excited to meet this Zoe, considering the face he made each time she was mentioned. \"We, uh‚Ä¶\" \"You can tell me that you dated her. I'm not going to freak out, man,\" Ali said. \"I know you dated other women.\" \"I think you're drunk,\" Mike laughed. Ali chuckled and turned around to face Mike. She slid her hands up his bare arms and she locked her hands around the back of his neck. \"I am not drunk, Michael,\" Ali said. \"I'm just interested in who this Zoe person is.\" \"Well, Zoe and I had a very short, well‚Ä¶thing.\" \"So you just slept together and then‚Ä¶\" \"It was slightly longer than a one night stand. And, well, that's about it,\" Mike said. Ali laughed again. She still had her arms around Mike. He had her pressed against the bathroom counter and he was looking down into her eyes. \"Mike, I don't give a shit, okay?\" He leaned down and kissed her. Mike's hands slid down her body and pulled her close. He picked her up and she wrapped her legs around his waist. They continued to kiss like that until they had to break apart to breathe. \"Bedroom?\" Ali practically panted. \"Bedroom,\" Mike repeated, his voice thick. ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ Breakfast the next morning was an enormous feast. It seemed like Nancy had been up for hours cooking for the four of them. \"You went crazy,\" Ali said to Nancy. \"So much food!\" \"I just wasn't sure what y'all liked for breakfast, so I made a bit of everything,\" Nancy laughed. \"And you need to fill out, honey. You need some meat on those bones.\" Ali laughed. \"I could eat my weight in waffles and be very content with that decision.\" \"And don't forget‚Ä¶ real bacon.\" \"Maybe I'll marry you?\" Ali smiled. \"That could work for me,\" Nancy said. \"As long as you don't mind that I'll be sleeping around on you‚Ä¶well, with Richie,\" Nancy laughed. Ali shook her head. \"I don't care ‚Äì as long as you keep making these waffles.\" \"Are you trying to steal my gal?\" Richie asked Ali with a smile as he walked into the dining room. \"Only for her cooking,\" Ali said. \"I'm a woman with very few needs. Gimme a good waffle and I'm a goner.\" \"We could probably work that deal out, then,\" Richie said. \"Mikey might be a little disappointed though.\" \"Awww ‚Äì I'm touched,\" Nancy said. \"Oh, you'll definitely be touched,\" Richie smiled. Nancy gushed with laughter and continued to eat. Mike joined them about fifteen minutes later. \"Morning, princess,\" Richie said. Mike's hair was still disheveled from sleep and what he and Ali had been doing before going to bed. \"Good morning,\" he smirked in return. He kissed Ali on the cheek and moved to get a plate. He loaded the whole plate up and sat down at the long table next to Ali. \"Hungry this morning, huh?\" Richie said with a knowing look. \"You worked up an appetite?\" \"Starving,\" Mike replied with a grin. \"Mike,\" Ali said, blushing a deep shade of pink. \"What, Al? We're all adults here. I'm fairly certain we all know we have sex, right?\" Mike said around a bite of scrambled eggs. \"And they probably heard us last night. We weren't exactly quiet.\" Ali sighed, resigned. \"So, after breakfast, we'll head out to get our massages and we'll do lunch. Zoe should be here around eleven. And the rest of the bachelorette party guests will be here at four. We'll get ready and head out. We have the suite booked at the place downtown.\" \"Sounds like you ladies will have a great time tonight,\" Mike said. \"We're doing a bar crawl. And‚Ä¶\" \"A bar crawl?\" Mike asked. \"Really?\" \"What? Are you trying to say I'm too old for a bar crawl?\" Nancy asked. \"That's a trap!\" Richie coughed. \"You're not too old for anything,\" Mike smiled. \"I'm just picturing Ali doing a bar crawl,\" he finished. \"Hey!\" she said in a mock-offended tone. \"Just because I'm not a huge drinker.\" \"That might be an understatement‚Ä¶\" Mike grinned. \"These ladies tonight will test the endurance of your liver, for sure,\" Richie said with a look to Nancy. \"Did you tell Ali about Zoe?\" he asked Mike. \"You have no chill, dude,\" Mike said. \"Yes. And I'm glad I did since you're bringing the topic up at breakfast.\" \"You don't think it'll be a problem that Zoe is around, do you?\" Nancy asked. Ali shook her head. \"Not going to be a problem for me,\" she said. \"Me either,\" Mike said. \"Oh, good!\" Nancy clapped. Ali finished her waffle and sat back at the table. \"You should have another,\" Mike said. \"Load up on the carbs to soak up the alcohol later.\" Once their breakfast feast was over, Ali and Mike were clearing the table with Richie. \"You go run along and spend time with your fianc√©,\" Ali said. \"We'll clean up here.\" \"You do not need to do that,\" Nancy said. \"I made the mess.\" \"Exactly!\" Ali said. \"You and Richie go do‚Ä¶whatever. Mike and I will wash the dishes.\" \"Most of this can just go in the dishwasher. The dishwasher pods are under the sink and‚Ä¶\" \"I think they've been in a kitchen before,\" Richie said. \"Let's go spend some time together before I lose you to the ladies tonight.\" He wrapped his arm around Nancy and pulled her gently to him. She giggled and they disappeared out of earshot. \"That's really cute,\" Ali said. \"Cute is a strong word for Richie,\" Mike said as he scraped plates into the sink. \"Watching him giggle is kind of painful for me,\" he finished. \"Come on, Mike,\" Ali said. \"Don't you think it's great that he's finally found someone?\" \"Of course I do,\" Mike said. \"But I just wouldn't call him cute.\" For a few minutes, Mike and Ali worked as a team; scraping and rinsing the plates and loading them into the dishwasher. Mike broke the silence when they were onto the non-dishwasher safe dishes. \"This is nice,\" he said, standing next to her at the sink. He was washing and Ali was drying. \"What is nice?\" Ali asked. \"Just‚Ä¶this. You and I, doing the whole us thing,\" Mike said. \"That is so cheesy,\" Ali said. \"But I agree with you.\" \"I think we should buy a house,\" Mike announced. Ali paused her hunt for the correct cupboard. She stared at the man. \"We have two apartments, I have no income right now while the club is closed and you just moved your business out to California,\" Ali said. \"But sure, let's buy a house,\" she said sarcastically. Mike shook his head. \"But the business is doing well, and you'll have your surgery, do your vocal therapy, the club will re-open, and we'll have two incomes again,\" he said. \"I'm sure we can find something.\" \"You're such an optimist,\" Ali said. \"I love that. And I love you.\" She crossed the room and the two of them kissed. They broke apart when they heard a floorboard creak behind them. Mike turned and found Zoe in the doorway. \"Morning,\" Zoe said. \"Hi,\" Mike replied. Ali smiled. \"Hi. You must be Zoe,\" she said as she walked towards the other woman with her hand extended. Zoe shook Ali's hand. \"And you have to be Ali.\" \"That I am.\" Mike stood silently while the two women looked one another over. He was at a loss for what to say at this point. He couldn't think of anything intelligent to utter and therefore silence is what he chose. All thoughts of finding a house went out of his brain. ‚Ä¶ The three women left for their massages shortly after that and left Mike and Richie alone. Their tux shopping/fitting wasn't until later that day, so they settled on a football game on the TV. \"Are you worried that Ali and Zoe are spending time together?\" Richie asked as he lounged on the couch. \"That one will be jealous of the other? No. That Zoe will come on to my fianc√©? A little.\" \"I guess that's a real thing,\" Richie said. \"But I don't Ali is her type; like Zoe isn't your type.\" \"What is my type?\" Mike said. He was interested in hearing Richie's assessment of him and his taste in women. \"You like women who don't take your bull shit, bro,\" Richie said. \"And are actually interested in you and a life with you.\" \"Isn't everyone like that?\" Mike asked. \"I mean, sleeping around can have its own benefits, but I think everyone wants their happily ever after, right?\" \"And when Zoe came into your life, she was in the sleeping around phase ‚Äì might still be, from what I've heard from Megan. And you didn't get with her because you wanted to marry her. You and Brooke had just broken up ‚Äì you just needed to get laid. And then you met Ali, which was a good thing. So it all works out. And not only does Ali not take your bull shit, she throws it back at you. And she's supportive of what you want to build with your business. She's the right mix of daydreamer and grounded in reality that you need, dude.\" \"I think you've been watching too much daytime TV,\" Mike said. \"I've been reading books on relationships, man. I just want to be a good husband. This has been the longest relationship I've ever had,\" Richie said. \"I don't want to screw it up. And I don't just want to be the trophy husband.\" \"You could quit working out and doing the spray tan thing,\" Mike said. \"Not a snowball's chance in hell, Mikey,\" Richie told him, laughing. \"I do love Ali. I love that she does have her feet on the ground, because sometimes I've got my head in the clouds,\" Mike replied. He shook his head laughing. \"This conversation has gotten way too deep, Rich,\" he finished. They both shared a laugh and focused back on the football game on the TV. ‚Ä¶ A couple hours later, the three ladies returned from their massages. They were loudly laughing and carrying on as they walked into the house. The three women found Mike and Richie still asleep on their respective sofas. Nancy was not delicate. \"What are you two still doing here?\" Nancy asked them. Ali was laughing and Zoe was smirking. He made eye contact with Nancy before waking up enough to find his phone. Looking at the time, he swore. \"Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit!\" He was up off of the sofa and rushing for the doorway where the ladies stood. \"What ‚Äì oh,\" Mike said sleepily. \"We could still probably get to the place in time. Or maybe just be a bit late. We can just call and let them know,\" he said as he stood from the sofa he'd been on. Mike headed for the doorway as well. He stooped to kiss Ali, hard, taking her by surprise. \"Oh,\" Ali said when they broke apart. \"I'll see you later,\" he winked. \"You'll see us tomorrow,\" Nancy corrected him before walking down the hall to say goodbye to her fianc√©. \"Oh, right,\" Mike said. \"You,\" he said to Ali, pulling her close again. \"You have a good time. I love you,\" he said. \"Have a good time, ladies,\" he said to the other two women. \"Oh, we will,\" Zoe said, slinging her arm around Ali's shoulders. \"C'mon, Mike. We gotta go!\" Richie called. Mike headed down the hall towards the front door where Richie was standing. \"Bye, Clitoria!\" Zoe called behind him. \"See ya, Dolly,\" Mike replied before leaving the house. ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ Author's note: Hey there!
