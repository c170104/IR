The heat began to rise, and for the first time in what felt like centuries his eyes opened. \"What the fuck!\" Tony saw miles and endless miles of flames, burning piles of human bodies, and creatures he knew from his Catholic upbringing to be demons. \"You're in Hell, Tony!\" said a bellowing voice, emanating from a place he could not see. \"Who the fuck are you?\" \"I am Lucifer - Lord of the Dark Realm, Prince of Evil, Master of this Eternal Prison. I am your ruler now - your SOUL BELONGS TO ME!\" \"Yeah, ok,\" said Tony sarcastically. \"You were killed today, Tony, and now you will suffer here for all of time.\" \"Hey, fuck you mein!\" Two beings that looked like demons approached Tony with pitchforks. As they made to poke at him, he grabbed one of their pitchforks right above the prongs, and pulled it free from the demon's grasp. In one swift motion he stabbed the horrible being through the throat, pushing hard enough to partially decapitate the foul monster. The demon that was still alive was shocked. \"You are insolent, human,\" it said. \"But you have balls. I like that. I think we might have a job for you here.\" *** Two Thousand Years Later \"Please, Tony, I'll give you anything you want!\" Lucifer said, quivering in fear, down on his knees.

Hope you enjoy! …And Everything In It -Constanze I couldn't tell you why I fell in love with him, or why I agreed to even marry him. I don't think anyone could, but I did. Everyone told me he was trouble. Even I knew he was trouble. But obviously that didn't stop me. He's killed thousands, many of them with his bare hands, and I still agreed to be his wife. I vividly remember the first day we met. I had been at the club with my friends; the Babylon was the place to hang out at the time. We were dancing-something I was never comfortable doing, but did anyway so my friends, mainly Sasha, wouldn't bitch. There was a guy sitting in the \"rich\" section, as we put it. I noticed him just glancing at me every now and then. After awhile, he himself jumped onto the dance floor. Soon he was dancing by me. At first, I thought he was the biggest moron alive, and I tried to get away. Then he started talking to me, and I changed my opinion. He had a smooth and sexy Cuban accent that caught my attention immediately. We had a casual conversation and not long after he was buying me a drink. I left that club with him that night and had no regrets. After that one, single night together, we became close friends. During those few months, I guess he really grew on me. I found myself wanting to talk to him everyday, and when he did call me I was completely and utterly ecstatic. The night he asked me out is still fresh in my mind. Well, now that I think about it, he really didn't ask me out exactly, but what does it matter? We were dancing, a usual thing to do, when a slower song came on. He took my hands and led me towards the middle of the floor. He wrapped his arms around me, and rested his head on my own. The song ended and we parted slowly. He took my face in his hands and kissed me with so much passion I let go breathless. He smiled at me, and I smiled back, knowing I had found my man. A few years had passed, and things had gone well. I learned more and more about him everyday. He was a Cuban refugee. He went to great lengths to get here to America. Since then he has become one of our city's leading drug-dealers. That was a factor that really should have bothered me, but for some odd reason, it didn't. Half the time, he was killing opponents or trying to make a big deal with someone. And for some strange reason, I didn't care. I didn't care one bit that the man I loved was out dealing cocaine-yeyo, he called it-and slaughtering men left and right. I didn't care that he would come home bloody and drugged up. All that mattered to me was that he was home safe with me. He made a lot of money with all the deals and the killings. Even the death he caused didn't upset me. He took me out to dinner, to beautiful, first-class restaurants all the time. He bought a wonderful mansion and asked me to live with him. He bought me jewelry that I never in my life could afford. He had me wrapped around his finger. One night, he bought me the most beautiful dress I had ever seen and told me to prepare for the night of my life. We went to the Babylon, the place we had met, and without one single word he slipped a rose in my hand. The stem was wrapped around a gorgeous diamond ring. With tears in my eyes, I flung myself onto him, and cried \"yes\" over and over. The wedding was small. Our closest family and friends were invited, and we had a small reception afterward. It had to have been the happiest day of my life. Even our honeymoon being cut short due to the death of a dealer didn't bother me. I now had everything I could ever want. We were married four years without any complications. We both worked hard everyday and came home to spend time with each other every night. There were times when I had to pick him up from random places in odd hours of the night. Strangers would show up at our house asking for him. And still, it never bothered me. Not once. I can remember a time when he would ask my opinion on his job, like if it bothered me at all. We would discuss it for hours, and I would always tell him that he could be a serial killer (which in a sense he was) and I would still love him the way I do. We would talk about having children. It was something I wanted to do, but with the lifestyle that he led, it just didn't seem like a very good idea. After all, I only needed my guy and I had him. Although now, I wish we did have children. He had to go to New York for a week or so to meet up with a man he was going to start doing business with. I had begged him not to go but nothing I said would change his mind. He promised me that he'd be careful-something he's always promised-and he'd be home as soon as possible. I let him go the next night, tears welling in my eyes. The trip must have been cut short because he showed up three nights later in a rage. He woke me to let me know he was home, kissed me softly, and he locked himself up in his office. He emerged hours later, traces of white powder on his nose. He walked over to my side of the bed, made love to me, and told me that no matter what happens, he'd always love me. It was the last time I ever saw him alive. I had fallen asleep in his arms. I awoke alone in the dark, and to the sound of gunshots. He used to tell me that if I ever heard suspicious noises in the house to stay in the room I was in and don't come out until he yelled for me. I curled up on the bed and prayed he was ok. I knew for a fact he could handle situations like this, but I was still worried. Finally, after what seemed like hours, the noises stopped. I heard a loud splash, and then the sound of closing doors. I walked out of the room and began searching for my husband. The house was a shambles. Things thrown everywhere, bullet holes in everything; the place was utterly destroyed. I walked into his office. Nothing. I called his name repeatedly. No answer. I walked to the edge of the balcony and looked down. I gasped and stumbled back, hitting the wall with a loud thud. I couldn't believe what I saw. There was blood everywhere, and someone was floating in the indoor pond he had insisted on installing. I could tell just by the suit that it was him. It wasn't long before I began to scream. Through the years I had been with him, married or not, I had loved him. Despite all the crimes he's committed, I had loved him through and through. He could be considered the greatest American gangster of all time… And his name was Tony Montana. ","Summary":" So, here's my little Scarface story.

His huge mansion empty, except for the bodyguards paid to protect him. Scarface was remembering his old life in Cuba. He loved his country and his family, but he loved money and power more. He absently touched the scar on his face that earned him his nickname. He was so lost in his remorse that he didn't notice he was no longer alone. \"I am Tubbs, the Ghost of Christmas Past.\" Bam! Bam! Bam! Scarface shot the phantom three times with his Glock, but the shots had no effect. \"Um... you did hear me tell you that I'm a ghost, right?\" Tubbs asked. \"Now, come with me to when you were a man of 16.\" The apparition waved its hand, and there on the floor were Scarface's parents. Both dead. A much younger Scarface standing above them. His gun still smoking in his hand. \"Why did you kill them?\" Tubbs asked. \"They stole from me, and nobody steals from Tony Montana.\" \"They didn't steal from you. They found the drugs in your room and threw them away. They were trying to protect you.\" Scarface began to cry. The ghost's voice softened. \"Why do you weep?\" \"Because now I am an orphan,\" the drug lord answered. He looked up from the lifeless bodies of his parents, but the phantom was no longer there. Instead... \"I'm Crocket. The Ghost of Christmas Present.\" Crocket adjusted his Ray-Bans, and, in a flash of light, they were at the home of a very poor man. Bob Cratchit. Tony's accountant. They both saw Bob Cratchit give each of his kids a peso. \"Merry Christmas,\" the father told his children, and gave them all a loving hug. His children squeeled in happiness. \"Where'd you get the money?\" his wife asked. \"It's just a few pesos ,\" her husband answered.\"Mr. Montana won't miss them.\" Crocket felt Scarface stiffen beside him. The wife's sad smile slowly faded before Scarface's eyes. Standing beside him now was Castillo, the Ghost of Christmas Future. They were at the landfill on the outskirts of town, and Castillo pointed a boney finger, as silent as death. Scarface looked at what he was pointing at. It was a large metal barrel filled with cement. Two feet sticking out of the top almost comically. \"Who's that?\" Scarface asked, fearing the answer. Castillo pointed again, but this time it was at him . Tony collapsed to his knees. \"No, no, no!\" he cried, and the world went dark around him. Moco, Scarface's personal bodyguard, ran into the room. \" Jefe! \" he called out, excitedly. \" Que pasa? \" Scarface opened his eyes. \"Moco?\" he exclaimed in relief. \"Is that really you?\" Moco looked at his boss, not knowing what to think or say. \"Oh, thank God! Thank God I'm back. Maybe it's not too late.\" Scarface reached for something on his bed. \"Moco, I've got something I want you to give Bob Cratchit.\" Scarface tossed the bodyguard the Glock he always kept close by. \"Tell him to say hello to my little friend,\" Scarface ordered. Moco couldn't believe it. \" Por que, jefe? Por que? \" he asked. Why, boss?

The Bolivians were gone. The mansion was in shambles. The pool was cold and filled with blood. Miami was silent. Elvira Hancock was in her Rolls Royce, driving to Tony's mansion. She did miss him, and in a way, she would always love him. She just couldn't take the stress of being a drug lord's wife anymore, despite the luxuries. But still, she felt it was proper to say a real goodbye after the whole restaurant incident. She pulled into the driveway and stepped out of the car. Things automatically seemed off to her as she walked to the familiar front door. There was no security around and everything was quiet. Elvira's mind started racing. Something must be wrong with Tony... He would never... Unless there was a... problem... She couldn't breathe and began to run. Then she stopped and lit a cigarette to calm herself. Calm down Elvira. If you know Tony, which you do, he can handle himself. He's just fine. Maybe he's trying to change to get you back. \"Yeah, that's it.\" She smiled to herself and continued the walk inside. Once indoors, however, Elvira was in complete shock. The place was a wreck; dead Bolivians littered the floor like cocaine dust. She walked up the grand staircase to the office, figuring he'd be there. The door was missing and she didn't even have to go in. All that was inside was guns, piles of cocaine, and his sister's dead body. She shivered slightly and turned towards the landing between the stairs to look out. Her eyes focused in on the dead corpse of a man face down in the pool. \"No,\" she whispered shakily under her breath. She ran down the stairs and fell to her knees by the edge of the pool and grabbed his wrist. She didn't need to see his face to know it was him. \"Tony?\" Her voice was cracked and squeaking, but he gave no answer. \"Wake up Tony, please wake up,\" she shook his arm urgently. No words, just silence. She began to weep-sob, actually- uncontrollably, but never letting go of his wrist. \"TONY! NO! NOT NOW! NOT LIKE THIS!\" But there was nothing she could do now. Her head fell into her knees, the only sound being her choked sobs. It was too late to say goodbye. ","Summary":" It was after the shooting. The Bolivians were gone. The mansion was in shambles.

The elves, who were sensitive to heat, were met with the extreme conditions of global warming on the winter of 1983, causing them great bodily harm, rendering them unable to ship off toys to potential users (Children) around the globe. T'was a bad time for the North Pole, especially for Santa Claus, whose present-shipping syndicate had been badly hit by this global warming situation, their profits the lowest since time began. However, Santa did not give up. He needed snow for his elves to keep the business running. Words came around that Tony \"Caracicatriz\" Montana, the king of coke of Miami, had just been assassinated by the Bolivians. Santa saw this as an opportunity, and wanted his body to be claimed back from the mansion for where he was brutally slain in, by a shotgun blast to the back. Santa needed his expertise in the snow, for his business shall not perish before Christmas. He needed to bring him back to life. Tony's Mansion, Miami \"This looks like the body. Jesus, he looks fucked up!\" Cried Sven, whose initially-clean and fancy pastel suit had just got stained messily by Tony's blood, dragging the drug lord's limp body out of the fountain along with fellow elf and amigo Christian, who simply looked at Tony's blood-covered suit, adjusting his shades accordingly. \"Hey! It's blood in, blood out if you deal in yayo, thought you shoulda known that by now!\" Replied the taller elf in the dark blue Hawaiian shirt. \"He's a dangerous man, ahdunno what the fuck was Santa thinkin', all this trouble so that we can send gifts to fucking kids.\" \"'Ey c'mon, Chris. Y'know we're facing troubled times, we do what we gotta do.\" Replied Sven calmly, before dropping the body on the floor and punching his amigo right in the face, causing him to stumble a bit. \"So shut the fuck up AND HELP ME WITH THE BODY! Jesus !\" \"Alright, alright, relax asshole, I'll lend a hand!\" Carrying Tony's body towards the driveway, the two elves dump the dead man into the trunk of the '83 Crown Victoria. Walking to the sides of the car, the two elves got into the car, panting heavily from the rotting smell of Tony's body. Twisting the ignition, the car began to flash its headlights in the cold Miami night, driving away to their meeting place, the La Bamba Club in Ocean Drive at South Beach. That was where Santa was going to meet them both, and Tony, and it was also a place for them to get that well-earned dose of alcohol. \"Miami PD must be on their way now, you sure the trunk's clean?\" Inquired Sven, turning the steering wheel into an alleyway, scaring the hobos away. \"Oh shit…\" \"What 'oh shit', don't tell me you fucked up something as simple as closing a trunk!\" Shouted the pastel suit elf. \"No, I mean. I might have dropped my pen inna drug dealer's body!\" Sven gave a long sigh. \"Fuck that, leave it in 'nere. You can take it out later!\" \"No, I mean, Jeanna seriously likes that pen, y'know? An' this is pretty much the only time I get to come to America!\" The Crown Victoria stopped suddenly, with Sven brashly pushing Christian by the shoulder. \"Go! An' make it quick, cops'll be here any minute!\" Shuffling over to the back of the car, Christian pegged his nose with his fingers and pulled open the trunk. Rummaging quickly through Tony's body, Christian finally felt something thin inside Tony's shirt pocket. Pulling the pen out, the elf suddenly felt the sensation of red, white and blue lights coming closer behind him. Running for the back seat, Christian jumped in frantically, as Sven drove away, trying to shake the pigs. Driving through several alleyways, the Crown Victoria came to a rest inside a derelict car park. Hearing no more sirens in the vicinity, the car was finally on the clear. \"Guess we lost 'em.\" Grinned Christian. \"'Lost 'em'? For god's sake, Chris, are you trying to get us killed?!\" Shouted Sven, throwing behind a glass dome stuck in front of the car. \"They might have taken down the license plate by now!\" \"'Ey relax Sven, we're almost there! See that sign there? We're already at Ocean Drive!\" Said Christian, peering out of the window into the neon-filled landscape outside. La Bamba Club, 456 Ocean Drive, Miami Stopping in the car park of the La Bamba Club and getting out of the sedan, Sven turned around and gave Christian yet another jab across the face, causing him to collapse on the ground. \"Fuck you, Christian, you no-good piece of shit.\" Said the assailant. \"I dunno why Santa even bothers keepin' around a small-time dumb chump like you!\" \"Asshole…\" The taller elf grabbed hold of Sven's left hand, pulling himself up. \"I can't see how you can even bring joy to kids, with you actin' like that.\" \"I just pack the goods, Chris. An' I'm not even married.\" Rebutted Sven, pressing against Christian's shirt. \"I could give a fuck about those little bastards.\" Dragging Tony's body upstairs to the private floor, the two elves were met with the sight of Santa Claus, dressed in a red pastel suit and his signature fluffy cap, who was enjoying a nice Italian dinner. Two Martinis were placed in front of two vacant seats, of which both elves immediately took up. \"Ah, my elves. I see you have brought along Tony Montana.\" Bellowed Santa heartily, taking a spoonful of sauce-covered Ravioli. \"Just give me some time here, and he will be up and running in no time! Enjoy your drinks, boys, oh and, Christian?\" \"Y..yeah boss?\" Said the Hawaiian shirt elf, sipping the Martini and eating the cherry on top. \"Quite stupid of you to just run to the trunk of the car in the midst of a police chase.\" Replied Santa sternly, getting grins from Sven. \"Can't help it, boss.\" Said Christian, finishing the Martini quickly. \"The missus wants a gift from America, an' I can't just turn that down.\" \"And where is that gift?\" Christian made a quick check on his pockets, and he was at a loss of words. The pen was nowhere to be found. Shaking and sweating profusely, he was afraid of what Santa might to next due to his lies, he didn't want to end up on his naughty list, for it is a fate worse than death. Receiving a thought, Santa smiled. \"Aahh… I remember!\" Said Santa jubilantly. \"Jeanna wants a limited edition Gucci fountain pen, am I right?\" \"T-that's right, Santa…\" Said Christian, turning his head down. \"Consider that a gift from me, Christian.\" Replied Santa. \"For your work today. You'll get it on Christmas Day.\" Relieved, Christian simply returned a smile. \"Thanks boss.\" The elf said, drinking his second shot of Martini. \"Anyway, now that it's all said an' done.\" Sven changed the subject. \"How are you gonna revive his body?\" Santa Claus stood up, pointing at a Blade Runner-esque machine resting on the side of a room. It was a large tube, with several flashing lights and green text flooding the black screens, with neon filters placed around it for stylistic effect. \"Introducing the Revive-o-meter 3000!\" Declared Santa proudly. \"Albert Einstein always wanted one of these for Christmas… Too bad that winds were bad that year, who knows what he might have done with it.\" The two elves gazed at the machine with awe, with Sven finally remembering something. \"Hey boss, if you don't mind me askin'.\" Said the shorter elf. \"I don't think Tony's gonna take it lightly when you bring 'im back to life. I mean, he's fuckin' crazy! An' his best friends are dead an' his sister's dead an'-\" \"I can give him Alejandro Sosa.\" Interrupted Santa. \"Alejandro who?\" Questioned Sven, raising an eyebrow. \"The Bolivian fuck who ended his life.\" Replied Santa, smiling a bit. \"He's been on my naughty list for years, and you know I absolutely abhor those children who stay in my naughty list.\" Sven and Christian drank up their Martinis, out of fear. \"In exchange for Tony's expertise in the… snow business, I give him the coordinates for Sosa, and we should be even.\" \"You're the boss, boss.\" Said Christian. \"I think that's it for today, my elves.\" Said Santa calmly, finishing up his Ravioli. \"Both of you need some rest, get up tomorrow for more news, alright? Good night.\" With that, the two elves quickly raised from their seats, returning to their quarters upstairs without saying a word to each other. Santa looked over at Tony's corpse on the ground, wiping the Ravioli sauce off his mouth with a napkin. \"Time for you to get back in business, Montana.\"[Chapter 2] Bolivia, 1983 \" Jefe , we got news back from the boys up in Miami. Montana is dead.\" Said Nacho, the cartel enforcer smiling while circling around the rims of his MP5. \"So whatchu gonna do now?\" Alejandro Sosa, upon hearing the news, began nodding his head and did a half-smile, half-frown indicating a gesture of sarcasm mixed with approval. The drug lord took a nearby bottle of rum and poured two glasses filled with the brown liquor, before tilting his palm foward like a traffic conductor at the chair in front of him. \"You should sit down, Ignacio.\" \"... Si.\" The enforcer did what he was told, while Sosa turned his chair towards the gigantic window to face an infinite mass of endless yet picturesque Bolivian rainforest and mountains. Nacho placed his machine gun on the side of the chair and inspected the finely designed glass, and raised it. The drug lord, taking notice of the faint reflection on the glass, did the same. \" Salud .\" The drug lord took a sip of rum, and the enforcer followed suit. \"Sure, Antonio Montana is dead. That is definitely a good thing, one less thorn on our side and one less liability for the organisation as a whole.\" Sosa squinted his eyes as he could roughly make out a coke lab not far from his view. \"But the ambassador still made his speech about the narcotics trade regardless, and now it has gone national. Because of this, the DEA and the FBI are all over my organisation, and we are now treading on shit's creek in Miami without a paddle, and as disappointing as it sounds, we may never find that paddle, Ignacio.\" The enforcer shook his head in agreement. \"So what do you suggest we do?\" \"...Because we are facing a growing amount of scrutiny on our operations, I propose a temporary solution. I'll make some calls to politicians, law enforcement to try and fan the flames of our situation in the U.S.. Meanwhile, you head down to Miami, and I want you to exterminate every single last Montana-associated drug and transport operations still standing and making money, while establishing more discreet ones in their place. This might not be a permanent solution to our problems, but it will at least keep our heads above water.\" \"Consider it done, jefe .\" As the enforcer prepared to stand the drug lord still had more to say. \"And also, Ignacio.\" \"Yes boss?\" \"You know, as one of the longest-serving members of my organisation please do not think that I do not appreciate the great lengths and efforts that you have made to keep my operation strong. For this I will reward you greatly in money and safety and, in the event of a crackdown, immunity from the law.\" \"I know.\" \"But, speaking as a friend, Ignacio, I request an optional favor, that you can choose to decline.\" The enforcer sat down again. \"Please do.\" \"Do you celebrate Christmas, Ignacio?\" \"No.\" \"Well, you should. Festive celebrations are what keeps us optimistic in the face of the reality of our line of work. Christmas is a time where we enjoy food, the company of family and friends and receive gifts that we desire very much.\" \"Yeah, I heard. So, just out of curiosity, jefe , what did you always want for Christmas?\" Sosa began to smile. \"I was just about to get to that. Are you familiar with John Wayne?\" \"Big American cowboy, goes around righting the world's wrongs, and killing criminals.\" \"And you know what he rides?\" \"No.\" \"An American Standardbred stallion, one of the finest appaloosas to ever roam the plains of the Americas, mane as dark as the velvet night skies during a pampas breeze. Ever since I was a child, I have always desired to own such a horse, I would constantly write to Santa Claus, if you are familiar with him, begging him to send me such a grand equine. Although... In this day and age, they are of a rarity.\" \"I'll try and find that horse for you and mail it back, jefe .\" \"...I am grateful for that, my friend, and my apologies if I may seem demanding to you at this time. That said, I am confident in your ability to produce results.\" \"Not a problem, jefe .\" \"How about another drink, eh? To signify our friendship and trust.\" Gino's Nightclub, Ocean Drive, Miami, 1983 Neon lights spread colorfully across the dancefloor, creating a kaleidoscope of hues as people, under the unholy influence of cocaine and alcohol, began dancing and cheering loudly. It was a dirty dream, America's decadent side came into full effect as people kissed, danced and did drugs to tunes by Berlin, Club Nouveau, Frankie Goes To Hollywood among many others. At this juncture, according to one of the clubbers, the tune that was playing concurrently was apparently \" Penthouse And Pavement\" by Heaven 17 , following another song called Blue Monday , not that the two elves in the club gave a shit. \"How long till Montana gets out of that fuckin' glass dome?\" Yelled Sven over the music. The lesser but taller of the two elves looked over cluelessly at the dancefloor, very confused as to what people were doing. \"Ahdunno, boss said by this Tuesday he should be able to talk!\" Sven changed the subject. \"Ohhh fuckin' hell, Chris. The girls here are beautiful!\" Shouted the pastel suited elf, eyeing at a blonde dressed in a hi cut shirt which exposed her shoulders and a turquoise miniskirt, with way too much eyeshadow for her own good. \"Why don't you go and talk to one of 'em? They'll like you or something!\" \"But I'm married, Chris!\" \"Fuck didja say?\" Christian walked closer to his partner, and much to Sven's surprise, he was wearing his aviators. Dumb fuck . Sven chuckled at the thought. Soon Christian was right in front of the elf, and yelled louder than the music. \"I'm a married maaaaaan!\" He yelled, as his partner closed his eyes and winced. Laughing, Sven punched Christian in the face again, this time causing him to bump against a lady dressed in stewardess clothing who was serving shrimp cocktails. Getting shrimp all over her, the lady gave an ugly look and slapped the dim-witted elf across the face, much to Sven's amusement. \"Fuck was that about asshole?\" Shouted Christian, bleeding from the nose wiping the cocktail off his shirt, before taking his aviators off and wiping them. It was then Sven snatched them away. \"You're a real fuckin' idiot, Chris, ya know that? First you wear shades in a place shrouded in absolute darkness like this, and then you yell at my face!\" Driving his good arm back, the shorter elf catapulted the aviators into the crowd. \"SO FUCK YOU! AND YER FUCKIN' SHADES! \" Upon seeing his 600 dollar pair of aviators fly in the air like that, Christian ran and went for his shades lost somewhere in the crowd. At this instant Sven heard a voice behind him. \"Great job, little man. You sure sure did teach him a lesson on social skills that he'd never forget.\" Said the blonde, with a slight Southern drawl. \"You seen the whole thing, didya?\" Smiled Sven. \"You bet.\" Smiled the blonde, touching Sven's face. \"Otherwise, why would I be talking to you? Who was he?\" \"Just a partner.\" The Midnight Mix of Too Shy had just begun to play in the club, as the whole crowd began to slow down, Christian continued to search high and low for his pair, while Sven and the blonde danced. \"You know.\" The blonde reached closer. \"I like assertiveness in a man.\" Sven continued to smile. \"So what do you say, partner ? how about we head there and do some lines?\" Said the blonde, pointing her fingers at the male restroom. Inside Sven could see several men snorting lines of cocaine along the marble with whatever they could find; bills, straws, even the occasional newspaper strip, while others simply passed out on the floors, mumbling incoherent babble about government conspiracies and drug deals of such. The blonde dragged Sven in and locked the cubicle to themselves as he pushed the elf on the toilet seat. \"What's yer name, tough guy?\" \"Sven.\" \"Youse from Sweden or some place up yonder? Never met a Nord who sounds like he's doing a bad De Niro impression.\" \"You sure you wanna hear it?\" \"Surprise me.\" \"I'm from the North Pole. I work with Santa Claus.\" Said Sven firmly. The blonde laughed. \"Now that's funny as hell.\" \"And wha' 'bout you? What's ya name?\" \"Real name's Madeleine, but my friends call me Mini.\" Sticking her hand inside her shirt, Mini pulled out a bag of white powder, hidden somewhere inside her bra and put it on the side. She leaned forward and kissed hard against Sven. \"We're gonna party all night, little man.\" Just as soon as Mini began to undress both heard the front door slam open, and what sounded like several men walking in. \"All of you, get out.\" Said the man, possibly the ringleader, as Sven could hear dragging and shirts being pulled. Thankfully, the cubicles did not have bottom gaps present in most bathroom doors so the two were never discovered. This did not stop Mini from getting scared shitless. Inside, Sven could hear what seemed like two men pleading in what appeared to be Cuban Spanish, which got progressively more frantic as time passed. Words like \"Montana\" and \"coca\" and \"drogas\" were oft-mentioned. Sven slowly reached for his Beretta, while Mini held on to the elf, wide-eyed and afraid. After some time the voices became louder, with \" ¡Ayudame! \" being the most prominent of them and Sven could hear the sound of a silenced firearm fire four times, following that of bodies dropping. It was then two men spoke in English. \"They was working for Montana?\" Said the first. \"We have plenty more to go. Sosa wants them all dead. So let's get to it. Come on! Rapido! \" This was followed by the door slamming shut. The two exited the cubicle, and the blonde ran out screaming her lungs out after seeing the bodies. Sven walked out of the bathroom to see the club in a state of panic, while trying to look for his missing partner, looking around, he finally saw Christian with his half-broken aviators, who angrily pushed him back. \"Fuckin' asshole, look what you did to my glasses! Where you been?\" Sven, looking fearful, did not respond. The tall elf slowly took notice, and asked another more relevant question. \"'What'sa matter, buddy?\" Sweating, Sven scratched the back of his head. \"...We got a problem.\" ","Summary":" November 1983, The North Pole The snow epidemic in the North Pole was finally reaching full circle,"},{"Movie":"Omen","Title":"Damien: Omen's Redemption","Author":"TheProphetOfWeasels","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12875027","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I ONLY OWN MY OWN STORIES AND IDEAS - NOT THE CATEGORIES He had failed. The Antichrist had failed his only job in life to defeat Jesus Christ and his followers, and yet here he was: defeated at the tender age of 20. He did his best to ignore the scathing stares of the Angels surrounding him, and never let his shame show. His reddened eyes stared at the wooden floor that he hadn't expected in Heaven, almost trying to burn holes in them. The carpentry was absolutely lovely, he could admit that, but he had worse things to focus on. \"Damien: son of the Jackal, the Beast, the Bearer of Sin, Antichrist and the Messenger!\" A booming, deep voice filled the ears of the man in question and made him internally groan. He knew everything that was about to be said, and he just wanting to get the sentencing over with so he could leave. \"What an unfortunate hand you were dealt.\" Damien's eyes widened in surprise, now focusing on his bare feet as the voice continued to speak. \"Born into a fate you could not change, and where none who could help you could reach…\" Damien refrained from rolling his shoulders – an old habit of his – as the words just kept pouring from the literal Man Upstairs. \"So very human, aren't you?\" \"Am I now?\" Damien's voice was quiet, almost no sign of the powerful man he had been. \"Why don't you get it over with? Send me down to burn for my sins?\" One of the Angels looked as if they were going to spit out some words, but the booming voice cut them off. \"Because you would be wasted down there,\" the voice surprised him again, Damien's throat involuntarily tightening. \"You have incredible potential, child, if you are given the right guidance,\" \"I have already failed the only reason for my existence, and I am murderer.\" Damien wasn't sure if he was annoyed, angry, upset or all of them rolled into one bundle of emotions. \"Before me, I do not see the monster that men have made you. I do not see a vicious beast ready to strike at me, as any true servant of the Prince of Darkness would,\" the voice had gotten far soft, and Damien felt a strange warmth around him - despite the fact that he was a soul (quite literally) naked before the Lord. There were a few Angels who were beginning to look uncomfortable with their Saviour's enemy being around for so long, but Damien had yet to see them. \"I see a lost child who has been misguided, a child whose guardian couldn't care less about him, and used him solely as a messenger who can be replaced. I see a boy who is, above all, human.\" \"But I'm not, am I?\" Damien shrugged his shoulders, shaking his head slightly. \"I have evil in my veins, and it has always guided me.\" Damien didn't speak another word as the Angels around him suddenly vanished, walls and décor appearing around him as he fell to his knees; his arms shaking as he dug his nails into his kneecaps. He didn't know what was going on, but he just wanted it all to be over; he didn't want to sit here and be lectured by the Almighty. \"Perhaps if your form was still the Beast, I could believe in what you're trying to tell me. However, the Dark Prince himself made a terrible mistake: he made you in the image of the very entity he despises more than any other. Perhaps he hoped that you would be emotionless and vacant, and from birth be focused on gaining followers?\" Damien felt a hand on his shoulder in a comforting manner, but he squeezed his eyes shut. \"How could he expect such a thing from one so young? I can't ask him myself, sadly…\" \"What do you want from me?\" Damien's voice was beginning to crack, his body shaking. He refused to cry in from of the Lord (what kind of message would that send?) but every part of him wanted to believe what the Lord was saying. He didn't want to believe that no one actually cared, but yet he didn't know why. Perhaps he was far more human than he believed… No! No he couldn't. He was evil rising. He was chaos; he was supposed to destroy Jesus Christ! So now, why was the Almighty comforting him like he was a child who failed to catch a ball? \"I want you to know your truth, Damien.\" There was a long silence as the Antichrist absorbed everything he was hearing. It made no sense, and yet every bit of sense. \"Do you know what truthfully runs through your veins?\" \"Evil, as I said.\" \"No, Damien. Far from it,\" there was almost a chuckle in the disembodied voice. \"My son had to create you, as I did with your counterpart,\" Damien winced at the memory of the battle. \"So, what was the feared Satan before the rebellion?\" \"An Angel…\" \"His blood did not change too much, just twisted. So, I ask again, what runs through your veins?\" No answer came from the man, his back bending forward even more with his fingernails digging deeper into his fair skin. Black hair, sticking from sweat, shielded his eyes from view (although he doubted that literal God needed to see his face) as his brain tried to wrap around everything. He had Angelic blood in his veins, and yet why had he never thought of it? Why was he never given that option? He had to numb himself to death; he'd been led and manipulated into believing all he was capable off was evil. Yet he had loved, mourned, grieved and had hope… Did none of that matter to anyone around him? Damien swallowed a thick lump slowly, beads of blood dripping down his knees, until laughter filled the room. It was a quiet, chuckle-like sound as Damien dislodged his fingers from his delicate skin. \"Well, that would explain why I'm so ravishingly handsome,\" shaking his head slightly in disbelief (he done a lot of that in his life), he admired the spiralling pattern in the wood. \"If I understand you correctly, you're telling me I have Celestial blood?\" \"Exactly,\" Damien practically felt the voice nod. \"I want to give you a second chance.\" \"For Your sake, why?\" Damien tilted his head to the left slightly with question, confused as to why the Lord would want to give his son's attempted murderer another chance. \"I believe you can be saved.\" Damien wanted to laugh at the thought. \"You have good in you; it was there before those around you manipulated your fate.\" Damien's mind was drawn back to his earlier thoughts, but he tried not to let them consume him. He still had a reputation to try and uphold. \"I killed on my own free will,\" \"No one with your fate has a free will,\" Damien stayed silent. \"I can place you somewhere safe on Earth, to rest and to heal, and then you can be reborn: a form of reincarnation if you will. You will still be yourself – with all the memories of everything that has happened – but you will be given the choice of acting differently. This rebirth will allow you to use your celestial blood properly. Just because you are the Antichrist doesn't mean you have to act on it,\" the voice paused for a moment, giving Damien time to unjumble his thoughts. \"I couldn't save my son – no matter how much I wanted to – but I can still save you.\" \"What if I fail?\" Insecurity filled him, once again reminding Damien how human he actually was. \"You won't fail,\" Before Damien could say another world, everything went white.

Like somehow return out of no where. It was better in my head and I'm really tired so I think it looks good when it probably doesn't. Leave kudos and comments if you like. I may write more on Mark/Damien (they were like the cutest and tragic babys of my early teenage years.) Also got some inspiration from my old rp blog and new one (though under a new au) on Tumblr: omenscry for those curious. It was agony, his head felt like it was splitting. Hearing the flapping of wings and what felt like crows pecking into him, bleeding out from his eyes like tears and he screamed out, screamed his name.. but never did he beg to stop he wouldn't beg. No matter how much his mind wanted him to- The sickening sound. He kept staring into Damien's eyes, though his vision began to blacken. He kept looking into the eyes of the monster. He stared as if his only rebellion, showing him that he won't break... Until he fell forward into the snow, the cold feeling heavenly as he felt the pain cease and consciousness leave him... he was dying. And yet he heard the pained scream that felt so far away.. Damien... He was dead and he felt so peaceful and free. He saw the light at the end of the tunnel and heard voices of his mother. He was ready to go home, it would be a nice time. Seeing his mother after so many years of being unable to see her- But it was the sudden fact that he noticed he couldn't move further forward. He reached out, trying to pull forward but the power that held him only grew tighter, almost suffocation tighter. He struggled as the force began to pull him backwards, towards the darkness again... His eyes shot open and gasps for air, the lack of it sent him into a panic. He was in darkness and it caused terror of realization to fill him as he kicked, feeling his shoes and fists hit something hard. He was in a coffin and he was now screaming out raspy sounds as he kicks and hit the lid until his knuckles were bloodied. But the lid finally somehow broke and all that was left was digging his way out, ignoring any stinging pain as the fresh earth got in his injured hands. And the night air filled his lungs but he hacked and coughed hard, his lungs feeling like they were going to come out. His head ached badly but he was alive.. how? Clearly he was dead.. if he wasn't he wouldn't have been in a coffin. He pressed his hand hard against his chest.. and his heart was beating rapidly.. he wasn't some sort of zombie either. He hoped. He looks at the stone... Mark Thorn.. And he knew truly that he was confirmed dead. But he was alive. He slowly climbed out, weakly.. his muscles working slowly. He stood up slowly only to fall down a few times on wobbly legs. He hears a caw and his blood chilled as he turned. A black bird- he assumed was perhaps a crow looked at him with an almost curious expression. He shook his head. Great, now he was The Crow... the reference was all to familiar. He slowly begins to re-bury so no one could be the wiser.. he was dead to the world and he had a choice. Go back to his parents... and face Damien and probably die for good.. or leave and never return... He chose the second choice. He was walking slowly, almost looking like a limping zombie going down the road. The bird following him and after a few attempts at scaring it, he gave up as it just always came back but kept it's distance. Mark was just feeling like somehow this was a dream or his piece of Heaven. But if it was.. than he wouldn't have been in a damned coffin nor remember the fact that Damien was the Anti-Christ.. His walking slowed to a stop at the darkened home. seeing the car was gone. Strange.. He walks forward. The crow flying around but didn't go closer to the house, as if it somehow knew there was darkness there. Mark walks inside after he found the key hidden under the rock nearby and walks inside slowly. Walking on, keeping his steps as quiet as he could. Going into his old room.. it didn't change at all. The bed wasn't made at all.. But he refused to linger on it. He opens the closet, brought out his backpack. He pulled his drawer and took all the clothes he could and closing them. He looks and took one photo of his family.. He looks at his bugle and sighs as he takes it to. He knew they'd notice but he didn't care.. maybe give his parents hope and Damien a great shock but he won't be returning and he wouldn't leave a note- \"CAW!\" The sound was loud and startled him. There, perched on the open window (did he open it?) was the bird who turns and points before he heard the familiar sound of the limousine pulling up- SHIT- He shoo'd the bird and closed the window but he watched... and he saw Damien.. and he looked different. He couldn't place it.. but the smile he gave.. it made him feel sick. But he didn't see his parents.. no where.. Just Damien and fear clutched and he knew, some sort of instinct told him that he won't see them. The head turned slowly and Mark ducked into the room, out of sight. And he did what he did before. He ran from Damien, but this time he didn't dare stop. He refused to stop or stumble. He ran and got out the back door and into the night- not looking back out of fear that he'd see those eyes.. the eyes that were no longer his loving cousin's. It was.. wrong, evil.. and how it just scared him more. There was no courage to stand against him. He ran.. like a coward. The only thing that followed was the crow who's wings flapped and seemed to grow closer until it was flying over him, never going any further ahead. Damien's eyes watching the shadow person run on into the night, the smile becoming a frown as Paul called out. \"What was that?\" \"... A ghost\" Was his only reply, like a whisper. He didn't know what he saw. Or perhaps he denied what he saw. \"Let's go.\" He walks past Paul, walking with pride but feeling It was the first time someone had truly outsmarted The Devil. How he somehow returned to life from The Beast's Wrath. Mark Thorn, the last human of his family has ran and has lived on. Changing his name to Marcus, his hair color. But the crow remained at his side as well as the migraines that came forth, showing what happened years ago was real. Years continued and Mark moved from town to town every few years. His crow always seeming to warn him and keep things away. Sometimes he would find dogs stalking him but the bird attacked them relentlessly until they fled. He fell in love but never could stay. He could try to live normal and happy but the memory and nightmare of demons and Damien haunted him. He made sure to let her go with kindness. It was only when he was hunted down by a priest after over ten years of moving around did he panic more. He was brought to Britain, much to his reluctance. He had been promised he would be truly protected from the Beast's rage and not just with faith or turning to God. And after explaining their plan and situation did Mark laugh bitterly. \"You really believe you can kill Damien?\" \"You can help. If he see's you, he will perhaps hesitate and than we can kill him-\" \"Using me as bait? Damien would destroy me as soon as he see's me. If he finds out there is another Thorn and how he failed.. He will probably decapitate me this time or worse.\" He looks at the crow that tried to get into the window. \"That is a demon you know? How can you allow yourself to be so close to one of his followers and then claim you want nothing to do with it\" Another man pointed out. Marcus shrugs and walks over to open the window, much to the priest's protests. \"I knew this bird is a devil. I had actually expected it to finish me off for the first month. But it isn't. It attacked dogs and other crows before and seem to protect me. This crow kept me sane as well..\" The crow was always there when he wakes up screaming from his nightmares and nuzzles him, showing what was real. Allowing him to hold the bird until he calmed. \"It... he is not on his side. I'm sorry I cannot see Damien ever again..\" \"Is it also out of a lost love?\" \"Damien killed me.. how I am alive is still beyond me.\" De Carlo suddenly pushed the cross necklace into his chest and hand covering it, making Mark yelp but stand still. \"... He restored you...\" \"What?\" \"The Anti-Christ brought you back to life. Death is meant to flow only in one direction.. pulling you back, though it is a powerful thing and probably unknown to him.. it is also shown that he pulled you back from eternal paradise... I'm sorry, my child\" Mark was in shock. The need to snap and yell out his rage at them died in his throat. \"... he.. brought me back? Than- than he doesn't.. know? Damn it... But what do you mean by pulled me back?\" \"He tore you from Heaven. You may not be able to ever go too Heaven again.. or Hell. It is wrong and not meant to happen. You suffer from migraines I've noticed by your medicine. Your brain will never fully heal yet you are alive, you may never die from the brain trauma. He both saved and cursed you..\" Mark lowered his gaze towards the floor, shaking. The pain in his head returning quickly. \"Help us end this Mark. Than we can help you..\" \"I- I- no- I'm sorry. I can't see him.\" Mark breathes out. \"I won't see him!\" He walks outside to breathe out. De Carlo walks out with him. \"He loved you dearly didn't he?\" \"Yes.. but he still killed me.. I remember his cry- and no- it wasn't for show. His scream.. it was human loss. True loss. And he somehow brought me back. But the last time I saw him I didn't see Damien anymore. The love and smile was gone, replaced by something evil.\" \"I will pay for you plane ticket back to the states. Is there anywhere you plan to go?\" \"I'm going back to Chicago. I missed it and with Damien here in Britain, I don't have to worry about him popping up randomly. I will stay here for a few days, I've never been to Britain and I think my crow will warn me if any danger is around.. right?\" The bird cawed in response. \"The Daggers are all that can kill him. I tell you this if.. if we fail. It may fall to you.\" Mark walks on, ignoring his prayer for him. He had never been religious and will never be no matter what. \"Hello mister\" Came a younger boy's voice as Marcus turns. He had been in a park sitting on a bench, eating at some ice cream. The boy smiled up at him but it wasn't exactly a sweet smile, it made Mark uneasy. \"Hello..\" He replied in an attempt to sound nice and polite. \"Damien sends his regards and apologizes for not seeing you\" His blood froze and he almost thought he heard him wrong. He felt stupid for his reply and he should've just ignored him but there he went. \"Who?\" Good job, Mark. \"He knows you came. And knows you've been running like a mouse from a.. Jackal.\" He grins. \"He wants you to come with me and visit him. He insists.. there's no where to run\" He glances at the crow that glared from the tree but couldn't seem to fly or move from the spot. Mark got up slowly and looks at the boy. He swore he saw Damien's eyes instead of the boy's. But he felt the courage from years ago return and he stood his ground. \"I will not join him, I will not join any side but my own. I am leaving in a few days. Tell him I will not stand in his way and all I want is to be left alone.\" \"You have been playing your bugle... the same tune almost every night\" The voice was new and came right behind him. Mark turning and looking at the taller man before him with a smile on his face. \"You've grown up, Mark. And quite handsome to.\" \"Leave me alone.. I beg you, just leave me alone\" Mark backs away as the boy walks and stood beside him. \"I will leave I swear.\" \"Now now. No harm will come to you.. My bird clearly has taken a liking to you and kept my dear Father away. Making sure he doesn't go behind my back and kill you again.. to think I restored you.. so well. Yet you still suffer from the damage..\" \"Touch me and I will show that you can bleed\" Mark glared at the hand that began reaching for him. He looks at the bird as it flew finally and landed on Damien's outstretched arm. \"You are not my cousin.\" \"Yes. Your cousin died with you. I was enraged at you.. You denied me. No one does that and yet you did. I could easily have taken your life from you again. A mere accident, even with your bird beside you. But I wouldn't and it isn't because I knew you wouldn't stand against me..\" Mark sighs as he sat back down on the bench. \"I am the last of the Thorns.\" He closed his eyes. \"You loved me.. but our fate is different. Mine was to die. But here we are.\" Damien shook his head. \"You may go home. And live your life.\" Mark looks up with a expression of growing hope. \"I just want a normal life. If you ever loved me you will let me go and live how I want.\" He lowers his eyes. The boy glared at the other with a angered expression. Mark looks at the boy with the same glare. \"Who is this boy anyway, yours?\" \"Wha... no no. He isn't.\" He chuckles. \"What? Does he resemble me?\" \"Nah. He'd have been crazy if he was. So I was just wondering\" He began to walk away. \"Farewell, Damien.\" The former cousins went their separate ways. Only one looking back. \"Why let him go, Damien?\" Peter asks. \"He deserves life... I did him great evil and this is the least I can do...\" Damien watched Mark's back. He could see something new on him. Something that no one else could see. He could see the feathery wings on his back that sometimes stretched. \"He is the only thing truly beautiful in this world\" The week on, the star shown. Marking the Second Coming. Marcus woke to witness it, feeling a divine power fill him. While Damien woke up in pain. Both cousins witnessing the same star. The crow moving around in the same pain until Mark calmed it down. The true battle of Good and Evil has truly begun and while he should be happy.. Mark Thorn found himself starting to cry and feel a great sadness...

Follows the history of my Why Me?: A Damien: Omen II Story & Damien's Daughter . Chicago, Illinois May 5, 1982 The sun was setting on a spring evening in Chicago. The young woman changed out of her work attire and into a pair of purple silk pajamas after a long day at the office. She poured herself a glass of blush wine from the bottle that was kept horizontally in the small black criss-cross rack that was in the kitchen of her apartment. A gentle breeze was coming in from all open windows. She walked to her bedroom so she could sit at her writing desk and take in the soothing wind from the open French doors of her balcony. Katie B. was not sorry that she had to cancel her lunch with Melissa tomorrow. She had her salon appointment with Sergio made two months in advance. It's not like she wouldn't tend to what needed to be done. She told Melissa she would see her next week. She was not about to cancel her all-important hair and nail session. The buzzer rang while she took a sip of her wine. There was an intercom in all of the rooms so she didn't have to walk very far. She pressed the button with her index finger that highlighted her chipped cherry red nail. \"Yes?\" She inquired in a pointed tone. \"It is me, Katherine.\" \"Come up.\" What could she say? She doubted it had anything to do with the Hines-Soto Project. This could not have been a problem, could it? Katie B. had not heard from Damien in three days. He was busy getting ready to graduate from Cambridge. He harshly reminded her to continue stay to available for Melissa and keep up with the charade of being her best friend. She only postponed their lunch by one fucking week. Was this what had her Uncle Paul wanting to visit her instead of usually going to Club 390 for his usual Wednesday night activity? Katherine put on her matching silk robe off the bed and went to answer the front door. He didn't even wait to be fully inside her apartment before speaking, \"Katherine, just what in the fuck do you think you are doing?\" \"No, 'hello', Uncle Paul?\" Paul Buher put his briefcase on the table went to the bar area to pour himself a rum and Coke. He had a feeling his niece was going to be trouble the minute Damien initiated intimacy with her. \"Is this about Melissa? Because I don't think a work matter would have you this upset. Did Damien send you?\" \"No. I'm trying to prevent that by speaking to you in the first place. You were granted many gifts and you are going to be start being selfish? You can go to the salon anytime. You know that one of your jobs has nothing to do with working at Thorn. You are supposed to be Melissa's best friend and you DO NOT go postponing lunches or other functions. It's NOT about your timeline. It's about Damien. I knew about my role before he even knew about his. Now, you are going to call Melissa and tell her your plans fell through and that you would love to spend time with her.\" Katie B. sighed. She hated being told what to do, but on the other hand, she did not want to upset Damien. Fuck. Her Uncle was right, but at the same time, she wished that he wasn't. Shouldn't being in Damien's inner circle, and sometimes his bed, come with extra privileges? \"All right, I'll call her.\" \"Good. I hope you aren't harboring any fantasies.\" Paul took a swift drink. His niece was going to need to learn how to keep a better stacked bar. This was subpar rum at best. \"What do you mean?\" \"The one where you think you are going to be, Mrs. Damien Thorn .\" Katie B. let out a small laugh. \"Don't be absurd, Uncle Paul.\" \"Melissa was the one chosen, like it or not. I don't care if she is as dull as dishwater; you are to remain her best friend, and best girlfriends do things together. Did Damien not tell you this?\" \"Of course he did. I honestly didn't think one week made much of a difference.\" \"It does when you go deciding the timeline. If Melissa wants to have lunch with you, you go. Now stop wasting your time talking to me and call her.\" She realized her Uncle was not going to leave until she placed that call. Damn. She was not a little girl. Katherine picked up the receiver of her beige touch tone phone and dialed Melissa's number in England that she had memorized. It would be about eleven at night. She hoped she would get the answering machine so she wouldn't have to deal with talking to the bore. \"H-hello?\" Melissa stifled a yawn. \"Missy, hi. It's me Katie.\" \"Katie, what's up? Is everything okay?\" \"Yes. I have some great news,\" Katie B. watched her Uncle's face go from stern to satisfied; \"I can make our original lunch date after all.\" \"Really?\" That perked Melissa up. \"Oh, how wonderful! I know I haven't been with Damien long – in fact, we just got off the telephone an hour ago. We couldn't see each other tonight because he's busy finishing his studies. I'd like to buy him something for graduation. Maybe a tie or cufflinks? I'm undecided. What do you think he would like?\" Katie B. rolled her eyes. \"I think Damien would like whatever you would pick out for him. We'll find something when during your visit.\" \"Okay. Thank you for calling me, Katie. You made my evening. I'll call you tomorrow with the details.\" \"You're welcome, Missy. I'll talk to you later. Goodbye.\" Katie B. put the phone back on its receiver. \"Was that so difficult?\" Paul questioned. \"No. But she is such a bitch.\" \"Aren't you all?\" \"Not funny. If you are done visiting, you still have time for your driver to take you to Club 390.\" \"Not a chance.\" Paul opened up his briefcase that he had put on her glass coffee table, \"If you expect to be promoted, you can't hand in utter garbage.\" He took out the Hines-Soto Project folder and handed to her. \"What's wrong with my report?\" \"It's put together in a very sloppy manner and where did you get your data?\" \"From the archives.\" \"Did you check for updates because the numbers you presented were from two years NOT two months ago. You can't hand this in and expect to be rewarded. Is this the kind of presentation you would hand into Damien when it his turn to be CEO?\" Paul wasn't certain what Damien's plans were to be after graduation. He might use the Thorn name to be an Ambassador like Robert Thorn or run for the Senate. It was undecided at the moment. Katie B. took the folder out of her Uncle's hand. \"That can't be. I'll fix this tomorrow.\" \"No. You will fix it tonight. I'll help you this one time, but Katherine, I'm detecting a pattern with you. Do you even do your incantations?\" It was rare that Damien spoke over his disciples, but his followers still had tasks to do even if he wasn't physically there with them. It was expected of them. There would also come a time when his followers would be too numerous to fit in one place. \"Of course. Do you want me to order any food?\" She was about to reach for the take-out menus that she kept in a side drawer. \"No. We'll eat when we're done. I expect you to do exceptionally well and when Melissa gets here, I don't care how much you hate her, just greet her with a smile on your face.\" She knew not to touch his good refillable pen, so she took a disposable Bic from her Uncle's briefcase and took the cap off with her teeth. \"I promise to do better. I guess I just got carried away.\" Paul smiled, \"We've all been there. Just remember who you are doing this for and why. You do NOT put your needs in front of Damien's or his Father's EVER . Do you understand?\" \"Yes, I do,\" Katie stated, \"Let's get to work.\" But yet that there was still that thought that lingered in the back of her mind where she kept her deepest darkest secrets, Why couldn't it have been her instead?

The Ridgely Academy Chicago, IL August 1986 (Week of the 25th)* The thirteen-year-old girl with the sunny blonde hair and blue eyes could only keep her mouth shut as she sat her desk. She took a black elastic band from the bunch that she kept tied around the handle of her silver hairbrush and put her hair in a ponytail. She was just going to have to let her friend sulk on her bed. She was sworn to secrecy and that was something that she took very seriously. There was a time when you had to put your dolls in the attic away and start acting your age. Centuries ago there were Kings and Queens their age. Her friend didn't have all the facts and it wasn't her place to tell her. Only one person could tell her and he wasn't going to as long as she acted like a petulant child. It was her task to protect her friend, not only from the outside, but also from herself. It was not Sarah McAllister's business to know why her friend was able to live. They knew each other ever since the junior high level at The Ridgely Academy. Ravender Thorn was always her roommate and friend and that never had to change. Their school terms always started in the last week of August with a field trip to the friendly confines of Wrigley Field to see the Chicago Cubs play in a day game for the annual the Ridgely at Wrigley outing that ended with them getting their school schedules and settling in their dorms. The boredom and hunger started to seep in as the baseball game was rained out. Because the cafeteria was closed the kids were left to their own devices to get something to eat. Sarah took a deep breath and turned around in her chair. \"Ravender, do you want to get something to eat?\" \"Not with you I don't.\" Her father gave her bank card back. It really wasn't that difficult to walk to the diner around the corner. \"You aren't being fair.\" Ravender sat up. \"I'm not being fair? I forgot who I am talking to. O Worldly One. But I am the one who is immature.\" \"You are. Once you start acting your age or older I guarantee this will all make sense.\" \"How about if I never care?\" Sarah had to be careful. She hoped that was okay to word things like that. \"That's your choice. I'm human – I have free will.\" Her friend was only half-human. She could never handle the truth about her father being the Antichrist right now. \"Free will to be an asshole? That's some new-age mumbo-jumbo. If you are hungry, Sarah, go your own way and leave me alone.\" \"I can buy us a pizza.\" \"And we can paint our nails and gossip about boys? I'd rather stick my head in the oven.\" \"I….\" Sarah started to say. Ravender Thorn stood up. Why did people have to push her? \"Fine. If you won't leave, I will. You can call Damien and tell him just how unfair I am being to you.\" Before Sarah could respond her stubborn friend was already gone. Outside The air felt good on her face. She wasn't going to go the schools hang out. She'd rather go to obscure places to blend in with the crowd. What if her father did win the presidential election? She'd never be able to go out for a walk like this ever again. If on the rare occasion she was able to, she'd have guards with her. She felt that was a false sense of security. Her late mother had lifetime protection and she still wound up being shot in the head. Ravender knew both Katie B. and her father were in on it. It didn't make any sense at all. She came across a coffee shop with its blue blinking neon open sign and cup on a saucer motif with the pot that \"poured\" a brownish gold light. It was the kind of place where older people went to get away from the younger kids and that's exactly what she needed because she didn't feel like them at all. Inside the Coffee Pot Diner The seventeen-year-old boy with the long brown hair who had to wear it in a ponytail for sanitary purposes was wiping off wooden table when she purposely sat in the booth he was working on. Her instincts told her he had nice eyes and he did. They were bluish-green. \"Hi.\" She faked a coyness. He smiled at her, \"Hi, Ravender Thorn.\" \"How do you know who I am?\" Then she figured maybe he saw her on TV when her father trotted her out on one of the local Chicago talk shows in the wake of her mother's passing. \"What's your name?\" \"Jesse.\" She waited for the last name. \"No last name?\" He nodded. He was so cute and a nice distraction. \"I'm hungry, but I don't feel like eating dinner. What's for dessert today?\" \"Apple crumb pie with French vanilla ice-cream. Would you like a piece?\" \"Sure,\" she started to get the card out of her jeans pocket. \"It's on the house. How is school?\" \"It didn't really start yet. I'd rather know about you.\" \"There's nothing to know, Sweetiepop.\" He went behind the counter to cut her a piece of pie. \"Sure there is. Do you live around here?\" \"I work here. How about two scoops of ice-cream?\" \"I don't want to gain weight.\" \"You won't be, there is nothing wrong with a sweet treat. How is your father?\" \"Why do you want to know?\" \"I'm interested in politics.\" \"If you are eighteen you can vote for him, but I'd rather nobody did.\" \"Why is that?\" He put down her plate and sat across from her. \"Jesse, won't you get fired?\" \"No. So why don't you want anyone to vote for Damien?\" \"Because then my life is over. And don't I deserve to have a chance at one?\" \"You sure do, Sweetiepop. Eat up and I'll walk you back to school.\" Ravender didn't know who this Jesse was, but she started to like him an awful lot. Thorn Townhouse Satisfaction in the Afternoon Damien's Bedroom That was strange and Damien did not particularly care for the unfamiliar. Something was off. Yet, Katie B. was sleeping soundly in his bed next to him. This feeling did NOT wake her up and he was usually tired after good love making sessions. He picked up the phone on his end table and dialed. \"Hello?\" \"Sarah, it's me, Damien. Is Ravender there?\" \"No.\" She bit her lip. She hoped that he would not be mad at her. She NEVER wanted to make Damien angry. \"Where is she?\" \"She went out to get something to eat. She did not want to go with me.\" Sarah was so happy to see her friend return so SHE could talk to her father. \"Let me guess.\" She took the phone out of her former friend's hand, \"Father, I'm fine. I just got in. I went out to eat, because I don't particularly like my roommate. Am I barred from going out in public?\" \"You have to be careful when going out.\" What was this feeling? Even he had no words for it. \"Are we done talking?\" \"Yes.\" Of course, he wouldn't say goodnight to her. Jesse did. He even kissed her on the cheek. \"Where'd you go?\" Sarah nervously inquired. \"On the corner of none of your business.\" She wished that she didn't have to leave Jesse. He was older-guy cool. \"Ravender, I do want to be your friend. I wish we could start over.\" Did she really want to have this fight? \"Well that all changed when you and your father left me alone in your summer house with no electricity. But – you are so worldly and sophisticated that it is only I – a peon – to be left in the dark without any information. I already know about Satan. My father told me. What else is there to know? But I'm supposed to bend over backwards and prove that I'm mature in order to be granted more information? You're all insane. My father included.\" \"You should be treating your father with respect.\" \"Why? He doesn't treat me with respect.\" Sarah knew this conversation was going nowhere. \"I still want to be your friend. I do love you, even if you don't love me.\" \"Love me?\" Ravender laughed \"That's a good one.\" \"I'll save you a spot in line tomorrow to get your Freshman green blazer.\" \"I can do that on my own. Stop trying to be my friend. I'm not yours. I'm going to take a bath and you can lie down and cry in your pillow over what you lost. I, however, have a friend.\" She was glad these suites all had private bathrooms. \"Who?\" \"Not your concern.\" \"Is it a boy?\" She would not let up. \"Sarah, you know what I'm going to do tomorrow? I'm going to the administrative office to get another room, a private one where I don't have to have any backstabbing and nosy roommates.\" \"Ravender, it'll be denied.\" \"Because you are supposed to protect me? Well here is what you are going to do. You are going to call my father tomorrow and tell him I said, I don't need protection and if I do, I certainly don't need it from the likes of you.\" She grabbed her nightclothes from the edge of her bed, went in the bathroom, and locked the door behind her. \"Damn it.\" Sarah sighed in frustration. Her friend was indeed stubborn. There was a better chance of a snowstorm in the Sahara Desert then Damien approving her request. How was she going to get Ravender to like her again? Whether Damien's daughter liked it or not, they were going to be tied together for life. Satan and the Antichrist told her so. A u thor's Note: Thanks to JoanMilton who looked this over for me. I figured, I'd put this up for a character study. Also to the one 'Guest' who reviewed Damien's Daughter , it was not my idea to level the Thorn Museum, that was 20 th Century Fox and part of the film canon. In The Final Conflict , the daggers were found in the rubble of the destroyed museum. In my version I left the museum standing. I'm responding here because I can't leave replies on Guest reviews. And no worries, not every story is for everyone and Damien's Daughter is going to have a very slow build and there will be a plot twist and ending that might offend some readers, that is why it is rated 'M'. I'm taking fictional liberty with the weather and whether or not the Chicago Cubs even played at home the week of August 25, 1986. And also of note, The Ridgely Academy is a fictional boarding school. Thanks to everyone who take the time to read and/or leave a review for all of my stories. It means a lot. Also note: As always, what I put up in these one-shots, will not always be how it will appear in the actual stories.

It is important to note that right away. A user called magsofthemuses did, and while I don't know the original upload date of the story, I had saved a Word document version of it in September of 2012. The story and the author disappeared from FanFiction sometime after 2012. I wrote a story called \"No Fear\" in 2015 to replace \"The Last Great Delusion\", and now, in 2017, having found the Word document I saved on a portable hard drive I have, I can upload the original so everyone can read it all they like, as well as compare it to \"No Fear\" and see for themselves how I did at writing a replacement story in my own words, without access to the original. If you read this story and have any thoughts on it at all, please leave a review. All feedback is welcomed. The snow had ceased to fall earlier that morning leaving the forest surrounding the Thorn's winter estate under a heavy blanket of silence. Mark Thorn sat under a tree, hugging his legs to his chest. His eyes red from a night of reading with a flashlight under the covers. He had never been so afraid in all his life. He needed to be alone and he needed time. Time to sit and to think so that he could figure out what to do. It was hard being alone with his thoughts, letting them churn, he had always had Damien to talk to before. He couldn't do that now. He was alone. As if on cue the soft crunch, crunch of footsteps and a too-familiar voice announced the presence of another: \"Mark! Are you out here?\" Damien. Mark got to his feet and started to walk as quickly and quietly as he could deeper into the woods. Listening intently he heard Damien's footsteps pause... Then start up again, closer this time. He was being followed. \"Mark!\" His chest started to burn, like he had been running for a very long time. His legs felt heavy and sweat slid down his brow. Gasping he stopped and leaned against a very large, thickly trunked tree. He panted. The footsteps stopped. \"I know you're there,\" Damien's voice was calm. \"Leave me alone,\" it came out a whimper and Mark almost felt ashamed of himself. Damien came around the tree and stopped a few feet away from Mark. Watching him. Mark's chest tightened even further. \"Why are you doing this?\" Damien asked, his face betrayed no emotion but his voice held a distinctly wounded note. Was he actually hurt by Mark's attempt to run away from him? Could he even feel hurt? Could he feel anything? Or was it all a lie? \"I know who you are,\" Mark murmured, \"I heard them, Dad and Dr. Warner, talking last night.\" \"So what? That I'm your cousin?\" Even to his own ears Damien's voice must have sounded forced. \"No, you're not my cousin, we're not even related.\" \"That's ridiculous-\" \"No!\" The tightness in his chest vanished and Mark pushed himself away from the tree. Dad was right, he was a man now and he needed to act like one. No cowering. Damien tilted his head up full of pride and arrogance. There was no point in pretending anymore. \"Then say it, Mark. Tell me what you know.\" Mark swallowed around the lump in his throat but he couldn't stop the tear from tracing down his cheek. \"They said...\" He cleared his throat, \"Dr. Warner said that the Devil could create his own image on Earth.\" \"And?\" Mark and Damien's eyes met and somehow he found the strength to finish. \"You're the son of the Devil.\" \"You must be aware of how incredible that sounds.\" \"Yes, I thought Dr. Warner was crazy. Dad sure does, he threw him out last night, but I started to think, really think and I... It answers so many questions, it was like a trigger that lifted a cloth from over my eyes like I could finally see what had always been in front of me. Teddy, school, all the terrible, horrible things that keep happening. It's all because of you.\" \"For me and for my father.\" \"Your father tried to kill you when you were little because he knew-\" \"He wasn't my father Mark, you know that.\" Mark's knees began to tremble and he sank down into the snow, crying. Damien took a few slow steps forward and placed a hand on his shoulder. \"I don't want to hurt you Mark, you're like my brother,\" Damien's voice was soft and gentle. Mark shook his head and pushed his hand away. \"The Beast has no brother!\" \"I love you, Mark!\" \"You can't love anyone, you're... You're a monster!\" \"How can you say that? After everything we've done together? We've been side by side for seven years now and you just want to throw it all away?\" \"How can I trust you?\" \"Why wouldn't you?\" This was all far too much for a thirteen year old boy to handle. Mark couldn't deal with this, he just wanted to run away from this nightmare, run away and leave it all behind so he could get- His mind flashed back to a day not too long ago at the Academy when he had been in the main lobby practicing with the band. Damien, in a rare display, had come flying down the stairs and bolted out the door. He hadn't come back until just before curfew and despite his curious prying Damien had calmly told him to go to sleep. He'd thought nothing more on that day until now. Just his cousin being weird. Oh G- It made sense. He looked up at Damien and saw... His cousin, his brother his best friend in all the world. Most of all someone just like him, someone who understood him and who he could understand. His lower lip trembled and Damien nodded. \"Come with me, Mark\" Damien held out his hand and after a long moment Mark took it. Damien helped him to his feet and then affectionately brushed a hunk of snow off of his pant leg. \"I would have begged you, you know,\" Damien said softly, \"I don't want to do this alone.\" \"You don't have to,\" Mark gave him a small smile and was rewarded with Damien's widest grin. They were brothers and blood had no bearing on it. They were brothers because they weren't really alone in the world. \"I'm... Afraid, Damien. I'm afraid of you, of what's to come, I don't...\" Mark shook his head. Still too much. \"I'm not now that I know you'll be there,\" Damien replied. Mark's smile grew real, he didn't have all of the answers but he had at least one. \"Mark? Damien? What are you two doing out here?\" Richard and Ann Thorn were standing there hand-in-hand, obviously in the middle of their morning walk. Richard eyed them suspiciously, obviously he hadn't put everything Dr. Warner had said out of his mind. Damien put an arm around Mark's shoulder and smiled at his brother, his eyes filled with trust. \"Oh you know,\" Mark said casually, \"we're just hanging out.\" END ","Summary":" The Last Great Delusion A/N: I did not write this story.

A Damien: Omen II Story then please wait until that story is complete before starting this one. If you don't mind the spoilers, read on and enjoy. And a friendly little reminder to stay tuned for the new Damien series starring Bradley James airing soon on A&E.; Trigger warning: Self-harm The Conversation New York City, NY June 1981 She drank to numb herself. What had she done? Not enough. She had not done enough. Why did she run away and not make certain that he came with her? The heavy metal band with punk undertones played in the background, but all she heard was one big loud, thumping sound. It sounded like gale force winds that swirled and hammered around in a tunnel. Every day she stumbled out of bed, took a quick no soap shower, and staggered across the street to the bar. She had no job to speak of and her savings account from her trust fund was dwindling. If her lot in life was to be homeless that was not punishment enough. Why did she run? At least the twenty-four news cycle had moved on to other stories when this became \"old forgotten news\". She may not have literally killed him, but she felt that she was responsible in-part for his death. When she went to the police two years ago to turn herself in they basically laughed at her and shooed her away as if she were certifiable, like the dirty guy on the corner who wore a coat no matter what the temperature and sold pencils from an tin cup. They didn't get it. Her instincts told her to run and she left him in danger's path without so much as saying goodbye or writing a note. They were not each other's great love, but she still loved him as a person. She was the rebound that never really was. The one time that they had sex was good, but she knew he never loved her in that way. He wasn't supposed to lose his virginity with her . She didn't notice the female lead singer in front of her, trying to order whatever beer was on tap. \"I'm sorry,\" The woman with the spiked black hair apologized for being in the other woman's space, \"I'm just trying to get SOME SERVICE HERE.\" She hollered to the bartender to get his attention. \"m-y f-fault….\" \"Excuse me?\" \"You'll have to excuse her,\" The bartender began as he slid the glass down for her for her to intercept, \"She's crazy.\" What a terrible thing to say. It was obvious that the woman needed help. She was supposed to go to a party tonight, but she ignored her bandmates, one of which was her boyfriend, and sat at the bar next to the 'crazy lady'. \"m-my f-ault. I'm an a-ccess-ory….oh…I le-t-t h-h-h-im d-d-ie.\" \"Do you need a place to stay?\" \"N—no. I – l-ive – ac-ross – th-e – st—reet.\" She handed the singer a crumpled up piece of notebook paper that she kept in her pocket. She had hundreds of copies, she gave them to the police, they did not care. She sent them to the media, not one response. No one cared. After all it was the crazy person. The singer almost lost her cool composure. She knew the writing. She knew the name. But these were NOT her words. \"What? This letter is complete bullshit. Who really wrote this?\" \"I have my su-s-pici – ons…\" They were only in each other's lives for a few months. The square and the rock star. … While I was away at school, I met someone else while I was in New York City… … I didn't want to hurt you, which is why, I kept my promise to visit…but I could not look into your eyes and tell you the truth… ..that is why I ran out of Damien's party… … I will always love you, Mark. But it is time for me to move on, Love, Vanessa…. She did NOT meet another man in New York City. She only loved her boyfriend Mark that she was separated from due to the girls parental interference. These were not Vanessa Greenhill's words. She wanted to be with her boyfriend, graduate high school, and get married. She wanted to have that fairytale existence, with two kids, a cozy house surrounded by a white picket fence. This letter may have been written BY Vanessa, but the words were someone else's. \"You are not responsible for Mark Thorn's death.\" But the woman was already passed out from yet another drunken stupor. Hannah Montgomery would never forget seeing those horrible images on the news. The reports were that Mark Thorn died of a brain aneurysm and Vanessa was shot in the head after being held hostage for months, but yet she was never reported missing. But that went unreported because the mainstream media always sucked and never went after the real story. She wrote a song about her friend's demise, but she never shared it with her band. Today the rock star, who said goodbye to her old life once she graduated from her uppity boarding school last year and the rebound girl finally met each other. Their paths crossed for a reason. \"Please take this girl with you…I'm sick of doing it.\" The bartender whined. \"What a douchebag.\" \"I'm taking this chick, home. You guys can go to the party without me.\" Hannah didn't even turn her head around to see their reactions. Ten Minutes Later Hannah did not need any assistance, but for how tiny this woman was, about 5'3\" and 110 pounds, she was hefty. The woman was in and out of thought. Hannah figured now might be the time to ask one important question. \"What's your name?\" \"T-r-…\" She drooled on Hannah's shoulder. \"I'll figure it out.\" It was a small apartment with only four mailboxes, two on each side of the door. \"I hope you are on the first level or that there is an elevator.\" There was only one 'T' selection: T Young. She could feel T. Young wipe her nose on her shirt. \"I have to go into your pockets, to find your keys.\" She found the keys in her side jeans pocket. Her keys were attached to a gold-plated 'T' initial key ring. There was also a keychain with the Thorn globe and a cross depicting Jesus' crucifixion. Hannah sighed heavily. It was not the time to worry about anyone's religious beliefs or the lack of her own. She was able to open the door and T. Young tried to stand up on her own. \"Ap – A.\" \"Apartment A? I'll get you inside.\" This place was a complete mess. The unopened mail was piled up on the entry table. The coffee table was cluttered with notebook papers and magazines. The whole apartment had a musty smell. T. Young was curled up on the black leather sofa as Hannah took it upon herself to go into the kitchen and try to find some instant coffee. There were two newspaper obituaries on the refrigerator held up by a two frog magnets. Mark Thorn and Vanessa Greenhill The girl who tried to keep her emotions private had to hold back the tears as she looked at their black and white high school photographs. Him in his military school uniform and her in her Catholic school one. She found a small canister of instant coffee in the cupboard with the missing handle and two small cracked white mugs next to it. This whole situation had encompassed T. Young's life to the point of her not having one. Hannah turned on the sink and the water made a loud swoosh that almost made her jump out of her skin. At least the water ran clear. Now all the microwave had to do was heat the coffee. When Hannah returned in the living room with what had to be the world's worst microwaved cup of coffee. T. Young was in the sitting position, with her head down, and rubbing her head. \"I can't promise that it will taste good.\" \"I'm e—mbar….\" She stammered. \"Don't be. I think I should tell you my name. I'm Hannah Montgomery and I briefly went to school with Vanessa. Not too far from here.\" That verbal admission caused T. Young to be more alert than from the one sip of coffee that she took. \"Sh—e …..\" \"You don't have to talk right now. I'll stay with you for a while. I'd really like to talk to you when you sober up. I'm going to use your bathroom, okay? After you feel up to it, we'll talk in the kitchen.\" It was better for T. Young to be sitting at the table than to be curled up on the sofa in the fetal position. \"o—k.\" People's paths always cross for a reason. 30 Minutes Later \"I'm so ashamed,\" T. Young and Hannah were in the kitchen at the square table finishing their coffee and eating stale vanilla wafers as there wasn't much food in the apartment, \"I'm Tracey Young…and I'm alcoholic.\" \"I'm not going to judge you. Although, I think you do need help. I wish we met under better circumstances. But I have to tell you—please, stop doing this self-blame. You are not responsible for what happened to Mark.\" \"When he received that letter, Hannah, I made a copy for myself and then I did a real shitty thing. I ran away. I was normal for a while. I was going to take a summer class at Loyola. Then on the first day, I remember being in the student lounge, when the news broke, and I ran as far away as I could go. My life ended that day.\" Hannah felt sorry for Tracey carrying around these burdens that were not hers. That's what organized religion did to a person and that was why she didn't believe in an invisible man in the sky. \"How terrible. In the bar you told me that you had your suspicions on the letter Vanessa wrote.\" \"Hannah, you are too nice. I really want to thank you for helping me and making sure I got home safely. You should go home, go back to your band, be a rock star, and make lots of money. You don't need to know any more. \" \"No, Tracey, I really want to know.\" Actually she needed to know and that scared her. \"That letter may have been written by Vanessa, on her stationery, and the original even smelled like her perfume, but she DID NOT write that letter on her own. She was forced to.\" \"Who do you think forced her?\" Tracey turned around, frightened that someone was in the shadows with a machine gun ready to kill her and Hannah from ever getting to the bottom of this mystery. Her hands shook as she brought the cup to her mouth to finish the now cold coffee. \"It's okay, Tracey, you can trust me.\" Hannah put her hand on top of Tracey's to show support for her new friend. \"Damien…Mark's cousin, Damien Thorn.\" 2 Months Later Hannah and her band had just finished their two-month-trek in the Greater Tri-State Area. Her friend Tracey promised her on that humid June evening that she was going to go to a rehab center and then maybe they could piece together what really happened between Mark and Vanessa, if only for Tracey's peace of mind and to satisfy Hannah's curiosity. Damien was the only Thorn survivor and Hannah thought that, that had to be more than a coincidence. If he was responsible for all of this, he could not have done it alone. Hannah promised Tracey once her tour was over, she would help her figure this all out. She was walking with her drummer boyfriend not far from Tracey's apartment when there was a large crowd, looking up at the young woman on the roof and screaming , \"Jump! Jump!\" No. Please don't let it be… Hannah could NOT believe the audacity of some people, even her own boyfriend, who knew who Tracey was and he still seemed bothered, because getting some new record albums were more important than her suicidal friend. How would they feel if it was their family member or friend? She forced herself to the front of the crowd. Was an ambulance or fire department on their way with a net? \"Tracey, please don't!\" She shouted, hoping it was her voice that would break through to reach her and not these jerks who thought someone jumping to their death was a great way to break the afternoon monotony. Before she could even think of running upstairs to her apartment and to the roof to stop her, her troubled new friend took the leap. \"NO!\" Hannah covered her eyes. \"NO!\" \"She was cuckoo, Babe.\" Hannah turned around and pushed her boyfriend off the curb, \"Fuck you, Keith! It's OVER! The band is over and so are we!\" She ignored the bitch word being bandied about as she tried to remain focused. Hannah wondered if it was now her turn to carry this weight? She went on tour and wasn't there for Tracey. She had no idea that her friend was suicidal. She wasn't there for her, when she probably needed a daily friend to remind her that life would be okay and to count the days without the booze. What happened in those two months? Her dead body was like a pretzel. She was twisted and covered with blood. \"I'll find out the answers for you, Tracey.\" Hannah stated out-loud. She herself might up dead, but there was more here than met the eye. The only thing Hannah knew about Damien was that he was at University in England. She was going to get to the solution one way or another…for Mark, for Vanessa, for Tracey, and for herself. She heard the sirens in the distance. None of these people were able to die with any kind of dignity. It was so fucking tragic. The only thing that mattered was to find out were the elusive whys. Hannah Montgomery waited until the EMT's put Tracey's corpse in a body bag before turning around and walking to the nearest subway stop to go home to her lonely apartment. If she pursued this matter further, she knew deep down in heart, that it was the beginning of her end and she accepted it. She wasn't afraid of the darkness, only the light.

That's what I keep telling myself anyway, when in actuality I knew it was for him. It was all too much for him. I couldn't remain there, knowing that it was me who brought him down. I mean it's not surprising that the antichrist's lover would be a figure of such controversy. The condensation clouded the view through my visor, it had been three years since I left him, I've heard from research and local papers that he'd been doing well. He was well known among the citizens of America. Luckily I myself am in London, it seemed to logical to return to my roots. It also seemed logical because I knew he'd never find me here. Or so I hoped. I picked up the speed of my motorbike, foot pressed against the fuel pedal. I felt a pang of guilt as I splashed numerous passers by on the pavement. I had just finished a day of courses at university, Oxford University that is. I never planned on going to college when I was twelve and Damien was thirteen, he said I didn't need to and as long as I had him then I would be fine. I believed him, until I was fourteen and I realised I had to leave, for me but mostly for him. The pulled up outside the apartment building, I leaned my weight to one side and planted my foot against the pavement. I unstraddled my bike and jogged up the steps to entrance, when I was inside and sheltered from the heavy rain I removed my helmet. Wavy locks of black spilled down my shoulders and a single strand dangled down across my pale face. My icey blue irises locked on to the elevator which like the day before had yellow tape across the entrance marking it as broken. I sighed and reluctantly moved towards the stairs, I was on the top floor and making my way up was going to take some time. I did eventually reach the floor of my apartment and twisting the key to unlock the door revealed my apartment. It was a moderate size, larger than a normal university student's flat. I shut the door behind me and made my way towards fridge, the fridge was stacked and a bottle of J2O caught my eye and I made a grab for it. I pulled open a draw with a tug and my hand locked with the bottle opener, proceeding to shut to draw again with the hip I made my way towards the counter and just as I was about to open the cool bottle a knock from the door echoed through my house. I stood frozen still, it was about ten at night. My family were dead, I had no friends and I payed the rent only yesterday. I edged my way towards the door, my hands locked with the brass door handle. I wiped open the door, before me stood that boy. The one which plagued my thoughts with dark brown hair and dark eyes, pale skin and a mind no other could match. It was Damien Thorn, the antichrist, my one. \"Why are you here?\" The words would hardly form together and became quiet and intolerable, he seemed to understand me though. He opened his mouth to say something but quickly closed it again changing his mind, his eyebrows furrowed and forehead creased. \"May I come in?\" I don't know why I didn't send him away, perhaps a part of me always wanted him to turn up out the blue. But I stepped aside, inviting the boy I loved so dearly inside.

Mark Thorn sat at the base of a tree far away from the house. He looked pale and quite worried. His eyes were sick with fear, and held a look much older than a boy his age should ever have. His arms were wrapped tightly around his knees, more from fear than from the cold, for he had never been so afraid in all his life. Mark didn't know who he could turn to for comfort. He couldn't think of anyone. He had always gone to Damien with his troubles, but he couldn't do that now. There was nowhere he could turn, no one he could tell of the terrifying knowledge he had just gained. He was alone. XX Then Mark heard footsteps; a voice calling his name. \"Mark? Hey, Mark!\" It was a voice he knew all too well. It was Damien, of course. Always Damien. Mark couldn't speak to him now. He had to get away, to hide somewhere safe before Damien found him. Because if there was one person Mark couldn't bear to be near right now, it was Damien. He was scared out of his mind, terrified of what he'd blurt out if Damien found him. And beneath his fear, Mark felt a sense of mourning- a terrible sadness at the death of their friendship. Because he couldn't go on like he had been, knowing what he knew of Damien now. It just wasn't possible. Mark got to his feet as quickly and quietly as he could. Keeping low to the ground, Mark moved further into the woods, then deeper still. He would find the deepest, darkest, most icy, snow-covered place in this entire forest and hide there. As long as he had to, if it meant getting away from Damien. But it was a pitiful, doomed effort, and Mark moaned in despair as he heard movement, barely even audible, behind him. It could only be one thing, and the hopelessness of the situation made Mark start to cry. Damien was following his tracks. Giving up all hope of stealth and subtletly, Mark started to run. \"Hey, Mark !\" Mark ran on, throwing everything he could into the effort, sprinting now, but he knew he could not run very far. He hadn't slept five minutes last night; he was exhausted and terribly frightened. But he had to get away. There was just no choice. Mark drove himself on, running until his body began to give way, his lungs burning with fire and his legs turning to lead. They would soon give up even if Mark wouldn't. But Mark stubbornly pushed on, gritting his teeth against the pain, his pace slowing until it was barely a jog. Finally he staggered and collapsed, face going into the snow. For just a moment Mark actually considered lying there, just giving up and letting Damien find him. But the sound of movement behind him- not far off now- got Mark up again. Straining with the effort, Mark got up and made one final, agonizing sprint to a very large, thick-trunked tree. He ran behind it and collapsed in a heap, eyes closed, sweating in spite of the cold, gasping for breath. A few minutes passed, and Mark lay silent and still, hoping against hope that luck would be with him. That he wouldn't be found. Then Mark heard Damien's voice again, very close now. Just on the other side of the tree. \"I know you're there, Mark.\" XX Mark trembled. \"Leave me alone,\" he said, sounding pitifully weak, even to himself. Damien made a wide circle around the trunk, coming to a stop six feet from Mark. \"Why are you running away from me, Mark?\" Damien asked. His face was calm, expressionless, his eyes piercing and watchful, but his voice- he actually sounded distressed. Forcing himself to sit up, Mark curled up, hugging his knees to him. He stared at the snow in front of Damien's feet. He couldn't bear to look at Damien right now. \"I know who you are,\" Mark said quietly. Oddly enough, Damien smiled. \"You do?\" Mark nodded. \"Dr. Warren. He knows too. I overheard him talking to Dad.\" Damien's face clouded over slightly, but only for a moment. He smiled again. \"So what's the big discovery? Dr. Warren realized we're cousins ?\" Damien gave a laugh at the idea, but even to him it must have sounded forced. Mark shook his head, still refusing to look directly at Damien. \"No. We're not cousins, Damien. We're not even related .\" \"That's ridiculous-\" \"Yeah!\" Mark blurted suddenly, interrupting him. \"Yeah, it is, Damien.\" He trembled, unable to keep the fear from his voice. \"I thought it was pretty ridiculous, too, at first. But I listened. I listened, and- and-\" he faltered and stopped. Damien's face clouded over again, and he now looked deadly serious. \"What did Dr. Warren say?\" It was more a command than a question. It came out as little more than a whisper. \"He said that- the Devil could create his image on Earth.\" \"What else, Mark?\" Damien asked with icy calm. You're a Thorn , Mark told himself scornfully, hating how weak he felt right now, how frail and terrified. Dad was right. He was a man now and he needed to act like one. He needed to face Damien no matter how badly it scared him. No cowering , Mark promised himself. No fear . He slowly forced himself to stand, look Damien in the eye. \"He said you're the son of the Devil.\" XX Damien tilted his head up, full of pride and arrogance. There was no point in pretending anymore. \"Mark,\" Damien said slowly, \"Tell me the rest. Tell me what you know.\" \"I know you're the Beast!\" Mark suddenly shouted. \"Come on! You realize how crazy that sounds, don't you?\" \"I thought Dr. Warren was crazy,\" Mark shot back. \"Dad sure does, he threw him out last night. But I started to think , Damien!\" His voice rose again. \"I've seen what you can do! I saw what you did to Teddy in the hall that day! I saw what happened in the classroom! What happened to Atherton and Pasarian! I'm starting to think I'm crazy, Damien, but everybody said your father was crazy when he tried to kill you! He did it because he knew !\" Damien stared back calmly. \"He wasn't my father, Mark. You know that.\" The brief courage that had come into Mark left him just as suddenly; he couldn't bear looking into those deadly calm eyes any longer. Mark fell to his knees, shaking. Damien was becoming frightened himself. He didn't want to hurt Mark. \"Mark-\" he began. \" Nooooo !\" Mark wailed. Damien grabbed Mark by the shoulders. \"Listen to me! Listen ! Dr. Warren's right; we're not cousins!\" \"No! Get away from me!\" Mark shouted, starting to sob and shaking his head furiously back and forth. \"You're like my brother!\" Damien shouted over him. \"You are my brother! I love you!\" \" Kill me !\" Mark shouted suddenly, snapping his head up to stare at Damien with reddened eyes, tears running down his face. \" What ?\" Damien almost screamed, startled and frightened. Mark hadn't thought he could have ever become more scared than he had been when the sun rose this morning, but he was now. He was experiencing a kind of fear that went beyond any description, too deep and unnerving to even comprehend. Mark knew his life was in danger here; somehow he was sure of it. Damien had the power to kill him, and suddenly Mark was terrified that it was coming. That he'd be killed so he'd be \"out of the way\", like Attila's brother had been. Attila had to, in order to rule alone. Damien had said it himself, that day in Chaplain Budman's classroom. What reason was there not to believe Damien had to rule alone, too? \"If you're going to,\" Mark moaned miserably, \" Do it, Damien. Do it now . Please. I-I won't run. I'll let you, I swear. Just-\" he choked on his own words, unable to believe he was saying this. \"Please.\" \"I won't,\" Damien said, voice trembling with emotion. \"I can't . You're my brother.\" \" The Beast has no brother !\" Mark blurted out. \"You can't love anyone! You- you're not even human !\" His voice rose to a shout again. \"Kill me now, Damien! Do it and save us both a lot of trouble!\" He broke down at that, hiding his face as he sobbed. Damien stood there for a full minute, letting Mark tremble and cry, before he spoke, calm once more. \"How can you even say that, Mark? Why would I kill you? How could I? You're my brother. I won't kill you, Mark. You mean too much to me.\" \"How can I trust you?\" Mark said hoarsely. \"How can we even be friends after- after this?\" \"Why not?\" This was all far too much. Mark was beyond his limits, being asked to deal with things no thirteen-year-old boy should ever have to handle. He wanted to run again, but he had no strength. He couldn't hide anymore. Mark looked up and saw Damien standing there, smiling warmly down at him, eyes bright with energy. And at that instant, Mark didn't see the Beast. Looking into Damien's face, Mark saw his cousin. His brother. His best friend in all the world. The one person he had taken to the moment they met, the one person he had always trusted completely, without a second's hesitation. He hadn't ever given it any thought, had never questioned it. Trusting Damien had felt like the most natural act Mark had ever done. His terrible fear slowly beginning to fade, Mark stopped trembling. His lower lip trembled, and Damien nodded. \"Come with me, Mark,\" Damien said quietly, smiling still. \"I can take you with me.\" He held out his hand, and after a long moment Mark took it. Damien helped him to his feet, affectionately brushing snow off him. \"Thank you, Mark,\" Damien said softly. \"I would have begged you, you know.\" \"You don't have to,\" Mark replied calmly; he felt calmer than he would've ever thought possible at such a moment. His words were rewarded with Damien's widest grin. Mark sensed it then; he could feel it. They really were brothers; blood had no bearing on it at all. They were brothers, and it meant something wonderful for both of them. They weren't alone in the world. \"I'm afraid, Damien,\" Mark said suddenly, his voice quiet. \"I'm afraid of you. Of… what happens next, and I don't know what happens next. I'm just afraid .\" He shook his head. He was feeling better now, but too much had happened too suddenly. He needed time to take all this in. \"I'm not,\" Damien said softly. \"Now that I know you'll be there.\" Mark found it in himself to smile. He didn't have all the answers- not even close- but he had some. He felt frightened of the future, still, and of Damien… but he knew Damien was right. Things could never be hopeless. Not as long as they had each other. \"Mark? Damien? What are you two doing out here?\" Richard and Ann Thorn were standing there hand-in-hand, obviously in the middle of their morning walk. Richard eyed them suspiciously, and right then Mark saw his father obviously hadn't put everything Dr. Warren had said out of his mind. Damien put an arm around Mark's shoulder and smiled at his brother, his eyes filled with trust. \"Oh, you know,\" Mark said casually, \"We were just hanging out.\" A/N: This story draws on text and plot details from two other works. Joseph Howard's 1978 novelization of \"Damien: Omen II\", and an excellent fanfiction based on the second Omen book/film called \"The Last Great Delusion\" by user \"magsofthemuses\". The account by that name has since disappeared, and I have been unable to relocate the story- I only was able to borrow some text and ideas from it because I copied and saved \"The Last Great Delusion\" to a Word document file on my computer. In no way is my story attempting plagiarism; I wanted to explore this what-if idea myself and sought inspiration from an author who had already done so. I give full credit to magsofthemuses for those sections of text I borrow from his/her work, and the same to Joseph Howard in regards to his novel. But I still affirm this is an original work, and one I enjoyed writing.

Apocalipsis 13:1,2 CAPITULO 1 Washington D.C. Un año atrás… -Me alegra que hayamos podido reunirnos, Gene – dijo Damien Thorn, joven empresario de tan sólo 32 años de edad, CEO de Industrias Thorn y, quizás, unos de los hombres más ricos del planeta – Ya apenas si puedo verlos a Karen y a ti por Chicago. Tienen que volver a visitarme por allá. Sé que a Paul le encantaría verlos de nuevo. Eugene \"Gene\" York sonrió. Lo mismo hizo Karen, su esposa, mientras quitaba los platos de la mesa. Ambos eran una feliz pareja joven con un gran futuro por delante: Gene era congresista, un postulante a la Presidencia de los Estados Unidos, y a su vez –en opinión de su esposa– un hombre justo y leal, la persona indicada para ocupar el cargo de Primer Mandatario. -Nos gustaría – dijo Gene a su amigo – pero desgraciadamente, entre mi campaña electoral y los asuntos en el Congreso, sólo vemos aeropuertos. -Dímelo a mí – suspiró Karen, sirviéndole a Damien una taza de café – Sabía que Gene planeaba una carrera política cuando me casé con él. Estoy resignada a ser una \"viuda del Congreso\". -Vamos, Karen – rió Damien – No puedes engañarme… ¡Sé lo ocupada que estás con la Comisión de Seguridad de productos para el consumidor! Karen se ruborizó. Se limitó a sonreír en silencio mientras le servía café a su marido también. -Les ha ido bien a ambos – comentó Damien, luego de una pausa dedicada a tomarse el suyo – ¿Para cuándo los hijos, eh? Un nuevo silencio se produjo en el comedor. Karen y Gene se miraron, incomodos. Ella bajó la vista, avergonzada, y él carraspeó. -Seguimos intentando… pero parece que el Señor todavía no se ha dignado a bendecirnos con uno – confesó Gene. -Entiendo. Lo siento, amigos – repuso Damien, disculpándose. Parecía sinceramente abochornado – Soy un bocazas. -Oh, pierde cuidado. No pasa nada – el joven congresista quiso de esa forma quitarle hierro al asunto – Estamos acostumbrados… -No nos cerramos a vías alternativas, sin embargo – confesó su esposa, para luego volver a ruborizarse y callar. -Humm… sí – corroboró Gene, tomando un trago de café – Aunque las adopciones están un poco… complicadas. Aunque no lo parezca, los congresistas tienen un límite. Como a cualquier hijo de vecino, nos ponen en una lista de espera bastante extensa. Como sea – decidió cambiar de tema, al ver lo molesta que Karen se sentía – Como ya sabes, he anunciado mi candidatura a Presidente de la Nación. Karen y yo hemos estado discutiendo sobre esto y… y nos gustaría que estés en nuestro equipo. -Caray – Damien pestañeó, perplejo – ¡Me tomas por sorpresa, Gene! Yo… no sé qué decir… El manejo de Industrias Thorn me tiene totalmente absorbido… ¿Crees que sea el tipo indicado para lo que me necesitas? -Sin duda – el congresista sonrió – No veo cómo no podrías no estar ahí, amigo. ¿Qué dices? ¿Te apuntas con nosotros a esta aventura política? Internamente, Damien sonrió. Su plan iba a pedir de boca. Pero pese a que todo marchaba como lo calculó, decidió fingir modestia. -Pues… me halagas, Gene – dijo – Pero necesitaré un tiempo para pensarlo – y se tomó tranquilamente el resto de su café. CAPITULO 2 Semanas después… Metido de lleno en la campaña electoral de su amigo, Damien utiliza los vastos recursos de Industrias Thorn para promocionarlo y posicionarlo en la cima. Gene asiste a debates televisivos, conferencias, etc, etc, y gracias a ello –y el hábil y sutil manejo de Damien– su imagen pública como político honesto, comprometido e intachable quedó asentada en la mentalidad y los corazones de las masas. Finalmente, ya cercana la fecha del inicio de los comicios, se celebró un mitin del Partido Demócrata en Calvin City, Pennsylvania, al que asistieron muchas personas. Gene, junto con su esposa, acudieron al lugar y el candidato dio un aclamado discurso. -Administraciones anteriores han ignorado los problemas, esperando pasárselos a las generaciones futuras – dijo – ¡Yo digo \"basta\" ! ¡La hora de actuar es AHORA! Aquella arenga obtuvo como resultado la ovación de la multitud. Tras el escenario, un complacido Damien hablaba por teléfono celular con su socio y acolito en Chicago, Paul Buher. - Según las últimas encuestas, tu candidato ha ganado otros diez puntos – dijo Buher desde el otro lado de la línea – Si sigue así, Eugene York será el próximo Presidente de los Estados Unidos… -No, Paul. Eso no va a ocurrir – comentó Damien, lacónicamente – Lo tengo todo calculado – echó un vistazo al escenario. Gene y Karen saludaban a la gente tomados de la mano – En este preciso momento, mi pobre amigo va a sufrir un pequeño atentado que le costará la carrera política… allanándome a mí el camino para ocupar su lugar. En ese instante, se produjo un disparo. Damien sonrió al ver la conmoción de todos los presentes. Consultó su reloj-pulsera. -Justo a tiempo… Lo siento, Paul. Voy a tenerte que cortar. Tengo trabajo que hacer. Charlamos luego. Bye. CAPITULO 3 Centro Médico Bethseda. Más tarde. Gene York no estaba muerto… aun. Había sido gravemente herido, eso sí. El culpable fue un asaltante no identificado, quien se abalanzó sobre él saliendo de la multitud y le disparó con una pistola. La bala había atravesado algunos órganos vitales, pero York –como se ha dicho– no murió en ese instante. Agonizaría bastante tiempo y, según cálculos de Damien, todavía podría mantener la conciencia el suficiente para un hecho muy especial: el relevo . -Gene, lo siento – se disculpó el joven Anticristo, parado al lado de la cama de hospital donde yacía su amigo, haciendo fuerza por mantenerse despierto y no sucumbir a la gravedad de sus heridas. En el otro extremo, Karen sollozaba desconsoladamente, mientras le sostenía una mano a su esposo – Debí saber que esto podría pasar. ¡Me encargaré personalmente de despedir al inepto servicio de seguridad y mover cielo y tierra para buscar al loco que te disparó! -Olvídalo… - suspiró Gene, con dificultad. Miró a su amigo directamente a los ojos – No puedo… permitir que nada te pase. Ahora… te necesitamos más que nunca… Damien… -Seguro. Pídeme lo que quieras, amigo. Lo que sea – Damien fue muy convincente en sus palabras. Aquél era su don, su talento natural (¿o habría que decir sobrenatural ?). Lo había heredado de su padre. De su verdadero padre. -Estoy fuera… no estoy para ser Presidente… no sé si saldré vivo de esta… -¡Oh, Gene! – musitó Karen, llorando con más fuerza. -No digas eso, amigo. Te pondrás bien. Ya verás – mintió Damien. -No… No lo haré. Y no tenemos tiempo de… buscarme un reemplazo entre los miembros de mi partido… de modo que voy a pedirte algo… -Lo que sea – Damien aguardó, expectante. El momento iba a llegar. -Quiero… que tú seas mi relevo. -Pero Gene, ¡yo no soy político! No podría… -La gente te admira… te han visto conmigo… saben la clase de persona que eres… Por favor, Damien. Prométeme que lo harás… ¡Prométemelo! -Gene – Damien, los ojos falsamente llenos de lágrimas, aferró al congresista de la otra mano – ¡Te lo prometo! Te lo prometo… A la salida de la habitación hospitalaria, Damien y Karen se reunieron. Siguiendo con su pantomima, el Anticristo se sentó en un banco y enterró la cara entre sus manos, fingiéndose compungido. -No puedo creer la fe que tiene en mí, Karen – dijo – Especialmente después de que le he fallado tan vergonzosamente. -No seas tan duro contigo, Damien – lo consoló ella – No pudiste evitar lo que pasó. Créeme: yo estuve allí . Lo vi – Karen ahogó un nuevo acceso de llanto. Damien le alcanzó un pañuelo – Gracias – dijo, secándose las lágrimas. -Y ahora, esto… No sé si voy a poderlo hacer… -¡Sí! ¡Sí que puedes! Gene no confiaba en otro que no seas tú. ¡Tienes que poder! Por favor, Damien. ¡Piensa en el futuro! El Anticristo se quedó mirando hacia el horizonte, en silencio. -El futuro. Sí – admitió – Es verdad, Karen. Se lo prometí a Gene – se puso de pie con decisión – ¡Tengo que hacerlo! ¡Lo haré! ¡América necesita un cambio, para que delincuentes como el que baleó a tu marido no sigan libres! Lo haré. ¡Seré el próximo Presidente de los Estados Unidos! CAPITULO 4 Con Gene York fuera de juego y utilizando su plataforma política previamente armada, Damien se metió de lleno en la carrera presidencial. Así lo reflejó el canal de noticias CNN en mitad de uno de sus tele-diarios: - …Y así, tras meditarlo profundamente, he decidido honrar a mi amigo Gene accediendo a su pedido. ¡Me presentaré como candidato para Presidente de los Estados Unidos! La imagen grabada de Damien dando una conferencia de prensa fue suplantada por el conductor del noticiero. El hombre continuó la posta a partir de ahí: -…Esta declaración fue hecha hace minutos en ronda de prensa por el empresario e industrial Damien Thorn, donde dejó patente su intención de continuar con el trabajo de su amigo herido, el congresista estrella Gene York. Las reacciones a este anuncio fueron inmediatas… y no todas a favor. El presentador del noticiero dio paso esta vez a la imagen grabada de Richard Morton, responsable máximo del Instituto de Derecho. - ¿Es una broma? – preguntó al periodista que lo entrevistaba – ¡Damien Thorn no tiene la edad legal siquiera para ser Presidente de la Nación, en el hipotético y poco probable caso de que fuese elegido y ganase! Personalmente, elevaré una protesta formal al Tribunal Supremo de Justicia para que se expida cuanto antes sobre este caso. De nuevo, retornó el presentador del noticiero: -Las declaraciones de Morton se suman a otras voces contrarias a la candidatura de Thorn, quienes insisten que por impedimentos legales, es un hecho inviable. Fuera como fuera, la cuestión de la elegibilidad del joven empresario se decidirá en una sesión extraordinaria y especial en simultáneo del Tribunal Supremo de Justicia y del Congreso la semana que viene. Hasta entonces, tendremos que conformarnos con especular cuál podría llegar a ser el veredicto: ¿Positivo o negativo? CAPITULO 5 Chicago. Edificio Thorn. Una semana más tarde. -No hay nada de qué preocuparse, Damien – dijo Paul Buher. El Anticristo y él se hallaban sentados frente a frente en el interior de la lujosa oficina que el primero tenía, con una panorámica de la ciudad de Chicago y sus altos rascacielos – Nuestra gente en Washington lo arreglará. Después de todo, es un lio legal, un tecnicismo arcaico y sin importancia. -Tal vez. Pero no puedo darme el lujo de perder el premio mayor – Damien se puso de pie. Caminó hasta un ventanal, observando la ciudad y frunciendo ligeramente el ceño – Estoy demasiado cerca de lograr mi objetivo. La Casa Blanca sólo es un peldaño más para la consolidación de mi poder y la gloria de mi Padre. -Te lo repito: nada de qué preocuparse – insistió Buher – Tenemos acólitos infiltrados en el Tribunal Supremo de Justicia y en el Congreso. Saldrá todo bien, ya verás. De repente, el celular de Paul sonó. Era como si hubiera estado esperando hasta ese momento para hacerlo. El anciano atendió. -Stephenson. Justo esperábamos su llamada – dijo – Dígame: ¿Cuál es el veredicto? Se produjo un instante de silencio. Dándole la espalda y todavía mirando los rascacielos de Chicago, Damien aguardó, expectante. -Entiendo – Buher asintió – Sí, se lo diré. Quédese tranquilo. Adiós – cortó y esperó a que el Anticristo se volviera y lo mirara para darle la noticia – Felicitaciones, Damien. Tienes carta blanca y libertad de acción. Tal y como te dije que sucedería. ¡La Presidencia de la Nación prácticamente es tuya! Damien no dijo nada. Tan sólo se limitó a esbozar una sonrisa, satisfecho.

First was the fake persona like the girl who had to attend dance class that she was not interested in nor did she care about dishing out slop on Thanksgiving for the homeless. Those activities looked great on paper especially when she got older and they would open up doors where she could meet those who could help her cause that she otherwise wouldn't and the Second was the real persona, the true destiny of why she and the rest of a certain few were put on the Earth. She rather hated the annual charity auction ball, why should her assistance be necessary to people who put themselves in their own predicaments in the first place? The one activity that she did enjoy was the yearly ski trip to celebrate the end of autumn and her past achievements and prepare for the next quarter. She worked hard and for a purpose, she wasn't coasting by just to get a job at a relatives corporation like a few of her classmates. She hated her time being wasted, but there was a time for relaxation after all and she pretended to be sick for the first day of the ski trip that was in Aspen because she needed to get some of her more important work done, now that her roommate Alison, who was the type to marry a guy for his money and not use her own brain type, was busy shacking up with her boyfriend in Wisconsin during winter break. So why was she at Kellogg wasting everyone's time? She saw the red envelope in her pile of mail and smiled at the upside down Santa Claus stamp, a little in-joke between relatives. Her Uncle would send her the same crisp $100.00 bill in the mail in the same card ever since she started junior high and she would send it back to him, as she didn't need it, nor want it and they would keep writing on the card. This year he upped the ante and put in $200.00. His words to her in 1978 were: Kathy, Since we both know the $100.00 is being sent back to me (as it should), here is an extra so you can do something nice for yourself. When you arrive in Chicago after graduation next year there will be an office waiting for you. I hear there just might be an opening for you in more ways than one. ave Satani, - P The truth was Katie B. was chomping at the bit. Like the excitement you get, when you finally get to bid adieu to your old life and get to start anew. She took out her red ink pen only because the green one ran out of ink and wrote: Uncle Paul, I cannot accept the extra hundred. I appreciate the gesture. I'm going skiing because I think Melissa might be there. We need to start reconnecting now so it isn't so obvious later. So, here's your $200.00 back. ave Satani, Katie B. (I'll explain the name later). She was going to have tell him, she hated being called Kathy, but for now. She let it go. She saw the clippings in the newspaper, Damien Thorn, The Chosen One, was quite handsome as she knew him to be. She knew maybe someday they'd have some hot-sex-in-between-the-sheets, but she had to get him to Melissa the former First Daughter who was in The White House when Damien briefly lived there before Richard and Ann Thorn came to collect him after the deaths of Kathy and Robert Thorn. He was quite the scholar and dabbled in the right amount of school clubs, making the transition from wide receiver to quarterback on the Davidson Military Academy football team, debate, and yearbook. What a magnificent task she given – to set up the Antichrist with his future wife for persona 'A' to benefit persona 'B'. That was why she chose her nickname, her truest self, Person B.

Canon characters created by David Seltzer and Joseph Howard for the novelizations and also Seltzer for the screenplay of The Omen. Plus Harvey Bernhard, Stanley Mann, Mike Hodges, for the D: OII script. I own nothing. This was meant to be when Damien and Mark decided to sneak with their girlfriends to one of the Vanessa's parents properties for a weekend getaway. Changed to fix grammar and other minor issues. A Fight Between Brothers Originally written in July 2001 Vanessa nearly jumped out of her skin when she saw Damien standing in front of her in the kitchen. Her whole body started to shake he was a menacing figure. She put the glass water pitcher back in the refrigerator. She knew he wasn't going to let her leave the room and go back to the safety of Mark's arms that easily. \"Would you please move, Damien?\" They were eye to eye, his eyes were so dark and brooding like they never knew what real love was. Were these the same eyes that Suzanne looked into and told her that they loved each other? You can't turn your emotions on and off like a water faucet. They're always there. If you have a good soul you can tell. If you are evil you can also tell. You can't fake it. She thought about turning around going out the back kitchen door and re enter through the front but why should she make it easier for Damien Thorn? If he had a problem then let him tell her what it was. \"Listen to me,\" he began softly his voice had the ability to rise even when whispering, \"I do not like you talking about me. You must think I'm stupid to not hear what you say about me to Mark.\" He grabbed her wrist with quick force. He was stronger than most men let alone most boys his age. \"Let go,\" Vanessa pleaded, thinking to herself if he just let go she wouldn't tell Mark about this incident. \"No. Not until you learn to keep your big mouth shut.\" The gauntlet was thrown and Vanessa was not about to not tell Damien what she really thought of him. \"Damien, I fucking hate your guts!\" With the hand that wasn't savaging her wrist he slapped her across the face for that. He didn't have a ring on so the trickle of blood that flowed down it was unexplainable. \"LET ME GO!\" It was as if a shroud of silence was hung over Suzanne and Mark in their rooms as they didn't hear any of this. \"NO. Are you going to stop talking about me? You know I could kill you right now and it'd serve you right. This is a warning, you better stop nosing into my business or else.\" He let go of her wrist and the motion bounced her off the wall as if she were a rubber ball. Later in the morning \"Good morning, Suzanne. Where's your other half?\" Mark was trying to be good and attempt to cook breakfast, but he wasn't having much luck. \"I just woke up, I haven't seen Damien yet. I thought he was in here with you.\" \"Damien cook? Ha ha ha ha! Don't get me wrong he can do it. He got an 'A' when they made us boys take cooking when you girls had do some stereotypical man's work, but put that in real life practice? No way.\" \"No offense, Mark, but I don't think eggs are supposed to be that color.\" Suzanne laughed. Mark thought it would better for all concerned and so did Suzanne if she cooked breakfast for everyone instead. He heard Damien in his room getting dressed. He went to see if Vanessa was in their room. She wasn't there when he woke up either. Vanessa thought she could be strong for Mark, she thought she could hide it, lie-say she fell, but when she Mark standing there she just broke down and fell into his arms. The first thing he noticed was the slash on her face and her red wrist, which felt like a small brush burn. \"DID DAMIEN DO THIS TO YOU?\" It didn't take long for Mark to lose his temper. How dare he! Damien went too far this time and Mark was not about to let him get away with this. Vanessa cried nervously. \"Mark, no, please, please, don't. Let's just go home now. Okay? Please don't.\" \"He's NOT getting away with this.\" \"No, please, Mark. He said he could kill me...\" Vanessa whispered the last part. She was also very afraid that Damien would kill Mark as well. \"Damien,\" Mark called out softly. \"In the kitchen.\" He replied just as quiet. Mark didn't want to do this in front of Suzanne, he knew he would look like a bastard to her for what he was about to do. \"Stand up.\" \"Why?\" \"I have a surprise for you.\" The little bitch Vanessa told Mark. Damien could feel it. He managed to punch Mark first in the stomach, knocking the wind right out of him, before he could get to him first. That infuriated Mark and he punched Damien in the face. Anything to make him look NOT perfect. Vanessa stood in the doorway. Suzanne saw Vanessa's bloody cheek and burning wrist. No. Damien couldn't have done that. And if he did he did do it was probably an accident. This was not the Damien Thorn she knew. \"Come on, help me,\" Suzanne said to Vanessa \"NO! I hope Mark fucking kills him. If you want to stop them you get between them!\" The real truth of the matter was that Damien could have easily killed every single one of them. He also knew it was not the time. As he and Mark thrashed on the floor beating the shit out of each other. Before Suzanne could react to Vanessa they were surrounded like the police that come out of nowhere to raid a house for potential drugs or to take innocent children back to communist countries in the middle of the night. It wasn't the police that would've been easier in a lot of respects. It was her parents, Vanessa's parents, and Ann and Richard Thorn. How in the hell was this happening? Who told? No one saw them. Richard and Suzanne's father got between Mark and Damien to break up the fight. (Only Ann Thorn smiled on the inside, of course.) Everyone there was grounded and would be punished. \"Why are you making sure that HE'S ALL RIGHT, MOM? Didn't you hear a word I said? It's pretty obvious that you favor Damien over me. He threatened to kill Vanessa. Look what he did to her!\" \"Richard, will you please take care of *your* son, he's not speaking clearly.\" Ann smoothed the hair out of Damien's eyes whose breathing was starting to return back to normal. \"DAD! I AM SPEAKING CLEARLY!\" (\"And what made you think that you could be a little whore?\" Was what Suzanne got in the car from her father.) The mothers minus Ann were too scared to talk. They all came from the \"Let the men handle it\" school. Even Vanessa's father didn't confront Damien over what he did to his daughter. The parents gave everyone under 18 ten minutes to pack their bags and Vanessa's mother made sure that no one touched her object d'art and other material things. Vanessa hugged Mark tight. They knew they wouldn't be able to do this for a while. \"Are you all right?\" She asked. Mark and Damien were both black and blue. \"Yeah, I'm fine,\" He lied, \"I'm concerned about you, baby.\" \"I'll be okay.\" They didn't know how they were going to survive their punishment and being apart from each other. Damien and Mark were to be separated for a few months. Sgt. Neff volunteered to let Damien stay with him. It was the *least* he could do. The school had to rearrange their schedules so they wouldn't be in the same classes. They weren't allowed to come home during the two months groundation period. Mark was barred from the band and had to turn in his bugle, which really didn't bother him. He hated being apart from Vanessa but quite enjoyed the break from Damien. Vanessa's parents sent her back to her New York school for the \"stunt\" that \"she pulled\". They couldn't even write letters to each other. Mark was certain Damien got to go home under the guise of being with \"Mom\". Damien didn't lose any of his activity privileges which pissed Mark off to end. The official excuse was that he was the \"star\" of each club he was in and the school could lose a lot of donations if Damien wasn't there to participate. Suzanne's parents forbid her to see Damien. She could only go to school and back home again. No more living in the girls hall, after begging her parents to let her so she could interact with other girls. It was back home to empty walls and hearing parents fight. END Author's Note: That's where I ended this in July of 2001 ","Summary":" Some original characters added.

This timeline is not set in stone as I don't know if I want Damien to be the current President or the former President.

New York City, New York High rise penthouse No year yet ….He didn't expect that reaction. Nor did he much like the vomit that spewed from her mouth and onto the floor getting his trousers in the process. She coughed in between her hysterical sobs. \"Father, you KILLED my MOTHER and you are NOT sorry…..\" Damien saw that his teenage daughter Ravender was ignoring the very fact that she too had the mark but would rather go in this direction instead. \"You are so close to saying something you will regret, child. While I did NOT personally kill your MOTHER, it was determined that she was in the way and would have ruined my chances for re-election.\" \"How could that be possible? You are the Antichrist…and I don't…..\" \"You need to stop talking, Ravender. You have no idea what all of this means, you only think you do. And yes, I HAVE personally killed people who were in the way of MY destiny.\" \"Will you kill me if I betray you? What If I reject Satan and you and praise God and his son instead?\" There she goes again, Damien sighed. \"I'm taking a shower and you are cleaning up this mess…not the maid…but you. We'll talk later when you are more equipped to have a logical discussion on the matter.\" Ravender Thorn did NOT want this burden. She just wanted to know where she came from and why. Damien felt more calm after a very hot shower. He was surprised to see his friend Katie B in his apartment lying on his bed wearing a black negligee. \"The doorman let me up, Mr. President.\" Normally he'd have jumped in the bed to have sex with a friend, but he pulled the strings on his robe tight. \"You'll stay here, Katie. I have to do something first.\" She wondered what was up? Damien was even more quiet than usual and Ravender did not pop out of her room to say 'hello'. You're going to make me do this again, Father. Once was not enough – you're going to make me kill, now it's the only girl, I ever truly loved – aren't you? Of course his Father did not answer when Damien (with the Secret Service lurking around) went for a walk inside the second level of the penthouse that was empty. Doesn't she realize if I wanted to do it now I could? I could do it myself or have one of these security goons throw her in the Hudson River. I cannot believe you are going to saddle me with killing the only other person I loved. How many chances am I supposed to give her Father, you tell me? How many fucking chances ? I tried that before and – well, this was different. She is my blood…and She has the birthmark – and like it or not, fight it as she may, it is her destiny and her free will to decide what she will do with it. And you see where Mark's free will took him. But yes, I could kill her…if I have to…. Don't make me kill my daughter. And then Damien had an idea.

(It's not that explicit but…) And did I mention ANGST!? Un-beta. And AAAANNNNGGGGGSSSSSTTTTT! Damien never thought himself the type to stare from afar. He's subtle about flirting with and presenting himself to girls, but he's never thought to be the type to stare and hope and wish with a dewy doe-like gaze in his eyes. But his cousin was an exception. To Damien, Mark was always exceptional. Damien loved his cousin more than a cousin should. He loved him more than anything. He may have panicked when he found out he was the Anti-Christ, but the night when Mark bothered him about him running, his dreams were sweet. He dreamed Mark was his. The taller and svelte form curled around Damien's smaller one, those soft auburn and strawberry blonde locks tucked underneath Damien's chin. The Anti-Christ's hands were gently caressing the silk-like skin on his beloved's frame. Damien's hands memorize every dip and curve of his pseudo-cousin's gorgeous body and they freeze at his chest. Under the warm duvet, the tender and bruised skin right over Mark's heart fills Damien's fingertips with a pleasurable tingling, knowing that Damien himself put it there. A circle of three sixes, just like the scar-birthmark on his head. Mark belonged to him. Mark shifts as Damien moves and kisses the ring of the Devil's number. Mark shyly backs away with a soft whine, but Damien's arm around his waist prevents him from being an arm's length away from the Anti-Christ. \"Mine.\" Mark gives up a soft sigh and his feather-light touch brushes the back of his hand across Damien's face, his rustic eyes sparkling with sleepy tears and adoring smile. Damien's heart flutters and he can't help but smile back. \"I love you, Damien.\" \"I love you too.\" Mark tucks himself back into Damien's embrace and the devil-child can feel his lover's lashes flutter close. Returning his arm to Mark's torso, he kisses Mark on the forehead and his own eyes lower to cover his own emerald eyes. When they close in his dreams, his eyes awaken to the thundering of the trumpet in the morning. He knows the dream is not coming true even though he's no longer Mark's cousin. But his beloved one and only doesn't need to know that. Mark should never have to know any of this, ever. \"The Beast has no brother!\" You're right Mark, the Beast has no brother. He has his one and only love in the world. Damien's heart can't take any more of this. He wants to beg Mark to stop. He wants to fall to his knees and let those tears melt through the icy barrier that Mark has placed between them. Inside, he's screaming, banging on that metaphorical boundary that his cousin, no, his Mark has made to divide them. Damien wants nothing more than to run over and hold him. He wants to tell him that they can rule this earth together. That Damien will be stronger than even God himself because God can give his heart to no one, but Damien can give his heart to him. He can do anything out his love for Mark. All Mark has to do is say that he loves Damien too. He had dreamed of Mark knowing before, but it was so much different and still vaguely the same. They're in a forest clearing together, a soft sprinkle of snow around them. Their bodies are trapped in each other's, their skins too hot to feel the cold. Sweat sheens on their bodies and Damien lets euphoria drown him. Mark gives off a sound; half-screaming half-gasping and completely in pleasure. A shiver runs up Damien's spine as he knows Mark's body better than probably the blonde knows it himself. He sees the tears well up on the corner of those glossy eyes, the warmth from them melting the soft blanket of white around them. But more than anything, he see his Mark's glimmering heart pour out unspoken screams of 'I love you' all for him. Damien can't resist him like this. He devours Mark's everything in a single passionate, almost burning kiss. Damien knows Mark has submitted into his dominance but the slightly elder boy has such a powerful hold over the Anti-Christ, that a single stroke of his tongue on Damien's and it's clear who the true seducer in this relationship is. Damien moans and draws himself further into Mark, if that is even possible. Mark screeches with ecstasy and that sound is sweeter than any scream of pain Damien has ever heard. \"It…h-hurts.\" \"I know. But you're close. It'll feel good soon.\" Mark's complexion is luminous with the salty tears Damien licks off his face. He can feel Mark's eyes about to slip under as the feeling of completion rings close to the both of them, like a thrumming vibration through both their bodies. He can't let that happen. He wants Mark to see him. See who's filling him with such warmth and love. Make him look at the one and only person in this world who can breathe the same breath and make him lose it at the same time. \"Don't close your eyes.\" He doesn't. When they come, it's in the same one moment, not a single fleeting beat off. Emerald takes in all the pleasure and submerges itself into the gentle washes of the rustic brown-hazel. He can feel Mark's arms around his neck pulling him closer, as if it was possible to meld them both together into one. Damien's face is completely aligned with Mark's; foreheads are pressed against each other, noses brushing, lips only a butterfly flutter away from a sweet kiss. Panting in the same breaths, their hearts are beating in sync, not a single beat able to differentiate from the other. It was the only dream Damien truly treasured. But here Mark is, destroying that fragile crystal with every curse that comes out of his mouth. Each breath of hatred Mark breathes serves only to worsen the ache. Damien wants to tell Mark, here on this snowy clearing in the forest that he's not going to be the monster that Mark thinks he is. And even if he was, Damien would never let Mark see him like that. He wants him to know how much he wishes they could be together. One single kiss to tell him that he loves him. Mark isn't willing to even get close now, for every step Damien inches forward; Mark takes two large steps back. He's trying to separate himself from the Anti-Christ. Damien can't let that happen. He won't stand for anyone trying to tear them apart. He can't let it happen, he can't, he can't, he can't! Mark's strangled breath is all Damien can stand. Because if Mark died screaming, Damien's cracking heart would shatter completely. And for once, Damien wishes something was just a dream instead of reality. It's just a dream. He wonders with each step that he pushes forward, if that shattering sound is the wall that Mark has placed between them crumbled or the last little fragments of his heart destroyed completely. It's just a dream. He is numb to the world; the icy cold doesn't touch his face, fiery tears are unfelt as they burn wet trails upon his delicate face, the trembling shivers that rake through his frame, and the focus of everything else is blurry except for that perfect sleeping face of his love. It's just a dream. He falls to his knees, stealing the first and last kiss he'll ever steal, he'll ever have, or that he'll ever even dream of having. Mark's lips are just as he imagined them to be; soft, gentle, and warm. He is still for all those passing moments his broken thoughts slug through his mind. When the curse of air is too much, Damien almost wishes for asphyxiation if it means he would always stay in this one kiss. It's just a dream. He can take no more than a few steps away before he has to look back at the one person that stole heart away, only to cruelly thrust it back to him broken and in fragments. When he does… It's just a dream. Damien screams. It's just a dream… A/N: I just got yelled at and punished by my mother, but I still drilled to ya. I deserve some sort of review, don't I? But really, I'm so sorry for the angst that I have just set upon you guys.

Chapter One It was exactly three in the morning when Sister Hazel went looking for Sister Elizabeth. The religious-all-girls orphanage school was mightily quiet. The only noise was the creaking of the shuttered glass windows. Sister Elizabeth had gone to check on the girls on the third floor. Sister Hazel was fingering her silver cross. The old nun, well not old, she was about mid-fifties, had her mouth slightly open as she prayed in her head. \"Sister Elizabeth?\" Sister Hazel whispered turning onto the third floor corridor and coming down the hallway. There was an ominous chime of bells in the air that jumped Sister Hazel. However, she waved the flash light around and clutched her black nun's gown noticing that it was the only wind chimes but the sound came again when she noticed the wind chimes did not move. Sister Hazel heard footsteps and just about dropped the flash light when she saw it was one of the schools girls at the other end of the hallway. The young girl was only thirteen years old. Dark red shoulder length hair, black barrettes holding her hair back from her face. She wore a white collard long sleeved shirt and black jumper with black mary-janes and white knee socks. Her light blue eyes held innocence but her face seemed to hold no expression except maybe a small hint of calmness that was unnerving. \"Ms. Rosier, you almost gave me a heart attack. What on Earth are you doing out of bed at this hour?\" Sister Hazel inquired. As the nun took a step towards her there was a low growl. Sister Hazel turned to her left and noticed a large black lab was sitting nearby. Sister Hazel noticed the redhead had not jumped nor showed signs of being scared of the dog. The dog merely glanced at the nun before moving to the redhead's side and sat near her. This just made the nun click her tongue and look utterly annoyed and distressed. \"Ms. Rosier, you know your not allowed to have a dog in school. Please take it outside this instant\", Sister Hazel exclaimed. Only a second after speaking did Sister Hazel smell something wafting under her nose. It smelled like smoke. The nun wrinkled her nose, she ignored it and just pointed towards the stairs with a firm point of her finger. The redhead did nothing nor said nothing, she patted her leg as she walked and the black lab followed, making the nun jump back. Sister Hazel swore on her cross she thought she saw hatred in that dog's eyes. Something about that dog was not right. As the girl and the dog left the third floor, and strode down the second floor and towards the stair case of the first floor, the smoke alarms went off. Reaching the first floor, the redhead looked over her shoulder to see that the kitchens doors were alight with flames. The dog nor the girl were bothered by this and continued on their way. Upstairs, Sister Hazel found Sister Esther and Sister Elizabeth. Sister Elizabeth was on the floor, leaning against the wall, eyes wide and looking frightened. Sister Hazel put her hand over her mouth as Sister Esther looked gravely down at Sister Elizabeth. \"She died of shock. I found her here not twenty minutes ago\", Sister Esther replied quietly. It was then that Sister Lucy came racing down the hallway from the other direction, looking frantic. \"I smell smoke. There's a fire beneath us!\" Sister Lucy cried. As Sister Hazel and Sister Lucy raised to raise the alarm, Sister Esther just stood there, looking down at Sister Elizabeth before looking out the window. Outside she saw the redheaded girl and the black lab standing in the tall grass forty yards or more from the building. Sister Esther clutched her cross, looking into the girls eyes and then the eyes of the black lab. \"God help us\", Sister Esther murmured. Outside, the redheaded girl and the dog just stood there, watching as flames wrapped around the building, engulfing and trapping everyone. The screams of the nuns and the orphan girls were heard in the twilight morning of the English country side. Nobody would hear them out here. Only the smoke would make the people of the world acknowledge such events. The wind picked up a little, brushing against the redhead's hair, making strands hit her face. She felt some sort of power wrap around her. Protecting her. \"Come on Samhain\", the redhead gently spoke, scratching behind the dog's ears, making the dog wag it's tail in affection and let's tongue hang out, dripping in drool. The dog trotted at the girl's side as she turned and walked away from the a-flame building. The two disappeared through the tall grass and down to the the dirt road that would eventually lead to the highway. \"Seven years ago I befriended a boy and watched a nanny jump from a rooftop, hanging herself. A year later, I found a dog in the park and watched my friend, Alison, get hit by a car. And last year, I watched Richard & Anne Thorn's museum go up into flames. My father sent me back here to London, to this god-forsaken orphanage because he was afraid. Because he knew. I named the dog, who keeps following me, Samhain. I read the news papers every day since being sent to \"Sister Mary's School For Girls\" and found that my friend returned to London, adopted by another family who were near desperate to adopt\". The girl smiled, eyes glittering happily. \"Don't worry Damien. I'm coming to protect you. Nobody, including my father, will stand in your way\", Erin Rosier thought to herself. Firefighters and the local rescue team arrived only two hours later after a phone call from some passing cars noticed the smoke from the highway. There were no survivors from the fire. And the cause of the fire was undetermined as there was nothing left to even determine anything. Police Officers and reporters arrived on the scene between the hours of seven am and eight am. \"All you saw was smoke?\" Officer Niles asked. Martin Gibson, of lower London, nodded, \"No. I was driving back to the vacation house me and my family own on the lake and I saw a young girl on the highway. She had a dog with her. I don't really remember much because when I looked at her, I saw the smoke in the distance. She might' have been going for help\". Officer Niles sent several of his men to check the two crossroads on the highway but when they returned they said they found no dog nor no young girl. Officer Niles leaned against his car, putting his hand against his forehead, rubbing his temples. A missing girl and her dog and a burnt down school with dead teachers and students? What a great way to start a Monday morning. If you have NOT watched \"Damien: Omen II\" PLEASE DO SO before proceeding the rest of this story! Thanks!.

Chapter 2 News of the fire out in the country side spread into the news by mid afternoon, as it had taken a few hours for the media to get their story straight and for some people to keep their mouths shut about what had happened. Although it was because nobody knew what had happened there was many-a-speculation. In London, sitting in his big easy chair behind a ebony desk and sipping a glass of whiskey on the rocks, Edmond Rosier was settling into wanting to take a quick nap before his four O'clock meeting later. However, his secretary came in that moment with the afternoon post and she looked frantic all at the same time. \"Mr. Rosier I am sorry to interrupt but-\", the secretary started. \"Calm down Ms. Christy and tell me what's got you so worked up\", Edmond replied, though more gentle than he was with most people since his secretary was religious and tended to get worked up over the smallest of things. The young woman set his mail down on his desk and looked at him, taking a deep breath, \"Its your daughter's orphanage. It burnt down. My husband's friend is a firefighter and he called me to tell me what had happened\". Edmond nearly choked on his drink, \"What-\" \"There were no survivors. Except your daughter. She was seen on the side of a highway with a black dog but nobody's seen her since\", Maureen Christy explained. Edmond dropped his glass on the floor and it shattered into a million little pieces. Whiskey flying across the hard wood floor of his office. The Secretary looked panicked. Clutching her hands against her chest. She had worked for the Rosier family since Edmond's daughter had been seven. She knew why Erin's father had sent her to that all girls school. But the redheaded girl frightened the secretary. Edmond told her it was fine and shooed her out and told her to take an early lunch break. Maureen nodded and left the room. Edmond didn't even bother picking up the shards of glass on the floor. He'd have someone else do it. Leaning on his desk, hands clasped under his chin, he closed his eyes, trying to think. Not about what his daughter was doing or where she was going. He knew where his daughter was headed. He just needed to stop her. Mark Thorn was an orphan but he took it as a strength. Also having nearly died a year ago, he took that as a strength too. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. He had played dead for his cousin until his parents had arrived and then he was put into a hospital without Damien knowing. Mark had spent a year re-cooperating and had learned Erin had been sent off to an all girls school back in London. But the news of Damien's re-adoption had chilled Mark's spine. He was going after her. Damien was always following her. He had followed her over to America and then back to England. Mark had tried to save her after he had learned what his cousin was. Who his cousin was. But the redhead could not have been told otherwise. The fourteen year old boy sat at an airport, he had decided to travel over to England with a friend from his Military School. The boy's family was visiting relatives and this gave Mark the idea to try and track Erin down before Damien found her. Mark was blind to the fact the redhead did not care for anyone else besides Damien and there was clearly something about her that was off. But that didn't stop him from wanting to save her from whatever evil his cousin was obviously was harboring. \"You doin' okay?\" Alex asked, having been sitting besides Mark the whole time. \"Yeah. Just thinking about someone\", Mark told him. \"That girl again?\" Alex wanted to know, shaking his head. \"She's in danger. I told you\", Mark muttered in a whisper. Alex wasn't buying it. He hadn't bought the whole 'My cousin is evil and is after the girl who I like' line. Mark should have told him the story about how Damien had stared at him in a hateful way and almost made his brain explode. Though he was sure Alex would have just thought him crazy. Mark just shook his head. \"I need to find her\", Mark continued. \"I think your seriously in denial that she had the hots for your cousin\", was all Alex said before returning to reading his book he was holding while they were waiting for their flight to be called. Mark glanced away. Nobody was ever going to believe him. Maureen Christy was walking towards a sub shop just a couple of blocks away from where she worked. Mr. Rosier had told her to take an early lunch break. She felt some fresh air would do her some good. She needed to calm down. As she walked, she saw a window of TV screens and stopped to glance at the footage of that morning's fire. She couldn't break her eyes away from the screens showing the firefighters putting out the fire of the all-girls orphanage that had mysteriously burnt down. Without realizing it, she reached up and clutched the small cross around her neck, mouth falling open. She decided to hurry along and get her lunch and go back to the office. Reaching the sub shop, she placed her order to go and stood off to the side. Trying to act calm, she glanced around and people watched. However, as she glanced out towards the window, the window pane was making shadows across the pavement outside due to the sunlight. She couldn't tear her eyes away. The window pane was making a cross-like-shadow on the ground. Maureen clasped her hands over her mouth as though she was about to vomit. The cross-like-shadow was up-side down. When her order was ready, she quickly paid and left, deciding to hail a cab instead of walking back to work. The cab driver was a little freaked out when she started to pray under her breath. She was lucky to make it back to work in one piece and ate her lunch as though she had seen nothing and that her lunch break had gone fine. OMG. FINALLY UPDATED! Oh bad things are about to happen 3 MWAHAHAHA! R & R![Chapter 3] A/N: Sorry about my long hiatus. Life has been super busy! & just lots of personal/health issue stuff has been going on. But I got a lot of reviews saying how much everyone liked this fic & asked for it to be updated. I can not believe how popular this is! Seriously! LOL! Thank you all for liking this fic. I will TRY to update as often as I can! Hope everyone is having a great 2014! Chapter 3 Edmond Rosier and Maureen Christy weren't the only ones who had seen or heard about the news. Across London, Damien Thorn sat in the living room of his new home. Watching the news intently. His adoptive parents were much like his mother and father had been, his aunt and uncle. Rich and in charge of some large estate, some company or whatever. Damien didn't really care. He had done well to be able to go with this family. Thomas and Eileen Lowery were friends with the Rosier family, friends from college. He sat with his fingers nearly digging into the chair as he watched the news. It was in the middle of the afternoon by this time and he felt a great swallow in this throat as though he'd swallowed a wad of gum and it wouldn't unstick. Damien got to his feet and grabbed his jacket. \"I'm going out for a bit, if that's alright?\" Damien called to his new mother. Eileen came out to the entrance hallway to see him, \"Alright. But be careful and be back before dark\", she smiled. Damien nodded, smiling politely and left the house. He went out past the walk way and found the Lowery's choffuer, Bryan. He knocked on the car window, nearly startling the poor man. Bryan rolled down the window and leaned out the window. \"Damien\", He smiled, \"What can I do you for?\" \"I'm looking for a friend of mine. Her school burnt down and I'm worried\", Damien told him, \"Can you please help me find her?\" \"Oh yeah...sure\", Bryan nodded, \"I heard on the news. Erin Rosier was the only survivor\", he quickly got out and opened up the back door for the teen, \"Don't worry, I'm sure we can find her\". As he got it, Damien smiled smugly. \"I sure hope so\" , he thought to himself. Erin had entered one of London's by passes around earlier in the afternoon and had stuck to side streets as she wandered. She had entered Hyde Park about mid away through the day. Her dog companion at her side, panting happily and licking her hand, trotting ahead and staying alert. They didn't meet anyone that seemed like a threat, so the dog just happily lolled it's tongue and stopped to sniff or lay down if she decided to seat herself at a park bench. The redhead was determined to go unnoticed though and didn't stop for long. She stopped to read any newspapers she came across, hoping to read anything about Damien. There was one article about an adoption. The Lowery's had adopted orphaned Damien Thorn. She smiled, ripping the article out of the newspaper. That was a good start to look. Better than expected. She knew, from being a child, this city was huge. \"Looks like our luck is turning around\", She told the dog, scratching behind his ears. Now to find where the Lowery's lived. Damien sighed as they sat in traffic. It was getting later now. People were heading home or getting off work. He was half tempted to get out and start walking. This search was taking forever. Bryan's car was pulling up by where Edmond Rosier's office building was. He stared out the window, hand resting under his chin in a bored response about slow things were going. Erin could be anywhere by now! \"Cheer up Damien, I'm sure she's alright\", Bryan spoke up, hoping to be reassuring. It was then Maureen Christy came out of the building moments later. She was walking past the car, putting something into her purse. She caught sight of someone watching her and looked towards the car sitting in traffic. Just as the lights switched from red to green, her jaw dropped, having looked straight at Damien's face. Something about the teenage boy made her heart stop and fill her full of horror. She stuttered and nearly tripped over her feet. The car drove past her and Maureen was frantic as she ran for her car. Maureen pulled into traffic as well a few minutes later, hoping to get home and lock herself inside where it was safe. Her mind was racing, as though she had looked upon the devil himself. She got into the left hand lane just a few seconds later. About eight cars behind where Bryan's car was. Damien couldn't to look disappointed they hadn't found the redhead yet. \"Pull up this street Bryan, I don't think we've looked here yet\", He commented. The driver nodded. Unbeknownst to them they too pulled into the left lane as well. At the same time, Erin had crossed several street blocks and was now at the very cross walk where the two cars were heading towards. Damien spotted her almost at once as they neared the intersection. She was waiting for the light to change, which wouldn't be for another several minutes. Maureen Christy spotted her too, almost at the same exact moment. Damien, without warning, got out of the car. But Bryan remained completely calm, driving up ahead so he could pull over next to the curb and pick them up. Maureen Christy, in a bout of bravery drove up and got out of her car. \"Ms. Rosier!\" Maureen called, trying to get the girl's attention. It was at that moment, almost in a freak accident, a car came around the corner and hit her straight on. Erin, who hadn't been paying too much attention, looked just as the car skidded by and blood and guts and membrane splattered the street. The piercing screams of everyone nearby. Damien reached her just in time to turn her away in his arms. \"Don't look\", He told her, breathing heavily from having run up the sidewalk, \"It's okay\". Erin just nodded, not too worried about what just happened. Though her fingers clung to the front of his coat. Bryan pulled up a moment later, getting out to hurry them both in. The dog followed the two teens into the car. Erin turned to Damien as he put his jacket around her shoulders. She smiled. \"I was coming to find you\", She said, taking out the newspaper article from her jumper pocket. \"You were never good with hide and seek\", Damien joked, \"I will always find you first\", he gave her a cheeky smile. He took the article from her and crumpled it in his hand and tossed it to the floor of the car. Edmond Rosier was done with work for the day when a police officer came into his office. He looked up from putting some files away. The officer looked apologetic. \"Can I help you?\" Edmond asked. \"Mr. Rosier, does a Maureen Christy work for you?\" the officer asked. \"Yes, yes she does. Is she okay?\" He wanted to now. \"Ms. Christy was hit by a car this afternoon and a witness said she called to a young teenage girl by \"Ms. Rosier\"\", the officer exclaimed, taking out his pad of paper and reading from his notes, \"Now, your daughter was the only survivor of that fire. Have you been contacted-\" \"No, I haven't been contacted about my daughter's whereabouts because nobody has bloody seen her!\" Edmond snapped, \"My secretary saw her and...and got by a car-\", he trailed off, rubbing his jaw and realizing something, \"Son of a bitch!\" \"Mr. Edmond?\" The officer asked in concern. \"It's that Thorn kid!\" Edmond sighed in frustration. \"Excuse me?\" The officer stated again, confused. \"Nothing. Nothing\", Edmond waved his hand, \"Thank you for telling me. Let me know if anything else comes up\". The officer nodded and left, very concerned by the other man's outbursts. Edmond went through his address index before he found Thomas Lowery's phone number, \"Tom, it's me. Do you mind if I stop over on my way home? I need help looking for my daughter\".

She's dancing, an ethereal figure, an angel-like silhouette moving gracefully on-stage. She's so caught up in her routine that she doesn't pick up immediately the penetrating smell, but suddenly her lungs are burning and she's inhaling smoke. Fire. She doesn't understand what's happening, and the sudden wave of heat that hits her, makes her head spin. Her eyes are full of tears, and she can't breathe, she can't breathe, she can't breathe . Fire. She hears cries of fear and pain, but she can't understand if it's her, who's screaming, or the other danseuses. And while she screams more smoke enter her lungs and she's interrupted by a fit of coughs. Fire. She's scared- no, she's terrified. The smoke makes it impossible to see where the exit is, and flames surround her every way she turns, a wall of heat, and death, and horror. Fire. Her heart is beating so fast she thinks it will dig a hole in her chest and leave, her lungs burn and her muscles ache, but numbness is slowly making its way in her limbs and she's so very tired... She'd like to close her eyes, and sleep, and- Suddenly the ceiling cracks and comes tumbling down. She's not fast enough. Fire. She feels it on her skin and it's so soft and thin, and it could almost do not exist. But then it's hot, and angry, and it hurts. It hurts . She can't move and it hurts. And it's not only the fire, it's also one of the beams that has her legs trapped. She can't run away. She's trapped. She can't run away. It hurts. Fire. She stops fighting. The sudden revelation she's been abandoned there to die hits her like a train. She's going to die in there. In the burning hell her favourite place in the world has become. But she doesn't dwell much on those thoughts, because the pain makes it impossible for her to concentrate even on the smallest of things. Fire. It's subsiding, she notices. The pain is replaced by numbness every passing second, and she's grateful, because this way she can finally rest. Her head feels like it's stuffed with wool, and her eyelids are so, so heavy. She's gonna die here, she thinks, she deserves a little sleep. Fire. It's silly, but she can't not notice the stark contrast between the bright (too bright) flames and the blackness she knows awaits behind her closed eyelids. It's silly. But then someone makes its way in that roaring inferno and frees her from beneath the beam. She's barely aware she's being picked up and that she's being taken out of there. Her eyes finally close and she blacks out. Even then, she dreams of fire. NOTES HERE: I saw the movie early on last year, and I thought it was nice. I saw it again recently, three days ago, for the sake of precision, and again thought it was nice. Full of anachronisms and- not right things, but nice. And so a sudden wave of passion for this movie and its characters came to be within me. That's how this fic was born :) Definitely, what caught me in this movie were the characters, three in particular. One, as y'all have probably already guessed, is Odette. Who's she? What's the deal with her? We just have Merante's words \"the best of her generation\", \"there was a fire\". If she was the best, how comes no one knows her? Not even people who should know her? A fire. What happened? What happened? If you search deep enough, you'll probably find she's a \"happy ending\" version of a real person, Emma Livry. And I could go on hours about Odette, but I'll stop here. Hope you liked this little thingy :) ","Summary":" Fire.

Odette s'inquiéta aussitôt : elle n'aimait pas entendre la voix de Félicie si fébrile. Félicie, habituellement gaie et enthousiaste, ne parlait pas d'un tel ton, sauf quand ça n'allait pas. Aussitôt elle arrêta ce qu'elle faisait et se tourna vers sa protégée. — Qui y-a-t-il, Félicie ? Son inquiétude ne fit que grandir en voyant la jeune fille se tordre nerveusement les doigts, regardant partout, sauf vers Odette. — Je réfléchissais à quelque chose, dit finalement Félicie.

Félicie l'avait bien comprit lorsque Mérante l'informa que les cours reprenaient. Elle retourna donc suivre les cours de Mérante et fut heureuse de retrouver ses amies, avec lesquelles elle ne s'entrainait plus depuis qu'elles avaient été renvoyées par Mérante. Il y avait tout de même une différence par rapport aux cours précédents : la présence de Camille Le Haut. Une chose fut certaine : Dora et Nora furent très surprises de voir Félicie se diriger vers sa grande rivale et bavarder joyeusement avec elle. Depuis quand ces deux-là étaient amies ? . 3. Une histoire abracadabrante. — Vous avez... quoi ? Félicie grimaça et chuchota à Victor : — Je t'avais dit qu'elle n'apprécierait pas ! Pour toute réponde, Victor haussa les épaules. Cela c'était quand même mieux passé que prévu. Et puis, il ne voyait pas ce qu'il y avait de grave dans le fait d'avoir sauvé Félicie des griffes de l'affreuse sorcière de mère de Camille Le Haut grâce à son ingénieuse invention. C'était bien la preuve qu'elles fonctionnaient, ses ailes ! En plus, le plus important était que Félicie soit arrivée à tant pour le ballet, non ? Le regard aussi épouvanté qu'incrédule d'Odette semblait dire que non. . 4. Le secret du maitre. C'était bizarre : Mérante paraissait timide. Il ne parvenait même pas à rester droit, gigotant nerveusement alors qu'il semblait peiner à regarder Odette. Et pourquoi était-il tout rouge ? Félicie trouvait cela assez bizarre, tout comme Odette. — Mérante, tout va bien ? demanda Odette. — Très bien ! assura précipitamment Mérante. En fait, je voulais te voir pour... euh... te demander si... Il jeta un rapide coup d'œil à Félicie, qui hocha la tête pour l'encourager. Finalement le professeur de l'Opéra toussa maladroitement et reprit, avec plus d'assurance : — Je me demandais si cela te dirais de te promener avec moi au bord de la Seine ce soir ? Félicie ne put s'empêcher de pouffer. Qui aurait cru que son professeur de danse si sévère était un grand romantique maladroit ? . 5. Un garçon trop collant. — Minouchka ! — Oh non... Félicie soupira, levant les yeux au ciel. Elle reconnaissait cette voix. C'était Rudi. Bon sang, que ce garçon était collant ! Son prince russe apparut, un grand sourire aux lèvres. — Je n'ai pas eu l'occasion de te féliciter pour ta prestation sur scène, l'autre jour ! Tu ne m'as pas vu dans les coulisses, avec les autres ? — Euh... Félicie rit nerveusement, à la recherche d'une excuse potable. — Je... il faut croire que j'étais trop obnubilée par ce que je venais de faire, dit-elle finalement. D'ailleurs, en parlant de ça... il faut que j'y aille ! — A-attends, Minouchka ! Alors que Félicie partait en courant, Rudi passa une main dans ses cheveux, perplexe. Son charme n'agissait plus ? . 6. Promesse. — Odette ? Est-ce qu'un jour on pourra danser ensemble ? Autant dire qu'Odette ne s'attendait pas à cette question, surtout alors que Félicie l'aidait à nettoyer la salle de spectacle. — Pourquoi demandes-tu ça, Félicie ? Tu sais bien que je ne peux pas danser. — Je sais, mais juste une toute petite danse. Juste pour nous deux ! Allez, s'il-te-plait ! Odette leva les yeux au ciel devant l'insistance de Félicie, qui la regardait avec espoir. — Bon, d'accord, mais juste une danse. — Super ! s'écria Félice en bondissant de joie. — Félicie, tu vas salir le parquet ! — Oups, désolée ! Odette soupira. Elle ne pouvait vraiment pas dire non à sa protégée. . 7. Amitié. Si on avait dit cela un jour à Odette, elle n'y aurait pas cru. Pourtant c'était vrai, et cela se passait devant ses yeux : Félicie et Camille s'amusaient à danser ensembles. — Non, Félicie, il n'y a pas tout ça de pirouettes. Ce n'est pas la chorégraphie. — Mais c'est amusant de faire des pirouettes ! Et puis on s'en fiche, de la chorégraphie, non ? On fait ça juste pour s'amuser. — S'amuser ? La danse, ce n'est pas un jeu ! — Bien sûr que si ! Odette sourit et referma doucement la porte derrière elle. C'était une bonne chose que ces deux-là soient devenues amies. Déjà parce que comme ça, Félicie n'errait pas toute la journée sans occupation et ne venait plus harceler Odette pour qu'elles fassent quelque chose. Et ça, ça n'avait pas de prix. . 8. Indiscrétion enfantine. Félicie ne put s'en empêcher, c'était plus fort qu'elle. Discrètement, elle passa sa tête par la fenêtre et regarda en contrebas, devant le portail, où se trouvaient Mérante et Odette, qui revenaient de leur soirée en amoureux. — Félicie, on peut savoir ce que tu fais ? — Chut ! Avant que Camille ne puisse protester – comme pour se plaindre qu'on ne disait pas « chut » à une Le Haut –, Félicie lui fit signe d'approcher. — Il y a Odette et Mérante qui dansent la valse ! chuchota-t-elle en souriant. Ainsi, les deux petites filles se retrouvèrent à espionner le duo d'adulte qui dansait sous le clair de lune, l'air plus amoureux que jamais. . 9. Surveillance. Victor déglutit. Madame Odette pouvait être aussi gentille que disait Félicie, en le regardant suspicieusement comme ça, Victor était certain qu'Odette n'était gentille qu'avec une personne : sa protégée. — Tu prends bien soin d'elle, c'est entendu ? — O-oui madame ! répondit Victor. — Et vous revenez avant minuit. — B-bien sûr, madame ! — Et s'il lui arrive quoi que ce soit, je te tiendrais pour responsable, est-ce clair ? — T-très clair, madame ! Madame Odette se redressa, souriant. — Bien, je t'autorise à la sortir ce soir. Victor souffla bruyamment, passant une main sur son front. Il ne pensait pas que Madame Odette pouvait être encore plus effrayante que cette sorcière de Régine Le Haut... . 10. Comment être amie avec Félicie. — Ce serait bien qu'on puisse danser ensemble sur scène. Camille sourit moqueusement, rendant Félicie dubitative. — Quoi ? Qu'est-ce que j'ai dit ? Ce n'est pas une bonne idée ? Après tout, on forme un super duo ! — Félicie, nous sommes rivales. Nous ne pouvons pas danser ensemble, voyons. Félicie croisa les bras, pensive. Après quelques secondes – durant lesquelles Camille crut que le cerveau de Félicie exploserait à force de trop réfléchir –, le visage de Félicie s'illumina. — Je sais pourquoi on peut danser ensemble. — Vraiment ? Pourquoi donc ? Avant de répondre, Félicie se rapprocha de Camille et joignit leurs mains ensembles. — Parce qu'on est amies ! Les amies se poussent bien vers le haut, n'est-ce pas ? Alors nous sommes amies ! . 11. Chez les bretons. — Alors c'est ça que vous appelez... une fête. Camille grimaça. Elle regrettait déjà d'avoir accepté l'invitation de Félicie à la rejoindre, elle et son ami maladroit bizarre – Vicky, Vincent ? – alors qu'ils se rendaient à une fête. Bêtement, elle avait accepté. Elle aurait refusé, si elle savait que cette « fête » consistait à être dans un bar breton où ne se trouvaient que des gens louches ayant bien trop bu. — Tu vas voir, on va bien s'amuser ! assura Félicie. Camille en doutait, mais puisqu'elle était déjà là... autant essayer de passer un bon moment. . 12. Le premier concours. Un concours n'était pas la même chose qu'une sélection pour jouer dans Casse-Noisette. Sauf que lorsqu'on avait été à l'Opéra de Paris en tant qu'élève du grand et sévère Mérante et qu'on était monté sur scène aux côtés d'une étoile, un concours n'était rien d'effrayant. Félicie n'était donc pas si inquiète, contrairement à bien d'autres ballerines à ses côtés. — Tu es stressée, Camille ? — S-stressée ? répéta la blonde en grinçant des dents. Moi ? Pff, c'est ridicule. Félicie posa une main sur l'épaule de Camille, souriante. — Ne t'en fais pas, tout se passera bien. Après tout, un concours n'était pas pareil qu'avoir un rôle dans Casse-Noisette aux côtés de la célèbre Rosita Mauri. . 13. L'avantage de l'hiver. L'hiver était enfin tombé sur Paris. Il était amusant de voir l'émerveillement de Félicie face à la neige qui tombait sur Paris, même si elle grelottait beaucoup. Odette prit note d'acheter un manteau pour Félicie, en ayant emprunté un à Camille – qui l'avait gentiment proposé – en attendant. Bien sûr l'hiver n'avait pas que des avantages : il faisait froid le soir, même avec le feu de cheminée. Cela n'empêcha pas Odette d'être surprise lorsqu'elle sentit, alors qu'elle tentait de dormir, Félicie se glisser sous les couvertures et venir se blottir contre elle. — Je peux dormir avec toi ? J'ai froid. Pour toute réponse, Odette sourit et enlaça sa protégée. . 14. Orphelin. Odette secoua la tête, croisant les bras. — C'est non, Félicie. — Mais enfin, regarde-le ! Il est tout seul le pauvre ! On ne peut pas le laisser là... — Si, on peut. — Mais ça serait méchant ! Allez, s'il-te-plait ! Tu m'as bien accueilli, moi. Pourquoi pas lui ? Odette soupira. Elle sentait qu'elle le regretterait plus tard, mais elle n'avait pas le choix : Félicie avait trop bon cœur, et Odette n'avait pas la volonté de l'empêcher de penser aux autres. — Bon, d'accord. Mais juste le temps qu'on lui trouve un propriétaire, c'est clair ? — Youpi ! Merci Odette ! s'écria Félicie en lui sautant dans les bras. Odette jeta un coup d'œil à la petite boule de poiles aux pieds de Félicie. Tiens, ce chaton avait le même regard que Félicie : celui qui empêchait Odette de lui refuser quoi que ce soit. . 15. Entrainement particulier. — Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça ? — C'est l'entrainement qui m'a permis de m'améliorer. C'est Odette qui l'a mis au point. Tu vas voir, c'est plus dur que ça en a l'air ! Camille fronça les sourcils. Elle ne savait pas si cela avait l'air bien dur, mais étrange, cela ne faisait aucun doute. Elle ne pensait pas qu'un jour, pour s'entrainer à la danse, elle devrait sauter sur une flaque d'eau pour toucher une clochette accrochée à une branche d'arbre. Les entrainements d'Odette étaient vraiment particuliers... c'était peut-être un entrainement secret pour devenir rapidement une bonne danseuse, du coup ? . 16. Grandir. Odette sentit les larmes lui monter aux yeux alors qu'elle terminait d'aider Félicie à s'habiller. Sa jeune protégée, en voyant cela, écarquilla les yeux. — Cela va, Odette ? Qu-qu'est-ce qui t'arrives ? — Rien, assurant Odette en essuyant ses larmes, souriante. Je suis juste émue. — Émue ? Pourquoi ? Odette ne lui répondit pas. À son âge, Félicie ne pouvait pas comprendre ce que ça représentait pour Odette de la voir ainsi, dans son costume, prête à entrer sur scène. Un parent ne pouvait qu'être ému en voyant son enfant voler de ses propres ailes. . 17. Allergie. — A-atchoum ! — Je suis vraiment désolé, Félicie ! — C'est pas ta-ATCHOUM !... Ta faute, Victor. Tu ne pouvais pas sa...aah... Un nouvel éternuement. Victor grimaça alors qu'il s'assura d'envoyer le plus loin possible le bouquet de fleur qu'il tenait auparavant dans ses mains. C'était bien lui ça : à toujours se rater quelque part ! À l'avenir, il retiendrait que Félicie était allergique au pollen, avant de l'inviter à se promener avec lui en tentant de lui faire une surprise en lui offrant un bouquet de fleur. Au pire, il lui offrirait plutôt des chocolats. C'était une valeur plus sûre. . 18. Leçon. DAM ! Camille grimaça. D'où venait ce bruit atroce ? C'était comme si quelqu'un de particulièrement mauvais s'essayait au piano. — Ne me dit pas que... Camille souffla d'exaspération alors qu'elle se précipita vers la salle où se trouvait son piano. Sans surprise, elle trouva Félicie qui tentait – sans succès – d'en jouer. — Oh, salut Camille ! Il est à toi, le piano ? — Oui, mais il ne le sera bientôt plus si tu continues à appuyer dessus comme une sauvage. Félicie rougit et s'éloigna du clavier. — Oups... Je voulais essayer d'y jouer mais... Camille ne tenta même pas d'écouter plus longtemps les excuses affligeantes de Félicie et s'installa à côté d'elle sur la banquette. — Je vais te montrer comment on joue du piano sans massacrer la musique. . 19. Promenade à Paris. — Wouah ! C'est immense, l'Arc de Triomphe ! Et là, on est au bout de l'avenue des Champs-Élysées ? Ça doit être encore plus impressionnant vu de près, alors ! — A-attend nous, Félicie ! Mérante ne put s'empêcher de sourire à la vue qui s'offrait à lui : Félicie qui trépignait d'impatience pour aller voir l'Arc de Triomphe, suivit par Odette qui, même si elle sermonnait Félicie pour qu'elle ralentisse, souriait, pleine de joie. Ces deux-là s'étaient vraiment bien trouvées. — Mérante, vous venez ? Mérante rigola. — J'arrive ! Tu devrais ralentir, Félicie. L'Arc de Triomphe ne va pas s'envoler, tu sais. Il était heureux de pouvoir assister à un tel spectacle de bonheur. . 20. Sourire. Les applaudissements résonnèrent comme le grondement du tonnerre, remplissant la salle de la douce mélodie de la réussite. Devant cette foule conséquente, Félicie ne put s'empêcher d'être impressionnée. Toutes ces félicitations, ces regards admiratifs, ces sourires gais... ils lui étaient destinés. Elle sentait son cœur battre à cent à l'heure. Elle n'avait jamais eu peur de la foule, mais, pour la première fois, elle craignait celle. Elle craignait que cette foule ne la submerge trop de joie et qu'elle en oublie tout le reste. Elle ne put s'empêcher de sourire. D'un sourire éclatant qui illustraient bien ses sentiments.

(Ballerina) , in part or whole, belong to this author. Why did I stray into this area? I watched this movie and was entranced, even with all the glaring (and I do mean glaring) historical inaccuracies. I was going to let it go, but this story has been growing and evolving in my head everyday for several weeks. So why not write it down and share, yeah? I tried to flesh out the characters and write this piece to where it can be read without watching the movie, if I fail I do not apologize, only recommend you watch the film and then read it again (happy face). Also, historical note: Pedro is a reference to Pedro Gailhard (Pierre Samson Gailhard) who was a French opera singer and the theatre director from 1884-1891 and then 1893-1907. I envisioned this to take place in the ballpark of 1900. ~O~ He was astounded. She took his breath away, sent his heart racing, stole the very thing in his bones that kept him upright. The flight of his senses that she inspired seemed to happen so naturally - he really shouldn't be so surprised by now. After all that had happened, he didn't think it ever could change. As he watched her hobble about on the stage, broom in hand and familiar tune on her lips, he was taken back to a time long ago – some ten years at least – yet to that same stage. That same figure. Same tune. Life had been so cruel to her, they – he – had been so cruel to her. And yet here she remained, unflappable in the face of the malice that swarmed around her. It broke his heart. And he knew that he deserved his heartache. While she deserved the world. ~O~ She had known he was there. Well of course she had known, what did he think, she was born yesterday? No, no he wouldn't; they went back a long time, she and Louis Mérante. Far too long a time for him to think that she was not in tune to his presence. Pausing in her sweeping for only a moment, she let herself fall back into familiar memories. Of a young ballerina who had the potential to be Prima – of red slippers standing out proudly, bravely, against pale legs and dark stage. Of a young man who worshiped her skills under the lights before the orchestra. Worshiped her body at night in the dorms when the Ballet Mistress was in bed asleep. Life was funny, in a mean sort of way. Back, before either had a chance to prove their worth but were well underway, he had seduced her. Or maybe she seduced him. Perhaps in reality they seduced and allowed themselves to be seduced by one another. In any case, they had a wonderful affair that, for her at least, made her feel as alive as being on the stage. A beautiful dalliance. And what comes from dalliances and affairs and seduction? Something that even now grieves her to dwell on. It was here Odette's movements ceased, and Mérante took a half step forward should she need aide. However it was not needed, the years had made her stronger than that. Banishing the thoughts swirling around her mind, she steeled her will that no, she did not like children, and began sweeping once more. Louis Mérante watched on quietly, wishing he knew some way she would let him in again. ~O~ Dirty. That was the very first thing he had thought when he first lay eyes on the young Mamselle Odette Baudin. Dirty and tall, not so much skinny as malnourished, but she had a pretty face. So ordinary in a poor sort of way. Certainly not worthy of the great Master Saint-Léon. Beneath him, ultimately. And beneath the Opera House as far as he was concerned. And yet when she danced – he understood why she was there the moment they shoved her on the stage to audition for a spot in the Ballet. Even with her total lack of technical knowledge and training, the sheer talent she had glowing beneath her skin was enough to bring the ballet teacher to tears. Being from a poor family as she was, naturally she had no money to pay for her lessons, so an agreement was made between the school and her humble, underprivileged farmworker father. The school would train her, as well as provide room and board gratuitement – for free – and mold her into the Prima Ballerina she was so obviously destined to become. In exchange for this generous gift, the Opera House would retain thirty five percent of any wages she would receive. So with a handshake her father had sold her to her dream, and while he left no richer he had one less mouth to feed and the comfort that she would be well taken care of, perhaps even be lucky enough to flourish. Flourish she had, for a time. She caught his eye – and he caught hers – and they quietly progress from acquaintances to friends. By the time they were fifteen they had become secret lovers, sneaking kisses in stairwells and caresses in shadows. Even now, if he closes his eyes he can still taste her soft skin. The scent of her hair deep in his nose, the feel of her supple body in his hands. It happened a few months after they began their secret little romance. A group of them had been rushing down the steps of the dormitory when Regina – a ballerina with no talent but well-off parentage – got her gangly legs and big feet tangled with Odette's. It had been chaos those few terrifying moments when her lithe body went flying heels over head down the unforgiving stone steps. After the doctor had been called and the crowd shooed away, he had lingered outside the girls' room and listened as she was told she may never walk again – let alone dance. Regina was ushered in to apologize – quite insincerely – to a quietly sobbing Odette. Eavesdropping alone Louis would have thought Regina tripped her on purpose, but who would do such a thing? Intentionally ruin not only someone's career, but their life as well? He was certain she could not have been so cruel. Prognosis delivered, Monsieur Saint-Léon had a decision to make. Clearly the poor girl could not dance again, being as she was now crippled for life. They could send her home to her family, but what of all the costs the school had incurred in her training, as well as feeding and housing her? They could never recoup the loss. And so it was decided that Odette would recompense her debts to the school by working as its cleaner. She acquired a cane to help with her mobility, and quietly slipped into the shadows so unlike how she had come into the light. To go from the toast of the school to its filth was something not many could do, but she managed. Those who had been thought of as close friends and confidants now would not speak to her, treating her as if she were invisible. Shared jokes were now jokes at her expense, and Louis was ashamed to admit that he had joined in once or twice. They all feigned they did not know her, and as old blood moved out and new talent replaced it, it seemed as if she was being forgotten from the history of the Opera House. The cruelty of her friends, however, did aide her in once sense. It gave her thick skin. The spiteful words and unfeeling actions hardened her heart, helped her find the strength within her to rise above it all. She held her head as was permitted of servants while commencing with her work. Even taking on extra tasks, such as helping the Costume Master mend when he needed the help. She even found second employment within Regina's household. Regina, who had taken her career from her, and then squandered it when she became pregnant – quite unexpectedly for such a virtuous girl. Regina, who quickly left the ballet school to marry the son of a local Restaurateur and have a pale little bundle of blonde hair she could control, much as her own mother had done. Regina, who offered Odette a job and a place to sleep not so much out of the goodness of her heart, but more to keep her adversary under foot. Regina, who perhaps was as cruel as Odette first thought when she arrived. It was only later that he heard, quite by accident from a conversation between Odette and one of the stage hands, that she had been pregnant at the time of her accident. Naturally, that was lost as well. It crushed him to know that she did not tell him; that he had pushed her away to the place where she thought he wouldn't care. How she carried the weight of it on her own. ~O~ Standing off stage while Felicie made her debut as Clara, Louis Mérante again only had eyes for Odette Baudin. Her eyes held so much hope and promise for the redhead before her, a girl whom she had become a surrogate mother and who helped fill the void within her. She tried to fight off the spiteful feeling of victory that it was her daughter – hers - and not Regina's that was dancing tonight. After ten years of cleaning for that wretched woman and enduring all her nasty quips and garnished wages and hard labor – watching Felicie live her dream felt like the sweet release of revenge. The thought both terrified and invigorated her. A strong hand slipped into the one not holding the cane, and out of the corner of her eye she saw Louis. All this time and her heart still raced at the sight of him. It took her to a memory of him when they were young; her first glimpse of him. He was tall and muscular, and at thirteen stood proudly over the stage like he owned it. She remembered thinking he looked like a bird, swanning about on the stage and displaying his plumage as a peacock. He was arrogant. Handsome, but arrogant. The sound of applause cut through her reverie, a hot knife through smooth butter, and when he lent over to kiss her cheek she blushed. All these years –harsher to her than to him – and he could still make her weak in the knees like a teenager in love. But when she locked eyes with him as he pulled away, she saw the realization that while they had a decade to grow differently, maybe they could find ways to grow together from today forward. Perhaps there was still hope for her, for him, for them all. He was assaulted with the knowledge that even with ten years of hard living between, her skin was still as soft as he remembered it to be. Astounding. Épilogue They cut quite a picture in the warm Parisian sun. Odette seated at the iron table sipping tea, her cane hanging delicately off the back of her chair. A vision in lavender, she forwent a hat, soft tendrils of dark hair escaping the elegant bun. Felicie, in her crisp white dress that wafted with her movements and red slippers as striking as the shade of her hair, cooed softly into the wooden pram before them both. An unexplainable yet completely expected feeling of love washed over Mérante in that moment, and he felt as though his heart might truly burst with the sensation. Everything they had endured, all the distrust and the heartbreak and the love, all of it was meant to lead them to this morning in the little garden of their apartment. A gentle hand touched his elbow, and Mérante turned to see the youthful Victor smiling back at him. His goatee and mustache were growing out well and, much like every time he saw both Victor and Felicie, Mérante was struck with just how much they had both grown. How they had all grown. \"Felicie, we need to get moving if we want to catch the train.\" Victor's deep voice broke the stillness, his deep tones further proof that time stands still for no man. At the sound of his voice Felicie stood and turned, and the look adorning her features was breathtaking all on its own. The blooming smile she graced them with was light and lovely, and as she moved to face Odette it evolved into the love of child to parent. \"I wish you could come with me.\" The voice was neither soft nor subtle, and both Odette and Mérante were again reminded of an elephant. \"Don't be silly, how useful could I be in Brittany? Besides, it'll do you good to get out of the Opera house, out of Paris and into the country again. You've worked hard and deserve a break – both of you.\" Odette sent a loaded glance at Victor, who blushed and rubbed the back of his head with a chuckle. Conceding defeat, Felicie laughed with a nod and bent to hug the woman who had become so much more than a mentor and a teacher – a woman whom her heart recognizes as a mother. \"Now go, before the train leaves without you.\" A friendly swat, a farewell into the pram and at the door, and the pair were gone. At the soft cry from the buggy Louis moved forward, only to stop again at the sight of Odette standing with very minor difficulty. Bending over she reached within and pulled out a bundle of yellow fabric, wiggling limbs and a head with dark hair. Resting the child on her shoulder, she swayed from side to side with a soft hum. Turning her face she met his gaze, and again he was astounded with the emotion churning within his breast. Love, he decided, was a most becoming look for a woman. \"You seemed almost eager to see them go.\" He observed casually, strolling into the garden to kiss her cheek. \"Now what reason could I possibly have for seeing my ward off to Brittany for a least two weeks? I should be devastated.\" \"And with no chaperone, why it's a scandal I cannot allow to besmirch the name of my good Opera House. How could you let her go with him unescorted?\" He teased, taking the child from her arms to bounce as she sat back in her chair and picked up her tea. \"Why should I worry? If you recall we were never chaperoned, and no liberties were taken.\" She hid her smile behind the teacup while he sputtered and had the decency to look guilty. \"Ah, well, I'm sure his intentions are far more honorable. And I have it on good authority he is finally going to ask her to marry him while they are away.\" If he was waiting for his lovely wife to be enchanted with his clairvoyance, he was sorely mistaken. \"And I have it on good authority she is going to say yes.\" The fact that her voice didn't waver had him turn his gaze back on her, watching closely. \"You are alright with it, yes?\" She looked at the flowers wistfully for a moment, before gracing him with an honest smile. \"Of course I am. I won't begrudge them the same marital bliss we have. Besides, it's not as if I'm losing a Ballerina – we're gaining an Inventor.\" With a laugh at his gobsmacked expression, Odette stood and took her child back into her arms. \"Come along my little Vianne, we need to get you cleaned up and ready to go. Lessons start in one hour.\" Taking her cane from the back of her chair, Odette passed along the stones to the door with limp a ghost of what it used to be. At the frame she paused and turned to her husband with a radiant smile on her face. \"Bring the pushchair Louis – the tea set will survive getting wet, but I don't want the pram ruined.\" Looking to the morning sky transitioning to afternoon, and seeing not a single cloud, he took a few steps forward. \"But there's no rain expected.\" If ever a woman had perfected the art of looking down her nose at her husband, then Odette Mérante must be she. Swiftly her pointed look morphed into one that he could only describe as enlightened. \"Don't be daft. The rain is just as expected as the sunshine. Now hurry up, I want to get there with enough time to hand Vianne off to Pedro before the girls see us and get distracted.\" And just like she disappeared into the apartment with a swish of her skirts, leaving the door open for him. With a light chuckle Mérante took the handle of the buggy in his hands and began pushing it towards the entrance. A feeling washed over him that Odette hadn't been talking about the weather, but something far more profound. Yet as he reached the door the soft patter of a light rain on his cheeks, corroborated by the delicate tinkling of raindrops on fine china, had him reconsidering. Were women always one step ahead? Astounding. ~Fin~ ","Summary":" Disclaimer: No rights for Leap! (Ballerina) , in part or whole, belong to this author. Why did I st"},{"Movie":"Ballerina Leap!","Title":"Anything one man can imagine, other men can make real","Author":"jomiddlemarch","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12703247","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The package Victor placed in her lap was unwieldy and hard, wrapped in brown paper and burlap, secured by an enormous quantity of twine. Odette thought that if her life had depended upon it, she would not have been able to reveal the contents in under a quarter of an hour and only with a stout knife. Victor had paused a moment to let her survey the mystery of the object, then murmured, \"If I may, mademoiselle Odette?\" and set to untying knots and shimmying the length of the prickly rope off the gift, peeling back this corner and that to make the final steps a matter of a few seconds' work. She surveyed what was in her lap and worked to keep her voice, even, curious, sensitive to the artist's wish to be understood without the need of explanation, of an orphan's yearning to be known and praised as those with fond mothers, doting grandmothers, even the stern father whose nod was all in all. \"Victor, what is it?\" \"It's a brace for your bad leg. Félicie told me to get my head out of the clouds, so I did,\" he said. He paused, as if there was nothing else that needed to be said. \"But how? I've never seen anything like this,\" she replied. She said it well enough that he beamed and did not frown. She rather thought him handsomer, more the remote Romantic genius when he furrowed his brow and his eyes darkened like the twilight that fell in the autumn, but she was happy to see his grin. \"It's mechanized, there are gears and belts. I made Félicie show me how she walks and show she sweeps, and I have been observing you, mademoiselle, when you invite me to dinner,\" Victor said. The device was a mix of leather and metal, a bronze color that could have been any alloy, polished to a fine sheen. He said there were gears but she could not see them and the rivets were as tiny as a seamstress's stitching. She was sure there was no other object like it in creation. \"There are gears? How did you make it?\" she asked. She had not thought he could smile any brighter but she'd been wrong. \"Oh, there they are,\" he said, leaning over and turning the brace over, pointing at what looked like the most infinitesimal clockwork. Some late afternoon sun caught the metal and it glowed like beaten gold. \"I have been studying, going to the museums and I've made a friend, you might say, of one of the guards at a library of the Sorbonne. And, like I said, Félicie helped. She even danced for me—I'm not sure the brace will work well enough for it, but she wanted me to try, to make it so you could do all the jumps you used to. It should be strong enough to bear the weight if you go en pointe, I know that for certain,\" Victor finished. He finally sounded shy as he usually did when he arrived for the simple dinner she offered to share with him, offering a few fresh rolls or a handful of dewy violets in a twist of paper. He had made her the greatest gift, a chance to move as she had once before, and he was afraid she would not like it, would scold him or turn him away. \"Victor, I have never been given such a gift. Such a perfect, thoughtful gift- something I could never have let myself hope for,\" she said seriously. He blushed, at her tone more than the words, and ducked his head. She was glad, for both of them, that they were alone, that Félicie was not watching them and making either of them conceal what they felt. She felt like a girl again and she saw he felt, for once entire and complete, like a man grown. \"Shall you help me put it on then? I'd like to try it,\" she said. \"Now?\" he blurted. \"Why would I wait? If I told you you might fly, would you wait even a second?\" she answered, lifting her skirt to reveal her twisted, shortened leg in its woolen stocking. It would be enough to walk without the stick, even if she could not dance again the way he hoped, but perhaps, perhaps… Neither of them heard Louis knock when he came to the door or when Félicie came charging after her ballet master, both of them ending up in the courtyard, regarding a scene they'd never known could be. Louis had nearly exclaimed when he saw Odette's stick leaning against the bench she preferred, under the leafy horse-chestnut, but the sight had stopped him; Odette walking lightly, her arms outstretched as if she might suddenly begin a pas de chat. Victor was beyond the reach of her hand, encouraging her, \"Keep going, Mademoiselle! More, lift your foot higher, you can do it!\" and Odette smiled. Oh , how she smiled! Félicie had cried out when she saw them, \"Victor! Bon Dieu, what are you doing?\" making them pause across the shady garden. Louis thought he had never seen Odette look so young, that he was seeing Mathilde for once, even if her hair was not in two tails down her back. Her cheeks were red and her eyes shone like the star sapphires in the ring he had for her. Félicie had clapped a hand to her mouth and her eyes flicked between her foster-mother and the boy she had loved first of anyone, seeing two people she had never met before. \"I'm dancing,\" Odette called softly, spinning on her foot, a delicate pirouette ending in the attitude of a nymph, with the confidence of a goddess. Félicie had laughed but Louis only held his breath, tightened his fists and waited. For her to come to him and for her hand to take his first. For her eyes to meet his in a joy unparalleled.

Hey! Desde el 1ero pensaba subir algo hoy por cosa de un reto amistoso... y no fue hasta hace unas horas que decidí finalmente la idea y me puse a escribir como esclava para no perderla ;w;... JK, sí me puse a escribir así, pero es que si no la terminaba de madrugada no me daba el día para cumplir lo acordado uwur. »Aclaración&Advertencia;: Semi!AU/Modern!AU, aparte de una pizca de OoC (?). Sin nada más con que retrasarlos... ¡A Leer! I s t here s omewhere . — N o es para tanto… solo es una de las habitaciones de huéspedes porque son mis invitados, la otra estará pronta en cuanto las sirvientas terminen de arreglarla. Camille Le Haut les había recordado eso al par antes de que su madre la llamara para definir los detalles finales de la fiesta, pero la pelirroja seguía danzando en aquel lugar mientras sus ojos resplandecían y Victor debía encargarse de que nada terminase destrozado contra el suelo por evitar más problemas de los que ya tenía con la Le Haut mayor. —Sé que estás tan entusiasmada como yo, ¿pero no puedes guardar un poco de esa energía para más tarde? —le pidió en cierto momento él, atrapando en el aire el jarrón que Félicie casi tiró por accidente segundos atrás—. Camille nos pidió no avergonzarla. —Lo dice el chico con el ridículo sombrero —retrucó ella, sonriendo confiadamente tras dejarse caer al borde de la cómoda cama de sábanas blancas. Por instinto, él alzó la vista hacia el extravagante accesorio con clara influencia steampunk y más cables sueltos de los que calculó tener. —Sabes que no es ridículo, es… —Un prototipo experimental de las gafas que en verdad quieres probar después de que termines de diseñarlas —terminó por decir, sabiendo de memoria aquel discurso que Victor solía darle cada vez que preguntaba o comentaba algo al respecto de sus extravagantes ideas—. Relájate, ¿sí? Camille también dijo que sólo es una pequeña fiesta. —Una pequeña- gran fiesta importante —aclaró, levantando el índice una vez tuvo las manos tan libres como para dejar su sobrero tirado en una esquina—, y ya arruinamos la anterior. Félicie rodó los ojos. Quizá Victor podía tener algo de razón, aunque no iba a reconocérselo. —En realidad… eso fue culpa de Camille por invitarte a algo tan refinado —dijo por molestar, haciéndose a un lado para que el castaño que sentara al lado suyo—, no te sabes comportar cuando hay gente alrededor. — ¿Así que tú no tuviste nada que ver con que el pastel de cumpleaños volara por los aires, aterrizara sobre ese ministro y ensuciara a los demás que estaban a su alrededor? Con la misma sonrisa de antes cuando Victor la miró de forma inquisitiva, ella negó. —Para nada. —Y tampoco fuiste tú la que se puso a bailar encima de las mesas, causando todo ello. —Exacto. Contuvo la risa el mismo tiempo que su amigo, lo cual no duró más que unos cinco segundos conforme seguían mirándose a los ojos. —Eres increíble —soltó en el momento que Félicie apoyó la cabeza en su hombro, embelesado. La conocía bastante bien como para saber que era cuestión minutos para que ella se quedara dormida (como solía pasar a menudo, por ello bromeaban con que se trataba de una habilidad especial), pero lo que no supo fue si llegó a ser escuchado o sólo ignorado. Después de que dejó de apreciar las adorables pecas en su rostro o cómo su flequillo le provocaba cosquillas en el cuello, alzó la vista y se topó con la dueña de la residencia observándoles. Camille había vacilado al entrar, lo dejó ver al fallar en disimularlo, aunque lo terminó compensando con el sigilo que tuvo al avanzar. — ¿Todo en orden? —Dándole un vistazo rápido al cuarto en busca de cualquier pieza de algo roto o de desorden, trató de desviar la atención de su persona—. ¿Va a despertar para la fiesta o debo pedirle a alguien que deje los extinguidores a la vista? Por fortuna, su tono arrogante enmascaró lo suficiente lo forzado de aquella burla, además de que Victor seguía distraído como para percatarse de las mejillas sonrosadas de la rubia. —Sólo fue un largo viaje hasta aquí y Félicie se duerme casi en cualquier lado cuando es de noche —le justifico, riendo un poco—, pero no te desharás de ella para la fiesta. —Lo sé, es una ratita terca —comentó, y no fue hasta que tuvo la mirada marrón del otro sobre sí que reaccionó a sus propias palabras. Con un vago gesto de su mano, restó importancia—. Viejas costumbres. —Hey, lo de terca no lo puedo discutir —cedió él, sonriendo de lado a pesar de no mirarle. Durante el momento de silencio, Camille se meció en su lugar, manteniendo las manos entrelazadas detrás de su espalda y mirando por encima de uno de sus hombros el detalle de las puertas, como si fuera lo más interesante del mundo. Quería decir algo y esa era la razón principal por la que había regresado a la habitación, pero el que su amiga estuviese dormida —prácticamente— en los brazos de Victor complicó el desarrollo de su primera idea. Esperó y esperó a que el castaño dijese algo que le ayudara a arriesgarse; sin embargo, lo que salió de sus labios fue lo típico que se escuchaba en esas ocasiones en donde no había ningún tema de qué hablar por falta de confianza. — ¿Y qué te trae por aquí, Camille? —Curioseó de forma casual y ella lo agradeció en silencio—. Aparte del hecho de que esta es tu casa y todo eso… —Venía a avisarte que tu habitación y tu atuendo ya estaban listos —respondió con naturalidad (que no supo bien de dónde salió) antes de darle un rápido vistazo a la inconsciente bailarina que seguía teniendo como una rival amistosa—, al igual que venía a decirle a Félicie que traerán su vestido pronto. Tan rápido como la Le Haut le brindó una de sus sonrisas soberbias, el chico entendió la indirecta entredicha. —Esa es mi señal para irme —resaltó, dejando cuidadosamente a su amiga recostada sobre la cama para ponerse de pie y marcharse. —Sí, puedes tomarlo como algo así —concedió, satisfecha—. Tercer cuarto a la derecha. Victor lo agradeció con una seña y desapareció apenas traspasó las elegantes puertas de entrada, permitiéndole a Camille relajar su postura firme y soltar un gran suspiro. A veces se preguntaba cuándo se había enamorado de alguien tan… tan opuesto a ella, en especial después de prometerse —y prometerle a su madre— que jamás dejaría que nadie la complementara (y completara) tan bien como podía hacerlo ese torpe aspirante a inventor. Podía echarle la culpa varios factores que los hacían coincidir, aunque eso no se sentía justo del todo. Una vez más, sus pálidas mejillas se encendían antes de que decidiese palmearse la frente, dejando confundida a Félicie que, en algún punto, se había despertado y sentado en la cama sin hacer ruido alguno. — ¿Camille…? Si al principio la rubia no había logrado actuar como ella misma tras verlos tan cerca y tan íntimos a la vez , menos pudo deshacerse de su expresión perpleja con la rapidez que le hubiese gustado. Al menos, su cerebro procesó una convincente excusa para escaparse. —Iré a pedir que traigan tu vestido… y que hagan algo con el desastre de tu cabello. No sería mucho pero, de momento, era lo que necesitaba para despejarse hasta que la modista finalizara los últimos retoques de su atuendo y las maquillistas terminasen de ponerse de acuerdo con su madre sobre que estilo le favorecía más de noche. C uando bajó las escaleras de mármol no miró a todos los que la aplaudían, sino que su mirada se posó únicamente en el par que la esperaba en medio de la multitud, de seguro, por uno de los tantos impulsos de Félicie; aún usando uno de los vestidos más caros (y accesorios a juego) y teniendo el cabello en un bonito recogido, se diferenciaba del resto de la gente del mismo modo que Victor y su traje de gala. Negó con la cabeza y logró acercarse a ellos después de saludar a la gente que, por educación, no podía evitar, mostrándose más tranquila que altanera en cuanto Régine Le Haut le dio la espalda por irse a hablar con el grupo de mujeres al que frecuentaba por ser de su mismo estatus social. —Ahora parece que sí supieron cómo vestirse —bromeó luego de darles otro vistazo más de cerca—, los felicito por su buen gusto. La de ojos verdes fingió su risa antes de que el otro llegara a responder algo. —Lamento que mi vestido sea más bonito que el tuyo, Camille —le siguió el juego, cruzándose de brazos y lanzándole una mirada desafiante. —No te preocupes, yo sí sé caminar con algo más que zapatillas. Por un momento, Félicie se sonrojó. Su amiga no había tenido que verla tropezar una y otra vez para saber que debió estar a punto de caerse en más de una ocasión, y eso que la falda azulada llegaba por encima de sus rodillas, por lo que no podía tropezar con algo que no fueran sus propios pies (o las alfombras de los pasillos superiores y habitaciones). —Eso fue un golpe bajo —reprochó antes de reír un poco, avergonzada. —Me alegra haber dado en el blanco, ratita. Volviendo a sonreír con aires de superioridad, acomodó el chal ámbar que se deslizaba por sus descubiertos hombros, cortesía del estilo del vestido con tonalidades verdosas y detalles dorados elegido a último momento. —Chicas, ¿estaban hablando en serio o jugando? —Quiso saber Victor al cabo de unos segundos repletos de intercambio de miradas pícaras y muecas traviesas—. Sinceramente, me perdieron desde el principio. De nuevo, Camille miró a Félicie, dando con la complicidad deseada… hasta que, al girar la cabeza por ver qué causaba el alboroto en el otro sector de la sala, toda su atención quedó puesta en el rubio que acababa de llegar con el mismo porte de un legítimo príncipe. — ¿Félicie…? —le tocó llamarla a la de ojos celestes. —Creo que la perdimos —opinó Victor, sacudiendo a la pelirroja un par de veces sin obtener reacción inmediata—. Tal vez debiste dejarla dormir un rato más. —E-Estoy bien —repuso como pudo ella, con una boba sonrisa indisimulable decorando su sonrosado rostro cuando volteó a verlos—, sólo vi a alguien que me resultó familiar y… Ninguno de sus amigos dijo nada en aquel instante. Mucho antes de que aquel rubio se acercara y abrazara a Félicie por la cintura y le susurrara algo al oído, ambos reconocieron que la mirada de ella parecía gritar de forma desvergonzaba que estaba enamorada; en silencio, Camille se preguntó si le pasaría lo mismo porque algo similar le ocurría a Victor cada vez que observaba a la de pecas. —Ejem. —El inventor fue el primero en salir de aquel trance—. Félicie, ¿y este sujeto quien se supone que es? —Permíteme presentarme —contestó él con un claro acento ruso, dando un paso delante de la pelirroja—, Rudolph Dimitriev Stanislaw Artiem Rankovsky III. — ¿Cómo hace este presumido para recordar su propio nombre? —preguntó por lo bajo Victor a Camille, aunque volvió a carraspear tras ver la mirada desaprobatoria de la pelirroja. —Chicos, creí hablarles de Rudy hace tiempo —intervino luego, interponiéndose entre ambos chicos. —Yo no lo recuerdo —mintió rápido Victor. —Te estuviste burlando de él porque parte del pastel que le cayó a ese ministro también le cayó a Rudy durante el cumpleaños de Camille —regaño antes de ver a la rubia, pasando a tener una expresión de culpabilidad—… y de nuevo lamento muchísimo haberlo estropeado de esa forma. —Aunque de no haber pasado, no habría tenido oportunidad de ver a mi minoushka —comentó el ruso cuando una apenada Félicie jugaba con un mechón suelto de cabello, ganándole la palabra a la hija de la anfitriona de la fiesta— o de hablarle. — ¡Fue como hace seis meses! —De hecho, fueron tres —le corrigió Camille al tener la oportunidad de hablar, comenzando a sentirse incómoda. Si debía pasar por ese tipo de situaciones para lograr transmitir algo en el escenario (como le aconsejó Louis Merante en su momento), no le estaba gustando. —Y, sin duda, estos han sido los tres mejores meses de mi vida —comentó Rudy, besando la mejilla de su novia a la vez que entrelazaba sus manos. — ¡¿Han estado saliendo desde entonces?! — ¿Qué creías que hacía Félicie después de clases? —le cuestionó la rubia a Victor, tironeándolo del brazo para que sólo él escuchara el murmullo. —No lo sé… ¿Practicar? ¿Danzar? ¿Pintarse las uñas? —trataba de adivinar—. ¿No es eso lo que hacen las chicas? Por más de que cierta parte de ella encontraba simpáticas esas tontas respuestas, no tuvo más opción que rodar los ojos y tratar de reprimir su sonrisa. —Si me hubieras preguntado, te habría dicho que ella ya estaba saliendo con alguien —resaltó, sin cambiar de postura. —Tendrías que habérmelo dicho apenas lo supiste. —Hasta Odette lo sabe, pensé que tú también lo hacías. — ¿Estaría actuando así si lo hubiera sabido desde entonces? En ese punto de la guerra de gritos susurrados, Camille se vio desorientada. — ¿Quizá? — ¡Agh! —Exasperado, Victor volvió la vista al frente para confrontar al par de tórtolos pero, para su decepción, no había rastro de ninguno—. ¿Ah? ¿Se fueron? ¿Y sin decir nada? —Es una fiesta, es fácil perderte con toda las personas presentes —trató de excusar la de orbes celestes, también buscándoles con la mirada. —O escabullirte —sentenció con tono amargo, pateando el suelo en el acto—. Rayos… Desearía que hubieras invitado a Mathurin también, así tendría con quien quedarme por lo que queda de la noche. —Bueno… —Si debía ser honesta, no tenía idea de cómo acabaría todo. Era consciente de que había cierta probabilidad de que Rudolph se apareciese en la fiesta de su madre gracias a las influencias que tenía aquella mujer (como había pasado en su decimosexto cumpleaños y no porque se conocieran en realidad), pero no le había prestado tanta atención al novio de su amiga como lo estaba haciendo Victor—. Puedes quedarte conmigo. Lo único que impidió un nuevo silencio fue la apacible música de fondo. — ¿Hablas en serio? Por supuesto, el recelo mezclado con el asombro fue la respuesta más natural que pudo obtener de él. —Estás solo… y yo también, ¿no? —fue a lo que se apegó, encogiéndose de hombros mientras el castaño parecía analizar la situación, llevándose una mano al mentón para lucir más pensativo. Antes de contestar, pareció recordar algo. Sólo por asegurarse, con otro rápido vistazo confirmó que Régine Le Haut seguía centrada en su grupo social y no en nada más… como su propia hija. —Supongo que no es tan mala idea. — ¿Tan? —resaltó ella, encontrándolo más divertido que molesto. No obstante, en vez de quedarse esperando alguna otra respuesta digna del ingenio de aquel chico, le tomó de la mano y le llevó a la mitad del salón que ejercía como una tranquila pista de baile, en donde un par de parejas mayores bailaban abrazados al compás de la melodía. Camille podía ser ambiciosa, pero no sentía la necesidad de pedir o exigir mucho: con algo de suerte, quizá podrían pretender estar enamorados esa noche, aún si era para perder el tiempo… y eso estaba bien para cualquiera de los dos, lo supiera o no. Hey de vuelta, si alguien merodea por aquí! Quedé conforme con el largo para el poco tiempo que tuve... y un poco con el triángulo amoroso del principio, aunque tengo problemas con la película porque no sé qué shippear bien —a excepción del obvio Merante/Odette— x'D. Anyways, el reto involucraba un +1000 palabras de extensión, que hubieran dos parejas involucradas y que el tema fuese el amor~, pero amo el amor troll y cuando alguien ya tiene novio/a (?). Sammie, espero que estuvieses feliz con esta pequeña sorpresa uvur y que cualquiera que se pasara se entretuviese, al menos, una cuarta parte de lo que me entretuvo escribirlo x'DD, aún si Rudy no se pudo lucir tanto por falta de presupuesto y Camille quedó media OoC (?). ¡Feliz San Valentín~! Y sin nada más para decir... ¡Ciao-Ciao nvn7! & Grazie por leer~.

It follow a few scene of the movie but it continue after its end. I hope you will enjoy it! The sun is in their hearts. He looks at her from his hiding place and he can not help thinking that she is the most beautiful woman he has ever met. His movements are graceful, like those of a swan, and he can not force his eyes to look elsewhere. She feels her eyes on her back, stop what she does to turn in his direction and plunges his blue eyes into his brown eyes. He freezes in his place, unable to move because he didn't expect her to notice his presence. - Mr Merante? What are you doing here? Are not you supposed to be on Camille's side to train her for the Ballet? - I... I just wanted to check if you were ok, because you seemed to be tormented by something. - I'm fine. Don't pay attention to me... He looks at her, shocked by what she just said because he can't stop worrying about her. Then, he notices that something is flowing on her cheeks and that she has a lock of red hair in her hand that doesn't hold her broom. He puts two and two together and immediately thinks of the redhead orphan girl: Felicie. He should have thought about it before, he never saw Odette so close to a child and he has known her for a long time. Something must have happened to the girl, that's the only thing that can explain her attitude. - Please tell me what is bothering you. I can help! Does this have a connection with Felicie? She looks at him and he can see she holds back a few tears. He approaches her and wraps an arm around her waist to hold her timidly in his arms. He thought she was going to reject him, but she burst into tears, her head on his chest. She hides her sensitivity behind a mask of coldness, now it's broken, he can finally see how she really feels. She loves Felicie as much as if she were her own daughter and is very worried about her. He gently kisses Odette's forehead, then, with his free hand, he takes his handkerchief and gives it to her. She takes it, slowly dries her tears, and when she finally regains her composure, she says: - Regine Le Haut sent her back to the orphanage. And, she fired me, I had to pack my things yesterday. Now I have nowhere to go, except here of course. - She had the audacity to do that despite my warning!, he exclaim angry. Odette looks at her interlocutor, shocked, but she would be more than that if she knew what he is thinking right now: \"I hate this woman even more than before, and if I see her again, I don't know if I could not to hit her because of the anger growing inside me.\" - Now, we must do something to get her back! I couldn't bear to see you like that Odette. She smile at him and try to tell him something which is very important for her but they are interrupt by footsteps which come closer. He free her from his grip, reluctantly, just in time because the Director of the Opera enter just a few minutes later. Merante sighs, annoyed by this presence but he must listen to what his boss wants to say and follow him in his office, leaving Odette alone in his thoughts. Fortunately, the conversation didn't last long and it was about Odette and he was happy when he left the room. He ran to find the brown-haired woman and told him that she could bring him things in the attic. She could stay here until she could find something more comfortable and where she could stay forever. Then he had to return to his classes to kiss her on the cheek, having been sure they wouldn't be seen and leave the room without seeing that Odette was blushing. She goes back to her own work even though she has a lot of things in her mind that have nothing to do with that. Her heart is full of warmth, as if the sun gives her it's own energy to make her hope that things could become better than they are at the moment. At the same time, at the orphanage, a certain little girl has no more faith but finally at sunrise, and after a dream involving her mother, she takes up the dancing spirit. She trains on the roof of the orphanage, not knowing that someone is watching her, and at night she tries to escape from this place. But she is caught by the terrible Mr Luteau, who, to his great surprise, helps him instead of telling him to go back to bed. The next day, they arrived at the dance school and after hugging her, Felicie comes in and sees Odette clean up the scene. She gets closer and says: - Let me help you. The woman gasps and turns to her so Felicie says: - You need me. I can clean. Squeaky clean is my middle name. Odette doesn't say anything, she focuses on the redhead, as if she thought she was in the middle of an hallucination. She thinks, \"It can't be her, is it? Regine tells me that I will not see her again... Oh my god... If it really is her, it means that the sun is finally back in my life. Her hair shines and looks as hot as the sun, I can feel her warmth in my heart. Hum... Stay focused, Odette Listen to her. Felicie does not seem to notice how much the woman is disturbed and continues to speak: - Actually... I need you. I want to stay with you. Then she kisses Odette, who holds her in her arms and the young one says: - I am really sorry. I really missed you. The older woman gently strokes her cheek, saying: - Me too. She gets up and invites the orphan to follow her. She brings her into the attic and shows her where she could settle before taking the time to talk about what happened when she was far away. After that she goes to see her friend Victor to apologize to him but he doesn't seem to be there, in fact he is under the table where his friend: Mathurin, is sitting. While discussing with Felicie, Victor puts on the table, her music box that was broken by Camille Le Haut before. She thanks him for his help even though Mathurin says he is not there. Then she leaves the place and returns to the Opera to join Odette sitting in a chair, watching Camille train. She admits that Victor did a great job on the box and they both notice that Merante has had some problems with her student dancing without showing any kind of emotions. Odette must now leave to wash the stairs so she tells Felicie to take care of the stage and she does it without protestations, until Camille comes back and takes her music box one more time. - Forget it, said Felicie anger growing in her mind. Give it back. - It looks like I did not throw it with force the first time! As she plans to do it again, Felicie stops her and recover her music box before she says: - Don't make the same mistakes. - Why are you leaving? the blonde said while Felicie put a distance between them. Are you afraid of being humiliated? Then, after exchanging a few sentences, a dance fight begins between the two girls and they are seen by one of the other dancers who alert the persons present at the Opera. When the brown haired girl arrive in the hall and tell everyone what's happening, the little dancers get excited and Odette turn to have a look on Merante who smile at her. He is proud to hear that is former student have in off courage to defy her rival and he can't wait to see which one of the opponents will beat the other. When they both arrive in the hall, Camille make Felicie fall from four step stairs, just in front of Merante, Odette and two students. All the four are looking at her surprised. In Merante and Odette eyes she can read worry. While Felicie stay on the floor, Odette encourage her and that help the redhead to fight the strength to stand up. Then the battle continues until they reach the last staircase. She turns to Merante and Odette and sees that they give him encouraging looks and because of that, she manages to win the duel, leaving everyone amazed by his wonderful Grand-Jeté. Then they applause her performance and she is joined by Merante, Odette and Camille. The teacher is the first to speak: - You have been very impressive girls. But, let me ask you an important question: Why do you dance? - I dance because... I dance because... Because... My mother requires me to do so, Camille answers. - Because it's always been part of my life, begins Felicie. It was there with my mother when I was a baby. It's here now thanks to Odette. It helps me to live, to be myself. - She should dance, said Camille, touch by Felicie's sincerity. That makes Merante smile and he says: - It was very honest Miss Le Haut, and brave. You have a future at the Opera if you wish. And Felicie, tonight you're dancing the Nutcracker. Everyone applause and Camille congratulates her former rival who has taken her in his arms. Then she jumps on Odette and hugs her so hard because of this news. Then, after some twists, for example, the fact that Camille's mother tried to kill Felicie on the Statue of Liberty, in a construction site and his rescue by Victor who used one of his inventions, she managed to reach Opera just in time. She's greeted by Merante and Odette who were very worried about her because the last time she was late, it did not end well, and it was almost the same, even worse, this time. But, the fact that she was late, let the two adults and the youngest to confess their respective feelings. So now, Merante and Odette are a couple, just like Felicie and Victor. Odette helps the redhead put on her red dance shoes, then she tells him: - You are ready. She was on her knees in front of the girl and Merante joins her in the same position, a hand on the shoulder of Odette. - You have what you need to dance here, he said, gently touching his chest. Then he gets up like his girlfriend and they go a little far, seeing Felicie kiss Victor on his cheek after he told her that she finally realized her dream. She then joins the ballerina on stage and interprets her first Ballet without more problems. She is absolutely gorgeous with her white dress and crown on the top of her head. Merante and Odette look behind the scenes very proud of her and the woman is also moved by what she has in front of her. She lets a tear drop and her lover kisses her tenderly on the cheek, one of her hands on her shoulder with the intention of comforting her and she smiles at him. They both think that they are the luckiest man and woman in Paris and that Victor agrees with them. As he looks at Felicie's performance, he wonders: - Is she really my girlfriend? The couple behind him smiles as they hear this and they are very happy for the two orphans who finally get something they did not have before: many people who love them. They also think of something they will probably do when a few days have passed. What could it be? Everyone will know soon enough. Now they are content to appreciate the moment. At the end of the performance, Felicie receives many congratulations from the audience and her friends. Now, all she need is something to eat and a good night to rest. She don't know yet that her mentor and her teacher are together, but they will tell her that later. Before, they want to keep it for themselves. After that night, everything becomes normal again and routine sets in at the Opera. While Merante teaches dance, Odette wash, Victor invents new things with his friend Mathurin, Camille tries with difficulty to find her true passion even if she doesn't stop to dance, and Felicie improves her talents as a dancer. But one day Felicie returns home after a meeting with Victor and finds the attic completely empty, there is only one note on her bed: \"Meet us at Camille's house\". She doesn't waste time and goes there with her boyfriend. When they arrive at their destination and enter the house, they are surprised to find everyone here and exclaim: - HAPPY BIRTHDAY FELICIE! She is moved by this surprise and she is far to guess what will come after. When Odette see her crying she give sign to everyone to make them understand that she need a big hug. They are fast to regroup around Felicie and the girl, who is not at all used to such a big demonstration of affection, take a long time to calm down. All the guests brought a lot of gifts for her, she has never seen so many, even in twelve years of life, or rather, thirteen now. After the meal, she starts opening the packages and thanks everyone, but it's not the end of her special day. Odette approaches her, while Merante looks at them from a corner, a big smile on her face. He is the only one, apart from his soul mate, to know what will happen. He is so happy for Odette and he hopes that Felicie will be so once she knows everything. He sends a silent prayer to God while Odette says: - In the last few days, I have been thinking of everything that has happened since we know each other. And you know that I really love you a lot. So I wanted to know... Felicia, would you agree to become my daughter? The redhead widens the eyes of surprise, shocked by what she has just heard and tears begin to come to her eyes. It is, of course, tears of joy, she would never have thought that Odette would give her such a gift. Felicie has always wanted to be adopted and now it's part of reality. She is too happy to speak, so, as a positive answer, she gently embraces the woman. Since then, some changes take place in the girl's life and she is taking a little time to get used to calling her mentor: Mom. But she managed to do it after a month. Everything is also going well between her and Victor who seems to be more mature thanks to the presence of Merante each time he is at Odette's to visit Felicie. The man is very protective of both Odette and the redhead, but Victor notices that Merante also takes care of himself even if he doesn't really know why. None of the young ones know what is going on between Merante and Odette, but they discover this in a very worrying situation. Odette and Felicie have recently moved into a nice house not far from the Opera. But, when the girl returns home after a long day of classes, she arrive in front of a broken door and finds Merante in tears in the middle of the living room. He is kneeling among pieces of furniture, a big bump on his head in addition to some wounds, and his torn suit. She rush to his side and ask him to tell what have caused such a mess. He tries to get up to face the redhead but the pain is too great for him to do it. By the way, Felicie wouldn't have let him do it and she prefers to sit on his right. She gently puts a hand on his shoulder and says with a weak voice: - They took your mother. I tried to protect her but I only managed to slow down their departure... I can't lose her. Not now, not once more. Felicie wants to ask her a lot of questions but she realizes that he is more hurt than she noticed when he arrived and a few minutes later, the police arrive, followed by a doctor. When he finishes his Merante exam, he lets one of the policemen interrogate him: - What did you do before the arrival of the kidnappers? - In fact... I kissed my soul mate, the man answers, embarrassed. That's when they came in reducing the door to pieces. The noise made me jump and they tried to take Odette. So, I fought them as much as I could, but I was not efficient enough. The last thing I saw before they left with her was that one of them was carrying her on her back even though she was protesting a lot. Then I felt something hit me and everything went dark. - Um... I see. Do you have any idea who could have been behind this? - Not really sir. Odette has many friends in Paris, he answers with some problems to stay upright because he is dizzy. When Victor, who arrived a few minutes earlier, notices this, he takes Merante by one of his arms and gently helps him to sit down. The dance teacher thanks him, then Felicie tells the policeman: - I think his ideas are not clear at the moment. - Who are you exactly in relation to the missing woman? - I am his adopted daughter sir and he is my teacher. - Good. In this case, do you have any idea who may want to take revenge on your mother or something? - I know someone but she is in prison. - That would be a track to follow, so tell me. - Regine the High. She has already tried to kill me so I think she is the kind of woman who is desperate to get what she wants. - We will search in this direction. Please tell your teacher to come to the police station when he is able to do so. I have to take his testimony. - Of course sir. Then all the police begin to examine the house and Felicie takes the opportunity to join Merante. It makes her suffer to see him in such a state, who is always so confident. Now he looks like a broken man, inside and out. She would not dare do such a thing normally, but they both need a little comfort, so she hugs him, being careful not to press her wounds. When she interrupts the hug, he has a small smile on his face and she asks him: - How do you feel now? - Better than before, thank you for asking. I only have a headache. - Can you explain what you said to the officer, about Odette and you kissing? - We had planned to talk about it tonight during dinner, but what happened changed all our plans. If only I had been faster... - You did your best Merante. If she had been alone at the time, it could have been worse because no one could have seen who took it away. - I guess you're right, Felicie, but I wish I had time to do more. - Excuse me for interrupting your conversation with Mr. Merante, but you can't stay here all three until we have finished gathering all the clues that could help us find the missing woman. - I understand inspector. Come with me children you will stay at my home until they find Odette. - Ok, Merante. I'm just going to my room to take some things. Her teacher approves but she still turns to the inspector to ask him if she can go to her room. He gives her permission, then she follows Merante, who was supported by Victor. On the way to go to Merante house, they meet Camille and she asks Felicie: - What happened to him? - He was beaten while trying to prevent Odette from kidnapping Odette at home. - WHAT?! But who could have done such a thing... No! You think my mother would have ... She suddenly realizes what it means and says: - I suppose it's logical to think she's the only one who could do it. By the way, she still has some relations in Paris, in strange places, but they can not be far from here now. - Does that mean you can get an idea of where they could hide? - Yes. I can not let something happen to Odette because of my crazy mother again! - What do you mean? - I know that the fire that destroyed the Opera at its first performance was not declared alone. She's the one who lit it because she was jealous of your mother. Fortunately for Odette, Mr. Merante managed to save her and no one ever guessed that my mother was the culprit. I learned this from the letters I found in the attic of my house. It was a correspondence between her and her partner in crime: Bartholomew Félious, who visited her in her prison a few days ago. I went to the police station when I met you. - When did you make this discovery? - Just after my classes, I was looking for something in the attic when I found them. - Do you have the address of this man? - Of course Mr Merante. - Come with us to my place. We will call the police from there. It will be faster than going to the police station on foot. - It's a good idea! Thank you Mr. Merante. A few minutes after they had called the police, they arrived, soaked to the bone because they were surprised by the rain, which suddenly began to fall, consistent with the gray thoughts of the three children and Merante. The chief inspector examines the letters that Camille has given him and immediately sends some of his men to Mr. Félious's home. They found him with their prisoner, they had almost started to \"play\" with her, but fortunately for Odette, the police arrived just in time. She can return to Merante house a few days later and now, the sun is shining even more than in recent days in the sky and in the hearts of everyone around her. They will never forget what Camille did for their family. ","Summary":" Author note: This story take place right after Regine Le Haut send Felicie back to the orphanage. I"},{"Movie":"Ballerina Leap!","Title":"Dancing Doll","Author":"PaperGardener","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12769216","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"I-I'm here to see Camille,\" Félicie said, stuttering from both cold and nerves as she stood on the snow-covered doorsteps, looking up at a sullen man in a dark coat who she had never seen before. At least it wasn't Camille's mother. \"What is this regarding?\" he asked, his face growing stern as he took in her borrowed coat from Odette, hanging loose on her shoulders. After a late autumn, winter had fallen on Paris in an icy blast, and Félicie had found herself not well prepared. \"I- we, um… we both dance at the ballet school at the Opera,\" Félicie said, rocking back on her heels. \"And she hasn't been to class in weeks. So I came to check on her. Is she all right?\" If anything, his face grew harder. \"From the ballet, you say? Well, we appreciate your concern, but Mlle. Le Haut is not seeing visitors now. Good day.\" He made to slam the door but a woman's voice stopped him. \"Wait.\" The man turned to reveal a stern-looking woman coming down the hallway, dressed all in black with her light, silver-streaked hair curled and pulled into a high bun. She wasn't exactly tall, although she gave that impression from how she walked and held her head. And though she wasn't exactly pretty, yet she still had an elegance that made her seem quite beautiful. \"Madame Chauvon,\" the man said with a respectful nod, stepping aside. \"You are a friend of Camille?\" she asked, looking down at her. \"Yeah,\" Félicie said, then muttered, \"more or less.\" She tried not to fidget as the woman's eyes took in the oversized coat, the heavy scarf, the patched skirt above her ankles. Mme. Chauvon turned to the man. \"Let her in.\" \"Pardon, Madame, but are you sure? I don't know if the Mademoiselle has earned such a privilege as visitors. Especially one of the petit rats from the Opera,\" the man said in a conspiratorial whisper. \"Camille is still a little girl, she needs friends,\" she said, offering no room for argument. Then she looked again at Félicie and waved a hand. \"Come along.\" \"Right, uh, thanks,\" Félicie said, edging past the glaring man with an almost apologetic smile. She breathed a sigh of relief- it was already much warmer than outside. And this woman seemed much nicer than Camille's mom. \"And be sure not to touch anything,\" the woman said sharply. \"Right!\" Félicie said, hurrying to catch up as she began to climb the spiraling staircase. Mme. Chauvon moved smoothly, holding her skirt up with a delicate air, the kind of high-class thing that Félicie would have mimicked for fun at the orphanage. Without stopping, Mme. Chauvon turned her head and glanced back at her. \"I want to thank you for coming. Camille has been quite upset these past few days, shutting herself in that room, barely speaking to us. Understandable of course, poor thing, but still. Perhaps you might be able to comfort her.\" \"I'll, uh, do my best?\" Félicie said, wondering why Camille would need comforting. Was she still upset about not getting the role? \"To be quite honest, I'm concerned for her. To think her mother had been pushing her so hard into ballet, of all the things. I wonder what my brother would have thought, God rest his soul. He had practically saved Regine by marrying her, letting her have a real life instead of being a dancer. Oh, pardon, I meant no offense,\" she said, though didn't look very apologetic. Félicie shrugged, spared from having to answer as they reached the top landing and went down a dark green hallway to a closed door on which the woman gave a sharp rap with a gloved hand. \"Camille, you have a visitor: Mademoiselle Félicie, from your class at the Opera.\" \"Oh… one moment, please,\" came the muffled response. Félicie could hear hurried movement, and in less than a minute Camille came out in a drab black dress, lined with crepe. She glanced to Félicie, surprise flickering in her blue eyes, before looking up at the woman. \"Thank you, aunt,\" Camille said, her face expressionless. \"I hope you're not dancing in there,\" she said stiffly, peering through the open door. \"No Madame. Just reading.\" Félicie found herself shrinking into her scarf at the coolness between the two women. More chilling, though, was how different Camille was than before. Of course, Félicie barely knew her in the first place, but it was still odd. Before, she had been bold as brass, all full of energy and confidence. This new Camille was cold, quiet and somber. Félicie decided she missed the old her already. \"Good,\" Mme. Chauvon said, straightening up with a slight nod. \"See that you escort your guest out when she leaves.\" \"Yes, Madame.\" Félicie stood against the wall as the older woman turned to leave and paused, then looked at her and smiled in a way that made everything about her seem soft and kind. With a slight nod, an unspoken thank you , she left the two girls alone. Félicie decided that she liked her a whole lot better than Camille's mom. Which wasn't saying much, considering Mme. Le Haut had tried to murder her just weeks earlier. \"Come on,\" Camille muttered, staring after her aunt as Félicie stepped into the room. It was only when she was standing in the middle did Félicie recognize it as the practice room where she had first met Camille. The practice barre was gone, the tall mirrors draped with heavy cloth, her balcony door lined in black crepe. It felt so cold and dismal Félicie shivered, rubbing her arms. \"Whoah, what happened? Did someone die?\" \"My mother.\" Félicie turned and stared at Camille, who didn't meet her eyes. \"The funeral was a couple days ago,\" said in the same flat voice. \"Oh. I… I had no idea. I'm sorry. Was it from the, uh…\" Félicie bit her lip, and thought to the night of the premier, when Mme. Le Haut had chased her, had gone completely mad. She had half-hoped it had been a bad dream. \"She fell, after she chased you up that statue. I couldn't see it all that well, but something happened, and all the scaffolding fell on top of her. They say she hit her head pretty bad. She passed away soon after.\" \"I didn't know. I…oh. Mon Dieu , it was my fault, wasn't it? Camille, I—\" \"No!\" she said forcefully, the first real emotion she had shown that whole time. \"It wasn't your fault. My… my mother tried to kill you .\" Félicie didn't know what to say. It was the truth. A horrible, ugly truth that lay between them in the cold room. \"She tried to kill you, and for what? Because of me, because I didn't get that part. She was so angry that I lost that role.\" Camille winced as if in pain, gripping her left arm. She kept her eyes down. \"I… I had never seen her like that before, it was so, so…\" \"Terrifying?\" Camille nodded. \"Does anyone else know what happened that day?\" \"No,.\" Camille still refused to look at her. \"I told everyone that I'd been playing there and my mother went to save me before I hurt myself. That the scaffolding had come down by accident. I didn't want them to know what she'd done. What she had tried to do.\" She looked up and locked eyes with Félicie, both angry and desperate. \"You can't tell anyone. Promise!\" \"I won't, I promise\" Félicie said, and swore to herself that she would take the secret to the grave. She wasn't a fan of Camille for many reasons, but she respected her. Her dedication, her strength, and now her loyalty. Despite everything, Camille was still trying to protect her mother. Even if it meant taking the blame on her own shoulders. \"I guess this whole funeral thing is why you haven't been to class.\" \"Well, duh,\" she said in a much more familiar, more human voice. \"So… when can you go back to the Opera?\" Camille sighed. \"Maybe never.\" \"What? Why?\" \"My aunt and uncle don't want me to do ballet. They said that it's beneath me, and want me to go back to Coubervoie with them and take up studies in piano and poetry.\" Camille paused, her face scrunching up at the thought. Then she curled in on herself, looked miserable again. \"And even if they did let me do ballet again, I wouldn't be able to return for months, maybe a year.\" \"Whoah, a year?\" Félicie said, trying and failing to imagine a whole year- months and months- without dancing. And Odette was often telling her that even missing one day of training was bad. \"At least nine months, but probably longer. My aunt is making sure I mourn properly this time. She said that I hadn't shown enough respect when my dad died.\" \"Your dad?\" Camille nodded. Félicie leaned back as the realization struck her. They were both orphans. The same, and yet completely different. Félicie had never know her parents, had never known what it was like to have a family, a home. Camille had had it all, and knew the pain of losing it. She didn't know which one was worse. \"That sucks.\" Camille gave her an incredulous look. Félicie backtracked. \"I mean, um, that's really terrible. About your parents. And it's awful that you don't get to do ballet anymore.\" \"Oh please,\" Camille said, crossing her arms. \"As if you'd care. Now you have less competition to deal with at the Opera. I'm not stupid, you know.\" \"I mean it. Besides, I was actually looking forward to dancing against you again. What we did in the theater that day was, like, the most fun I've ever had doing ballet. Ever.\" \"Oh. Yeah, that was pretty fun.\" Camille relaxed a little, loosening her crossed arms. She stepped over to a chaise lounge against the wall and perched on the edge, feigning an air of indifference. \"So… how have classes been? Are they still rehearsing for the new ballet?\" \"Yeah, there's always rehearsals, and class is exhausting like usual.\" Félicie idly kicked her foot up stepping over to where Camille sat. \"You're lucky you don't have to do them, my legs are killing me, and Odette says I can't even take one day off. Oh, and then some of the girls were talking about auditioning for a ballet coming up in the spring. Something called, uh, Copeh… Cope-ah something.\" \" Coppélia ?\" \"That!\" Félicie said with a snap of her fingers. Camille gave a little huff of laughter and a condescending look. \"That's a famous ballet, you do know that?\" \"Really?\" Camille rolled her eyes and leaned back, her eyes focused on her pale fingers against the black of her dress, as if deep in thought. \"I always thought I was similar to her,\" she said softly. \"To who?\" \"Coppélia, the dancing doll in the ballet. I know you're supposed to want to be Swanilda- that's the lead role by the way, since you clearly don't know anything.\" \"Swanilda? That's a weird name.\" \"Well, that's her name,\" Camille said slowly, raising her eyebrow as if Félicie was asking her to change it. \"It looks like a fun role to play. You know, I bet you'd be good as her. But whenever I watched the ballet, all I kept thinking about was the doll. I think… I think she scared me. It's so stupid!\" she said suddenly, balling her hands into fists. \"What?\" Félicie went and sat beside her. The prim little sofa was not as comfortable as she had hoped, but she ignored it. Camille hunched her shoulders, leaning away from her. \"If you tell this to anyone, you'll regret it.\" \"Uh, all right,\" Félicie said, confused but curious. \"I was afraid I'd become her,\" Camille finally whispered, so soft Félicie had to lean close to hear her. \"I was afraid that one day I would become nothing more than a pretty dancing doll. I'd dream about it, all alone in a dark room, and forced to dance and dance, never stopping… I felt so powerless.\" \"It was just a dream,\" Félicie said and put a tentative hand on her shoulder that was quickly brushed off, as Camille sat up and glared at her. \"I know it was, idiot!\" she said, but the tremor in her voice took away the harshness. \"Then—\" \"But it's true, isn't it? That's what I am!\" she said, and there was a desperate pleading look in her eyes. \"Just a dumb doll. At rehearsal, Mérante said that I was emotionless, that I needed to express something and… and it was like I didn't know how. I can't even answer why I dance, and I've been doing it most of my life. I can't remember if I ever wanted to do ballet. I never questioned it. I only ever… I only did what my mother told me.\" She let out a deep breath, her expression shifting from self-anger to misery. Her eyes dimmed, her shoulders lowered and her face took on a flat, dull look. \"And now look at me. My mother died and I… I don't feel anything. I should be sad. I should have cried, right? Or, or something. Maybe I'm supposed to be happy, or relieved. But there's nothing. My mom's dead and…\" They sat in silence, the unsaid words lingering between them. Félicie thought of her own mother. She thought of her own dream, or maybe memory, or merely hope personified, of a red-headed woman dancing and twirling as she tossed the pale green music box high in the air… her music box. She fumbled in the deep pocket of her coat and pulled it out, the chipped paint on the top almost as comforting as the soft weight in her hand. She opened it– more careful than she usually was- and with a few small cranks it began to play its tinny lullaby. \"Huh, another dancing doll,\" Camille murmured. Félicie smiled, and then it faded. \"This is all I have left of my mom,\" Félicie said, watching it spin. \"I never knew her, I don't even know if she's alive. I have a memory of her holding me, I think, from when I was a baby. Or maybe it's just my imagination. I don't know. When I hear this, it's nice because it's like... it's easier to miss her. But I don't think I've ever really felt, you know, sad. Just, just this weird… emptiness.\" The music box gave a final 'ting' and went still. She could feel Camille's eyes on her, but Félicie only stared into the blank face of the figurante. She clamped the lid down, feeling the chipped paint under her thumb. Why was she telling all this to Camille, anyway? \"Sometimes the other kids at the orphanage would cry for their mom and dad. I couldn't bear to hear them, so I always ran away to the hills or the bell tower. I didn't want to think about it. I mean, I wanted parents, I missed the idea of them, of having loving parents in a warm home, but…\" She let out a shaky breath. Despite what she had said, her eyes were warm. \"Maybe, maybe what I'm trying to say is… it's all right. To not cry.\" \"I'm sorry,\" Camille said after a pause. Félicie looked up, having never heard her apologize for anything. Camille looked away, seeming surprised herself. \"I'm sorry for breaking it before. Especially since it means so much to you. I've been really awful to you, haven't I?\" Félicie shrugged. \"Yeah, you were. But to be fair, I did steal your identity. And took that lead role.\" \"True.\" Camille leaned forward, her head bowed as her hands gripped the hard edges of the chaise. \"It was my dream. I so badly wanted to get into that school, you have no idea. Every day I trained and waited for that letter, and in the end none of it mattered. I failed. And now I may never get to dance on that stage. Ever. Everything, all this time and work… and it was all for nothing.\" Camille gave a shuddering sigh, looking out into the empty room, growing darker in the fading winter light. Félicie followed her gaze to the barre covered up, the mirrors, the scuffed and polished floor. For the first time, Félicie truly felt guilty. She hadn't meant to hurt anyone, not really. And even though Camille had once said that she only danced because of her mother, Félicie suspected there was more to it than that. \"Do you… want to keep dancing?\" \"I don't know.\" Camille hugged her arms around her chest, sounding so lost that Félicie looked around, trying to think of something, something… \"Well, would you like to dance now?\" Félicie asked, turning to her. \"What do you mean 'now?'\" \"I mean we should dance. Right now!\" Félicie jumped up and pulled her scarf off. Camille didn't move, just squinted at her, as if waiting for the punch line to a joke. Félicie just grinned. \"Whenever I'm sad or anxious, I dance.\" \"Of course you do,\" Camille said, rolling her eyes. \"Come on, don't you ever just dance for fun?\" \"You really haven't been paying attention,\" she said, but was smiling all the same, and Félicie knew she was doing something right. She fiddled with the last button of her coat and shucked it off, throwing it into the air before it landed in a heap with a muffled 'thwump' before she reached a hand out, and waited. Camille bit her lip, then cautiously took her hand and let herself be pulled to her feet. She looked down at her long black dress, and began unfastening the buttons. In a flash she had the drab dress pulled over her head, revealing a white tulle skirt that was almost blinding in contrast. \"I thought you said you weren't dancing in here?\" Félicie teased, putting her hands on her hips. \"What my aunt doesn't know won't hurt her,\" Camille said, then carefully placed the black dress on the back of a chair. Félicie jumped from foot to foot, unable to contain her sudden burst of energy, and with a low whoop she twirled, spinning about until Camille hushed her with a look to the floor below. So Félicie shrugged and swung herself around the blonde with a light laugh. Camille hesitated, looking strangely unsure of herself, but Félicie gave an encourage smile and was glad when Camille moved into third position, one arm curving to the side, and then she too began to dance. Although not even half a minute in and Félicie stopped, just watching as Camille did a sissone jump into tendu . Her footwork was perfect, her arms sharp and precise but Félicie suspected that she was doing a specific routine, only going through the motions. Thinking fast, Félicie grabbed her hand as she brought it down from an arabesque and stepped in front, facing her. \"What are you doing? You're ruining it,\" Camille said, coming to a halt as she glanced at the hand holding hers. \"Try dancing with me.\" She frowned but allowed herself to be led along and together they sashayed down the room, Camille stumbling for a moment before matching her wide, kicking steps like what she used to do in Brittany. When at the end of the room, she faced Camille and spun her, bringing out a light laugh from the other girl. They danced together, hand in hand, before Camille did the same to her, twirling her, but Félicie flowed under her arms and kept going, spinning away before launching into a leap. Camille followed close behind with her own chaines turns , smiling for real, and finally looked like she was having some fun. The two of them danced, part ballet and part everything else. Camille had frowned at Félicie's more unusual moves, before copying and putting her own spin on it, sometimes literally. They pranced about and nearly hit each other when they got too close, and Camille laughed once after Félicie had landed on her rump, dizzy from too many fouettés. It really was fun to dance with Camille, she thought with great satisfaction, especially when she really put her heart and soul into it. Of course, they had very different styles, Camille in general was more reserved, precise, almost thoughtful, while Félicie was, frankly, not. As they danced Camille's movements became softer, slower, but Félicie shrugged it off, figuring she was growing tired as well. She spun about with a wild flourish, then turned to Camille and stopped at the sight. Camille stood motionless, with her arms high, reaching, reaching for something. She balanced on her toes, her face tight with pain, the definitive look of someone holding back a sob. Slowly she lowered her hands and sank down, bringing them to her chest as if… as if… A shudder ran through her. It was as if cradling a child. There was a hollow thud as Camille dropped to her knees and buried her face in her arms. Then she began to cry, taking deep shaking breaths between sobs that shook her thin frame. Félicie stood still, fighting back the impulse to flee. She vividly thought back to the orphanage, to the cries of the other children. It was almost like she heard them as well, the children who cried into their pillows because they missed their family so much, or screamed in anger that they had been abandoned. Or at how unfair life could be. Félicie couldn't miss her family, because she never had one. She wanted to run. Run far away to the snow-dusted streets of Paris where girls didn't cry and a tinny melody didn't echo in her mind. Instead, she brushed a quick hand at the corner of her eye and knelt down beside Camille who stayed bent over, hiding her face. Like a child who'd lost her mom. Félicie bowed her head, thinking of her own mom. Her dad. There was nothing but a lonely ache deep within. For a long time neither moved, and night began to fall outside. \"It'll be all right,\" Félicie whispered, and hoped it was true. ⁂ Camille was trapped. Slowly, endlessly, she twirled upon her toes, stuck in an unmoving, perfect arabesque. Her arms and legs felt no pain, just a hollow numbness. Her cheeks were stiff with blush, her mouth a painted smile. She was alone. No one... no one else was there, all gone, vanished. From high on a pedestal she spun, surrounded by a murky haze that lingered between darkness and nothingness, and beneath her feet came a tinny, metallic tune that echoed and faltered. If she fell, she wouldn't be able to stop herself. She'd just break. All someone would have to do is push her… She shivered, but dolls don't shiver. They don't cry. Or speak. They just look pretty and one day they shatter. Help , she tried to say. Help me . Please … All at once, the music fell silent and she jerked to a stop. The stillness was deafening. There came a soft noise: the tiny, familiar sound of slippered feet. From the darkness a figure approached, little more than a ghost. It was a girl. She wore soft white tulle, all covered in beautiful embroidery and with her dark brown hair pulled up in a bun. On her feet were pink dance slippers, and her fingers twirled a golden stalk of wheat. Over her shoulder, a butterfly fluttered about. Camille knew her instinctively. Swanilda. The lowly peasant girl from the ballet, who was kind and brave and loved by everyone. Who wore a real smile instead of a painted one, and was all the better for it. Then Camille saw her bright red hair, tied in a braid. Had it been different before? She wasn't sure. For seconds or hours they stared at one another. Camille stood trapped in her arabesque, terror gripping her un-beating heart. Would she force her to dance? Or break her? One little push… Then the girl raised her hands over her head, twirled her wrists around each other, and stretched her arm out with a warm smile. Camille understood. Dance with me . Camille tried to shake her head. I can't . Without any sense of movement, Camille found that she no longer looked down from her precarious height but stood level with her, very close. Even so, her face was hard to see. The girl stepped closer and touched Camille's outstretched hand. A shiver ran all through her. Something changed: her finger twitched, her foot dipped, and she could move again. Slowly she leaned back, hardly daring to breathe. Her hand went to her chest, and she could feel the fluttered beating of her heart. For a moment she waited, afraid to move, afraid that something else would take control, but it never came. She was free. Camille looked around and they were on a stage, empty and dark but for a bare bulb on a staff in the center of the stage: a ghost light. It faintly illuminated the vast array of seats spilling out past the orchestra pit, the shadowed wings on either side. It was… exhilarating. Before, the emptiness had been oppressive, but as she stood there it had become like a blank canvas, and she held the brush. Music began to play, a lone violin at first, then a second joined in. There came the deep poom-poom of a cello, the staccato of drums, the warbling of a flute. The tune wavered, deeply familiar and more in her mind than in her ear. She rose on the balls of her feet, almost on tip toe, straining upwards and then sinking down, keenly aware of how her tulle skirt fluttered against her arms. Camille glanced at the other girl facing the silent theater. There was a faint sadness about her. For a moment she wavered, like a water's reflection- a flicker of dark hair, round arms and a face she had never seen before. Then it stopped, and Camille thought nothing of it. The music soared louder, urging them, welcoming them to dance. The other girl, her Swanilda, turned toward her and held her arms wide, as if beckoning her. Camille took a deep breath and felt a real smile on her cheeks as she slid into forward tendu, feeling the slight strain, a moment's pause, a breath. Then she stepped forward, kicking her feet up in a pas de chat , her tulle flaring outwards as she turned with her arms high and wide, feeling the air pull at the whisps of her hair. She couldn't remember every dancing like this. Perhaps she never had. Each step was unplanned, flowing with each beat and breath. She felt alive. The world changed, the footlights flared and everything sang gold and crimson. Camille stood on stage of the Opera de Paris, the bright lights warm on her skin, burning in her eyes. She took deep gasps into her lungs, reveling in the rise and fall of her chest, how her legs trembled as she sank into a plié, arms stretched out at her sides. It was hard. It was painful at times. But it was all worth it. It'll be all right. She would dance again. She would find her reason. Author Notes: Finally I got this done! I've been wanting to explore more about Camille- she has one of the most potentially interesting storylines in the movie (ok, besides Meradette stuff) and I think the movie fell way short of her potential. So here's my take on what might have happened next. I think I'm one of the few (only?) to think that her mother actually died at the end. I just assumed she wouldn't survive all the falling scaffolding. Funny enough, in 1884 the Opera really was putting on Coppélia . Speaking of, this is somewhat of a precursor to my long fic that will be coming soon. 19th century French funeral customs: a child who lost a parent spent: \"six months in crape trimmings, three in plain black, and three in half-mourning… Additionally, society activities would be given up for at least three months, although it was more likely they would be given up for nine months.\" I've got more plans for these two :D ","Summary":" \"I-I'm here to see Camille,\" Félicie said, stuttering from both cold and nerves as she stood on t"},{"Movie":"Ballerina Leap!","Title":"Second Chances","Author":"teaAndFandoms","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12915355","Passage":"[Chapter 1] p class=\"MsoNormal\"span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1;\" /spanThe stage was quiet, and Félicie was about to perform. Odette and Mérante were watching in the wings with bated breath. The curtain began to rise as Rosita and Félicie began their synchronous dance. The audience sighed, and Odette brushed a tear of pride from the corner of her eye. Mérante rested his pensive gaze on Odette's profile, shadowed by the darkness of the wings. The two of them had been inseparable before the fire. They headlined dozens of shows as the prince and princess of ballet, Mérante and Odette. But the fire had confined their fates to sorrow and loss. It made Mérante finally believe that old saying, that all good things come to an end. It had made Odette cynical, hostile. Just as she was forced to take on beggar's work when her leg no longer supported her own weight, let alone her dancing career, he rose to the top of the teaching staff at the ballet school. Mérante always thought it a twisted irony that, in becoming everything he dreamed as a child, he lost everything that he had ever loved./p p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .5in;\"Yet here they were, standing on the edge of the stage watching Odette's young protégé succeed. She danced with the passion of a flame, the grace of wind rushing atop a canyon, the poise of a tiger prowling the underbrush. She was like nothing he had seen since Odette stopped dancing, and now he saw Odette with that spark of light in her, of hope he feared she had lost long ago. He watched her brush the tear from her face, and wondered for the first time in years at the old adage that had become his mantra. Maybe all good things don't come to an end, but are just peppered with some misfortune along the way. Perhaps life was just a dance between joy and sorrow, where even as one takes the upper hand of the other, a well-trained dancer knows that in a moment, the power will shift and the dance will become something new. Mérante considered this as he glanced between the girl on stage who was not yet lost to the world's sorrow, and the woman he loved most in the world who was just realizing joy again. He considered the events that had brought Félicie to Odette and the ballet school, and likened them to serendipity. In the end, he couldn't let this opportunity go to waste. Odette was right beside him, and who knew how long he might have to wait until that happened again? They had been this close perhaps three times in the last ten years, and he was determined to change that. He remembered his father's advice the day before his first ballet performance. em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\"Louis, you're onto something good here.

Voici ma première contribution à la nuit du Fof du vendredi 4 mai 2018 une heure sur le thème suivant: Coupable. J'espère que cet OS vous plaira. Bonne lecture ! Injustement accusé. Je cherche des réponses à mes questions, j'en ai des tas, et d'heure en heure, elles s'accumulent. Pourquoi ne m'a-t-il rien dit ? Pourquoi s'être caché ? Pourquoi ne m'a-t-il pas fait confiance ? Est-ce qu'il a cru que je le rejetterais s'il m'avait mise au courant ? Quelle est la signification de tout ce cirque ? Pourquoi me mentir à moi alors que l'on s'est toujours tout dit jusqu'à maintenant et que je n'ai jamais cessé de me fier à lui ? Il m'en a pourtant fait des coups tordus, mais là, c'est le summum. Je me retiens difficilement de me venger. Je dois être patiente. La sentence est déjà en approche. Je préfère en rester à mon jeu de questions, qui resteront sûrement sans réponses. Pourquoi diable a-t-il fallu qu'il me fasse un coup pareil AUJOURD'HUI ?! Je l'avais pourtant prévenu qu'il devait se tenir tranquille. Au moins jusqu'à ce que la tempête passe. Mais non, cette bourrique n'a pas voulu m'écouter. Pourquoi est-ce qu'il faut toujours qu'il fonce dans le tas sans réfléchir à la conséquence de ses actes ? Je ne suis pas là pour penser à sa place. Je suis sa sœur bon sang de bois. Pas un truc que l'on peut mettre de côté quand cela nous arrange ! Je devrais lui mettre mon poing dans la figure, mais non, il a suffisamment de problèmes comme ça. Mais mince ! Pourquoi est-ce qu'il a fallu qu'il lui demande cette permission maintenant alors qu'il était si peu enclin à laisser quiconque m'approcher après l'accident avec cette folle de Regine Le Haut qui s'est échappée de sa prison. Il a toujours été extrêmement protecteur envers moi ou notre mère adoptive. Et en plus, Victor étant occupé avec une invention, il n'a pas pu lui donner un coup de main. Et maintenant, voilà qu'il est accusé d'avoir tué quelqu'un, simplement parce qu'il s'est trouvé au mauvais endroit au mauvais moment. En le voyant derrière les barreaux, je sens mon cœur se serrer, je sais qu'il n'a jamais apprécié le fait d'être enfermé. Mon jumeau a toujours été plus volatile que moi, même si j'ai fait les 400 coups avec lui. Mais me faire ça aujourd'hui, alors que je préparais ce spectacle depuis des mois avec mon professeur, et désormais, notre père adoptif par alliance, je ne le lui pardonnerais jamais, même si ce n'est pas de sa faute. Pourtant, tout est contre lui. Bon dieu ! Qu'est-ce qui lui a pris de toucher ce foutu marteau ?! Bon d'accord, il ne faisait pas très clair dans la ruelle, mais il aurait dû sentir l'odeur du sang et tourner les talons, ou simplement appeler la police, voire même une ambulance plutôt que de toucher quoi que ce soit. En plus, il s'avère que la personne assassinée est quelqu'un avec qui il était en conflit depuis que nous sommes installés à Paris. La police l'a trouvé là, figé devant le cadavre, et bien sûr, qui a été prévenu le premier ? Notre père adoptif: Louis Merante a aussitôt interrompu mon entraînement en plus de tous ses autres cours de la journée afin de pouvoir aller voir mon frère au centre de police. Je peux encore sentir la fureur de papa sur le chemin pour rentrer à la maison, lui qui est si calme habituellement, bah là, c'était clair qu'il se retenait de péter un câble. Lorsque nous avons tout raconté à maman et Victor, ils se sont tout de suite portés volontaires pour mener une petite enquête chacun de leur côté. Nous devions trouver le véritable coupable avant que la sentence ne soit rendue. Mon frère a beau être inconscient, tête en l'air, très agité et incroyablement maladroit, il n'en reste pas moins mon jumeau et je l'aime. De plus, il ne mérite pas d'être puni pour quelque chose qu'il n'a pas fait. Alors, même si j'aurais préféré pouvoir danser, avec l'aide de mes amis de Paris, nous nous sommes mis à fouiller partout, en nous faisant les plus discrets possibles. Et vous savez quoi ? On a eu du bol ! Nous sommes tombés sur un témoin du meurtre au gré de nos errances. Son histoire a été vérifiée par rapport aux indices relevés sur la scène de crime, les dires de mon jumeau: Clément, mais aussi le fait que le véritable coupable, contrairement à mon frère, avait la force nécessaire pour pouvoir fracasser la tête de quelqu'un à coup de marteau. Il ne reste plus à la police qu'à lui mettre la main dessus, et ça, c'est une autre paire de manches. Heureusement, la police connaissant maintenant la véritable raison du meurtre: une querelle à cause d'une femme, ils ont eu la bonne idée de se servir d'elle comme d'un appât pour attraper le criminel. Jamais les membres de notre famille n'ont été aussi soulagés en recevant la visite de policiers. Il nous faut maintenant sortir Clément de son trou, il y est resté assez longtemps et j'espère que cela lui mettra un peu de plomb dans la cervelle. Nous rendre là où il a été gardé prisonnier ne fut pas chose aisée parce que le lieu avait des horaires de visite assez particulier, mais le plus important, c'est que nous sommes parvenus à le récupérer. Il a passé un mauvais quart d'heure avec certains des autres pensionnaires de l'établissement, mais avec de bons soins, il fut vite remis sur pied. Il promit de ne plus agir de façon aussi inconsciente et nous espérons tous, pour sa propre sécurité, qu'il s'y tiendra. Il n'est pas passé loin d'être jugé coupable, et vu la peine encourue par le véritable meurtrier, je suis bien contente que nous ayons pu tirer mon frère de ce mauvais pas. Je ne sais pas ce que j'aurais fait sans mon brave Clément durant mes premières années de vies, et puis papa l'adore malgré sa tendance à s'attirer les pires ennuis. Cette expérience eue le mérite de tous nous rapprocher. Et je me suis fait silencieusement la promesse de toujours garder un oeil sur mon garnement de frère pour éviter qu'une situation de ce type ne se reproduise ultérieurement.

Her sweet girl was already gone – training had ramped up significantly after her debut in the Nutcracker last week. The past few days had been a whirlwind for them both, and their schedules rarely lined up anymore. Félicie was now enrolled in several technique and performance classes, a few of which were taught by Mérante. Louis Mérante. Odette had never met anyone else like him. His intensity, drive, and precision were unmatched, and his awareness of the world around him made him the ballet master and world-renowned choreographer that he was today. Unfortunately, that also awarded him a much higher social status than her, which in Odette's mind only furthered the gap between them. Until the other day, despite their history, she never would have considered trying to reconnect with him – to rekindle what they once had… She lifted a hand to her face, where she could still the feel ghost of his soft kiss. Before that happened, the two of them had been locked in a complicated, tense series of interactions that did little for Odette's confusion about here they stood with each other. Odette smiled, remembering how he'd looked at her, and how it felt to have his arm around her shoulders. She couldn't fathom why he would still want her...the fire ten years ago had robbed her of her ability to dance; she was poor and, apart from her cleaning skills, had little value to the ballet. Félicie had given Odette hope again, but it wasn't the same. She wasn't the same. Nevertheless, their interactions had been distinctly different lately – more…intentional. Even if it was just in passing, Mérante made a point of stopping to greet her and checked in whenever he had the chance. More than once, he had sought her out while she was sweeping the stage at night. He would watch for a minute or two, admiring her grace and poise before making his presence known. Mérante wanted to get to know Odette again – he'd spent so much time achingly far from her after being pushed away, unable to help or support her after the fire without hurting her more. He wanted to make up for that time as best he could. Though most of their nights were spent talking, Mérante had once managed to persuade Odette to dance with him. She had been incredibly reluctant, insisting that she couldn't and backing away until Mérante had walked right up to her, taken her cane, and held her hands tightly in his. She could smell his cologne as he looked her right in the eye. \"Please?\" he asked quietly, tentatively. She sighed and gave in, leaning into him as he walked her slowly to the center of the stage. Both of their hearts were racing, and they both pretended not to notice. Mérante wrapped one arm snugly around Odette, held her hand with the other, and started to turn them through a series of circles. After a few minutes, he led her through a slow turn and dipped her low, making her laugh. When they were both standing upright again, Mérante kissed Odette's forehead. She pulled back and looked at him, her cheeks pink and her eyes full of intensity. His lips parted as if to say something, but Odette cut him off. She took back her cane and looked down awkwardly. \"Thank you for the dance, but I should go…Félicie must be wond– \" She stopped short when she saw the flash of disappointment in Mérante's eyes. He turned away, searching for a reason to ask her to stay. Staring into the audience, all he could come up with was \"How's your leg?\" Odette extended it out in front of her, wincing slightly. \"It's fine,\" she murmured, \"just mildly inconvenient.\" Mérante looked at her over his shoulder, curiosity evident on his face. \"Where did it happen?\" \"I guess I never told you…\" She took a deep breath and made her way to a spot close to where he was standing. \"My foot went through the stage floor right around here. That's where the fire started: underneath us all. It just gave out beneath me.\" As she got lost in the memory, terror crept into her voice and she spoke faster and faster as she retraced her steps around the stage. \"It was very, very hot, and I could feel my tights starting to burn. One of the other ballerinas eventually pulled me out – I wanted to check on my foot but by that time the proscenium was starting to crack and the smoke was so thick we could barely see, much less breathe. We tried to run but everything started falling and next thing I knew the ceiling was hitting the stage. I dove to try and avoid a huge piece of debris and ended up right in the path of another. I remember the snapping sound when it landed on my leg and I remember it hurting, but only briefly. I passed out not too long after.\" She paused, sweat on her brow and tears on her face. She leaned heavily on her cane; her legs were trembling, as was her voice. Mérante's elegant features were contorted in pain and sadness as he watched Odette try to regain her breath. She looked down and continued. \"I thought I was going to die there. I have no idea how I ended up outside. The worst part of it all was that when I woke up after it was all over, I wished I was dead. I knew I wouldn't dance again. The burns on my foot were going to scar and my leg wouldn't allow it. At that moment, I thought I would've rather died dancing than survive and have to try to find a way to live without it.\" The silence that settled over the two of them was unlike any other. The tension was palpable as the two locked eyes across the stage. Mérante's heart ached for her and he was frantically trying to compose himself. Alas, when he spoke, his voice was still raw with sorrow. \"Odette, why didn't you tell me?\" \"About what?\" she snapped, \"About wishing I was dead?\" He wasn't entirely surprised by the hostility, but it stung nonetheless. Then, suddenly, Odette sat down on the edge of the stage, put her head in her hands, and let the tears flow freely. \"I was so ashamed. The fire took everything from me. I had no idea who I was without ballet – to be honest, I still don't. You deserve so much more than what I can offer - I'm…I'm nothing.\" The only other time he'd seen her cry was during Félicie's Nutcracker debut, and even then those were tears of pride. Tears of pain or sadness? Never. Mérante's shock gave way to a quiet, passionate rage. Here he was, letting Odette walk around in this indescribable pain, thinking that she wasn't worthy of the world she missed so desperately. He knelt next to her, took her in his arms and rested his chin lightly on the top of her head, fighting the very strong urge to kiss her. \"My dear, you don't see yourself very clearly. You're so far from nothing. You're…you're everything .\" The two stayed like that for a considerable amount of time, until Mérante noticed that Odette was beginning to doze off. She had allowed herself to be comforted, and was now worn out. Trying not to disturb her too much, he picked her up and started to carry her to her room. She opened her eyes, saw what was happening, and smiled to herself. She sat up a little and brushed her lips against his cheek. His eyes closed briefly, savoring the moment. \"Thank you, Louis.\" Odette whispered. His breath hitched in his throat. She hadn't used his first name in years – he'd forgotten how it sounded when she said it. Perfect.

I can't believe I'm doing it again. Anyway, this came into my mind when I saw the movie Ballerina/Leap and I have decided to publish it because why not. In my mind, Odette and Mérante did not know each other from before, because if they had and Mérante had not helped her, he's too much of a jerk to deserve her. Yadda yadda yadda, this doesn't belong to me. Of course he had recognized her when he first caught a glimpse of her cleaning the salons at the Palais Garnier; there was no way he would not have. He had heard of her, of course, and seen her dance several times before the fire, when it seemed she was going to take on the whole world with her dance and make it a better place because she had. That had been before his time as Maître de Danse at the Opéra, and he did not know much more than that about her. He tried asking after Odette Livry, but nobody seemed to share his concern or interest in the woman who swept more gracefully than most ballerinas aspired to dance in their lifetimes. And so, Louis Mérante, patient man that he was, found himself watching from afar and wondering about the fate of the woman who had once been a great ballerina and was now apparently scullery maid to Régine Le Haut, apart from working as a maid at the Opéra full time. He did not have any contact with her for several years; there never seemed to be any opportunity for him to approach her, and what few times he had encountered her cleaning his salon before a lesson, she left as fast as she could upon the sight of him. He learnt that she was surprisingly nimble on her feet for someone who needed a cane, so he just appreciated from afar. With time, he began memorizing the moments when she would clean the main stage, for that was always a treat to watch. He only did this on special occasions, though, or when he was feeling particularly disheartened by his students. It felt like he was intruding on something private he should not be looking at, so he cherished those rare moments. She was, more than anybody he had seen, a person born for the stage. Fate was cruel indeed, he thought. Having somebody like her, somebody destined for something, and taking it away entirely too soon, before she even had a chance to truly spread her wings. Enter Félicie Lebras, under the guise of Camille Le Haut. If there was something he found to be discrediting to his work, to his art, and to everything he had lived for, it was having to teach some rich girl just because the Director was besotted with her mother's prime rib. He was proven right in the girl´s first lesson: a complete disaster from beginning to end. That was why he was even more surprised than he would have been when she started improving so quickly over such a short period of time. When he got the full scope of the picture, though, he understood everything. He saw them together one day and it was as simple as putting two and two together. He began taking a shining to the girl because he could see Odette's work on her, apart from her obvious innate love for dance. When Régine Le Haut threatened to fire Odette, he found it inevitable to not get protective. He had come to care for her, at a distance and in a purely platonic way. He had to admit that he found it terribly romantic: somebody who, despite not being able to perform, still lived and breathed for her art. The day when he crossed words with Madame Le Haut was also the first time they spoke. He was leaving the building when he heard his name called. He turned and saw her making her laborious way towards him, so he met her mid-way. \"Thank you, M. Mérante\" were the first words out of her mouth directed at him. Her face was demurely turned down, but in her eyes he could see the fire that had ignited her performances all those years ago. \"I did not even think you knew who I was, but thank you for your kindness towards me and Félicie.\" \"It was the least I could do, Mlle Livry,\" he answered \"since you have given me a pleasant surprise in the form of a pupil. And it really is impossible to not know who you are, for someone with the right set of eyes.\" She smiled at that and looked up. He continued \"You should be proud of yourself. If you continue like that, I just might have to speak to M. le Directeur and get you hired as a teacher.\" That did take her by surprise, and he stayed just enough to enjoy the look of complete bafflement on her face before leaving for the day. After that, she no longer shied away from him, and he found he ran into her more and more. It seemed she also knew more about him than he had initially thought. He felt more at liberty to watch her clean, though it still seemed an invasion of her privacy. Félicie found him once and asked him about her. He told her what he knew to be true: she had been the best of her generation. They spoke more and more, and even if she was not the mysterious sylph who had lived for dance any longer, he cherished knowing the real person behind it all. He got glimpses of the prima ballerina she had been, though she did not like talking about the past. When Félicie left her, he was happy she allowed him to be there for her. The girl had disappointed them both when she had not done what she had to do in order to win the audition, but clearly, Odette took the brunt of it all. He managed to find her rooms inside the Palais Garnier. They were small, but she was used to small. This also meant that she could stop working at the Le Haut residence. He had never seen her smile like that and was pleased that his offer would be taken up on. The day of the premiere came, staring whom he had come to think of as Odette´s adoptive daughter of sorts. He was backstage, making sure everything went well. He put his hand on her shoulder when they were encouraging the child, offering her words of wisdom to help her get through the performance, and when the show started took Odette to his booth with him. She was overcome with emotion watching Félicie, and he was overcome by tenderness watching all the emotions play on her face. He had never been so distracted from a choreography he had put together, but he found he didn't mind. So when he saw her wipe a tear from her cheek, he finally gave in to his desire and kissed her right where the tear had been. She turned to look at him, with open eyes and a small smile, and he drew her closer to him. That night he helped her clean after the show and she spoke to him even more openly than before. He learned about her feelings towards Félicie, what had happened in the fire and her attitude towards dance. He promised himself that he would get her out of there, and he spoke to the director the next morning. She was deemed fit to be his assistant, with the possibility of a class of her own later on. He was more than fine with that. Working in close proximity to her was wonderful, and it meant that they got to know each other quicker and she no longer had to clean for a living. Their proper first kiss happened not long after they started working together: the last class was finished, and as was their custom, they left together. He walked her to her lodgings and when he was about to turn back after a kiss on the cheek, it was her who grabbed him by the necktie and kissed him fully on the lips. Thanks for reading, and I hope this was liked. I have another one I'm kind of writing and might post here when done. ","Summary":" It's been so long since I last dabbled in Fanfiction...

The way she held her wrists, pointed her right toe, let her neck bend into the curve of her arm like a dove with its wing were all Odette's. When he trained dancers, it was much harder to see his imprimatur, he knew that—he was able to perceive each one as entirely separate and was able to identify each one's tendencies and flaws and to correct them so that only the woman remained. Still, Odette had been an exceptional performer, with a rare ability to channel her passionate nature into the most restrained, exquisite choreography, and her commitment to precision and an ephemeral stillness were most evident in the young auburn-haired girl. He and Odette had hardly spoken in years before Félicie arrived, smudged and far too thin in her cast-offs, because Odette could not bear it. She had not let him help her, beyond the barest measures, and he knew he must conceal how it hurt him to see her working as a drudge in the Opéra House she had once reigned in as its queen. His queen. Her face was too drawn and her eyes, those blue eyes that were the color of dusk in Paris, were too large in her pale face but she took pride for sustenance in place of food or drink and always had. She could not believe she had any value to him if she could not dance and she could not dance if she could not do it perfectly. She did not know who she was and so she couldn't believe he could, did and still loved the woman he knew. He had done what he could for her after the fall that crippled her. He knew she would not believe any further declaration of love, not even if it was her favorite Verlaine whose words he borrowed. Félicie had learned lessons Odette had not meant to teach, the most important one—to return. Mérante saw what it was for the others in the class when the young Bretonne arrived every morning, her face scrubbed and her narrow shoulders bare, her vitality contagious. She was the flame that lit the candle. She made him remember how it had first been to come to Paris, to choose the corps and the prima, to quarrel with the conductor and see every face in the audience gilded before the curtain parted. She had made Odette become another woman, not the one she had been before her injury or the one who had been suffering since; she let Odette remember how much she had loved to dance and mourn it, she had let her admit how her leg ached and how much better she liked to cook for two. Félicie had done something else, something that was without words, that let Odette again hold his gaze steadily when he spoke and let her drop her eyes, those smoky blue eyes like a Parisian twilight, when he brushed his lips against her brow. He had found the room in the garret for them but he knew when he told Odette what he wanted now, to give her what she needed, she would nod and she would not turn away when he bent over to kiss her sweet red mouth. She would let him put his arms around her and hold her close enough she did not need her stick. She would even brush back the lock of hair that fell across his forehead and murmur Je me souviens before she pressed her lips to his jaw, before she whispered his name with her hand against his hear ","Summary":" Odette was a very good teacher but not the finest; Mérante could say that, to himself at least, bec"},{"Movie":"Ballerina Leap!","Title":"Practice and Imperfections","Author":"FlatFox","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12915207","Passage":"[Chapter 1] All of you Leap! writers are so darn good!

Louis's eyes widened but he did not speak, the way he would have done years ago, some immediate exclamation. He still held her hand, rough now from years of scrubbing with lye soap, in both of his, and she thought if she had tried to draw hers back, he might have remained quiet yet but would not have let go. The years had passed for them both. \"Afterwards, you had warned me and I hadn't listened and I ruined it all, I wasn't sure how I felt,\" she explained. Those first days of disbelief and the sharpest pain, then the weeks of misery, despair she could not afford, she had not been able to tease it apart, the degrees of loss. Or she had known it would break her, to face it, and so she had not, had found a stick and a series of houses to clean until Louis had asked her, very simply, to attend to the Opéra House, and she had not be able say no. \"You were hurt,\" he said. They would be more careful this time. His lips on her cheek had been deliberate but light, like the tone she used when she said his name for the first time in years Louis , the hint of her Provencal accent making it an endearment again. \"I did not want to say it, if I missed dancing more. If I missed myself, the ballerina I had been. I was stupid, I should have realized,\" she said. One of his hands kept her in his grasp, but the other he lifted to her face, tracing her cheek and chin, then her parted lips. Once, he would have followed swiftly with a kiss, demanding and definitive, possessive, and she would have acquiesced and known he did not have all her heart. \"I think I understand, I think I do. You weren't stupid though, you were only young and so badly hurt. I had not made you know well enough, how I felt, if I could not dance it with you. Odette, I did not love you well enough then. But I can, I would, if I may?\" Louis said. He did not rush through the words and he waited for her to answer, however she would. She turned her face into his hand and brushed a kiss in the center, slow, incontrovertible, assured. \"Oh, how I missed you!\" he cried and then she was in his arms, herself, not again but at last.

That surprised him, so he did not interrupt; he wanted to hear what else she would say but he would not let go of her hands, her palms against his. \"What a joke, the worst, most banal jest—the Maître de Ballet married to a cripple! I'll be the ruin of you, Louis, you must see that,\" she went on. Another woman would have looked away as she spoke but not Odette with her great blue eyes, her face unadorned except with her undeniable beauty. He had seen her in spangles and voile, once upon a time, another lifetime, and he did not miss them. Only pearls , he thought, only something else exquisite made from imperfection could ever suit her. He would see her in ropes of them, around her slender neck and dangling from her ears, in pearls and black silk velvet or nothing except the baubles and her skin. \"I see you are a fool, Mathilde, an adorable fool, who imagines anyone would think so little of you…and that I would allow such nonsense to hold my attention for even a moment,\" he said calmly, drawing her closer. He would remind her of who she truly was and how he felt, what was real and what was her fear and disappointment, how much came from the sharp ache in her leg he had not yet found a way to mitigate. \"Madame le Haut, her friends,\" she began. She was near enough she must arch her neck to look at him and he did not let her finish, bent to kiss her bare throat, swiftly and deliberately, feeling her pulse beneath his lips. Hearing her gasp. \"You and I, we are artists. We understand what is valuable. No one who is our friend could do less,\" he said. He let her hear the words as she felt him breathe them against her skin. \"You don't mean to give this up then?\" she asked. Had she ever sounded so shy before? \"This? You—give you up? No,\" he said, pausing to kiss her again, the underside of her jaw, to nip her earlobe and graze his beard against her cheek. \"Nothing could persuade me. Except you, Mathilde. If you asked me-\" \"No,\" she blurted. \"No, I won't ask you.\" \"Then we are agreed. Agreeable,\" he replied. He reached a hand around her waist, to bear some of her weight on his arm as if it were a pas de deux, and moved so her mouth was just where he wanted it. She put her arms around his neck, her hand at the back of his head, the lightest pressure, the gentlest command. \"C'est agréable,\" she murmured and kissed him.

At first, it was all searing light and the terrible dark oblivion of smoke and she was nothing between the two, lost in the seam. She lay on a pallet for weeks, the dressings being changed on her burned leg, her broken arm secured to her chest, the familiar, disgusting scent of her singed hair inescapable and she drifted from waking into sleep like a dust mote. The fire burned Le Peletier to ash every time her eyes closed, the sound of the inferno like a wolf's howl, the sea's hungry crash to devour the shore. Months passed and she learned to use her stick, strengthened her weak arm with menial tasks, exhausting herself so that she would be able to overcome the fear of the nightmares that threatened to keep her miserably yawning through the smallest hours of the morning. She began to dream of the pain of the beam that crushed her leg, that had pinned her and made her a witness to the destruction. She had clawed at it like a beast and had broken every nail on her hands to no avail. She choked on her tears and her lips bitten bloody. She had not thought her body could ever have flown through the air, nor that she had once worn a skirt of the palest blue tulle with a satin sash. Years passed and she dreamt and Félicie appeared in the street, cajoled her way home. She taught her in the small courtyard and she did not wince when the girl rang the bell. She began to see her when she slept, in the place of Marie-Laure or Héloise, running through the halls with her red hair a flame that rose from her white face, that made her open her mouth in a wordless scream. She saw the girl's body just too far away to reach, limp, soot making her lashes dark and her pursed lips. They said a true mother could always rescue her child and it was another failure for Odette, that Félicie was not hers and could not be saved until the dawn broke. A decade and she wept in her sleep, crying out for Louis who appeared in doorways and thresholds, perfectly groomed, his face mildly dismayed by her pleading, desperate shrieks. She struggled under the weight of the masonry that had wanted to become her coffin, her own burned flesh a shroud for her yearning soul and called for him, Mérante , Monsieur when he would not turn his head for Louis! \"Mathilde! Bois de l'eau ,\" she heard, the words defining the cup that was held to her lips as much as the smooth rim, the sweet cold relief of the water that spilled down her chin. Louis had learned that was all he should say to wake her; he used the name she had signed on the marriage license, not the one he'd first known, the ballerina's. She had been Mathilde first and at night, she was again, when he drew her back from the fire's infinite horror with only his voice saying her name, the names of all the rivers in France, la Seine, la Loire, Garonne, Dordogne, Meuse, Sélune, Blavet, Charente, all he could remember, all the water that she had longed for. He did not touch her until she turned to him and laid her face against his bare chest, her cheeks wet with tears, and then he traced the line of her healed arm where it rested like a wing. It was dark then, without a candle lit, and it was light with the moon's cool glow. She heard only his heart beating and she slept without dreaming.

XD the movie tells the story of a young girl felicie who really wants to become ballerina and in a way she reminds me of my self. i think this is a very inspiring movie and its definatley worth watching. this story here is just a one-shot that i came up with when i didn't win a tae kwon doe competition. i hope you enjoy XD P.O.V Felicie It was time for the final leap, i looked over to Odette who was silently cheering me on and supporting me, though during the split seconds in between the turns during which i saw her face i saw it was lined with doubt. i winked at her and continued to do my thing. I got this, i got this, I GOT THIS! I kept on telling myself as i spun and spun again towards the staircase. Camille's stupid sneering face came in and out of view as she mirrored my moves. In reality, the moment only lasted several seconds but for me it felt like an eternity. Don't mess up now, Felicie! This is your only chance at this! The pressure increased as i tiptoed backwards closer and closer to the edge of the stairs, it was a matter of time now before i would rise up into the air. Suddenly it was time. I tensed my muscles in my legs and poured every drop of my energy into this final leap which would become a work of art. This is it! The decisive moment! I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, i had never felt like this before, Iwas existing in the right place at the right time, I was soaring through the air. i could no longer feel the presence of Camille, she did not follow me, but she did not matter now. My feet came closer and closer to the ground, i tensed them in anticipation, i lived for this moment. My toes touched the ground but i didn't stop moving. What's wrong?! What's happening to my body ?! My heart stopped as i saw my ankle twisting, my foot had landed on a large spill on the ground and was sliding along like a deceitful snake. My face got drained from its usual rosy color as i grasped at the air desperately. I was falling backwards, my balance was lost and there was only one thought going through my head over and over: This is the end! This is the end! THUD! I heard my body clumsily hit the ground like a swan with clipped wings. My vision became fuzzier and darker as the void swallowed me. Suddenly, everything was cold and black. Something warm and wet touched my face as my consciousness returned. I blinked my eyes and saw Odette kneeling over me, crying and with her tears falling onto my cheeks like rain on wilted roses. Memories of what just happened returned to me and filled me with shame. You had this one chance Felicie and you ruined everything like usual! You were never meant to be a ballerina! You're just nothing! My thoughts of self disgust made my own eyes well up too. I was finished. Everything I worked towards was lost. However, in Odette's eyes I didn't see disapointment like I thought. Could it be...? \"Odette...\" I whispered, my lip quivering. \"I failed you...I'm the worst ballerina ever!\" Without replying, Odette wiped my tears away and gently stroked my forehead, filling me with warmth. And then, she smiled. \"You did your absolute best, I saw how hard you tried,\" she spoke softly. \"But, but...\" I began. \"I fell...and and...I lost my chance...\" Like a cloud rising in the night, Odette gently helped me up. Pain jolted through my bones as I began to feel just how hard I fell. I could barely stand, but something about Odette gave me strength. She looked at me straight in the eyes and spoke to me very candidly. \"My little Felicie,\" she finally spoke. \"I think that you are the best ballerina in the world, and nothing will ever change that. You did so well leading up to this and tried your very hardest.\" With that, I felt my pain go away. I quickly hugged her and we stood there in an embrace for what felt like an eternity. How hard I fell didn't matter anymore, because Odette lifted me all the way up, and higher.

Sometimes he stayed behind in the pit orchestra while his fellows left but most often, he found an empty room and sat by one of the many-paned windows, the cello cradled between his legs, and drew his bow across the string, loosing music like arrows into the fading light. Phrases and bars might float out from behind the door any day of the week, almost as if the Opéra house itself was singing. Félicie hardly noticed. During the day, she was occupied with her classes and the few minutes that could be borrowed to chat with Nora or Camille and at night, she was too tired to wonder at the odd lullaby. There were times when she heard Odette humming as she attended to their garret room, as she changed linens, dusted the furniture, set out their evening meal on the little table they'd made from some abandoned crates. If they sometime ate their bread and cheese to the accompaniment of Offenbach or Bizet, it was as usual as when she and Victor had picnicked on the roof of the abbey with murres and kittiwakes. Her mind was most often occupied with Monsieur Mérante's latest choreography, the exact placement of her foot on the barre, the way the cobbled streets felt beneath her feet when she walked to the patisserie to fetch a fresh baguette. And sometimes, the question of whether Victor's eyes were the color of the Seine or the Seine the color of Victor's eyes. Tonight, she was not wondering that, not even a little. She had missed her dinner with Odette, though her place had still be laid and carefully covered with a cloth before she gobbled it down. She had seen Rudi perform a brisé en avant and she wanted to try it herself, with only the looking-glass to critique her. She dashed the crumbs from her lips and ran down the hall to the empty practice rooms, her skirt fluttering around her, her shoes' ribbons neatly tied. She had expected every door to be closed, unattended. She nearly skidded to stop when it was not so. Monsieur Mérante stood in the open doorway of the room second from the end. He wore his top-coat, as if he had been on his way out, but his cravat was loosened and his collar slightly open. The light from the room was a very soft gold on his face and Félicie thought she saw what he had looked like when he was a boy. It was as if he was not aware of her at all, transfixed by whatever he watched in the room. \"Monsieur-\" \"Quiet,\" he ordered, his voice matching the word, pitched low. He did not sound angry, she knew that tone, nor even impatient, though there was none of the fondness that had been present over the past few weeks, since her performance as Clara. Since she had seen him take Odette's hand. The hand that had held Odette's now gestured at the door and she moved closer, to see better. Odette was dancing. Félicie had never seen someone dance the way her teacher did; there was a degree of deliberation in each step that did not look awkward, but only as if there was a way of dancing that only Odette had discovered. Odette moved across the floor, using the broom she had been sweeping with as a prop more than a way to balance, her form fluid and lithe. Her throat was limned with light when she arched her back, her arms held en bas. She conveyed all the precision of dancing en pointe, the startling arrest of a perfect arabesque, her turnout unmarred by her lack of proper slippers, at a pace Félicie had not known was possible. Her lame leg was more a part of her than it had ever seemed, while it was clear Odette must favor it and use all her strength and grace to ensure it seemed essential to her motion, an axis and not an anchor. Her dark hair was coming loose around her face and there was a rich color in her cheeks. The cellist's melody hung in the air. It seemed Odette had always been dancing and always would, that time had unraveled itself around them and only the woman before them could command it. Odette bent at the waist, her fingers grazing the polished floor, and Félicie heard Monsieur Mérante gasp. She reached out her hand to touch his arm and he shook her off, but let his eyes glance away from Odette. Félicie saw he had forgotten she was standing beside him. That there was anyone except for the dark-haired woman in an apron engaged in a variation without parallel. Félicie opened her mouth to speak and he placed a finger against his open lips, then angled his head to indicate she should step away from the door with him. They could both still see Odette, but the distance seemed enough that they would not disturb her. Félicie opened her mouth again, waiting for a half-second to see if Mérante would stop her, proceeding when he nodded. \"Did you know she could do that?\" \"No. I suspected she might, but I didn't know. She never said,\" he replied. \"What was it? What she was doing. It wasn't ballet,\" Félicie asked. She had not been able to stop thinking of all the steps and jumps Odette did not do, no grande jeté, no bourée nor pas de chat, but she had not missed them exactly. She had been aware of their absence and how what remained of them was like the memory of a scent, still powerful without the actuality. \"It was magic. It was- it was ballet, the soul of it without the body. It was Odette,\" Mérante said, trailing off. Félicie had never heard him speak so, not even when he had asked her why she danced. He was telling her why he danced, why he loved ballet, why he was in love, she suddenly knew, desperately, entirely in love with Odette, more now than he could ever have been before she was injured. \"Does she know how you feel?\" Félicie said before she could stop herself. She was shocked at asking Mérante such a question—he was always formal and brooked no arguments nor discussion when he directed them, but it was as if another man stood before her. Someone who reminded her of Victor, whose eyes could reflect the sky. He might not answer but he had heard her. \"She must,\" he said, his brow furrowed, one hand clenched into a fist. He meant it to stop himself—from what? Félicie thought of Odette's face when she slept and when she rubbed the sleep from her eyes, when she sat with her head in her hand, tilted to one side, her hair in a long braid over her shoulder. She thought of how Odette's lips curved when she spoke to Mérante and how she dropped her eyelashes when she spoke of him. Félicie was young but she was not stupid. \"You haven't told her,\" she said. Announced, really, though with her voice kept low. He still flinched. He had held Odette's hand so gently and had watched her now, rapt. \"You should tell her,\" she said, more kindly. The cellist had not played a note in a minute, maybe more. She heard the sound of Odette's regular tread, how it worked not to be heavy. \"Now, when she comes, tell the truth,\" she urged him and then she ran down the hall and into the empty practice room where she flung open the window to catch the scent of the night. Victor might have put on his wings to fly and it was worth looking among the stars. She assumed an attitude en pointe, balancing on the window-sill, and listened to Paris at night and the sound of Odette's choked exclamation, the clatter of the falling broomstick. Mérante's bass confirmation and then the rustling silence of an embrace. She sighed and looked for wings trimmed with copper and tin, the wings of an orphaned angel.

This is a very special fic, because it's dedicated to my first friend in the Ballerina fandom and fellow Mérandette shipper, Scar Stones. I hoped to have this all finished for her birthday, but with all the stress of home and uni it just wasn't possible.

Shout-Out to my Dad for the amazing cover! :) .o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o. Chapter 1 Thunderous applause echoed throughout the dark theatre, loud enough to rival the pounding of her own heart. A dull ache throbbed in her cheeks from smiling so much, and her limbs felt as though they could just fall off her body, but Félicie was too happy to care, holding her final pose until the red velvet curtain pooled on stage in front of her. \"You did it.\" The young ballerina stood up properly, stretching her tired muscles as she did so, then smiled at the woman beside her. \"Was I ok?\" \"You did wonderfully, Félicie.\" Rosita smiled at the girl, then nodded towards the backstage area. \"You have people waiting for you.\" Félicie said nothing; only smiled as she quickly walked off stage. So much had changed in such a little amount of time. When she first set foot in Paris, she had nothing but the clothes on her back, her childhood friend by her side, and a music box and half a postcard in her pocket; a naïve dreamer not yet prepared for the world she was throwing herself into. But now, she had everything she could need and more. And it was all back there waiting for her… Forgetting for a moment how tired she was, Félicie ran into her mentor's arms, smiling as she felt her nurturing arms wrap around her body. \"I knew you could do it...\" She couldn't see Odette's face, but she could somehow sense that she was smiling. The red-haired girl cast a quick glance up at her instructor, a smile forming on her own lips, \"Well, I do have a good teacher.\" The former ballerina gave her one last hug, then pulled back to let her see her smile. Félicie tilted her head a little, trying to take in her mentor's face in the dim light, \"Are you ok? Your face looks a little pink.\" Somehow pointing it out made it more noticeable, and Odette nervously tucked a piece of hair behind her ear, \"I'm fine. Just proud...\" Félicie raised an eyebrow, pondering whether or not to question her, but was stopped by a voice calling her name. \"Félicie!\" Looking up in surprise, she smiled at the blonde rushing over to her, \"Camille!\" Camille gave her a quick hug, then stepped back to talk, \"Sorry I'm so late. The police showed up just after you left. I guess someone must have heard you screaming.\" \"The police?\" Mérante was the one to speak this time, one eyebrow raised in concern. \"My mother tried to kill Félicie,\" Camille explained, Félicie adding, \"That's why I was so late.\" Odette's eyes flashed with terror, but Camille continued to speak, \"Thankfully they had enough evidence to arrest her on the spot. My aunt Genevieve has full custody of me now.\" As if on que, a tall woman walked up towards them. She was strikingly similar to Régine in appearance, but her features were softer and she was substantially less 'done up'. Odette gave the woman a nod, \"Genevieve.\" \"Hello Odette, it's lovely to see you again,\" the woman – Genevieve – smiled. \"Camille told me everything. I'm so sorry for what my sister did to you both.\" Odette shrugged a little response. \"Well, I didn't exactly help matters… \"Nevertheless, you put up with a lot over the years. I'd understand if you said no, but perhaps you might consider working for me instead?\" There was a moment of silence while she thought about it, but after receiving an encouraging smile from Félicie, Odette nodded in agreement. Genevieve smiled, gesturing towards the door, \"Let's go gather your things.\" Before long, everyone had gone their separate ways, leaving only the five kids on an empty stage. \"Well,\" Dora started. \"I think we can say tonight was a success.\" \"I know, and tomorrow's the biggest day of the year!\" Nora added, clapping her hands as she bounced on her toes. Félicie laughed at her antics, \"Calm down Nora. It's just Christmas.\" Much to hers and Victor's surprise, Nora gasped in horror, suddenly unable to form one coherent syllable. She was clearly in a state of utter disbelief, but neither could comprehend why. Dora rolled her eyes at her twin, then rested her hands on her sister's shoulders, \"Easy Nora. Deep breaths…\" Nora did as she was told, taking a few deep breaths to calm herself, then promptly exclaimed, \" Just Christmas?! Just, just- how?! \" Félicie merely shrugged, failing to see what the fuss was about, \"You guys already know I was brought up in the orphanage…\" \"I know, but it's still Christmas! The Christmas Eve feast, decorating the tree, Christmas Logs, singing carols, leaving your shoes by the fireplace, the Galette of Kings, mistletoe! \" Nora continued, practically squealing that last one. The two orphans shared a confused look, before Félicie interjected again, \"Uh Nora, we've never even heard of most of that stuff…\" \"What about presents? You at least get presents, right?\" \"We get new clothes. That counts…\" Victor commented, but was quickly shot down. \" No it does not count! \" Félicie shrugged a shoulder, unsure what she was supposed to say to them. They were nice girls, but they'd all lived a life of luxury, whereas she and Victor hadn't. She didn't envy them in the least, nor did she blame Mother Superior for the struggles she'd faced growing up, but trying to explain all that was becoming unsettling. \"There were a lot of us. Any money the orphanage got went to looking after everyone.\" Victor nodded in agreement, \"As far as Mother Superior was concerned, all the presents in the world wouldn't help us if we were starving, cold and sick in bed.\" \"So… You've never had a real Christmas before?\" Dora asked as she stood beside her sister, who finally seemed to be taking in what she was hearing. Félicie and Victor shuffled their feet on the polished floor, avoiding eye contact with both the girls and each other. Camille and the twins looked amongst themselves, knowing all-too-well the answer was 'yes'. All three felt terrible for them, but none more so than Camille. She'd taken Félicie's upbringing and slammed it in her face, all over a part in a ballet that she didn't really want. \"All those things I said to you before the final audition… I'm so sorry Félicie. I… I had no idea.\" Félicie smiled reassuringly, waving it off, \"It's ok. We're here now. Maybe this is our chance to learn…\" At that, Nora gave an almost dramatic gasp, then turned to her twin and grabbed her by the shoulders. \"I just had, the best idea! Félicie and Victor have never had a proper Christmas before; we know everything about it. We can teach them all about our favourite holiday traditions!\" \"Nora, that's a great idea!\" Dora smiled. \"In fact, I know how to make it even better.\" Without another word, Dora led them down the sculpted hallways, until they found the cheerful giant that was the Director of the Opera. \"Our families are old friends. We go to his Christmas party every year,\" Dora explained. \"Perhaps he'd be willing to let you come as well.\" Director Vaucorbeil turned at the sound of footsteps, and smiled at the four young dancers and Félicie's friend. \"Ah, good evening girls!\" he greeted merrily, before taking Félicie's hand. \"Congratulations, Miss Lebras. You were exquisite.\" Félicie smiled as he lightly kissed the back of her hand, and did her best to curtsy, \"Thank you sir.\" \"So, what can I do for you ladies?\" \"I know it's a little impolite to be asking, but my sister and I were hoping we could bring Félicie, Victor and Camille to the party tomorrow,\" Dora asked as respectfully as possible. \"They didn't really celebrate it at the orphanage, so in a way, this is Félicie and Victor's first Christmas.\" \"But of course! The more the merrier,\" Director Vaucorbeil replied, a hand over his heart as he bowed his head good-naturedly. \"Camille, I heard Odette will be working for your aunt from now on…\" \"Yes sir,\" Camille replied. \"She's helping Odette get her things from the attic now.\" \"Excellent,\" the man beamed, clapping his hands together. \"Perhaps now she'll finally be able to come as well. Anyway, I'll see you five tomorrow. Merry Christmas!\" \"Merry Christmas, Monsieur!\" \"Have a safe trip home!\" The director gave them a friendly wave before walking away, and Nora immediately resumed jumping around in excitement, \"This is going to be the best Christmas ever!\" Félicie opened her mouth to reply, but the words vanished when she noticed the confusion written in Camille's face. \"You ok, Camille?\" \"Yeah, just… Dora, what did Director Vaucorbeil mean when he said about Odette finally coming?\" \"He and Odette were good friends back in the day. He invites her every year, but she always too busy working for your mother.\" Camille's brow creased, her puzzled expression ever more prominent. \"That doesn't make any sense…\" Victor shrugged, \"Why not?\" \"Odette's worked for my mother my entire life. I know her schedule by heart; 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\" Camille explained. \"In all that time, not once has my mother worked her late on Christmas Day.\" \"Really, never ?\" \" Never . Every year, my mother always hosted a party for her upper-class friends. So, every Christmas, she'd work Odette double time to get the house looking spotless by 4 o'clock, then she pretty much banished her to her rooms.\" Camille paused for a moment to collect her thoughts. \"If Director Vaucorbeil had been inviting her like you said, not only could she have easily slipped away without Mother noticing, but even if she had noticed, she'd be glad to have her out of her sight.\" \"That's weird …\" Nora stated, making a face to emphasise her point. Dora nodded in agreement, \"Yeah, why would Odette lie about something like that?\" \"I don't know…\" Félicie mused. \"I'll talk to her tonight. Maybe she'll open up to me…\" \"Well, it'd be good if you could get her to come,\" Dora smiled. \"Yeah! She can be one of my victims.\" Nora rubbed her hands together, sporting a devilish grin that brought the other four to silence. Eventually, Félicie mustered the courage to look at Dora, who was simply smirking at her sister. \"Victims?\" \"Trust me Félicie, you'll find out tomorrow.\" Unlike her last coach ride, Félicie couldn't help but find the rhythmic skip of horseshoes on the cobblestone roads oddly relaxing. Up until now, the snow-cover had been unusually light for this time of year, but in the last few hours, large clouds of it had accumulated on every sidewalk and every rooftop, just in time for a true white Christmas. But of course, the effects of this had been almost instantaneous. No sooner had Odette stepped outside, walking on her limp became next to impossible. And so, the pair had found themselves making the short trip home by coach with Camille and Genevieve. Her head propped up against her mentor's shoulder, Félicie watched the snowfall outside, each tender flake dancing on the wind like a perfectly unique, crystal ballerina. Beautiful as it was, the picturesque scene before her did little to aid her weighted mind. She had so many questions; questions she both wanted and needed answers too. As soon as the coach stopped outside the Le Haut household, Félicie was the first one out, grabbing the box with the door key in it and letting herself into Odette's rooms. By the time Odette herself made it to the door, the fireplace had roared to life, casting a homely orange glow around the room. Hearing the front door close, Félicie grabbed a chair from the dining table and brought it closer to the fireplace, \"Why don't you sit down for a bit… I'll help you unpack in the morning.\" \"Thank you,\" Odette smiled wearily, setting the last box on the table next to Félicie's. Noticing the way she winced with every step, Félicie took her arm and helped her sit down. Once she was settled by the warmth of the fire, Félicie brought a chair over for herself, all but falling into it. \"Tired?\" Odette giggled, fond memories of her own debut floating through her mind. \"Uh-huh…\" Félicie mumbled, the sound muffled by her closed lips. Subconsciously aware of the knowing smirk on her mentor's face, she forced herself to sit up properly, \"Am I going to be this tired after every performance?\" \"Don't worry, you'll get used to it,\" the older woman assured her. \"You really were great up there tonight.\" Had anyone asked her, she probably would've blamed it on the open fire, but her cheeks turned a soft shade of pink after hearing the compliment. \"Well, I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you…\" \"You're welcome.\" Neither said anything more, content to listen to the crackling fire as the dancing flames cast elegant shadows across the room. Just outside, the bitter wind had picked up in strength, and would likely leave a fresh coating of powdered snow in its wake. All across Paris, children were surely tucked into the warmth of their beds, sweetly dreaming as they waited for the joys of tomorrow. The peaceful serenity was finally broken by an uneasy sigh, and a voice began to speak. \"I'm sorry for how…\" Odette gave a brief chuckle, amused by her own lack of a better word, \" 'un-Christmassy' it is in here…\" \"It's fine, really,\" Félicie replied, her voice soft with a reassuring smile on her face. \"This is pretty much what I'm used to anyway.\" \"It is?\" \"Yeah… Christmas for us just meant extra dinner and some new clothes,\" she explained, then shrugged a shoulder in thought. \"Unless of course any of the kids got sick. Then any extra funds went towards medicine. There were too many of us for them to handle a full-on outbreak during the winter.\" Odette looked down at her lap, feeling all but sick with the sudden guilt. While the rational part of her knew there was nothing she could have done, that didn't stop her heart from aching for this little girl, sheltered and alone with no inkling of what it was like to be part of a family. \"I never knew it was that bad…\" \"If it makes you feel any better, neither did we. We made do with what we had,\" the girl assured her, her smile almost too sincere for someone her age. Odette felt the corner of her mouth tug up in unwavering pride, \"Guess that explains why you're so humble…\" \"Probably,\" Félicie agreed, her emerald eyes gleaming in the firelight. \"I am looking forward to tomorrow though. Camille, Nora and Dora are going to teach me and Victor about their favourite Christmas traditions.\" The former ballerina simply chuckled at her excitement, \"I'm sure you'll have a great time.\" \"Me too.\" The pair fell into a comfortable silence, but Félicie soon found herself thinking back to her conversation with Camille. While it was true that her mentor had been anything but a social person when they first met, she couldn't shake the feeling that there was some other, more pressing reason behind her lies. \"Hey, speaking of earlier, can I ask you something?\" Odette raised an eyebrow, a playful smile on her lips, \"Have you forgotten the night we met? In all my years, I've never known someone ask so many questions.\" Félicie burst out with laughter at that, so much so that she almost forgot what she was going to ask her. Odette couldn't help a small chuckle of her own, before regaining composure, \"Seriously though, what is it?\" \"When Director Vaucorbeil invited us to the party, he mentioned how you were always too busy working. I didn't think much of it until Camille told me the truth…\" Odette looked down in regret, knowing she'd finally been caught out. Deep down, she'd always known that it couldn't last forever, but after a decade of successfully pulling the same charade, it came as a shock to be found out so suddenly. \"I know I didn't have much of a Christmas, but I always spent it with Victor. I just don't understand why you'd choose to spend it alone…\" At first, Odette remained silent, unsure of just how much she was ready to let go. Finally though, she heaved a sigh, forcing herself to speak. \"My mother died when I was very young, and the only other family I had was my father. He was a musician for the opera; he did write a few of his own pieces over time, but no one ever heard them… We didn't have much, but… we had each other. Then the fire happened…\" Félicie's eyes widened. No one beside Mérante had ever said anything about the fire, and even that wasn't much. A part of her felt like she should stop her; tell her that she didn't need to go into such a painful part of her life. But at the same time, she wanted to know. To understand why she'd lied for all those years… \"I was trapped on stage. Papa found me, and tried to help me escape. My father noticed the ceiling cracking and knew he couldn't save both of us. I'll spare you the details, but basically, I got away with a few scars and my limp. My father wasn't so lucky…\" Odette sighed, brushing away the tears that had rolled down her face, \"Christmas is a time to celebrate family. After my father died, I didn't see the point any more…\" For quite some time, Félicie remained silent. She could only imagine how lonely it must have been; living off the same routine with no one to turn to. \"Have you… ever thought about what it might be like? Having a family again…\" Félicie asked nervously, trying not to push too far. Odette sighed, forcing herself to ignore the old wounds, \"I have thought about it… But I know better than to get my hopes up for something that isn't possible…\" Félicie waited a few moments before responding, \"Maybe it is possible…\" Her mentor looked at her in confusion, unsure where the conversation was going. \"What do you mean?\" The young ballerina shifted in her seat, nerves suddenly getting the best of her with the thought of actually asking her mentor to adopt her. There were so many reasons for her to say no, and after secretly wishing for so long that she would, she wasn't sure she was even ready to hear her response. \"Félicie… It's okay…\" Odette rested a hand on the girl's face, gently stroking her cheek in an effort to sooth her. \"Whatever it is, you can ask me. I promise I won't overreact again.\" Félicie chuckled a little at the memory, leaning into the warmth of her touch for just a moment, then straightened in her chair. Odette followed suit, waiting for her to continue, \"Go on…\" \"The day before the final auditions… After Mérante left, Camille started having a go at me for being an orphan, asking me questions she knew I couldn't answer. I don't know why I snapped at you the way I did, but I regretted it from the moment it happened. And when Monsieur Luteau helped me escape again, I told him to drop me at the opera. Not because I wanted to prove I was a good dancer, but because I want to be near you, whatever that meant…\" Odette watched her intensely, listening to every word. Taking a breath, Félicie continued, \"I guess at the end of the day, what I'm asking is... Odette, will you adopt me?\" The silence was almost deafening. After a moment, Odette looked away, staring deep into the fireplace. Félicie waited quietly for any sort of answer, but just when she thought that none would come, she noticed the glisten of tears on the woman's face. \"Did I say something wrong?\" she asked in concern, watching her mentor wipe away her tears. \"No, not at all. It's just…\" A sigh shook from her body, heavy with emotion, and she shrugged a shoulder as she struggled for words. \"I've always wanted to be a mother, but after everything that happened… I thought it was something I could only dream about…\" Félicie let those words seep in, then cautious asked, \"So, does this mean…\" Odette nodded, a teary-eyed smile stretching across her face, \"Yes… Of course I will.\" Félicie got to her feet, dragging her chair next to Odette's, then sat down and hugged her tightly, tears of her own starting to form. The initial shock finally wearing off, Odette held her close to her chest as one final tear of joy ran down her cheek. After so many years of living with a broken heart, she finally felt whole again, more so than she ever had. The pair stayed like that for quite some time, until Félicie sat up to face her, \"So, now that you have a family again, does this mean that you'll come to the party?\" Odette sighed, absently tucking a lock of her rich brown hair back into place. \"I don't know Félicie… I don't even have anything suitable to wear.\" \"The party's in the evening; we've got all day to worry about that.\" Holding her new mother's hands tightly in her own, she gave her the biggest, best puppy dog eyes she could muster, \" Please? Everyone'll be thrilled to have you…\" The older woman chuckled, instantly falling for the childish ploy, \"Alright, I'll come…\" Félicie smiled, hugging her once more, \"Good.\" Odette smiled down at her new daughter, then gently kissed her forehead, \"Merry Christmas Félicie.\" \"Merry Christmas, Mum.\" .o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o. Aww… Don't you just love it when Odette gets all motherly? Félicie's so lucky to have her. :) Just to be clear, I am going to take a few creative liberties for this fic. I understand Ballerina only had a limited budget, and if you ask me every dollar of that was well spent, but come on - leafy green trees on Christmas Eve in France ?! Here in Australia, yes, but definitely not in France . XD I did do a little research into popular French Christmas traditions though. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed the first chapter, especially you Scar Stones. See you all again soon! :D[Chapter 2] Well this fic did better than I expected. :D I'm glad you all enjoyed the first chapter, especially you Scar. You'll have to make sure you're logged in when you review this time, and wait until after class. ;p Anyway, here's Chapter 2. Quick shout-out to ellymango for helping me with the framework and ideas for this chapter, as well as for letting me use her 'bleating lamb' metaphor for Camille. Time's really run away from me this year, so I don't know when the third and final chapter will be up. Whenever I post it, I assure you it'll be worth the wait. (; I normally do review replies at the start of each chapter, but since this is only a small-scale fic and a number of those reviews were simply named 'Guest', I'll just say a huge belated Christmas thank you to you all. :) .o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o. Chapter 2 Throughout the night, the tender twirls of crystal ballerinas had risen to a roaring symphony, the storm of the season at last making its grand appearance. By morning, all Paris was buried in soft white snow that crunched underfoot, and gave the city a mystical glow in the pale morning sun. Most had yet to venture from the warmth of their beds, but those who had held no resentment to the bitter cold. Only hope and joy for the time to be spent with those they held dear. At the Le Haut household, a single door creaked open in the servant's quarters, slow and steady so as not to wake the young child sleeping inside. Closing the door with as much – if not more – care, Odette shuddered against the icy chill, willing herself on as her weak ankle prepped for an almighty scream. She barely made it three steps when the door adjacent to her own swung open, but for once she was met with a warm, friendly smile. \"Odette. You're up early,\" Genevieve stated as she stepped into the winter air. She shrugged a shoulder in response, \"Force of habit…\" \"Well, either way, Merry Christmas.\" Standing beside her, Genevieve rubbed her hands together in an effort to warm herself. \"Goodness, it's cold out here. Were you and Félicie warm enough last night?\" \"For the most part. Félicie ended up crawling into my bed during the night.\" Odette couldn't help but smile at the memory, how she was instantly woken by Félicie sneaking under the covers with her, only to promptly fall asleep beside her; her first real taste of motherhood. \"I just came out to get some firewood.\" Odette turned to walk away, but was immediately stopped by a hand of her shoulder. \"Oh no you won't. That's solid ice down there,\" Genevieve warned, pointing out the large patch of ice stretched across the courtyard. \"I won't have you injuring yourself on Christmas. Or any day for that matter.\" \"It'll alright Genevieve, I'll be careful.\" \" No , I'll hear nothing of it. I'll go,\" her employer insisted, her tone firm and unshifting. \"And from now on, if you need anything , just let me know.\" Odette sighed in defeat, but gave her a grateful smile, \"Thank you.\" \"You're welcome.\" With that, Genevieve turned to walk away. Odette went to do the same, but stopped as a thought popped into her mind, \"You wouldn't happen to have any jam I could borrow, would you?\" \"But of course, go on in,\" the woman smiled, gesturing towards the door. \"Help yourself to whatever you need.\" Odette smiled back, then went inside and walked to the kitchen. After a few minutes of searching, she managed to find what she was looking for, and returned to her rooms to find a neat stack of firewood just inside the door, and her new daughter still lost in a peaceful sleep. Quiet as a mouse, she busied herself with unpacking her things and getting breakfast ready, every so often casting a glance at the girl who had stolen and mended her heart. At long last, Félicie stirred in her sleep, eyelids fluttering as she started to wake. \"Well you certainly took your time,\" Odette teased as she knelt beside the bed, using her cane for support. The corner of Félicie's mouth twitched – the closest she could come to a laugh in her current state – and Odette found herself running her hand over the girl's ginger hair. \"Merry Christmas.\" Félicie smiled back at her, her eyes now open and shining like stars, \"Thanks Mum.\" Odette's heart skipped a beat at the name – one she thought she'd never be so blessed to hear – before she got back on her feet. \"Breakfast's ready.\" Sitting up in bed, Félicie stretched her tired limbs. As she did, a familiar smell filled her nostrils, and her eyes lit up in surprise and hopeful excitement, \"Is that-\" \"Baguettes? Fresh from the oven.\" \"Really?\" the red-head beamed, tugging on her shoes and rushing to the table. \"Well, warmed up really,\" Odette admitted, setting the jam and a plate of warm baguette slices on the table. \"I didn't have time to make them from scratch… I know it's not much…\" \"Are you kidding? I love it,\" Félicie smiled, hugging her tightly. Odette instantly smiled back, holding her close, before the pair sat down to eat. \"Today's going to be the best,\" the young dancer stated between mouthfuls, bursting with excitement. \"I can't wait for the party tonight.\" Odette's gut clenched at the mere mention of the party, but she managed to fake a smile. \"Slow down Félicie. I still need to find something to wear.\" \"True…\" Félicie thought for a few moments as she ate, then practically shot out of her chair. \"Camille! I bet her aunt has something you could use!\" Stopping just long enough to give her new mother a quick hug, she dashed out the door, grabbing another slice of baguette as she went. Though she initially laughed at her girl's antics, Odette soon felt her unease set back in. She'd told Félicie she would go, and she would keep that promise, but that didn't mean she felt any better about it. While she finally had someone she could call her family, there was something – or someone – else on her mind this year; something she was far less willing to face. Finishing her own breakfast, Odette made her way over to her boss's house, where Camille and Félicie were already gushing over plans. \"- It's a little plain for my taste, but it'll look perfect on you.\" Camille paused mid-rant, giving Odette a small – almost sheepish – smile. \"Good morning, Odette.\" Before she could even reply, Genevieve appeared beside her. \"I hear you're in need of a dress. Come with me.\" Odette sighed quietly to settle her nerves, then followed her out the room. As soon as they left, Camille smiled at Félicie, \"I cannot believe you managed to convince her.\" \"I know! I'm so excited!\" The blonde chuckled at her enthusiasm, then lightly nudged her shoulder, \"Come on… I want to show you one of my traditions.\" The young ballerina smiled, then followed her into a large sitting area, pleasantly warm from the glowing fireplace. Smoothing her skirt, Camille sat down on the soft carpet, taking a pen and blank piece of paper out of her pocket and placing them on a wooden board in front of her. \"So,\" Félicie started, curiously sitting beside her. \"What is your tradition?\" Camille took a moment before answering. \"I don't know if Odette told you this, but my father – Edward Le Haut – he's died when I was four. So, every year at Christmastime, I'd write him a letter and burn it in the fireplace. It's my way of keeping his memory alive…\" Félicie smiled sympathetically, \"It's a beautiful idea.\" \"I usually do this at Odette's place,\" Camille stated casually, touching her pen to the paper. \"It was the one place I couldn't guarantee Mother wouldn't look.\" At the mention of Régine Le Haut, memories from the previous evening flooded through Félicie's mind. Camille had already told them she'd been arrested, but that was all. \"Hey… With everything that happened last night, I forgot to ask you…\" she began, carefully choosing her words. \"Are you ok? About your mother?\" \"Well, controlling as she was, watching her be arrested for attempted murder on Christmas Eve isn't the most ideal situation…\" Camille admitted. \"But, the way I see it, she took a pretty hard fall when that scaffolding came down. She's a bit battered and bruised with a few broken bones, but ultimately, I'm just grateful she's still alive…\" The red-headed girl released a breath she hadn't realised she was holding, \"That's good.\" Camille nodded in agreement, then started her annual letter. Out of respect, Félicie refrained from reading the letter, instead watching the way Camille wrote. Each letter flowed beautifully into the next, every sentence evenly spaced and grounded to invisible lines. It was a hundred times better than what they were taught at the orphanage, which was really just showing them how to form basic letters. After a while, a question began to play at her mind. Though she did so with great hesitation, she eventually decided to ask, \"Do you remember him?\" Camille paused, sighing deeply, but didn't seem too upset. \"Not much… I know what he looks like from pictures, and I remember bits and pieces, but mostly all I have are the stories Aunty tells me…\" she explained. \"What about you? Do you remember your father?\" Félicie shook her head, \"Never knew him. I only really have one clear memory of my mother and I don't think she was wearing a ring, so I guess my father just took off before I was born...\" \"I'm sorry...\" \"It's ok.\" The room went silent for a minute, before Félicie spoke once more. \"What's it like? Having a father?\" \"It's a lot of things… Your father is someone who teaches you right from wrong, and stands by you even when you make mistakes. He's someone who helps you find your place in the world, but stay's close so he's there when you need him. He's a little strict at times, but it's only because he wants what's best for you. And above all, he has faith in you, even when you don't have faith in yourself.\" Félicie simply smiled at her words, \"Sounds like you had a pretty great one…\" \"Yeah, I did…\" Camille smiled in return, then went back to her letter, \"Your name; the first 'e' is accented, right?\" Félicie hummed in agreement, the girl beside her giving her a quick 'thank you' before she continued. Even without trying to read what Camille was writing, Félicie clearly noticed the way she repeatedly broke from her cursive flow, pausing just long enough to add a sloped dash above several of her 'e's. \"Why do you need to know how to spell my name?\" \"My Christmas Day letter to my father is my chance to tell him about all that's happened over the year. I'm sure he'd love to hear about my first real friend.\" She could have said just about anything else, and she'd still have expected it more than that . Yet, however surprising, the words brought a small smile to Félicie's face. \"I'm your first friend?\" Much to her surprise, Camille seemed suddenly nervous, as if fearful she'd crossed some invisible line. \"Well, I hope you are… I know I said some pretty horrible things to you, but I'd like to be your friend…\" Félicie's smile widened, \"I'd like that too.\" Camille responded with a heartfelt beam, then went back to her letter. After a few more lines and a carefully penned 'Merry Christmas', she signed her name at the bottom, smiling in satisfaction. \"There, done,\" Camille stated, talking to herself more than anyone as she picked up the completed letter. \"Now I just need to let the ink dry a little bit…\" Félicie watched her for a few moments as she fluttered the paper in her hand, before noticing something on the back. \"Hold on…\" Using her hands to steady herself, she craned her neck to get a closer look, confirming her suspicions, \"Is that- me ?\" \"Huh?\" Camille turned over the letter, revealing a pencilled image of Félicie's face and neck, drawn to the finest detail. Every feature was crafted to near perfection, not one hair out of place. The sole fault one could possibly hope to find was the arrangement of her freckles, and even that wasn't too far off. A bashful smile tugged at her lips, \"Oh, yes… My mother's always put pressure on me to be a ballerina, but I've always had a thing for art. Every Christmas, when I write my letter to my father, I always do a drawing on the back. He used to love it when I drew for him…\" The red-head smiled in return, before Camille turned to look at the glowing fireplace. Taking a breath, she allowed a heavy sigh to spill from her body, then walked over to the open flames. Her movements slow and cautious, she carefully dropped the letter into the fire, then sat beside Félicie as they watched it burn. After a minute, Félicie spoke, \"You know, it's almost a shame to let it burn… It was really good.\" Camille openly laughed, as though she'd never before heard something so amusing, \"What, that ? Please, I just free-handed that last night. It's not even one of my best.\" Félicie looked at her in surprise, her head tilting slightly as her eyebrows raised, \"It's not?\" Getting up, Camille walked over to a suitcase on the sofa and began rummaging through it. \"Sooner or later, most of my drawings ended up in Odette's fireplace. But my favourite ones, I mailed to my aunty. She held onto them for safe-keeping.\" Finally finding what she was looking for, she pulled out a leather folder and handed it to her friend, \"You're welcome to look if you like…\" Opening the folder, Félicie pulled out a small stack of papers and began looking through them. Sure enough, each one held a drawing of some kind, all done to absolute perfection. \"Wow, Camille, these are great,\" she smiled. \"How long have you been doing this?\" \"Pretty much my whole life…\" the blonde replied, her pale cheeks turning a delicate pink. \"But I started taking it seriously when I was six.\" Félicie handed the pile back to her, \"Do you have a favourite?\" Camille smiled widely, as though she'd been waiting for that exact question, and began flipping through them, \"It's was autumn, my mother was out late at the restaurant, and we'd had a bad storm that day. Mother was having guests in the morning so she forced Odette to stay up and sweep the courtyard. I was bored and couldn't sleep, so I decided to take the opportunity.\" Just as the words left her lips, she pulled out a single paper and showed it to her. \"This is actually a remake. Aunty always buys me a set of coloured pencils for Christmas, but they're rather expensive, so I made sure to keep them far away from Mother.\" Félicie could only stare at the drawing, completely lost for words. The paper showed the courtyard from above with a velvet night sky, the moon – a single spotlight – cascading down on Odette's pale silhouette as she seemed to dance with her broom, coloured leaves swirling around her feet. \"Camille, this is beautiful. I've only ever seen things like this in storybooks…\" Camille smiled at the drawing, admiring her work, \"Between you and me, Odette's always been one of my favourite subjects to draw. Even with her limp, she manages to do everything with such grace and elegance. Plus she's naturally beautiful; she doesn't have to spend an hour on hair and make-up like my mother does.\" Félicie briefly remembered Mérante saying almost the same thing the day he found out who she was, before another thought occurred to her, \"Is that why your mother hated her so much?\" \"My mother had many reasons to hate Odette,\" she corrected. \"But, according to my aunty, there were three in particular. Firstly, she was jealous of her beauty. Second, she was so obsessed with everything being clean that nothing Odette did was ever good enough.\" \"And the third?\" \"My parents were an arranged marriage, and after Odette had her accident, my father went out of his way to help her. But my mother is exceptionally paranoid; somehow she took him trying to make things easier for his recently crippled employee as him having an affair with her.\" Silence. Camille turned to her new friend, almost laughing at the blank expression on her face, \"I know. I don't get it either.\" Unable to form a proper response, Félicie fell back on dry humour, \"Ok, note to self: never become paranoid…\" She half expected Camille to give her a questioning glance, but was instead met with a fit of giggles, \"I know, right?\" The pair quickly burst into hysterics, before falling into a comfortable silence. Félicie repositioned herself on the floor, swinging her legs round so she could hug her knees, \"I ran into Mérante after he found out my secret; he told me about Mum. He said she was the best of her generation…\" Camille nodded in agreement, \"Aunty says that too.\" \"I wish I could've seen her. I mean, sure, I've seen her do a few twirls while she sweeps, but…\" Félicie sighed quietly, resting her chin on her knee. \"It's not the same…\" Camille said nothing at first, unsure how to respond. Glancing around the room, her eyes again fell on the drawing of Odette, then lit with excitement as an idea took root in her mind. \"Can I… draw you something special? For Christmas…\" the blonde asked, pulling a small rectangular tin and a blank piece of paper from the leather folder. Félicie smiled a little, her spirits lifted by the request, \"Sure, if you want to…\" Camille smiled knowingly as she opened the tin, selecting a finely sharpened pencil, \"I know just the thing.\" Odette sat on the sofa in what was, until yesterday, her former employer's room, tracing circles into the plush cushions with her fingertips. Genevieve stood just four paces away, her back turned to her as she rummaged through her sister's closet. She wasn't sure what the woman was looking for, but with every silent moment that passed, she could feel herself getting more and more anxious about the night ahead, especially about– \"Now don't you fret, my dear,\" Genevieve called over her shoulder as she pushed dress after dress along the rack. \"I'm certain there'll be something in here you can use.\" Odette sighed, trying to sound calm, \"Listen, Genevieve, I really appreciate all the trouble you're going to, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable wearing one of her dresses…\" \"It's quite alright Odette. After everything my sister put you through, you deserve a night out,\" her new employer assured her. \"Besides, most of these are dresses I leant her, she wore once , then never gave me back.\" Nervous as she was, Odette placed a hand over her mouth, trying in vain to stifle a laugh. Genevieve smiled a little, muttering just loud enough for Odette to hear, \"Anyone would think she's the younger sister...\" The moment passed as quickly as it appeared, and soon enough, Odette was back to a state of worry. All the while, Genevieve simply continued through the extensive closet of dresses, combing through each one. \"No. No. Heavens, no…\" Odette sighed, unable to take the mounting pressure, \"Let's just face it, Genevieve. We're not going to find anything…\" At last turning around, Genevieve looked at her in concern, noting the way she anxiously hugged her waist. Sighing softly, she walked over to the sofa and sat down beside her. \"Odette… You may not be the most social person I've ever met, but you're anything but shy. And it's not like you won't know anyone there…\" Noticing the way she tensed at her words, Genevieve gently placed a hand on her forearm. \"What's really troubling you?\" Odette sighed, knowing full well there was no avoiding the question. Régine may not have cared about her feelings, but Genevieve was nothing like her sister, except when it came to being persistent. \"It's Louis…\" \"Mérante? From the opera?\" Odette nodded, \"He kissed me last night, during Félicie's debut…\" \"Did he now?\" Genevieve's eyebrow arched, a little too pleased with her answer. \"It wasn't like that…\" Odette insisted, stumbling to explain herself. \"It was just a little peck on the cheek. It was nothing that special…\" Her employer chuckled, clearly unconvinced, \"If that were true you wouldn't be blushing about it. But go on, I'm listening…\" \"When we first met, I only knew him as this remarkable dancer that every young girl fell in love with. I used to tell myself I was better than that, but soon enough, I looked at him as though he hung the stars in the skies…\" Odette admitted, trying to ignore the warmth in her cheeks. \"After my accident, I thought if I broke his heart then and there, he'd move on and find someone better. But last night, after all these years, he kissed my cheek and looked at me the way he did back then. I don't know what he wants, and I'm terrified of… well, whatever it is he's looking for…\" Genevieve nodded, but asked cautiously, \"Are you sure that's it, or is there something else you're afraid of?\" Odette froze. She wasn't sure what answer her employer was looking for, but she desperately hoped it wasn't what she thought it was. \"I… I don't, know what you're talking out…\" \"I think you do…\" Genevieve gently rested a hand on her shoulder, as though she were talking to a wounded fawn, \"I know , Odette… I have done for a while…\" The room went silent, if only for a moment, before Odette shuddered a gasp. No… No, it couldn't be. There was no way she could've uncovered her terrible secret. She'd been so careful… Hadn't she? \"Was I that obvious?\" she stammered, her blue eyes wide with fear. \"No. No, not at all,\" Genevieve assured her. \"Honestly, the only reason I noticed was because I have a friend who suffers the same thing.\" Odette went deathly pale, another horrifying thought passing through her mind, \"Régine, does she-\" The older woman shook her head, \"Trust me, if she knew, everyone would. I've heard what she thinks about women who can't bear children…\" Odette looked down at those words, her eyes brimming with tears. \"When did you find out?\" \"Just after my accident… I was staying with a close friend of my father's; he's a doctor, so…\" Genevieve simply nodded, \"I thought so. You weren't the best at hiding it back then…\" Odette sniffled, losing her battle not to cry. She didn't really want to know, but something made her ask, \"What gave it away?\" \"There were a lot of things that caught my attention. The dullness in your eyes, the odd days you seemed to be in more pain than usual, the way you tensed up whenever Régine neglected Camille…\" Genevieve sighed, lightly squeezing Odette's shoulder, \"I'd had my suspicions for a while, but the thing that really confirmed it to me was… that one day with Camille…\" Odette placed a hand over her mouth, her tears overflowing as she gave a broken sob. She didn't need to ask which day she was referring to; she already knew all too well. Edward had been away on business, leaving Régine – who was too stubborn to admit she needed help – to handle both the restaurant and a cranky, teething Camille. By the time that day arrived, Régine was so tired that she often fell asleep in her chair, leaving her little one to cry until someone else took the initiative to see to her; something that made her blood boil in light of her own infertility. That day, she'd been folding the linens when Camille started crying, bleating for her mother like a newborn lamb, but once again, Régine never came. Finally pushed to breaking point, she'd crept into the young Le Haut's nursery and sat beside the cradle, gently rocking it with her foot as she went on with her work. Sure enough, the soothing motion was all it took to calm the infant, happy just to have someone there. Just as she'd gotten up to leave, Camille managed to push one of her toys – a plush donkey from her father – between the cradle bars, sparking a fresh wave of tears from the lonely child. Setting the basket of linens aside, she walked back and picked up the toy. But as she returned it to the cradle, Camille managed to grasp her finger, cooing softly as her eyes pleaded to be picked up. Every impulse within her told her to do so, but she knew all too well why she couldn't. She didn't notice Genevieve walk in the room, nor did she stick around to ask how long she'd been there, simply dashing from the room as she fought back tears. Odette was brought back to the present by Genevieve hugging her shoulders, but made no effort to restrain her tears. In all the years since she'd found out, she'd never confided in anyone. After so many years of silent suffering, it felt nice to have a shoulder to cry on… \"So, let me guess; you're afraid that Louis is looking to make you his wife, and that you'll one day have to tell him that-\" \"That I'm nothing but a broken little girl who doesn't deserve his affection,\" Odette interjected, tears of shame streaming down her face. Genevieve remained silent for quite some time, carefully planning her response, then handed her a neatly-pressed handkerchief, \"My friend said that once too...\" Odette looked up as she took the handkerchief, bringing it to her tear-stained face. \"She was born into a quite wealthy family with a lot of upper-class connections. One of these families had a son her age, so in the interest of 'maintaining wealth', their parents brought them together as often as possible in hopes they'd fall in love.\" Odette sniffled, wiping away the last of her tears, \"Did they?\" \"Yes. Very much so… A few weeks after they announced their engagement, she came to me in tears, wanting to talk. We went up to my room, and she told me his parents had started making comments about them continued his bloodline, and she was terrified because she was almost 17 and still hadn't had her first period.\" Genevieve paused, a tear of her own rolling down her cheek at the bitter memory, \"Later that week, I snuck her out to a doctor's appointment myself, sat with her while he assessed her, and held her as she cried when he confirmed her fears.\" The former ballerina bit her lip, reluctant to fall into another wave of salty tears. She hadn't been so lucky; she'd had no warning, no mother to explain how it worked, no inkling that her light, erratic bleeds were anything to be concerned about. The truth had come down on her as cruel and as suddenly as the ceiling that killed her father, shattering the only thing she'd managed to salvage from the fire – her hopes for a future, and of building a family of her own. \"She was so ashamed and embarrassed, and terrified her fiancé would stop loving her when he found out… But eventually, I made her see that if he left her over this, it just proved his feelings weren't genuine to begin with.\" \"Did she tell him?\" \"In time... When she was ready, she asked him to meet her somewhere quiet and they had a very long talk about it.\" A small smile tugged at the woman's lips, \"Funnily enough, it was then they realised neither of them actually wanted children; they were just under stress from all the pressure their parents were giving them.\" \"What happened to them?\" Genevieve chuckled, clearly knowing something she didn't. \"Well, you must keep in mind I'm using them purely as proof that I understand, not an example to follow…\" Odette raised a questioning eyebrow, and Genevieve smiled in amusement. \"Changed their names, eloped to America and joined a traveling circus.\" Odette couldn't help but laugh a little, torn between amusement, bewilderment and utter confusion. \"I don't know, I don't understand it either…\" Genevieve chuckled. \"I'm the only one that knows they're even alive . Albeit only just; they've both faced death on numerous occasions.\" Taking a breath to calm herself, Genevieve took Odette's hand in hers, \"But at the end of the day, they have each other and they're happy; that's the most important thing. If someone truly loves you, they'll do so regardless of your scars…\" Odette smiled shyly, fully aware of the true meaning behind her words. \"As for you with Louis, my advice would be to just… take it slow. You don't have to tell him anything until it gets serious.\" \"And… if he rejects me?\" Genevieve just smiled, gently squeezing her hand, \"Then at least you'll have your little girl…\" Odette looked up in surprise, trying to process what she'd just heard. \"Félicie told us you were going to adopt her,\" Genevieve explained. \"It was practically the first thing she said when she burst in this morning.\" Odette felt a single tear roll down her cheek, but she knew it wasn't from fear or sadness. After so many years of heartache, she'd grown to believe she was no longer worthy or capable of being saved, yet Félicie had done all that and more. She'd given her back a sense of purpose and a reason to smile each morning, and uncovered a side of herself she'd forgotten was there. She restored her hope, and brought light back to her life. But above all else, she'd given her something no man ever could – the chance to live those distant dreams of motherhood. And no matter what, she'd forever treasure her precious ray of sunshine… \"I'm so lucky to have her…\" \"Yes, you are,\" the woman beside her smiled. \"And she's going to be so happy to have you there tonight.\" Odette's smile faltered, still slightly nervous about the prospect of going. It'd been so long for her, and the first step was always the hardest. Genevieve seemed to notice the lingering discomfort, offering her a reassuring smile, \"Look, why don't I come with you tonight? That way you won't feel so alone.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Of course. Besides, I can't ask you to look after Félicie, Victor and Camille.\" Odette smiled, the last of her stress melting away, \"Thank you, Genevieve.\" \"You're most welcome,\" Genevieve smiled, then looked back towards the closet. \"Now, where to find you a dress at such short notice...\" As if on que, someone knocked on the door. \"Come in.\" The door immediately opened, Camille walking in with Félicie. \"Hey Aunty.\" \"Hello girls,\" Genevieve greeted, smiling at her niece and her new friend. \"Having fun?\" \"You bet,\" Félicie smiled, bouncing onto the sofa next to Odette. \"Mum, you have to see what Camille made me for Christmas.\" Félicie handed her a piece of paper, and Odette could only look down in amazement. There on the page was an image of herself and Félicie, dancing together in full costume. She couldn't quite place their poses, but she immediately recognised their costumes as being those of Berthe and Giselle respectively, knowing them better than the back of her hand. \"Camille… You drew this?\" she breathed in awe, the girl blushing in response. \"Darling, this is wonderful. Is that Giselle?\" \"Uh-hmm... Young Giselle and her mother,\" Camille smiled proudly at her aunt. \"Félicie mentioned it's Odette's favourite ballet.\" \"So, any luck finding Mum a dress?\" Genevieve's face lit up, and she smiled to herself as she again looked at the drawing, \"Actually, I think I know just the dress…\" Being Christmas Day in the City of Love, Dreams and various other things – just not pigeons, apparently – the usually-busy streets were as good as empty, most citizens either at home or at Church. That being said, the odd coach could still be seen pushing through the fallen snow, each driven by a mid- to old-aged man as he went about his rounds. One said coach came to a steady stop, jolting as it did so, in front of a house in the better side of Paris, far smaller than most of its kind. After securing the reins and praising his horse on a job well done, the coachman got down from his seat and opened the door, carefully helping his young, crippled passenger down to the sidewalk. Odette winced as her right foot touched the ground, clutching her cane in one hand and the coachman's arm in the other, but managed to find her footing. \"Thank you.\" By this point, Genevieve had helped herself and the girls out of the coach, and presented the man with a generous tip. Tipping his hat to them, he climbed up to the driver's seat, calling back to them as he urged his horse onwards, \"Merry Christmas, Mademoiselles.\" Genevieve chuckled, opening her front door to let them in, \"Ladies…\" Félicie followed her inside, Camille and her new mother close behind, and looked around at the spacious interior and standard furnishings, \"Huh… Somehow I pictured it bigger…\" \"Unlike my mother, Aunty chooses not to boast her wealth,\" Camille explained. \"But seriously, what are we doing here?\" \"You'll see…\" the woman teased. \"Follow me.\" Gesturing for them to follow, Genevieve led them to a room on the second floor, then opened the door to let them in. One look inside was enough to tell that this particular room had had many functions in its lifetime, though it currently served as a make-shift sewing room. Most notable was a large collection of drawings – clearly done by Camille – pinned against the side wall, many appearing to be outfits or costumes of some kind. \"Whoa… You're really into this art thing…\" Félicie remarked as she looked at the various drawings, earning a giggle from Camille. \"Camille's taken up quite an art for fashion design in recent years. Last time she came to visit me, she drew this gorgeous red evening dress,\" Genevieve explained as she walked over to a covered mannequin on the other side of the room. \"I loved it so much, I just couldn't help myself...\" Grabbing the black fabric, Genevieve carefully pulled it away to reveal her work, then turned to smile at her niece, \"What do you think?\" Camille gasped in delight upon seeing the dress – her dress – adorning the mannequin. True to her original design, the fitted bodice was made of velvet, with elbow-length sleeves and a wide v-neckline decorated with black lace and intricate beading. The floor-length skirt had an almost Flamenco-esque style to it, covered with short ruffles from the hips down, as though it was made from hundreds of swan feathers dyed a brilliant ruby red. \"Aunty…\" Camille breathed, circling the mannequin once as she smiled. \"It's even better than I pictured it…\" \"It's lovely, Camille,\" Odette chimed in, causing the blonde's smile to grow even wider. Genevieve stood next to her niece, thinking out loud as she made random gestures with her hand. \"I mean, it's not made-to-measure; may need taking in a bit. But, with a little work-\" \"Wait, you mean…\" Catching her drift, Camille turned to her aunt, suddenly uncertain. \"Aunty, are you sure about this? It's the first of my dresses we've actually made, it's probably ahead of its time, it's going to be seen by dozens of people…\" \"Camille, darling, you worry too much,\" Genevieve smiled, lightly hugging her shoulders. \"It's a beautiful dress, and let's not forget you designed it with Odette in mind.\" \"You really think people will like it?\" \"Of course they will. Odette, would you mind standing over there so we can get a better look?\" Propping her cane against a nearby chair, Odette walked over and stood behind the dressed mannequin. Even without trying it on, it was apparent to all that the dress needed work; a bit too generous around the waist with sleeves that didn't quite reach. But those were alterations well within their limits, especially with the hours they had at their disposal. Minor flaws aside, the outfit complimented her figure beautifully, the luxurious red fabric perfectly suited to her fair skin tone. Genevieve hummed in satisfaction, admiring hers and her niece's handiwork, \"Yes, I dare say this'll do nicely…\" Camille put her hands over her cheeks, index fingers pinching the bridge of her nose as she searched for a reason to not go through with this. \"Don't love it. Don't love it. Don't love it…\" Félicie came to stand beside her, stating simply, \"You love it.\" \"I do love it. Oh , but it needs- something …\" Casting a quick glance around the room, Camille dashed over to a large trunk, rummaging through it before racing out the room altogether, \" Aunty! Where's the black lace?! \" Genevieve chuckled at her niece's antics as she stood beside Odette, a knowing smile on her face, \"This is going to be a long day.\" .o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o. There, finally finished… I tried so hard to get this up for Christmas; so much so that I ended up sitting at my laptop in tears at 2am the day after. I'm sure someone's going to tell me it's 'not that important', but with all the emotional stress of looking after my dementia-suffering mother, it takes very little to set me off sometimes… Anyway, I hope this is ok. :) Since I didn't do the best job explaining it, my idea behind Camille's dress was that it would be an 1880's style evening gown inspired by what we today would know as the Peacock Dress in 'Love Never Dies', which is set roughly around 1900. I did try searching 'fashion in 1880's France', but you'd be surprised how hard it is to find images of dresses from the era , not just 'in the style of'. Oh well, I'll just leave it at that and let you make of it what you will. XD Ok, that's all for now. Again, I don't want to make any promises as to when the last chapter will be up, but I'll try to make it as soon as possible. Hope you enjoyed this chapter, and look forward to hearing your thoughts.

It's not simple, but he likes it well enough. He has Brooke and he has Jimmy and he couldn't ask for more. JimBo. … … I've never written in present tense before this. It's really weird. :/ Anyway, read it; review it; let me know how you like or don't like it. The number over each section is Bo's age in each scene, fyi. … … 0 Elizabeth and Michael Tabbot have been debating on the perfect name for their child for months. As the pregnancy draws to an end, Elizabeth wants \"Bo\" and Michael wants \"John\". Then, nine and a half months in, time is up and they must make a final decision. He's born at 5 lbs 2 ounces – a healthy baby boy, but Elizabeth doesn't make it. Only minutes after holding her baby, her eyes shut for the last time and her breath stills. When asked what name to put on the birth certificate, Michael says, \"Bo Tabbot,\" and looks at his sleeping baby's face with tears in his eyes. … … 4 As Mother's Day nears, the kids in day care begin making gifts for their mothers. For the first time, little Bo realizes that maybe his family isn't like everyone else's. And he wonders where his mother is. His father says his mother is with God. He says she loves him and that she's watching over him, even though Bo can't see her. His father hands him a photo of his mother at four months pregnant with his father in their little house. It makes Bo smile and he treasures the framed image because it is the only picture he'll ever have of his family. At day care, one of the older kids asks Bo where his mother is. \"With God,\" Bo answers proudly. He is put in time out for punching the older kid in the nose when the kid laughed at him and said his mom was dead. When he is let out of time out, a little girl with her brown hair in braided pigtails comes over and looks him straight in the eyes. \"Your mommy's with God in heawen?\" she asks, holding her stuffed dog to her chest tightly. \"Yea,\" Bo answers defiantly, holding his chin up high. She smiles at him. \"Then she knows my daddy!\" she half-cheers. \"He went to God last year. I still really miss him. But I bet he likes it. There's probly ponies and fishes up there. Daddy loved fishes. Your mommy liked fishes?\" Bo shakes his head and squints his eyes. \"No!\" he denies forcefully. \"She liked daddy and me!\" The little girl smiles. \"Brooke!\" she announces loudly, holding out one tiny hand to Bo while the other keeps a hold of her dog. Bo nods. \"Yea. Mrs. Stevens said called roll,\" he tells her, proving just how observant he is. He clumsily takes her hand. \"Bo.\" Brooke giggles. \"Your name's cute!\" \"My name's cute!\" Bo agrees, beaming. And thus is the start of their friendship. … … 7 Bo sits in the brown wood paneled room in silence. He can hear kids laughing and screaming down the hall and outside, but he doesn't feel like playing. He doesn't feel like doing anything. The lady at the desk out front said this was only temporary. Just until they find him a new home. A new family. He takes out his little framed photo and stares at the smiling faces of his parents. He's glad he took it to show and tell today. It's all he has left of his mother. It's all he has left of his father. It's all he has left of a life that no longer exists. He heard the police talking to the lady at the desk. A spark, they said. Maybe from the oven, they said. But all Bo cares about is that he got off the bus and his home wasn't where it was when he left for school. A pile of ashes and black debris was in its place. Within a month, he's adopted. He moves across town, up town, to a more prosperous neighborhood. The people who took him home are called the Sanders. Bill Sanders is in banking. Lily Sanders stays at home and sells Avon. Bo Sanders starts at a new school. And still he doesn't feel like doing much at all. He wants his dad to come take him home. He can't understand why his dad isn't there anymore. He knows what happened and he knows what that means, but he can't think about it; can't accept it. He just can't. He's stuck. Then the teacher calls roll. \"Brooke Muller.\" She's sat at the back of the classroom, her hair still in those silly pigtails. He hasn't seen her in over a year, but she looks just like he remembers her. She smiles and waves at him and he thinks maybe God isn't so cruel after all. … … 12 Bo captains the Middle School Wrestling League team at his school. He's the youngest captain they've ever had. He's the big shot around school because he took down Don Reynolds, the school bully. He's only in seventh grade, but he's the big cheese, and he likes it. Brooke started wearing tank tops last year. She wears her hair in a tight ponytail instead of pigtails and paints her nails. She's getting boobs and Bo isn't quite sure what to make of that. The other guys on Bo's team say Brooke is the hottest girl in school. Bo agrees, but he doesn't understand why they're all obsessed. For the first time, he begins to realize he's different from his friends. Again. Except this time he can't explain why. It's the middle of the year, almost Christmas break, when he first sees Jimmy Myers. And then he can't forget him. Bo's walking through the halls like he's the king of the world. People are moving out of his way. Then he hears someone's schoolbooks hit the ground and chortling. He glances over and there's this kid standing by the lockers, staring at the books on the ground like they're his heart and someone's stepped on it. His hair is short and curling, light colored. From where he stands, Bo can tell his eyes are light as well. He's thin; weak. The chortling is from three members of the wrestling team. Tom, Sean, and David are standing in front of the kid, laughing their butts off. In an instant, Bo knows what's happened. As captain, it is his responsibility to keep his team in check, so he heads over to tell them off. \"Heard you've got no parents,\" Sean teases cruelly. \"Must be nice.\" \"Well I heard he's living with an older woman,\" Tom cuts in. \"Is she hot?\" \"How's it feel to be an orphan?\" David asks meanly. The kid sniffles and bends to pick up his books without looking at his three tormentors. They laugh some more. \"Aw,\" David coos. \"Poor wittle baby orphan. Do you miss your mommy and daddy?\" \"You gonna cry, baby?\" Sean sneers. \"Stupid loser.\" \"What's there to cry about?\" Tom asks with a shrug. \"No rules. No bedtime. No nagging. I'd switch places with you in a heart-\" Bo punches the locker directly behind his teammates so hard it dents. His hand throbs from the action but he doesn't let it show. The noise startles his mates into turning around and the dent scares them. Or maybe it's the glare on Bo's face. \"Unacceptable,\" he hisses out and all them of them flinch. \"I hope you weren't planning on sectionals, because you're off the team. Effective immediately.\" All three of their pairs of eyes widen. \"But Bo!\" Tom half-shouts. Most of the kids in the hall are watching them but Bo doesn't care. \"Shut up,\" he orders darkly. \"I don't want to hear it. You don't get to act like this and be on my team. Got it?\" They all nod. \"Good. Now scram before I break you.\" They hurry away and the rest of the kids in the hall move on with their lives. Bo bends down next to the kid and picks up some loose papers scattered around. The kid stands up quickly and Bo follows suit. \"Sorry about that,\" Bo apologizes. \"And I'm sorry about your parents. I'm Bo-\" \"I know who you are,\" the boy interrupts thickly. He looks up at Bo, finally, with tears clinging to his lashes and the edges of his eyes. \"Thanks, but just leave me alone,\" he states blandly before turning and walking away. Bo blinks after him for several seconds. The warning bell sounds and Bo hurries to his class. It isn't until he's in his seat in class that he realizes he still has some of the kid's school papers in his hands. The name at the top of the page is \"Jimmy Myers.\" Bo smiles. \"Nice to meet you,\" he whispers as Mr. Brian tries to teach him pre-algebra. Brooke next to him gives him a confused look, but Bo doesn't explain and she eventually turns back to class. The next day he sees Jimmy sitting alone at lunch. He decides then to befriend Jimmy, because Jimmy reminds him of himself: after his father died and he didn't want to do anything. So he starts sitting with Jimmy at lunch. His first excuse for doing so is to give Jimmy back his papers, but then he never leaves. He talks about what he's been doing lately, his training with the team, his home life. He doesn't mention he's adopted and he wonders if Jimmy notices the way he doesn't call his parents 'mother' and 'father.' He's shocked at how much he really wants Jimmy to notice. A week in, Jimmy finally answers back in conversation. \"Aren't you supposed to sit with your team?\" he asks, nodding his head to the large group around a table across the room. The people in the group are members of the wrestling team and their girlfriends; popular people. They aren't the most popular group in school, but they rank. Bo only looks at them for a moment before facing Jimmy again. He shrugs. \"They can take care of themselves,\" he says with a smile. A little smile grows on Jimmy's face and he looks grateful. Bo nods. \"Can I have your roll?\" Jimmy laughs and Bo feels his insides flutter. He's happy but he can't explain why. And he wonders if he should ask Brooke about this feeling, but immediately thinks no. She's a girl and he's a boy. It's not the same thing. … … 14 Jimmy isn't sure if sneaking out of his sister's house is the best idea, but Bo assures him that everyone has to sneak out at some point or they aren't a man. He sneaks out at least once a month to attend parties at his teammates' houses. So at eleven on a Sunday, Bo sneaks out of his adoptive parent's house and jogs to Jimmy's house. He's spent every other weekend at Jimmy's since they finally became friends. He picks up a pebble in the yard and bounces it off Jimmy's second floor window. A moment later, Jimmy shows up at the window and gives him a nervous smile before opening the window. He scales down the wall so skillfully that Bo wonders if Jimmy has really never done this before. As soon as he hits the grass, they run across the yard and down the street. Bo leads him to a little lake in the city park. There's a path with a small wall and Bo walks on the wall with perfect balance while Jimmy takes the path below. It's a full moon and Bo thinks maybe this is sort of like a date. \"Bo?\" Jimmy asks. Bo looks down at his younger friend. \"What?\" Jimmy stuffs his hands in his pockets and shrugs vaguely. \"Nothing really. Just….have you ever….wanted to date someone?\" Bo stops walking without realizing it. Jimmy turns to face him with a curious look, but Bo can't think straight. It takes his mind a full ten seconds to reboot. \"You mean, do I like anyone?\" he asks. Jimmy nods, looking nervous, and Bo shrugs. \"I don't know, I mean….All my mates have girlfriends, but I don't really want one.\" \"Same,\" Jimmy says. \"But Brooke,\" he begins, but stops. Bo feels something deep in his gut clench and drop. \"You like Brooke,\" he states. The statement hurts more than he thought it would. Jimmy shakes his head but doesn't speak. The silence carries on for several minutes and Bo feels it like a heavy weight on his shoulders. Jimmy doesn't look at him so Bo looks up at the moon. \"It's a full moon,\" he states, changing the subject. Jimmy looks up too. \"Maybe we'll see a werewolf.\" Bo grins and then bends over a little with a laugh. \"You're such a nerd, Jimbo.\" He catches Jimmy's frown. \"Yea…well,\" he flounders. Jimmy isn't good at fighting, with his fists or with his words. He's a book worm and an intellectual. He's nothing like Bo and Bo likes that. \"You're such a jock.\" Bo laughs again, jumping off the small wall. \"Yep. I'm awesome,\" he compliments himself. He reaches over and places a hand on Jimmy's shoulder, drawing his gaze. \"And I'll always be there to protect you.\" It's dark, so Bo isn't sure he actually sees it, but he thinks Jimmy's cheeks turn pink. They stay out until four, just walking and talking. Jimmy tells Bo about a new comic series he's reading and Bo pretends he isn't interested but Jimmy keeps talking and Bo listens to every word. By the time he's helping Jimmy back up into his bedroom, Bo thinks maybe there is someone he'd like to date. Because he's heard Brooke blab about guys at school she likes and this sounds like it: he feels super charged, like he could take on a whole wrestling team on his own and win; like he could run for days and never tire; and it's a happy, jittery energy. And as he heads to his own house, Bo already misses Jimmy's face. He can't wait for school to start. He doubts he'll even sleep. They'll sneak out together, at least once a month, and go to parties and go on walks and go to midnight movies and just hang out. They've been friends for years, but Bo suddenly can't get enough. And Jimmy is still a nerd and Bo is still popular, but everyone knows they're practically inseparable and no one complains. … … 18 Bo can't believe high school's over. It's Prom and Bo's standing in the darkened reception hall in a tux. Brooke is his date, since neither of them has anyone. Brooke did a week ago, until she found out he was cheating on her, so they went together instead. She's wearing a gorgeous red dress and Bo is certain she's the hottest thing in the room. A group of guys at the food table is staring at her while several girls along the wall are staring at Bo, so he supposes he must look good too. The music is bump and grind music while the decorations are 'traditional prom' themed. Bo and Brooke stay on the dance floor for over an hour, dancing in the pit with the rest of the student body, before finally extricating themselves from the masses. Brooke leads Bo to the refreshment table and grabs a glass of punch for each of them. \"This is fun,\" Brooke comments loudly, to be heard over the music. Bo nods and downs his whole glass in one go. He can feel the sweat beading at the back of his neck, and he's only felt this thirty after an intense training session. He's just grabbed a second glass when Brooke points across the room. \"Hey, it's Jimmy!\" she cheers just loud enough to be heard. \"I thought he wasn't coming.\" Jimmy glances around the room until his eyes land on Bo and Brooke and then he hurries over. He's dressed in a traditional black and white tux with a black tie. Bo's never seen Jimmy in dress clothes, and he has to admit he likes what he sees. After knowing Jimmy for six years, Bo can safely admit to himself that he likes Jimmy. In fact, he sometimes admits to himself that he loves Jimmy. He's never said it aloud, even alone in his room. But right now, Bo nearly lets the words spill from his mouth at the mere sight of Jimmy. \"Hey, Jimbo!\" he greets with a bright smile. Jimmy smiles nervously and adjusts his tie. \"Hey.\" Brooke smiles too in greeting. \"I thought you said you weren't coming,\" she says. Jimmy shrugs, his eyes drifting almost nervously between his two friends. \"I thought it might be worth it,\" he explains vaguely as his eyes come to rest on Bo. \"You clean up nice, jock boy,\" he teases with a grin. The words are unexpected. Bo still isn't used to Jimmy's wit. Jimmy says he's learned from the best; from Bo. While he's happy about that, Bo is shocked every time he hears a smart ass comment. \"You too, loser,\" he responds smoothly. He holds the cup of punch out to Jimmy. \"Thirsty?\" Jimmy looks relieved at the offer and takes the offered cup. \"Yea, I'm so thirsty.\" He takes a big gulp. \"Is it hot in here or is it me?\" Brooke laughs and Bo smiles. \"It's kind of warm,\" Brooke agrees. \"Do you have a date?\" she asks. Bo's smile fades. He hadn't thought of that. He isn't sure what he'll do if Jimmy came with a date. Jimmy has never shown interest in anyone really; at least no one that wasn't fictional, and definitely not in a romantic sense. It's part of the reason why Bo hasn't confessed yet: he has no idea of Jimmy's orientation. Jimmy shakes his head and a part of Bo lightens as he lets out a quiet breath. \"No,\" Jimmy says unnecessarily. \"Just me.\" \"Don't know why,\" Bo says teasingly with a smile, \"You're a catch.\" It's obvious that Jimmy doesn't know what to do with the compliment, a joke or otherwise. His face is bright pink, the way only Jimmy blushes, and his mouth is hanging open as his mind tries to come up with a response. Brooke saves him the trouble by drawing his attention with a hand on his shoulder. \"There are quite a few girls over there that would love to dance with you,\" she tells him with a nod to the wall flowers. \"Why don't you go say hi for a bit. We'll join you once we've caught our breaths.\" \"Uh, um, sure,\" Jimmy stutters. \"Yeah, ok. See you,\" he waves and makes his way toward the chairs against the wall. Bo watches him leave and thus doesn't see Brooke grinning lewdly at him. When he does, he takes a half step back, nervous. \"What?\" Her grin widens. \"You might get lucky tonight,\" she hints suggestively. Bo's eyes widen and he holds up his hands. \"I'm flattered, Brooke, but you're not my type.\" She rolls her eyes. \"I meant Jimmy!\" she practically yells, and Bo glances around to see if anyone heard her. They didn't. There's no one around them right now. He turns back to Brooke. \"What are you talking about?\" She huffs. \"Oh don't give me that, Mr. Big Shot. I've known you almost all your life. You think I hadn't noticed?\" She shakes her head. \"I've known for years about your crush on Jimmy.\" Bo isn't sure his eyes could get any wider. \"Oh,\" is all he manages. He wonders briefly if anyone else knows, if he's been that obvious, or if it's just Brooke. \"Do you think Jimmy knows?\" Brooke shrugs. \"I don't know,\" she says lightly, \"but he was checking you out just now. He's definitely interested,\" she assures him. At first, it doesn't register that there might be a chance. Then a tiny smile creeps onto Bo's face. Brooke sighs and he frowns. \"What's the matter?\" She shakes her head a bit to clear his doubt. \"All the good men are taken or gay,\" she complains. \"It's too bad Jimmy bats for your team, or I'd totally snag him.\" Bo lifts an eyebrow. \"What, you wouldn't go for me if I was straight?\" he asks as if offended. Brooke scoffs. \"Oh please. You're practically my brother. It'd be too weird.\" She smiles at him and Bo feels it lift the corners of his mouth as well. \"Come on,\" he says with a nod toward the dance floor. Jimmy's there with a short blonde girl in a green dress. They both look a bit out of place together. \"I think Jimmy needs back up.\" Later Bo thinks about that night and wonders about his 'coming out' to Brooke. He's heard terrible stories about guys that are shunned and mocked by old friends when they learn a guy is gay. He thinks he should've been worried when Brooke said she knew…but he wasn't. Perhaps, he thinks, it is because Brooke is right. They are like siblings, and siblings stick by you, so he didn't worry. He also thinks maybe things will change now that she's revealed she knows. But nothing does. Life goes on. Now, as Brooke likes to tell him when they're alone, it's time to woo his man. … … 19 Bo and Jimmy attend the same college. They even share an apartment together just off campus. Jimmy sits around in hoodies and sweats reading comics or sci-fi novels in his spare time. Bo just wears the sweats and studies. Jimmy never studies because his brain is like a sponge and he remembers everything in a snap. Whenever neither of them is working, studying, or in school, they like to sit around and watch movies together. Sometimes Bo gets Jimmy to jog or work out with him, and he's put on a bit of muscle for it. Bo's so in love by this point that he isn't sure he can handle life without Jimmy anymore. The thought scares him but he can't stop the way he feels. Jimmy still has no idea. Brooke calls every Saturday to chat, and every Saturday she tells him to fess up already. He always says it's easier said than done. One Friday, halfway through their second semester, they go to a party thrown by one of Bo's teammates. Bo isn't the captain of this team, but he's next in line. The party is typical. The music is too loud and the drinks are too many and the room is too crowded. Everyone is dancing and drinking, no matter their age, and the living room made dance floor is swarmed in grinding, writhing bodies. Bo finds himself right next to Jimmy in the mix of people. He blames it on the alcohol, but he takes the chance. So he turns only slightly to the side and suddenly he's front to back with Jimmy. Everyone has their hands up and Bo grazes his fingers against the backs of Jimmy's hands as his head comes up next to Jimmy's. The base pounds from the speakers and vibrates through Bo's body and he throws his hips forward. Jimmy looks back over his shoulder with wide eyes but seems to calm when he sees Bo behind him. And then suddenly they're in perfect sync, moving against one another with wonderful friction. Bo can feel his blood rushing through his veins, can hear Jimmy's heavy breathing over the pulsing music, can see the sweat beading on Jimmy's skin, and as his nose brushes through Jimmy's curly hair he smells his minty shampoo. Now is not the time or place but Bo can't move away. He's glad for the large crowd hiding their actions but there's a pressure, a tension, and Bo can't deny the feeling much longer. He wants to throw Jimmy against the wall only three feet away, screw inhibitions, and give these people a real show. He wants to rip Jimmy's clothes off right then and there and run his fingers down his body, finding every sensitive spot that makes Jimmy writhe and moan, and just give them both over to passion until the morning light shines through and beyond. He leans his head on Jimmy's shoulder and groans deep in his throat. His fingers curl in the back of Jimmy's Abercrombie shirt and he rolls his hips against Jimmy's backside. Jimmy's head falls back a bit as he lets out a low breath. \"We need to leave,\" Jimmy croaks just loud enough for Bo to hear. \" Please .\" It's nearly a beg and every muscle in Bo's body tenses in beautiful anticipation. They barely make it through the door of their apartment and Bo pushes Jimmy against the wall and crushes their lips and hips together. \"You've no idea how long I've wanted to do this,\" Bo breathes out. Jimmy laughs airly. \"I think I can imagine,\" he manages, his voice deeper and yet softer than Bo has ever heard it. It makes Bo's stomach do flips and the rest of the world disappears outside of Jimmy. Bo touches Jimmy's face lightly before grabbing his stupid Abercrombie shirt. \"This needs to come off now, or I'll rip it off.\" Not much is said after that, but Bo does all the things he imagined on the dance floor and more. Jimmy is just as shy as ever, and yet bolder than Bo has ever known him to be. He's not sure how long they go at it, but he knows tonight is not enough. He's not sure he'll ever get enough of Jimmy. Especially when he licks Jimmy's inner thigh and Jimmy starts quoting his comics like cries to God. It sounds dorky but it's strangely erotic and Bo does it again and again to hear another line. … … 23 The moment the hats fly in the air, Bo knows he's made it. He's got a diploma in his hands and a beaming smile on his face and Jimmy at his side. They're both wearing ridiculous graduation robes but Bo still thinks Jimmy's the hottest person on the planet. Once they've left the auditorium, Bo pulls Jimmy to the side and plants a solid kiss on his lips. He feels Jimmy smile and kiss back and even after all these years, it still makes his stomach jitter with joy. They go out to eat with Brooke, her boyfriend, her parents, Bo's adoptive parents, and Jimmy's sister Ellie. Brooke announces her engagement with a bright smile and a matching bright blush. Ellie congratulates them and lifts an eyebrow at Jimmy. She still thinks Bo is a phase that Jimmy will grow out of. Bo's mother tells him later that she looked up places where gays can legally marry and asks him if he wants to pick a date. Bo blushes like a stop light. \"Lily!\" he gasps. \"I haven't even asked him!\" She just looks at him innocently. \"So when are you going to do it? I can take off work to film it, you know.\" In that moment, Bo has two thoughts: how did he get adopted by crazies, and when is he going to do it? … … 24 It's after Brooke's wedding. She was gorgeous and elegant in a traditional white gown and veil and the ceremony went off without a hitch. At the reception, Bo takes Jimmy aside in the hall. He gets down on one knee and already Jimmy's eyes are wide. Once the question's been popped, Jimmy nearly passes out but he nods his head and Bo kisses him senseless. It's one of the happiest moments of his life. And for the rest of their lives, through better and worse, they support each other. Ellie never really accepts Bo, but Bo's parents treat Jimmy like a second son and Brooke supports them. Things aren't always easy, but they're never truly bad, and what's important is that no matter what happens, they're happy. And Bo couldn't ask for more. … … Fin. … … So….thoughts?

Notes: Jimmy is still a werewolf because he bit Jake as he was dying. Also, I'm ignoring the existence of the were-bear like wolves and going with a more typical werewolf (like Teen Wolf or Big Wolf on Campus) because I can't take that thing seriously. And there is gratuitous use of werewolf fanlore, as well. Characters not mine, please enjoy! Comments are awesome. Jimmy is drunk out of his skull the first time it happens. He's sitting on the couch in Bo's basement and there's a movie playing but he no longer has any idea of what that movie is. Brooke left an hour and a half ago, with excuses and apologies and Jimmy's heart, but Bo's still there (obviously, because it's his house, duh) and so is the bottle of vodka he snuck from his Dad's liquor stash. \"Jimbo?\" Bo slurs at him, nearly as drunk as he is. \"Yeah?\" Bo doesn't say anything, just leans across the meager space between them on the sofa and kisses Jimmy like he's everything. There's a hand on his face that moves to drag through his hair and a tongue in his mouth that's moving against his own, with the sharp nip of teeth on his lips. Jimmy doesn't remember any of it when he wakes up the next morning with what is quite possibly the worst hangover ever. The second time, Bo's unconscious so it doesn't really count. Jimmy's roaming the woods (because what else can a well-behaved werewolf do on the night after the full moon?) when he hears the unmistakable screech of metal on metal and the tinny explosion of glass shattering and spreading out across the road. It's instinct that makes him go toward the crash because logic tells him he should stay away and the red Camaro he finds is enough to explain why. It's wrapped up in what was once a silver Impala and he can smell the strong stench of blood. He doesn't want to attack though, because the smell of blood is overwhelmed by the smell of Bo. \"Bo!\" He's shouting, more so roaring, as he picks his way down the woodsy hills. \"Bo, hold on!\" The other driver is dead, he knows, can't hear any other heartbeats around besides the one he's affiliated with Bo, and even that is weak and off-rhythm. Bo's still in the car, strapped in and trapped by a door that won't open. His head is lolled to the side, blood streaking down from a cut over his eye. He's barely awake, eyes bleary and unfocused as Jimmy uses his werewolf strength to claw his way through the door, prying it off the car's frame and tossing it aside with nearly no effort. \"Jimmy?\" \"Right here,\" he's saying, a shaky hand on Bo's arm. He's afraid to move him, knows that it could hurt him more than help him, but his nose picks up traces of gasoline leaking and he's going to have to risk it. He slices through the seatbelt with a sharp claw and pulls Bo from the wreckage carefully. \"You'll be okay.\" He can't be seen here, not half-wolfed out and covered in dirt from the woods. He carries Bo a good distance away from the wrecked cars, a safe distance should anything explode, and frees Bo's cell phone from his pocket. He dials 911, but doesn't say anything - they'll trace the call and come on their own. \"I have to go,\" Jimmy tells his friend, but Bo's not awake anymore. He's still and quiet, but Jimmy's sure he's still breathing, that his heart's still beating. He stays as long as he can, with Bo's head resting in his lap on the side of the road. He's been able to hear the sirens approaching for a while, but it's not until he can almost see the lights that he finally moves. For a reason he doesn't quite know, He drops a quick kiss to Bo's lips before he ducks back into the cover of the woods. He watches. Watches the silver Impala burst into flames just as the emergency vehicles arrive on the scene. Watches a fire truck deal with the flaming car as the cops secure the scene and the paramedics set to work on Bo, checking him over and loading him into the ambulance. \"Lucky kid,\" Jimmy hears one of them say. \"Probably wouldn't have made it if he'd still been in the car.\" The next time is at the hospital, six hours later. It still doesn't count. Jimmy hurries home, forcing the wolf into compliance as he wanders back into civilization. It reluctantly behaves and Jimmy thinks it might be because it's Bo that's hurt and the wolf inside of him doesn't like that anymore than the human part. He'll figure out what that means later. Right now? Right now he needs a shower and clothes not covered in a messy mixture of blood and dirt. Once he's clean and clothed, he rushes downstairs to find Ellie just getting home from a late taping at the studio. \"Bo was in an accident,\" he tells her, hoping she doesn't ask him how he knows that. \"Can we go to the hospital?\" Since the whole werewolf incident, Bo has become a pretty common fixture in their house. He's been by for dinner more than once and slept over even more than that. Bo volunteers to help Jimmy out with chores around the house (the aftermath of the whole Jake thing was an involved clean-up process - who knew getting claw marks out of the ceiling would be so difficult?) and he's always been polite to Ellie. So her worried expression and her quick move to grab up the keys she only just put down are not unexpected reactions to his news. The drive to the hospital is quick, but the wait for news is long. Jimmy and Ellie sit in the waiting room for something that's maybe a little less than forever, but the wolf has him so anxious and wound so tightly that he can't sit still, so he finds himself endlessly pacing the room like the caged animal he is. He finally manages to focus on Bo's heartbeat among the hundreds of people in the hospital. It takes a while, sifting through all the different beats (small ones and arrhythmic ones and too fast ones and ones that don't seem like they'll be beating much longer), but he's used to Bo's like he's used to Ellie's and eventually he pinpoints it. It's slow, but not like it was at the accident site, just like he's sleeping. He sighs, and the relief must be evident because his sister looks at him, confused. \"'s nothing,\" he mumbles, just as a nurse finally comes out with information for them. She's hesitant to tell them anything, but Jimmy explains that Bo doesn't have any siblings and his parents have been away - London, he thinks - on a business trip and probably aren't easily contactable. \"He's my best friend,\" he begs, \"please.\" She sighs and nods, tells him that Bo hasn't woken up yet, but he should soon. He has a concussion and a few cuts and bruises. She says that he's lucky it's nothing more serious. That the driver of the other car didn't make it. But Jimmy already knows all that. \"Can I see him?\" \"For a little while,\" she says. \"I'll wait here,\" Ellie excuses herself as the nurse leads Jimmy down a series of maze-like hallways. He picks up Bo's scent as soon it becomes distinguishable from the array of factors influencing it - medicines that add an artificial quality to the intricate mix he's familiar with, plus the strong scents of cleaners and bleaches that sanitize the rooms all around them, and all the other people around. Jimmy has to force himself to stay behind the nurse once he figures out where the scent leads, but he manages. \"Try not to disturb him. He'll wake up when he's ready.\" And then he's alone with Bo. He claims the seat by the bed, grabs Bo's hand in his own on instinct - the wolf relaxes, just a bit, with that little bit of contact, and yeah, he really needs to look into this - and waits. \"Mm. Jimmy?\" Bo's voice is rough and quiet, and he keeps his eyes closed, but the change in his heartbeat tells Jimmy that he is awake just a few short minutes after he comes in. \"Thanks for the save.\" \"Anytime,\" Jimmy replies, giving Bo's hand a squeeze. \"Get some sleep, okay?\" \"Yeah,\" Bo answers and it's just a few minutes later that the steady lub-dub beat slows down again. Someone else is coming, his heightened senses warn him. Probably the nurse. The wolf doesn't like it - doesn't seem to want anyone else around an injured Bo - but the human side knows that it's not something that can be avoided. He pulls Bo's hand up to his lips, kisses it quickly and is standing on the other side of the room when the nurse appears to escort him back to the waiting room. \"You can visit again tomorrow, okay? Visiting hours are from 8 in the morning to 9 at night.\" He nods and goes to Ellie, who settles a hand on his shoulder as they walk out. \"He'll be okay,\" she says. \"I know.\" He has to be. Jimmy doesn't know what he'll do (or what the wolf will do) if he isn't. The next time is almost different. It's been two days since Bo was released from the hospital. His head is healing, along with the rest of him, bruises and cuts slowly fading away. He's even back at school already. Jimmy, though, he's looking a little worse for wear. Every since Bo was released, he's been researching. There are piles of werewolf books scattered across the warzone that is presently his bedroom. His computer holds a wealth of knowledge as well, in the form of several hundred bookmarked sites on lycanthropic lore. And in between his homework and school, he's buried himself in all of it. There's plenty of stuff about packs and pack dynamics and hierarchies - alphas and betas and omegas - that doesn't relate to him because he's alone . The only wolf there is now that Jake and Joanie are both dead and Ellie's turned back. He doesn't have a pack, so this is all meaningless. But there has to be an answer. Somewhere, there has to be. So he researches and researches, and then he researches some more. He doesn't sleep, but he goes to school and comes home and is quick to get his homework out of the way. He skips dinner (like he skipped breakfast and lunch) and doesn't sleep that night, either. The next day at school, he's starting to regret the lack of sleep - his wolfish instincts are a little on the testy side (he nearly takes off the door to his locker when he misses the numbers of his combination three times, Bo's friend Louie almost loses an eye when he accidentally nudges one of Bo's healing injuries, and he may or may not have growled at his math teacher) - and by the time he gets home, he's nearly dead on his feet. Bo's on his heels, though, having invited himself over for dinner, so he forces himself to stay awake just a little while longer. \"You look awful, man,\" Bo tells him, around a mouthful of pizza. \"Have you slept at all since the crash?\" Jimmy frowns and devours his own slice of meat lover's pizza. \"Yeah, of course. \" \"Liar.\" \"Am not.\" \"Are, too.\" \"Am not.\" \"Really, Jimbo?\" Bo laughs, a move that makes him flinch because of the bruises on his ribs. \"Go to sleep, okay?\" Jimmy sighs and crushes the empty pizza box. \"And you?\" \"I have to head home. My parents should be back tonight, but I'll come back later. If that's okay?\" \"Yeah,\" Jimmy nods. \"Yeah, that's okay.\" And so Bo leaves while Jimmy heads upstairs to get some much needed rest. He comes back less than three hours later, after his parents lecture him about his car (even though it wasn't his fault, the other driver had been drunk when he slammed into Bo's car, driving in the wrong lane) and he blows off dinner with them. Ellie lets him in, tells him that Jimmy's upstairs, and he takes the steps as swiftly as he can with the pounding in his ribs. Bo's kind of stunned by the mass quantities of books that have materialized in Jimmy's room. It looks kind of like the Library of Congress threw up its occult section all over the place. And Bo is fully prepared to make fun of Jimmy for the excess of werewolf related research materials that have exploded around the room and \"what're you doing all this for, anyway? You planning a dissertation on not-so mythical creatures?\" But, Jimmy's still asleep, curled up amidst piles of books that have been pushed just out of the way enough to allow room for him on the bed. He's got his back to the wall and his arms twisted all over the place and Bo shakes his head and wonders if he should bother trying to wake him up or not. \"Jimmy?\" He says quietly, but he just gets soft snores in response. He frowns, sits down in the desk chair and waits. Five minutes, then ten. He's antsy and the pain meds he's on are clearly messing with his decision making abilities because all he really wants to do is cross the room and kiss Jimmy again (because, yes, he does remember being drunk the night Brooke and Jimmy broke up, and, hazy as it is, the night of the accident). \"Jimmy?\" He calls out again, a little louder this time. But Jimmy still doesn't stir. He does make an odd sort of whining noise that sounds like it might be meshed with Bo's name (the wolf picks up on Bo's anxiety, locked on his scent and heart rate even in sleep) and so Bo stands up and does just that. He presses his lips to Jimmy's. It's a barely there sort of kiss, over almost as soon as it starts. He backs off a bit and when he looks back down at Jimmy, it's to open eyes and a confused expression. \"What?\" Bo asks, hoping to play this off if he needs to. Jimmy touches his lips softly and frowns at Bo. \"Nothing,\" he says, \"I just... had a dream.\" \"Bad dream?\" \"No. Definitely not.\" The fifth time? It doesn't mean anything. Jimmy's out in the woods again, running and letting the wolf blow off some steam, when he smells it. The scent of another wolf is strong and unfamiliar, but unmistakable. Like this invasive, poisonous stench that assaults his senses and makes his skin crawl. He wonders if it would affect him any less if Bo weren't out here, too. He's got the newly repaired Camaro at the edge of the woods, waiting to give Jimmy a lift home at sun-up. Jimmy knows he's probably asleep by now, vulnerable to the threat of the invading wolf. And, no. Not happening. He takes off for the car as fast as his wolf speed will let him go. The scent gets stronger as he gets closer and sure enough, the hulking figure of another werewolf is lurking by the car. Jimmy gives a vicious sort of growl, a threatening sound that comes from deep in his throat. The noise is apparently enough to get Bo's attention, whether he was sleeping or not, because the lights inside of the car flick on. The other wolf turns to face him, looking less than surprised by his presence. \"Took you long enough,\" it spits at him. Jimmy only offers another roar as he puts himself between the car and the stranger who poses a threat to Bo. \"Relax. I'm here for you, not for him.\" The stranger says, not looking terribly threatened by Jimmy's presence. \"I'm recruiting lone wolves for my pack. You're a lone wolf.\" \"No,\" Jimmy manages, a low growl devouring most of the word. \"Did I say you had a choice? You join or you'll die. All wolves need a pack.\" \"I have one,\" he lies, forcing himself to shift down enough to form full sentences, but keeping his place between the threat and the car. \"I have a pack. I don't need yours.\" But the stranger only laughs at him, straight out doubles over and laughs. \"No, you don't. You're the only werewolf around, now that Jake's dead. He always was an asshole. Was that you? Because if so, you might actually be useful.\" \"What makes you think I won't do the same to you?\" Jimmy demands. The strange wolf launches forward, shifting as it moves with more speed and more skill than Jimmy has. It lands hard, claws raking at Jimmy's chest, leaving bloody gauges in his half-shifted skin, shredding his t-shirt. Teeth gnash closed just by his neck and somehow Jimmy manages to dodge away. \"Because next time, I won't stop so easily,\" comes the answer. The sound of a car door opening draws the attention of both wolves and all Jimmy can think is not good, not good, not good because there'd at least been an implication of safety when Bo was still in the car, but now he's out here and he's at risk and the wolf twitches with the need to get him out of here. \"Bo, go away,\" Jimmy hisses out, keeping the vulnerablekillablebreakable human at his back. The other wolf is still close - too close - and the smirk on his face is unnerving for a lot of reasons. \"Is this your 'pack'?\" He mocks. \"Yes.\" But that's Bo talking and why is Bo talking and no no no no. \"Just because you know about werewolves doesn't make you pack.\" \"No,\" Bo says, stupidly brave as he forces his way to Jimmy's side, as they face a werewolf who could kill him in a second. \"No, it sure as hell doesn't. But being his mate? That does.\" \" Mate ,\" the other laughs again. \"Do you even know what that means?\" Jimmy does, in theory. His research has turned up plenty of information on mates amidst all the pack stuff, but the idea that Bo could be his is one that hasn't crossed his mind. He's pretty sure Bo is bluffing, though, just trying to get the stranger to leave. He's surprised Bo knew the term, though. Maybe he's done some research of his own? \"If you're his mate, then prove it.\" Bo's heart rate jack-rabbits out of control when he pulls on Jimmy's arm, forcing him to turn and face him. He kisses Jimmy - both of them sober, conscious, and aware for the first time, but it doesn't mean anything. This is just an act. Just to get rid of the invader. Bo's good at fake-kissing, though, careful as he is not to touch the bleeding wounds on Jimmy's chest even as he tries to pull him in closer. But, suddenly, a hand is tearing them apart, the strange wolf's massive claws curled around Bo's neck as he's pulled a good distance away from a roaring Jimmy, and Bo's spewing a colorful string of curses - the likes of which Jimmy hasn't heard since Bo stopped picking on him - up until the wolf's grip tightens and Bo is forced into silence. Jimmy surges forward after him, an enraged howl tearing from his throat, but the subtle move of the other wolf's hand causes a pronounced change in Bo's breathing and so he freezes. He manages a terse \"Let him go now,\" that comes out in a snarl of words. \"I told him to prove it and he didn't. Touching as that was, a true mate would know that I meant the mark.\" \"He's not a wolf, he's not marked,\" Jimmy explains, wondering how the stranger can be so stupid. Even he knows that humans can be pack - humans can help stabilize them, keep its members tied to their humanity. Humans can even be mates. \"Shouldn't you know that?\" \"Not the mark on your hand, you fool,\" the other wolf actually rolls his eyes at Jimmy. With the hand not holding Bo, he points to a mark on his own neck. \"You would've marked him, like this, if you were mates.\" \"So, I haven't done it yet!\" Jimmy retorts, his voice a desperate sort of noise that the other wolf has to catch on to. \"That doesn't mean he's not my mate.\" \"No, but it means you'll come with me once he's out of the way.\" Fear and terror and panic and pain hit Jimmy all at once and he would swear that he feels the pressure on his own neck when the claws around Bo's start to tighten and that's when everything goes red. When Jimmy regains his senses, he's sitting on the ground next to Bo's Camaro. The sun is starting to come up and he has no idea what happened. He's covered in blood and what looks like bits of bone and brain matter. And he can see pieces of the strange wolf on the ground in the dawn light, but he can't see... \"Bo?\" He calls out, frantic when he realizes that Bo could be hurt, could be dead. He stands, unsteady on his feet and lurches in a circle, instantly relieved when he sees Bo pacing back and forth on the other side of the car. \"Fuck, good. You're awake. Good.\" Bo should have run far, far away from him after this. Whatever happened, Jimmy doubts it was pretty and so the last thing he's expecting when Bo circles around to stand in front of him is a hug. His arms come up and circle around Bo - even though he's covered in bits of someone's body and his own blood and he's getting that all over the other boy - and holds on. They slide back down to the ground, leaning against the side of the car. They're both exhausted, as adrenaline starts to die off now that the threat is gone. \"Are you okay?\" \"Yeah, just some bruises on my neck,\" he says, rubbing it subconsciously. \"It's nothing.\" \"No scratches? Bites?\" Jimmy asks because it was only a scratch on his chest that turned him and the stranger is already dead so it's not like Bo could kill him to negate it and he doesn't want to inflict any more of this crazy werewolf stuff on Bo, not like this. Bo shakes his head and checks himself over just in case. \"Nothing,\" he concludes, \"aside from some skinned knees when you tackled that thing off of me. What about you? You're the one who went all Cujo on him.\" Jimmy brushes off the hands that try to get at the wounds on his chest. \"They'll heal,\" he says, and it's true. The scratch that turned him took all of forever to finally heal, but everything since then has faded away more quickly. \"We should get out of here. Someone might see.\" But then there's a hand on his arm, stopping him from getting up and Bo's looking a little nervous. \"That, ugh,\" he starts, pointedly not looking at Jimmy. \"That thing you said, that you just hadn't marked me yet, or whatever. Were we just making that up? Or...\" And Jimmy wasn't expecting that. After all, it was Bo who started playing the mate card, who called himself pack when Jimmy didn't think he had one. \"Were you making it up when you said you were my pack?\" \"No. I mean, I know he said that I'm not pack just cause I know about you. But... I thought.\" \"You're pack,\" Jimmy confirms. \"And... if you want, you're my mate, too.\" Bo doesn't actually say anything in response. He just leans forward and kisses Jimmy because finally . And they're both exhausted and covered in gross, disgusting things but it doesn't matter because the wolf gives a low, rumbling growl that sounds something almost like a purr and he's pretty sure things couldn't get any better. The mark comes later, though. Once they've dealt with the stranger's body and cleaned up and passed out on Jimmy's bed. It's some hours later, the room glowing an array of colors with the setting sun, that Jimmy wakes surrounded by Bo. His smell is everywhere in his room, masked by the scent of Jimmy's soap and sheets, but still there. His heart beats steady and slow with sleep and his breathing even. He's warm against Jimmy's side, pulled in close because the wolf doesn't like leaving his mate's back exposed anymore than it likes leaving its own. And Jimmy's kind of awed that he's there, that he can see Bo curled up next to him like this. Before he was turned... this never would have happened. He probably would've pined after Brooke for forever and Bo probably would've kept picking on him for forever and eventually he would've moved on. But now? This is all he wants. He senses Bo start to wake up so he moves slowly, presses his wolf-teeth over Bo's neck and bites, just a little. It's not enough to break skin because this isn't to turn him, but it's enough for the mark. He kisses the skin around it and sucks hard enough that the bruise it'll leave will stick around for a while (a mark for his human side, too - and one that Bo can reciprocate) and Bo rolls towards him. He lifts his head to bare more of his neck and Jimmy's kind of failing at ignoring at what that does for the wolf because he's not sure Bo even knows what he's doing. \"You know,\" Bo mumbles, voice sleep-thick and gravelly, \"I'm really tempted to make a Big Bad Wolf joke right now.\" A hand moves to his neck, where the new mark and the new bruise stand out. Bo grins when he realizes and now he shifts to face Jimmy. \"You should reward me for resisting. Since we're mates and all.\" \"Mates,\" Jimmy echoes, still a little stunned by that himself. \"Yeah,\" he grins, leaning forward to kiss Bo again and again and again. \"I guess I should.\" ","Summary":" Stealing Kisses Written in response to cottoncandy_bingo prompt: couples first kiss, even if it tak"},{"Movie":"Cursed","Title":"The Beast Inside","Author":"windstorm21","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9556086","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Running. I only knew i was running, and in severe pain. Pain i had never felt, sharp, jagged, and gooey. A warmth i had never imagined, but at the same time, so cold. Like blood meeting the air and dripping down my arm. My shoulder. It was coming from shoulder.I quickly glanced down at my arm, blood was dripping down my fingers, and leaving a trail behind me. I can't be followed... by whatever that was. It had grabbed me, right out of a park. It had human like hands, but claws that ripped my flesh, and huge glowing red eyes of a demon, and nothing else could describe the evil behind them. That's all i had time to notice, before the beast had suddenly let go of me. I sprinted, and didn't hesitate. I ran into a neighborhood. The houses were really nice, and huge. As I rounded a corner I saw a figure standing in my way. The fact that it was three in the morning made that seem weird. I went to run past... him? Then he shot out towards me, and grabbed my wrist. \"You're bleeding. A lot. I'll take you inside and have my brother look at it. My mom is working a night shift so it will be safe inside.\" I nodded, uneasy. I wanted to run from him, but he seemed so sincere... I couldn't. When he pulled me into his house I wrapped my shirt tail around my arm to prevent blood from dripping all over the nice white carpet. I finally let myseslf take a look at the boy holding my hand. He was beautiful. He looked like he was about seventeen, maybe a year older, or even younger. So no matter what he was close to my age, sixteen. His eyes were huge, and silver- blue, which i had never seen. Shaggy dark brown hair framed his face in wavy curls. He was tan, with a Native American look about him. He was also about six feet tall. \"I'll go get my brother so he can stitch you up, go sit on the kitchen counter.\" He pointed into a beautiful kitchen, and i walked sighlently. I sat in silence for a long time, waiting. Then finally decided to look at my wound. Blood was drying down my arm, but fresh blood continued to come from the wound. I pulled my shirt over my head, and was super happy that i had a tank-top on. The wound stretched from my shoulder blade to my chest, it was my left arm luckily, so my right would be okay. Then I heard footsteps on the stairs, and straightened up in preperation. The boy came down the stairs with a guy about an inch taller than him, but much larger in muscle mass. He was also very attractive. \"Holy... this is worse than I've ever seen. How did it do that with just a scratch?!\" He asked the younger boy. \"I don't know, they don't usually go for wounds that could be fatal, she isn't looking too hot...\" He mumbled. He was right, i was becoming dizzy, and and cold. My head was spinning. i laid back onto the counter, and closed my eyes tightly. \"She is losing too much blood, and if we don't get the wound stitched in time the poison from the claws might escape with the blood.\" I didn't look to see who said it, I just squeezed my eyes tighter when a hand caressed my cheek. I shivered and clenched my hands. My movements became involuntary, I couldn't do much at all though. \"Let's stitch her up fast.\" I still refused to look. \"We need to clean the wound, here bite down on this, cuz it's gonna hurt really bad.\" I bit down on the fabric he put in my mouth. Then felt a horrible sensation, I screamed. I just kept screaming, then fell unconscious. I was floating, it was a feeling of no explanation. I felt no pain, and it was what I had always imagined floating on a could to feel like. Then I began feeling it again, so much pain. A needle. Weaving in and out, back and forth across my shoulder. I gasped, it was loud, and caught the boys attention. \"It'll be okay, here, hold my hand.\" The younger brother said as the needle went back and forth. I squeezed his hand tightly, so tightly it surely hurt him. He didn't seem to mind though. Then suddenly the needle stopped. \"I've done everything i can, it should heal now.\" The older brother mumbled. Then i fell asleep again. ","Summary":" Running.

Aquí estoy para traduciros un fic de Animegirl1129, de la pareja Jimmy x Bo, de Cursed (La maldición). Por si alguien se pregunta por mi otro fic \"Amor de hermanos\", pronto actualizaré. Declaimer: Los personajes no me pertenecen, y la historia es de Animegirl1129. Advertencia: Esto es Yaoi (historia romántica chico x chico). Si no te gusta, ¿Qué mierda haces aquí? - Entonces,- empezó Bo, dirigiendo su mirada hacia su sandwich de pollo medio comido, desviándola así del chico sentado enfrente suyo en el pequeño restaurante cercano a su casa- ¿Cómo te fue en tu cita con Brooke? Jimmy se encogió de hombros, cogiendo desinteresadamente su orden de patatas francesas.-Estuvo bien. La película del hombre lobo era un tanto redundante. Bastante aburrida si la has vivido.- Sonrió, consciente de los arañazos que persistían en su cara y pecho.- Aunque ella me besó. - Oh, ¿Como fue?- Bo tenía una segunda intención con esta conversación, pero la aplicaba de una manera sutil, con el fin de no asustar a su nuevo amigo y apartarlo lejos. él salió con Brooke por muchos mesas antes del ataque del hombre lobo. Sabía como besaba. - Bien, supongo.- hizo una pausa.- Considerando que ella fue a la primera a la que besé... No tengo a nadie con quien comparar. Y esa fue la apertura por la que él estaba esperando. Una oportunidad para probar si Jimmy podía estar interesado en él. Incluso si no se la merecía después de tantos años de hacerle Bullying, necesitaba intentarlo. Ignorando la puñalada de celos que sintió al perder la oportunidad de ser el primer beso de Jimmy, agarró el brazo de Jimmy y lo sacó fuera del establecimiento. Había muchas otras \"primeras\" que él podría ser. Una vez que estaban seguros de miradas indiscretas, Jimmy habló- Bo, ¿Qué estas...?- Pero fue interrumpido por los labios de Bo, que eran presionados contra los suyos, envolviendo su cuello con sus brazos. Bo estaba aterrado por la idea de perder la oportunidad de tener una relación, amistad o cualquier otra cosa por el atrevimiento, por lo que sintió un gran alivio cuando Jimmy le correspondió el beso. Enredó sus dedos en el pelo de Bo, mientras sus lenguas exploraban la cavidad del otro. Y, para alguien al que solo habían besado una vez (sin contar la noche del incidente del hombre lobo), le pareció algo magnifico... Bo lo notó, y se acercó aun mas al cuerpo de Jimmy, presionándolo contra una pared. -Bo...- Dijo sin aliento cuando se separaron, buscando desesperadamente aire.- ...Wow... - Ya tienes una base para la comparación.- dijo, sonriendo. Bo pasó con suavidad un dedo por la marca que le dejó el hombre lobo a Jimmy, para luego besarla, y moverse lentamente hacia sus labios de nuevo.- Sabes- empezó Bo-. Me refiero a lo que pasó el otro día. No fue la maldición lo que me atrojo a tí, a menos que hayas sido un hombre lobo por mucho. Sus manos se deslizaron a las caderas de Jimmy, reteniendolo, y el mas joven no tuvo quejas.- Lo sé. Me lo imaginaba ya que seguiste a mi alrededor depues. - Jimmy... podría tener...¿una oportunidad? Para mostrarte que voy en serio.- Bo lo observaba atentamente, buscando repuestas en los ojos del otro. Cuando Jimmy asintió y se lanzó a por otro beso, sonrió.- Brooke aun no me cree. No cree que yo fuese un hombre lobo. -Yo tampoco lo creía, hasta que Zipper rompió la ventanilla de mi coche- le recordó, riendo. Jimmy bufó, llevando a su... ¿amigo? ¿Novio? De vuelta a la calle, sin saber donde diablos ir. Pero quería caminar de todos modos.- Pero tú me creíste. Y hubiese sido desmembrado de no ser por que estabas ahí. Bo sonrió, sorprendido de que la mano de Jimmy fuese fuertemente apretada contrla la suya.- Me alegro de haber estado ahí. Había esperado que este se sintiera incómodo, raro, como si no tuviera que estar haciendo esto, especialmente en público, donde cualquiera podía verlos. Pero, en realidad, alivió a Jimmy. Le costaba estar a gusto con Brooke (de quién estuvo flechado por años), pero con Bo era simplemente... normal. No tenía sentido, pero se sentía bien. - ¿Jimbo?- la voz del mayor lo sacó de sus pensamientos. Miró al chico de pelo negro como respuesta silenciosa al llamamiento.- ¿Estas de acuerdo con esto? Habían llegado al coche de Bo, y, en respuesta a la pegunta, empujó a Bo contra el vehículo, presionándolo en su lugar mientras unía sus labios de nuevo.- Sí, creo que sí. Los dedos de Bo se enroscaron en el cinturón de Jimmy, mateniéndolo en su lugar.- Bien. Pero, ya sabes, si no quieres, podemos volver a ser amigos. Solo quiero que sepas de lo que va a ir. Jimmy sonrió mientras cabeceaba.- Esperemos que no pase. ¿Quieres...ugh...ir a ver una película, o algo? La voz detrás de ellos rompió el momento antes de que Bo pudiera contestar. - ¡¿Jimmy?!- Brooke se quedó sin aliento, mirando a su novio el cual estaba muy apretado contra su ex-novio. -¿Bo? ¿Qué diablos está pasando? -Ugh... Brooke, hay algo que quiero decirte.- empezó Jimmy, apartándose de mala gana de los brazos de Bo para mirarla. Ella lo miró fijamente.- Si esto es por la tontería del hombre lobo otra vez, no quiero oírlo.- notó los ojos en blanco de Jimmy ante ese comentario.- ¡Quiero saber por que estabais besándoos en el aparcamiento! Bo dio un paso al frente- Mira, Brooke... -Brooke, creo que no deberíamos vernos mas. Yo... quiero estar con Bo.- para enfatizar ese punto, agarró la mano del mayor de nuevo.- Lo siento. - ¿Lo siento? Oh, genial. Mis dos ex-novios me dejan para estar juntos el uno con el otro. Eso sonará simplemente fantástico en el instituto.- Se fue pisoteando de mal humor, dejándolos a los dos solos. Jimmy se quedó mirándola.- Bueno, creo que fue casi tan bueno como era posible.- se subió al asiento de co-piloto para evitar conversaciones incómodas con alguien más que los hubiera visto. Bo se deslizó al asiento del conductor.- ¿Todavía estas de acuerdo con esto?- El otro chico asintió.- Te das cuenta de que toda la escuela sabrá de nosotros mañana ¿no? -No me molesta. ¿Estás tú de acuerdo con esto?- preguntó Jimmy, su mano reclamando la del otro.- Quiero decir, tu ya estas fuera, ¿pero estarás bien con que todo el mundo sepa que estamos juntos? -Sí- Bo asintió- Así que, ¿Te llevo a casa? Jimmy sacudió la cabeza.- Nah, quedémonos aquí.- él sonrió, y se inclinó para besar a Bo de nuevo. -Sin argumentos O me dais un pequeño rewiew, o mi buen amigo y vecino Jeff ira a vuestras casas y os hará hermosos (como no sepais quien es no entendereis mucho xD) Es mi primera obra como traductor, así que soy un principiante (piedad, no me comais).

The contest was never judged, so I don't know if I won or not with this. But I got tired of waiting, not to mention the site closed down, so I'm posting this here now. I apologize in advanced for any typos and for how astonishingly cliche this is. XP ... ... Title : On the Curb Outside Fandom : Cursed Pairing : Bo x Jimmy Cliché(s) : Caught in the Rain and Friends … … Bo sat on the curb of the road just outside of his house. Tears were pouring down his cheeks but no one could tell through the rain pouring down. The moving truck in the driveway to his left was a stark reminder of why everything would be ok. It was ok. He could cry and let it out and then he'd move on. It didn't matter that Jimmy…. He let out a short sob of a sound and pulled his black jacket closer around him. High school was over. Tomorrow, Bo was moving to Riverside to attend the University there. It had been the perfect time. Nothing was supposed to be able to go wrong. So why… After the werewolf incident, Bo and Jimmy had become good friends. Jimmy knew Bo's secret, Bo understood what Jimmy had been through on those nights after he'd been bitten almost a year ago. Brooke had dated Jimmy for the entire rest of the school year, but Jimmy had broken it off shortly after graduation. It was mutual and neither hated each other, but everyone was shocked at the break up. Bo had hung out with Jimmy all summer as they planned their lives out for the next four years. Jimmy was staying in L.A. and attending college there. Bo got a scholarship and was moving away. Bo had been hiding something from Jimmy though. He'd been crushing on Jimmy for two years before Jimmy was cursed by the mark of the beast and became a werewolf, before everyone else was affected by his change and thought he was attractive. That's why he picked on him, for god sake! The little boys in the sandbox that pick on girls they like: that was Bo , but with Jimmy! After Jimmy started dating Brooke, Bo had tried so hard to give up on him. Jimmy was straight and that was the end of things. But he couldn't. He tried and he failed. He liked Jimmy, might even love Jimmy now that he'd actually gotten to know the guy as a person and not just some body he'd love to top. He fantasized about Jimmy, dreamt about him most nights, wished and hoped they would end up together in the end. More than once he'd actually gotten down on his knees and prayed to God that Jimmy would feel the same, while simultaneously apologizing for asking for a great sin. Nothing changed. Jimmy and Bo were friends; best friends; the only true friends the other had. They knew secrets about each other that no one else knew. Bo had wanted to tell Jimmy about his feelings after Jimmy and Brooke broke up, but he was afraid. Jimmy was his best friend. He didn't want to lose that by telling Jimmy he liked him that way. He was terrified of being alone, of having no one who knew him for him, of losing Jimmy. He was selfish that way. But he was moving tomorrow so he'd thought 'It's now or never.' Jimmy had been busy all day at work, and Bo waited outside his house for hours just so he could catch him when he got home. He'd been so nervous that when Jimmy finally got home and said 'hello,' Bo had practically jumped out of his skin. Jimmy had invited him inside, but Bo had declined, saying he only had a minute and he just wanted to say something real quick. He should've just stayed home. Or kept his mouth shut. Or at least kept his mouth to himself. At least he'd been able to kiss Jimmy this time. His lips had touched Jimmy's for the briefest of moments and it sent flares of joy through Bo's very soul. Then Jimmy had shoved him away, angry. \" What are you doing? \" he'd demanded. \"I'm in love with you!\" Bo had practically shouted. Several moments passed with only them breathing and then Jimmy spoke: his tone was low and dangerous, the likes of which Bo hadn't heard even when Jimmy was a werewolf. \"This is a joke.\" \"No. Jimmy, I-\" \"Get lost,\" Jimmy had ordered brokenly and yet bitterly. \"I don't appreciate it, Bo. Go away.\" Bo had listened. He tried walking away, keeping his pride at least a bit intact, but he couldn't keep it up and within four steps he was running flat out from Jimmy's house to his own. It had started to rain on the way and by the time he reached his house it was pouring, blocking out the moonlight and the stars and all hope. Bo hadn't gone inside. The rain was like a message: empathy. The world was crying with him and Bo wanted to wallow in it right now. Which was why he was sitting outside his house on the curb of the street crying in the rain at some time past ten at night. He'd ruined everything! \"Oh god,\" he sobbed out, laying his elbows on his knees, bending over to hide his face, covering his eyes with his hands. \"I thought…\" Jimmy hadn't reacted that badly the first time Bo tried to kiss him, when Bo had first told him he was gay. He'd thought Jimmy would reject him kindly, gently, like he did everything else. He could've handled that. This harsh refusal hurt…. it hurt so much ! Bo moved his hands from his eyes to run them through his sopping wet hair and held on there. He wished…..that he had never gone to Jimmy's house that night after the wrestling tryouts, never confessed who and what he was. Maybe then he wouldn't have fallen so hard. Maybe then this wouldn't hurt so much. He barely heard the splash of the footstep over the drone of the rain. Then he saw, from the corner of his eyes, as someone sat down on the curb next to him. He didn't have to ask. He recognized Jimmy's dark brown hoodie anywhere, even when it was covering most of Jimmy's head. Bo took a deep breath and sat up straighter, and tried desperately to stop his tears. It didn't matter much anyhow with the rain. \"Bo,\" Jimmy began, and it sounded like a murmur through the rain. He spoke louder the next time. \"I'm sorry, Bo.\" Bo shook his head, running his hands along his upper legs and making sure to look anywhere but at Jimmy. \"It's fine,\" he assured him. \"It's not like I really expected you to-\" \" Do you really love me? \" Jimmy interrupted loudly. Bo looked at him then. He had his elbows on his knees much like Bo had earlier, with his hands clasped in the middle. He wasn't bent over much but his head was down and Jimmy was staring intently at his own hands. With a nod, Bo said, \"Yes.\" Jimmy clenched his hands together. \"I'm really sorry,\" he repeated. \"When you showed up at my house and kissed me and said that….I thought you were playing some sort of sick joke on me because you're leaving tomorrow and wouldn't have to deal with it later.\" Bo shook his head, still watching Jimmy curiously. \"I wouldn't do that, Jimbo. You're my best friend.\" \"Your best friends are your worst bullies,\" Jimmy actually did murmur, but the rain was beginning to let up so Bo managed to catch it. Jimmy sighed; a deep breath in and a heavy breath out. \"Then again…\" He stopped. \"Why did you tell me now?\" Looking at his left knee, away from Jimmy, Bo shrugged. \"I'm moving tomorrow. To Riverside. I figured…if you rejected me now…at least I was leaving and it wouldn't….wouldn't matter,\" he struggled out, finding warmth running down his cheeks again and his voice cracking. He wiped his eyes harshly. \"I uh…ahem,\" he cleared his throat, \"I liked you before you were cursed…just so you know.\" Jimmy looked at him, confusion lacing his features in a raised eyebrow and a crooked mouth. Bo cleared his throat again. \"It's just….You think no one likes you. You said so once. You hate your own body. You wanted to be a werewolf again because it made you feel attractive, brave, and strong…..But I've liked you since sophomore year, and you managed to make it through high school as both the biggest loser and the most popular guy in school…..So….You're better….than you think.\" He couldn't look at Jimmy's face anymore. His cheeks were burning but thankfully it was so dark out he could barely see Jimmy, let alone the color of Jimmy's cheeks, so Jimmy probably couldn't see his. Several moments passed with only the rain for noise. Bo couldn't keep himself from remembering how harshly Jimmy had sent him away and tears kept leaping to his eyes unbidden. Then there was a weight on his shoulder. Bo turned his head to the right, his eyes widening when he saw Jimmy leaning his arm against Bo's arm and his head on Bo's right shoulder. The hood was gone from his head as well, revealing curly hair that had been darkened and straightened by the rain. \"I got angry because…I-I-I thought you were making fun of me,\" Jimmy said nervously. \"I thought you had found me out and just wanted one last laugh before you left…It was stupid of me. Worse than stupid.\" \"Jimbo?\" Bo asked, not sure if he was hearing this right. Jimmy took a deep breath. \"It takes one to know one, right?\" he asked rhetorically. Bo felt hope flare in his chest. \"It just took me longer than most to notice it in myself: The truth.\" \"The truth?\" Bo asked, barely noticing that the rain was down to a heavy drizzle. \"That I….I think I love you…too….,\" Jimmy admitted, shifting uncomfortably against Bo's side. Bo just stared at the top of Jimmy's head for several seconds in stunned silence and then….then he started to laugh. It rumbled through his body unhindered and Bo had no desire to stop it. Jimmy sat up straight and half glared at Bo. \"What?\" he asked heatedly. Bo shook his head and covered his mouth with one hand. \"Nothing…I just….You really like me back?\" Jimmy nodded determinedly. \"Since when?\" Jimmy squirmed where he sat. \"Shortly after….the wrestling championships.\" Thinking back, Bo counted in his head. \"Five months?\" he asked incredulously. Before Jimmy could say anything, Bo let his head drop down like he'd been before Jimmy showed up. \"Why didn't you tell me?\" He sounded a bit broken even to his own ears. \"We could've had five months.\" \"What do you mean?\" Bo lifted his head and stared Jimmy in the eyes. \"I'm moving to Riverside tomorrow, Jimmy.\" Jimmy's eyes narrowed a bit and he looked away at the other side of the street, watching the water running down the slight incline of the road in rivers. \"People have had longer distance relationships that work out,\" he said at length. \"You serious?\" Bo asked, barely allowing himself to hope. Jimmy nodded. \"Riverside is only a little over two hours away in bad traffic,\" he explained. He looked back at Bo. \"We could do it, if you're willing to try,\" he ended with a hopeful tone. Bo lifted his left hand, reached over, and placed it on Jimmy's cheek. He rubbed his thumb over Jimmy's jaw like he was prepared to memorize every feature, and then he slowly moved closer, watching Jimmy's reaction. Jimmy didn't stop him, so Bo moved in the last inch or so and captured the younger man's lips with his own in a semi-chaste, heartfelt kiss and Jimmy kissed him back. Pulling away, Bo looked from Jimmy's lips to his eyes and licked his own lips. A smile spread across his entire face. \"I was willing when you were a beast,\" he half-joked. \"I'm definitely willing now that we're the same species.\" Jimmy's eyes widened and he lightly punched Bo in the arm, making them both laugh as the rain gently came to a stop, leaving them both soaked through but happy. \"Jerk.\" Bo kept the smile on his face as he leaned in for a second kiss, and a third, and a fourth: all simple but with a lot of emotion behind them. Life was getting better, Bo thought. So Bo sat on the curb of the road just outside of his house. The younger man with curly brown hair to his right was a beautiful reminder of why everything would be ok. ... ... Fin. ... ... Thank you so much for reading!

The alarm had gone off at the right time, of course, but having tossed and turned most of the night it didn't really sink in that the alarm was for, you know, him. He just assumed that any alarm going off at what was (judging by the depth of his grogginess and the lethargic wonderfulness of his bed) clearly not a reasonable time, was obviously not an alarm meant for him. He is now coming to understand that he was wrong. Not fully understanding, of course, he's still trying to fully comprehend what 'seven-thirty' actually means, and how it's supposed to relate to him, and school, and whatever time it is that school is supposed to start. Is it even a school day? Apparently. And it's seven-thirty; school starts at eight, and he has to walk. Because, because? Because there was the thing with the teeth and fur and claws and it left the car (and him) in a state his Dad considered reason to confiscate his keys. Ah. Which gives him - half an hour? - to walk to school. Ah. (In the time it takes him to relate 'seven-thirty' and 'eight' into meaningful quantities, remember subtraction, and apply it, he has to go back to first principles three times and squint fuzzily at the ever-changing clock readout twice. He's not that good at mornings.) He lies sprawled over his bed, duvet half on the floor, and is one with the mattress. He really could do without today. But it's no good - he shifts and feels the urge to stretch, and once his back clicks in that interesting way it does he'll never fully go back to sleep. So he lazily shifts his weight to the right, misjudges the relationship between center of balance and edge of mattress, flails slightly, and falls out of bed. The flailing brought the duvet with him, and for a moment, trapped in a cushion-y ball of duvet, he puts his forehead to the cold wood floor and groans. He really could do without today. But seconds pass inexorably on, marked by the ticking of his rather insolent clock, and illustrated by the dust balls dancing about under his bed, ghosting along on air currents from the fan above. Some of them try to go up his nose, but since it's smushed uncomfortably into the floor, none are successful. Seconds pass by and his mind is steadily cleared of woolliness by the cold floor, squished nose and dull ache in his knee from when he fell. His thoughts are not happy ones. Because today he has to go to school. And it's the first time he's gone to school since the, err, crazy business with the dog and the snapping teeth and Jimmy and the huge bloody great monster that tried to kill him. But that's not really the issue here. Because it's also the first time he's gone to school since he came out to Jimmy. The more he thinks about it, the more adrenaline floods his body and makes him want to run, hide, or punch somebody - anything but go to school today and act normal. He hasn't told anyone else. He's fairly sure that Jimmy won't tell anyone. Not that Jimmy doesn't have incentive to, but Jimmy's Jimmy, and Bo already bribed him with Brooke for god's sake, so that should be enough to make Jimmy forget any urge for revenge. It's not that he absolutely positively doesn't want people to know, just that he would appreciate knowing who knew. He felt remarkably good about telling Jimmy. It was a little anticlimactic, to be sure, and completely eclipsed by the following weirdness, but it was the right time and the right person (aborted kiss aside), and he's finally told someone. Part of him wishes he hadn't. It's not a terribly big part. But for years now he's been carefully ignoring the suspicions in his own mind: carefully avoiding noticing some things, and carefully fixating on others. It's a relief to give up that turmoil and admit it to himself, but he can't stand that someone else might be thinking of him as gay. He's not gay - he just likes men. He's exactly who he was before, he's not less manly, or less alpha or less normal. No, he's Bo. And knowing that it's the sinewy scrawniness of his fellow guys that arouses him rather than the soft slimness of the girls doesn't make him gay. He doesn't have a problem with being gay, honestly. He doesn't have a problem with gay people. He just never foresaw being one of them. And it means something different, being gay, rather than liking men. He'll admit he likes men. And he'll admit that that makes him gay. But the term 'gay' means far more than 'liking men' in high school, and he's not ready to be that. He's not a fringe group, or a minority. He doesn't need the simpering Gay/Straight Alliance crowd with their overdeveloped sense of discrimination and human rights and the need to love everybody in some weird hippy-ish way. No. He's king of his school, and he won't give that up just because he dreams of cock and not fanny. So he'd appreciate knowing who knows. When he knows who knows he can make damn sure to set them straight. If they think he'll soften just because he's started being honest with himself they've got another think coming. He can pin any one of them to the mat, and he won't hesitate to do it. It would, perhaps, be easier just to tell everybody. Then he could set them all straight. Except that, while the urge to defend himself makes him itch to fight people, the idea of everybody knowing just makes him cringe. He's Bo. And he likes men. And there's nothing shameful about that. Really. But he can't fight the knowledge that some will think that it is, and most will think him a stupid Neanderthal for the basic psychology that made him the hypocritical homophobe before. And he can't fight the knowledge that everyone will treat him differently, whether they have issues with gay people or not. Besides, while he knows, knows , there is nothing shameful in it, he can't help feeling less because of it. He's a disappointment now, and while heterosexuality was never really his to begin with, he's lost even the possibility of it and all of its comforting trappings now that he's admitted that it was a façade. He can't, he just can't, let other people see him shameful too. People might be nice, but then again, they might not, and those that are nice will mostly be nice out of pity, and he will not abide pity from those that used to envy him. So all in all, he'd prefer that people not know. Which is a problem. Because he can't pretend that nothing's changed. Pandora's Box has been opened, and nothing will shove the knowledge back in. How is he supposed to go on avoiding noticing the all-consuming things (the line of Jimmy's back, the lightly-haired length of his forearm, the precise timbre of his voice), and pretend to notice the others (breasts, hips, legs, the usual) at the same time? How is he supposed to ignore the way his body reacts to certain stimuli when his mind, newly-confessed, is busy trying to catalogue and explore it? How, when confronted by Brooke and her crowd, is he meant to imply enough disinterest to make it clear that he broke up with her , but enough lust to be a teenage boy who likes girls? And god oh god, what the hell is he going to do about Jimmy? He can tell the guys to ignore him, he supposes, but considering how Jimmy threw him through the air the other day, and considering Brooke, that's pretty much not gonna happen. He could tacitly include Jimmy in the in-crowd, of course, but Jimmy's gone all alpha dog now, and when Bo's around him he feels utterly omega. The guys are his, or were, but he can't lead them as an omega, so how does that all come out in the wash? So he doesn't know what he's doing. He's pretty much gonna have to wing it. Maybe if he milks his injuries he'll get some space. He can claim any odd moments on the painkillers, pretend to focus on school work, avoid the spotlight a little. He reckons Jimmy'll be helping him out there, coz Jimmy's gonna be getting some serious attention from all the groups. Gay/Straight Alliance'll probably even be disappointed by the whole Brooke angle. Serve them right, the self-righteous windbags. Just a little space, that's all he needs; a day or two, just enough that he can figure out his new mask. Figure out how to seem straight when you know you like guys, instead of just suspecting it. Okay, so he has a game plan: walk in, act the same, keep head down when possible. Jimmy's less of a fairy than he thought - anyone who can throw him of all people is at least better than Carl, that dolt, so the guys can at least leave him at 'invisible no-nothing' level even if they actively won't have him in their group. The break-up with Brooke is reasonably easy to explain. She was being a prude and a cock tease, and he can do better, so he dumped her. She ran straight to Jimmy, who, as a (still slightly effeminate) softie is all very perfect to play Prince Charming. He feels a little bad about Brooke, she was a good girlfriend, but he'll get over it. He's not exactly gonna be saying it to her face, anyway, and all the girls will be taken with her new lapdog, and at least the guys won't think she's a slut. So yes, everything's sorted. Now all he has to do is actually do it all. Starting with getting up off the floor. Which is far more difficult than it should be. After finally (finally!) untangling himself from the duvet and bed, he stumbles towards the bathroom, balance shot to hell, and narrowly avoids tripping over those piles of papers and clothes on the floor that he isn't able to just walk all over. The bathroom comes as a nasty shock (there's a clock in there), and he ends up brushing his teeth and pissing but eschewing the shower. He's fully awake now, and a tad rushed, so he returns to his bedroom at a run and stubs his toe on the chemistry textbook that failed to trip him up the first time. His watch goes on first, and he grimaces at the time, and the underpants and jeans and t-shirt swiftly follow. He hops around putting on socks, locates his iPod, and exits the room in a flying leap that clears the floor-level debris. He's halfway thumping down the stairs when he remembers that the debris included the offending chemistry textbook, so he thunders back along the upstairs hallway to his room, grabs the book, and is soon thundering down the last of the stairs. His parents have already left for work, but his mother left some bagels and muffins out, and he knows there's milk and cereal with his name on it. There's no time though - he's gonna have to run anyway - so after a longing glance at the kitchen he goes to locate his shoes and backpack. He's grateful to see that both are exactly where he left them - school bag slumped near the bottom of the stairs, innards trailing like intestines; one shoe to the left of the front door mat, the other ten feet back down the hall, half under the radiator. His parents have been busy recently, which explains why they've actually managed to abide by their own rules (\"If you won't pick them up right now then I'm certainly not clearing up after you\") for once, rather than cracking and cleaning them up anyway (\"because the house is a right state and I don't want to have to keep tripping over your blasted shoes!\"). It's stupid, anyway. Yeah, sure, it's clutter, he can see that, but the reason he shed them there was because it's, you know, the front door, which is exactly the place he'll be looking for them when he next needs them, so why not just leave them there? (The shoe under the radiator is an anomaly. Normally, when he throws the second shoe off, it only travels a foot or so. He'd been rather impressed by last night's trajectory.) And he's out the door, slinging on his backpack as he goes. He reaches the end of the front path in one second flat and breaks into a fast jog as he turns onto the street, thinking lovingly of his (dammit) garage-bound car. The sidewalk is hard, he's running on adrenaline, and his body really hasn't had as much time to wake up as his mind. His feet hit the sidewalk hard each time, a jarring thud rather than a satisfying thump. His backpack is awkward when he runs, and he's just remembered that he has a French test today. Well, it's the least of his problems. He can't even remember if he actually put the damn chemistry textbook in the bag in the end, or if he left it on the bottom stair while he was putting on his shoes. It doesn't really matter, but it's one more thing to be stressed about. Why couldn't it be a holiday today, or the school plumbing break, or something? All of this is really not helping. He's nervous, and he's trying not to be. He's hungry, and the empty stomach and jogging makes the slightly queasy feeling worse. He's suddenly absolutely adamant that he cannot and will not see Jimmy; please God, no Jimmy today. But they have three classes together so that's a false prayer. Failing that, he prays that Jimmy is looking as bad as he is, or worse. That's not such an impossible prayer, is it? The guy's just recovering from the whole rabid-things-with-jaws affair, same as him - surely it must have been worse for Jimmy, who was in the thick of it? Except that Jimmy's all alpha at the moment; all confident, and capable, and extra-strong, and probably extra-resilient too. Jimmy's probably still glowing from the way things turned out with Brooke, as well. God, the two of them all over each other... and even if Jimmy does look bad, he'll just be all tousled and warm and begging to be touched. Shit. The game plan is totally not gonna work. Shit, shit, shit. He briefly considers turning straight back around again, but he's too confused to think of a good excuse for being late and too confused to think of where to go, and really too confused to make any decision at all at the moment. So he follows his feet. There's a fair amount of traffic, but he's not run over, which can only be a good thing. He's so relieved to see the school buildings (in conjunction with the time '7:53' on his watch) that he almost forgets to stop jogging. Some idiot girl trailing friends behind her with a loud recount of gossip gets in his way though, so that's okay. He pats down his hair and wipes away sweat from his face as he joins the trudging crowd entering the building. His heart's still pumping like mad, but he's in good shape and he's not breathing too heavily. His heartbeat doesn't slow though. He can hear it in his head, feel it in his fingers and in his empty, fluttering belly. He clenches his fingers and tries to ignore the wafting smells of breakfast that other students brought with them. The food smells make his stomach rumble, but the overpowering scent of coffee just makes him want to vomit. He's grateful that he hasn't seen any close friends yet, anybody who might try to strike up a conversation, because he can't think what he would say. His mouth is dry and he feels a little shell-shocked, and he can't stop the odd shiver that keeps wanting to break out all over. The corridors are a little bit too crowded, a little bit too noisy, a little bit too hectic. He's probably hunched over and looking mousy, and he hopes to god that that little movement he made when that guy came up from behind him wasn't a flinch. That he jumps three feet in the air whenever anyone shouts unexpectedly near him is beyond denial. And they do it a lot - people are only just starting to head to class. He can't believe that despite all the worries and fears and \"oh God what am I going to do about\"s that he's been torturing himself with for the past 24 hours that he forgot the most basic problem. He's fucking terrified. This isn't him. He's not terrified, he's bravado and swagger and backed up by twenty guys. But it is him. He's terrified and he doesn't know how to deal with it. He told someone. He told someone! What in the hell was he thinking? He said the unthinkable out loud and it doesn't matter if Jimmy wouldn't tell anyone because it's like emails and cyberspace - he's said the words out loud, he's said them to somebody, and now the truth is out in the world he can never control it, never get it back, irretrievable. They'll know, they'll all know. They probably already know. Maybe they knew before, but the same magic words that made it real for him has made it real for them as well. He feels like a dragon bereft of treasure - his hated, uncomfortable, sharp, metallic secret is out in the world and it's his secret, god-dammit, but now it's being used against him. He feels tiny, notices each and every person taller or wider or heavier than him like never before. Even those smaller than him are dangerous, less likely to be able to look over him, forced to look at him, forced to see the gay boy walking. He's shameful and he's scared and this is so not fair and you know what? Screw that. He's gonna be okay. He's Bo, god-dammit. He may be a little omega-ish when Jimmy's around, but to be fair, Jimmy has the whole jaws-of-hell thing going for him, and besides, he's a little bit hot. But the rest of the school? What, he's gonna cower from Meghan Farley, the fat girl from French? Because she's bigger than him? Screw that. He feels bare and abraded and exposed for all to see, but he's still Bo, god-dammit, and he's still better than anyone in this damn corridor. They can get out of his way, because he could pin any one of them to the mat without breaking a sweat. And yeah, so what that he's wearing his deepest, darkest, shameful secret for all to see? He may be a damn fai... - he shrinks from the word - a damn gay guy, but he's still worth ten of them. He's walking straighter and his heart beat has returned to normal, but he's still tense as ever. He's ready to fight, not cower. It doesn't solve the dryness in his mouth, but he can get over that. He's exactly who he was before, king of the school, no less manly and no less an alpha. And as long as he keeps telling himself that, he'll be cool. But, oh, the school is definitely not what it was before. The people may be beneath him but the walls are closer. Everything's a bit noisier and a bit more colourful. He can almost see the invisible bubble all around him. It marks him out, shows him worthy of mockery, stops him from melting into the crowd, but won't stop anything bad from shooting him through the heart. He's feeling just a bit too sensitive, and he may have his swagger and his bravado back, but it's only on the surface. He's coasting over the school, pretending, and he doesn't own the corridor the way he used to. His initial reaction to reaching his classroom is one of sheer unadulterated panic. He can feel his heart jump. The corridor may be too loud, but the classroom will be too quiet. From the claustrophobic bustling (but at least anonymity and freedom) of the crowd, to the claustrophobic quiet of a small room filled by people he sees every day, trapped. Oh dear. But he's Bo. So he strolls through the doorway regardless, without hesitation, wanders to his desk, and plonks himself down with oddly shambolic aplomb. The people already sitting around don't immediately point and laugh, they don't even really notice him, except for a few that greet him like normal. So far, so good. He really should have gone to his locker, but his friends would have been hanging around there, so he didn't. He doesn't mind carrying the extra weight; he can go switch things after class. That is, if he isn't a human piñata by that point, of course. He looks up at the clock. Okay. Six hours. He can do this. The first day of his homosexual life. He grimaces. Yeah, another term he's not gonna hurry to use in self-reference any time soon. A few stragglers scurry into the classroom. Dave and Mike start a paper war, throwing balls of paper into the trash can by the door to see who can get it in the most. One bounces off Katie as she walks through the door unexpectedly. The resulting laughter and apologies go a little way towards reassuring him. Because this is every morning, and why should sexual orientation effect how he deals with these guys he's grown up with? He sees them every morning, rain or shine, when they're well or coming down with something and when they haven't slept all night. He knows these people, he has a place here. And this business really shouldn't change all that. Except, of course, it does. He's on the other side of the divide now. And when Mary storms in muttering about how everything is going wrong for her at the moment and how everything's \"so gay\" he can't help but flinch. He'll repress that instinct better, next time. Jimmy wanders slowly past in the corridor, hampered by the corridor crush. He looks... normal. Less confident the last time Bo saw him, less alpha; a little nervous, even. Maybe he's having as much trouble returning to normal in his different-from-before state as Bo is. That's not really a good thing, but Bo appreciates the similarity, even if what Jimmy's going through isn't even in the same galaxy as this horrible nakedness that Bo's got going on. Jimmy has so much power over Bo, and, in that horrible residual alpha-ness, it doesn't even feel wrong that he should. Just, you know, terrifying. Jimmy notices Bo, of course, and for an exceedingly awkward moment they look at each other. Bo is tempted to look away, but the problem is, he told Jimmy, and now Jimmy holds his secret. The wolf-thing doesn't even count as a reciprocal secret, not that anyone would believe him if it was. Now he's bound to Jimmy (as though attraction wasn't enough...), and Jimmy is bound to him. He freed himself from denial, when he tried to kiss Jimmy, but he also tied himself to Jimmy. Jimmy knows his secret, Jimmy knows Bo likes him, and even decades from now, Jimmy will be the first guy he fell for, the first guy he told, the first guy he tried to kiss. He'll never be free of him (not that he wants to be, most of the time), but right now, Jimmy looking at him and him looking at Jimmy and - please oh please let no one be noticing - he thinks that he almost preferred the shackles of before. He was tied by denial and self-loathing before, and that was bad, but at least in company he was a little more free. He wasn't free to look or act or speak honestly, because he was desperately not thinking about what that honesty might be, but his façade was an ingrained part of him. He could live through it. As long as no one, not even he, truly knew it was a façade, it was real enough. His secret was safe, and he was free. Now he's tied. Oh, he's freed from a little of the fear and most of the denial, but he's still not free to look or act or speak honestly. If he did, everyone would treat him differently (at best), and he's definitely not ready for that. His façade has been ripped away, and he's desperately trying to hold the strands together so that no one will see. It's not part of him any more. It's an ancient relic he's saddled with, and it doesn't fit him right. The distance between him and the Bo the world sees is greater, so he notices the restrictions more. He can't live through it; he can only live up to it. Besides, his secret is out. Jimmy may not tell anyone, and maybe no one will guess, but eventually the truth will out, like a knife hanging over his head, ready to drop at any time without warning. He's tied to Jimmy by the truth, and to Brooke, because she's not stupid, and there's a suspicion of truth there too. What good is accepting the truth if he has to pretend exactly as before? What good has it done him but to make him more aware of his shackles, different though they are? But Jimmy smiles - a small, hesitant, hopeful smile, and maybe that's okay. He's not really free, but some of the chains are ones he'll gladly bear. A small shock thrills through him, because Jimmy's never smiled at him like that before, and it looks good on him. Even better, it's directed at Bo, just at Bo, just for Bo. And Bo's skin feels terribly terribly thin, as though it's not really there, as Jimmy passes on down the corridor. He feels flayed alive, and the frisson of desire and the frisson of fear are one and the same in the aftermath of Jimmy's smile. He hates Jimmy again, for just a second, for having this power over him, but he can't deny that he delights in it too. He's nervous, and he's scared, and he'll never really be free, but maybe the delicious feeling that comes from Jimmy being happy to see him will make it worth it in the end. The teacher comes in and the corridor begins to empty as the bell rings. The class starts. It turns out that he did leave his chemistry textbook at home, but that's cool, he can share. He's still shaky, and he's sure that he's probably a good deal paler than he should be, but what the hell, maybe it suits him. His skin still feels over-sensitive, and he jumps when the teacher calls on him, but then, he wasn't really paying attention so he would have jumped anyway. He's Bo, and sometimes Jimmy smiles at him. He's got a gang of friends, he's got wrestling, and he's certainly not the thickest guy in class. He flatters himself that he's good-looking, he's in good shape, and his favourite show is on TV tonight. He's Bo, and sometimes Jimmy smiles at him - he'll be okay. ","Summary":" Bo wakes up late. The alarm had gone off at the right time, of course, but having tossed and turned"},{"Movie":"Cursed","Title":"Hunted","Author":"spoodle monkey","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6081319","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: Nope, don't own A/N- so, this is a X-Over! And if you can't figure out the x-over then...well, then I'm worried...Slash. Bo's walking down the street next to Jimmy, letting his friend rattle on about Brook, and not really paying attention to what he is saying when he spots them. It's really just a passing thought as they cross the street towards the comic book store; Bo spots these two hot guys leaning against a really sweet car and takes a moment to glance them over before turning back to Jimmy. They're hot but not really his type. He's much more into the nerdy, werewolf type. So he dismisses them without another thought and holds the door open for Jimmy. He's not that into comics, but Jimmy's like, obsessed with the things so he's totally okay with Jimmy dragging him to the store twice a week; he takes the time to Jimmy watch while there. DI He's walking down the front steps of their school the next time he sees them. He's already agreed to meet Jimmy (and Brook) out front and knows they'll see him when they exit the school, so he's just looking over the cars lining the street for lack of anything better to do. There's a black car parked half way down the block, an old classic. Looks like an impala- his dad used to have one, used to talk to Bo about it, back when they were on speaking terms. There's something about this car though, in fact he's pretty sure he's seen it before. It's possible though, it's not like LA is this impossibly huge place. He's still watching when two guys cross the street from somewhere unseen and climb into the car. Oh- it clicks where he knows the car from; it's the hot guys from the day before. He shrugs off the coincidence though and just decides to admire the car. He's not really paying attention a few minutes later when Meyers (his ex-friend who also happened to captain the football team) slams into his side as he's walking past. Bo's books go flying but he manages to remain standing only from years of wrestling training. His shoulder is going to bruise though he realizes as he grimaces and crouches down to pick up his books. There's no point to getting angry though, Meyers is surrounded by the football team and Bo doesn't even have the wrestling team watching his back anymore. He just has Jimmy and Brook; werewolf in training and prom queen, his odds aren't great. \"He's such an asshole.\" Quick hands beat him to the punch, helping to gather up his books. Together they stand and Bo tries to take his books back but Jimmy holds them out of reach, instead tugging up the sleeve of his t-shirt with his free hand to inspect his shoulder. \"It's nothing.\" Bo tells him, suddenly self-conscious as Jimmy's fingers trail over the sore area. \"I've had worse.\" It's not a lie; he's had much worse with the wrestling team, with his dad. It's just embarrassing. Jimmy snorts, but lowers his sleeve again and grudgingly hands him his chemistry and math books back. \"Where's Brook?\" Bo asks as his friend turns to lead them down the stairs. He falls into step next to the smaller teenager (not quite as small, Jimmy's grown, god has he grown. Put on a few inches, almost able to look Bo in the eye, lanky but with a strength in him, not that Bo has noticed. ) \"Uh,\" Jimmy glances to the side, almost guiltily. \"She's not coming, she had some homework to do.\" It's weird because he'd talked to Brook at lunch and all she'd been able to talk about was the movie they're about to see. \"So it's just you and me then, huh?\" He tries to not let it show just how pleased he is with the outcome but he's fairly sure he's failing; a wide smile breaks across his face. Jimmy grins back at him and Bo has to be imagining the slight red colouring the back of his neck. When he looks down the street the car is gone. DI Bo's humming lightly to himself and jogging down the side of the road when he comes upon Jimmy's house. Completely by accident of course, he just happened to feel like jogging an extra half an hour that morning and the route had just happened to take him right to Jimmy's house. Finding out from Brook the previous night that she and Jimmy had broken up (a mutual agreement apparently; she wouldn't tell him why though) had absolutely nothing to do with it. So he's slightly out of breath, sweating under the hot mid morning sun and decides it's a good time to stop and bug Jimmy for a glass of water or something. His friend should be up and watching cartoons by now anyways. Bo quirks an eyebrow at the black 67' Chevy Impala parked at the curb, knowing he's seen one recently, but deciding it probably isn't the same one and rings the doorbell. Ellie answers the door, already dressed and looking ready to take on the world, but she smiles and lets him in even if she does crinkle her nose at the sweat that's still dripping off of him (he offers an apology but she just shrugs it off and tells him he can shower if he wants and that he knows where the towels are). He walks back to the kitchen where he's surprised to find Jimmy isn't alone. The two guys in suits glance up as he walks in and for a moment he tries to figure out if this is some sort of weird joke. It's the two hot guys that he keeps seeing everywhere, except this time, instead of leather jackets and jeans they're dressed up in suits. \"Hey Bo!\" Jimmy waves from his chair and offers him a wide smile. One of the guys, with short brown hair, watches Jimmy watch Bo. It has the hairs on the back of his neck standing up. \"Hey Jimbo.\" Bo slips by the two guys, wary but hiding it and places himself next to Jimmy, leaning on the back of his chair. Yeah, one could call it looming or something but he's not moving until he finds out what the guys are doing at his best friends house. \"What's going on?\" \"I'm Agent Young,\" The suit with short hair speaks up pulling out some credentials that look real enough. \"And this is Agent Scott.\" He gestures to the guy sitting next to him, with longer brown hair, lanky form folded into the chair in Ellie's kitchen. There's something about the names that doesn't sit right with him, like he's heard them before. \"We're with the FBI, just looking into some murders in the area.\" Agent Scott speaks up in a sympathetic tone that's so good it must be practiced. Bo's not really sure what any murders have to do with Jimmy or Ellie and something is really not right here. \"Right.\" Bo pastes on his best smile and glances over at Jimmy only to freeze slightly. Jimmy's eyes are flickering to an eerie golden colour. Shit , this close to the full moon Jimmy has even less control than normal and Bo standing next to him, sweaty and giving off who knows what is totally not helping. \"Um, actually- Ellie needs help upstairs finding her glasses , cause she can't see without them.\" He stares at Jimmy, crossing his fingers that his friend gets the message. It works- Jimmy looks confused, then startled and then backs out of the room with a hasty excuse leaving Bo alone with the two Agents and wondering how he can get rid of them. \"I think we have everything we need for now.\" Agent Young stands, sharing a significant look with his partner that Bo doesn't miss. \"We'll be in touch if we have anymore questions.\" Agent Scott reaches out and shakes his hand. Bo can feel the calluses that come from years of handling guns (his father always said they made the man). \"Right.\" Bo says dryly and follows them to the door, closing it and locking it as soon as they're though. He watches from the living room window as they talk for a moment over the hood of the car, arguing and he wishes he knew what they were saying. Then they climb into the car and with a roar pull off down the street and out of sight. \"Bo?\" He jumps, not expecting (but probably should have been) Jimmy to appear in the doorway. His eyes are under control now, the gold dimmed until it's barely noticeable. He can hope like hell that the two guys didn't see the gold but he has a sinking feeling that they saw it. Bo lets out the breath he hadn't known he was holding and shrugs and grins. \"What is it?\" Jimmy asks, crossing to him and glancing out the window. He could reach out right now, pull Jimmy close and kiss him and this close to the moon the wolf would be screwing with Jimmy's head, would make him kiss back. Bo closes his eyes, shakes his head- shakes the thought out of his head- and opens them again. \"That's the third time I've seen those guys.\" He spots Ellie standing in the doorway but she hangs back. \"What do you mean?\" Jimmy's eyes narrow and he doesn't seem to realize that he's standing toe to toe with Bo, that they're practically breathing each other's air. \"I saw them at the comic store on Wednesday and outside the school on Thursday.\" He has a sinking feeling that they've been watching Jimmy . \"Are you sure?\" Ellie demands sharply, stepping into the room fully. \"A 1967 Chevy Impala isn't exactly discrete.\" Bo's joke falls flat as it becomes clear that the siblings aren't quite sure what he's talking about. \"I'm sure.\" He says instead. Ellie and Jimmy exchange a look. Bo has a vague idea of what this could mean, they'd all thought they were home free after Jake- even if the curse wasn't lifted. \"Are we sure they're not just here to investigate the murders?\" Jimmy asks, sounding hopeful but not really believing it himself. \"They're not FBI.\" Bo says; at least not any FBI he's ever seen. Jimmy's shoulders slump a little and he suddenly looks tired. \"What are the chances that they'll just…leave?\" DI Bo skips English class and makes Jimmy skip history so they can go to the library and search the net. Of course, they're not really sure what they're looking for so they spend the first ten minutes arguing quietly in the back of the room while gaining curious looks from other students. Finally Bo gives in and Jimmy types in a bunch of random keywords (because he is much, much better at this than he is) and spends the next twenty minutes scrolling through pages. When Jimmy starts rolling his shoulders, Bo reaches out and begins to knead the tense areas with one hand. The other teenager all but purrs and leans into the touch, hands never stilling on the keyboard. Bo's mouth goes dry and he tries to focus on the screen in front of them. \"Got something.\" Jimmy whispers, opening a page. One of his hands falls away from the keyboard to land just above Bo's knee. The heat is like a shock to his system and his hand stutters where it's still rubbing at the nape of Jimmy's neck. \"What is it?\" He hates how his voice cracks as he asks and Jimmy takes a moment to shoot him an amused smirk, his hand squeezing lightly before turning most of his attention back to the computer. \"Hunters.\" Jimmy frowns. \"People who run around hunting the supernatural.\" Which includes Jimmy . \"Are you sure?\" Bo asks sliding forwards to get a better look but careful not to dislodge Jimmy's hand. Jimmy nods. \"Pretty sure.\" Bo stands suddenly and then pulls Jimmy to his feet ignoring his startled expression. They're out of the library in an instant and down the hall, a teacher yelling after them to walk and to get to class. The sun temporarily blinds him as they exit the school and in those breathless seconds he's terrified that the two guys are going to show up and take Jimmy away from him. Then his sight clears and he can see that the car is nowhere in sight. \"Where are we going?\" Jimmy asks breathlessly as Bo all but drags him to his car. He deposits Jimmy in the passenger seat and then gets in the drivers side quickly, peeling out of the parking lot. \"I'm taking you home.\" \"What? Why?\" Jimmy demands, scrambling with his seatbelt as Bo takes a sharp corner. \"They know where you go to school.\" Bo says, stopping impatiently at a red light. \"I don't think they'd do anything with all those people around.\" Jimmy points out. \"Besides, they've been inside my house.\" Shit- he's right. It's not like he can just take Jimmy to his house, not when he barely spends anytime there as is. His dad would probably be home with his luck. He knows his mom wouldn't be there. \"We'll barricade the doors and windows.\" Bo says, thinking fast. \"Hide out there.\" For how long? Forever? If it would keep Jimmy safe. \"And what about the full moon tonight?\" He'd actually managed to forget about that somehow. \"The wolf will be okay in the house.\" \"Okay but not happy.\" Jimmy points out, frowning. He'd just have to make it up to the wolf later, he can't think of anything else to do right now though. DI He parks in front of Ellie's office building and walks in. He already knows where he's going from all the times Jimmy had dragged him there to borrow money from his sister or something. Jimmy's safe at home, all the windows and doors are locked and blocked in some way or another and he's here to pick up Ellie. Ellie didn't seem to think he was overreacting too much, had even agreed to leaving her car at work overnight and letting Bo drive her home. Apparently the Jake incident is still fresh in her mind. Ellie's office is in the far corner of the building and she smiles and waves when he pokes his head in. \"I'll just be a minute.\" She mouths and then goes back to her call. Bo shoves his hands in his pockets and wanders down the hallway trying to recall where the break room, and more specifically the vending machine, is. He walks by an unmarked door when suddenly the door is flung open and he's dragged into a dark room. Bo flails, fighting back, trying to use his wrestling moves but there's very little space, his foot hits something and he slips. His head connects with the edge of a shelf, hard. \" Shit!\" Is a harsh whisper in the dark and the last thing he hears as Bo's knees crumple and he goes under. DI \"-so we've resorted to kidnapping ?\" An angry voice cuts through the fog that fills his brain and sends sharp stakes of pain through it. \"Sammy,\" A second voice begins. Bo groans in place of telling them both to just shut up because he has the worst hangover in like, ever. \"I think he's waking up.\" The second voice comes closer and Bo attempts to pry his eyes open. At first he thinks he's imagining things, but then he realizes with a sinking feeling that he doesn't have a hangover and that the two so called 'FBI agents' from before are standing in front of him. \"Morning sunshine.\" Agent Young drawls and Bo remembers where he knows the names from. \"AC/DC? Really?\" He groans and tries to move. His hands and ankles are tied to a chair. Agent Young smirks and glances at his partner. \"See, told you he figured it out.\" The other guy just rolls his eyes and crouches down so he's at Bo's eye level. The guy is a freakin' giant . \"Look, we're really sorry about this.\" He starts and Bo snorts. \"You knocked me out and kidnapped me and you're sorry ?\" \"Hey! You tripped!\" Young defends, arms crossed and seating himself on a bed nearby. Bo takes in the cheesy décor, twin beds and small kitchenette and comes to the conclusion that they're in a hotel. They could be anywhere . \"Dean!\" The giant snaps and turns back to Bo. \"We don't want to hurt you.\" \"No, you just want to hurt my friend.\" Bo snarls back and for a moment it feels like he's the one with the wolf clawing under his skin. Wolf. Oh no. He glances out the window and through the thin blinds he can see how dark it is outside. \"What time is it?\" \"Why?\" The giant blinks in confusion. \"What time is it?\" Bo demands. \"About 3 in the morning.\" Dean tells him, suspicion clear on his face. 3 in the morning- great, he'd told Jimmy that he'd be right back with Ellie. That had been hours ago. \"You should probably untie me right now.\" Bo tells them. They exchange a look and then look back at Bo. I don't think so.\" Dean says, leaning back on the bed. Bo can now see the shiny gun on the sheets next to him. He swallows hard but keeps his expression blank. \"Sam, it looks like we're going to have to go out and find this wolf tonight before it kills again.\" \"Kills?\" Bo repeats incredulously, straining against the ropes. \"You think that the wolf is behind these deaths?\" Dean stares back impassively. Bo may not know what killed those people but he knows that it wasn't Jimmy or Ellie. The door splinters inwards suddenly and everything goes to hell. A large brown wolf comes bursting through the door and as the two guys level their guns on it, a second, black wolf comes racing in at its heels. A gun goes off and Bo knows he's yelling, wonders why no one has come to investigate yet. Probably too afraid. \"Shit! Sam watch out!\" The two wolves leap at the guys and Bo can only see this ending horribly. \"Jimmy! Don't!\" He yells desperation tingeing his voice. Both wolves stop abruptly, turning large, shaggy heads to Bo. \"Don't shoot them!\" Bo yells at Sam and Dean as the guns are levelled on the brother and sister. \"Just leave them alone!\" Jimmy stalks forwards, growls menacingly at Dean and nudges at Bo's hand. Bo let's out a shaky laugh as his ropes are bitten through and suddenly he's free. He reaches out, petting the back of Jimmy's neck. \"Yeah,\" He says softly. \"I'm sorry I wasn't there buddy.\" He hasn't missed a full moon yet, not if he can help it. He's seen how much it hurts Jimmy; Jimmy's told him it's easier when he's there. \"Sammy.\" Dean says from across the room and Ellie growls low in her throat. Bo stands, placing himself between the guys with guns and the rather large wolves. \"It wasn't them, they're not killers.\" Jimmy tries to slip by him, but he just pushes the brown wolf back, shielding him. He needs Jimmy to let him do this one thing, let him be the hero this time. \"On full moons they just run around the forest.\" The guys share another look and Bo can't read this one. \"We can wait for morning. See if they really do listen to you.\" Sam finally says. \"But we need another room, someone's going to be checking in on all the noise any minute now.\" Dean finishes, gathering up bags and looking out the door. Bo tries to make sure his sigh of relief isn't too loud. DI Bo eyes the guns in the Winchesters hands for the next few hours. He has Jimmy curled protectively at his side, like he's the one that needs protecting, not the wolf. Ellie is curled on the other side of the bed and the two brothers (not what he would have suspected. He'd been becoming convinced that it was something else) sit by the door, guns gripped in their hands. Sun up is soon, and Bo can feel his eyelids growing heavy. He has taken up idly patting Jimmy's back so he feels it when the transformation begins to take hold. It's painful to watch so he turns his attention to pulling the sheets off the bed. He tosses one to Ellie as she lays on the floor, recovering and then slides over and gently wraps one around Jimmy. The brothers watch from across the room, silently. \"They're always like this?\" Sam asks, something akin to wonderment in his voice. There's probably a story there but he's not going to ask. \"Yeah.\" Bo nods his head and watches, relief hitting him swift and sure as they lower the guns. He lets out a shaky breath and turns back to Jimmy. Jimmy blinks up at him and slowly smiles. Bo smiles back, reaching out and grasping Jimmy's hand. When he looks up again the brothers are gone but there's a bit of money sitting on a dresser; which is really good considering the siblings only have sheets to wear and Bo isn't sure what happened to his wallet. DI Ellie locks the door and goes around making sure that every window is shut and locked when they get back to the house. Then she offers a tired wave and heads up to bed. Bo doesn't figure they'll see her for a few hours at the very least. He turns to Jimmy, surprised to find Jimmy less than a foot away and getting closer. His friend pauses as their toes touch and they're breathing each other's air. \"The wolf freaked out a bit when you didn't come back yesterday.\" Jimmy informs him, hand coming up to trace along Bo's jaw gently. He tilts his head into the touch. \"Didn't actually mean to get kidnapped.\" He tries to say but is cut off by lips on his own. He's not used to this, to being pushed down on the couch and straddled as Jimmy ravages his mouth. He's licking and sucking and Bo groans aloud as Jimmy bites his lip, then moves away from his mouth to his neck. He's not used to this intensity, to being claimed - but he likes it. Jimmy bites down on the juncture between his neck and shoulder, sucking hard. Bo arches up, hands trying to pull Jimmy closer, trying to get some friction, something . Jimmy chuckles against his throat and licks a wet stripe up before meeting his mouth again. Bo slides his hands around, cupping Jimmy through the jeans he's just changed into, rubbing gently, but hard enough to have Jimmy moaning aloud and breaking the kiss. Quick, deft hands undo his zipper, shoving his jeans and boxers down far enough so Jimmy can reach skin, then undoes his own jeans. Bo leans back, lets Jimmy take the lead and watches with fascination as Jimmy licks his own palm and then fists them both. His head hits the back of the couch and he swears, uncaring if it wakes Ellie up because Jimmy is stroking them rough and hard with only the intention of getting them off. He alternates between watching Jimmy's face as he bites his lip and watching Jimmy's hand wrapped around both of them, pumping up and down. His hips buck up in helpless little stutters as he reaches out and pulls Jimmy close, kissing him hard and wet and dirty . Jimmy's strokes speed up and suddenly with a twist of his hand Bo is coming, and coming and coming. It feels like his spine is melting as his hips keep hitching and he grabs onto Jimmy's shirt trying to ground himself. He feels Jimmy bite down on his shoulder hard, making him shudder and then Jimmy sags against him. They're sticky and sweaty and probably stink but Bo doesn't feel like moving. \"We need to do this more often.\" Bo mutters into Jimmy's shoulder. He can feel Jimmy's snort of laughter against his cooling skin and then what is definitely Jimmy licking his neck. \"Next time with a bed, maybe.\" Jimmy suggests, pulling back and kissing him softly, unlike the hurried, desperate kissed from before. Bo decides he likes these kisses the most. DI The next time he sees the 67 Chevy Impala he's driving down the highway with Jimmy to some state fair, and hey- what a better way to celebrate their anniversary than to drive two hours to a field in the middle of nowhere. Bo may complain but he's secretly pleased with the idea. A black car roars passed them on the highway heading the other way and for a moment Bo is sure he recognizes it. He glances at Jimmy to see if he noticed anything but Jimmy is staring out the window, humming absently. Bo shrugs, decides not to ask and just reaches out to grasp Jimmy's hand. Jimmy glances over and gives him a soft smile and squeezes his hand back. The x-over was Supernatural btw... ","Summary":" Disclaimer: Nope, don't own A/N- so, this is a X-Over!

Here it is. It's kind of in a weird style – there's no actual dialogue, but there is. I don't know why it came out like this. Kinda dark-ish. Um, boys aren't mine. OC's are – though I'm not sure I want them. Enjoy! In the month following the werewolf incident, Bo sort of becomes a permanent fixture. Brooke, too. But, mostly Bo. Bo stays over a lot. Eventually, it's not even planned, he'll just show up and shrug sheepishly, and after a few times, Jimmy gives him a key. An air mattress has taken up root in Jimmy's room, as well. And Bo has a few sets of clothes on hand at Jimmy's place, too. Sometimes he sneaks into Jimmy's room in the middle of the night, sometimes at more reasonable hours. He doesn't explain and Jimmy doesn't ask. But, the next full moon comes around and Jimmy calls Bo in a panic because he's turning again and evidently the wolf wasn't as gone as he thought it was. And, please, Bo, don't come over tonight, please. But, he does. He shows up with a black eye and a finger shaped bruises on his arm. Jimmy tries to ask him about it, then, but transforming sucks majorly and Bo won't answer him anyway. He just sits on the bed with Jimmy, trying to help in whatever way he can. He's more than a little worried about getting all wolfy with Bo just inches away from him. Closer to terrified over actually hurting him, especially now that's he's turned up already hurt. But, he's starting to catch on to what's going on, so he can't - won't - ask Bo to leave, either. All in all, the night passes, as do the other two nights of the lunar cycle. Bo stays all three days and remains totally unharmed by the werewolf. In fact, the werewolf is oddly protective of Bo instead. So much so that it's only when Bo isn't around that Jimmy feels any sort of potential for violence. He breaks up with Brooke the next day – it's too risky and they've been kidding themselves for a while now. Bo needs him more, anyway. Bo's bruises fade, and new one's appear the next night he stays over. Jimmy doesn't try to ask again, but he does deflate the air mattress and lifts the covers of his bed in silent offering. If being closer helps the wolf cope, maybe it can help Bo, too. They come home together after school the following day, and somehow, someway, in the midst of doing their math homework, Jimmy ends up hovering over Bo, their lips pressed together and his hands under the other boy's shirt. Bo doesn't show up for a week after that. He's out of school for a few days, too. Jimmy tries to see him at his house, but all he gets is a door slammed in his face by some military looking man with the unnerving scent of Bo's blood on him. Late that night, the wolf wakes him from an uneasy sleep. Bo. Bo, it tells him. Bo needs him. He goes outside and starts walking the path to the other teen's house, finding Bo about halfway there. He's lying on the sidewalk, close to unconscious. His nose is bleeding, he has a busted lip, and that's just what he can see. He doesn't know what the hoodie the older teen is wearing hides, but he's seen all he needs to see to know that the wolf inside him is on edge and he needs to get Bo home. And by home, he means back to Jimmy's house, Jimmy's room. Not back to whatever the hell is going on at Bo's. One good thing about still being a werewolf is that he gets to keep his werewolf strength. He carefully shifts Bo into his arms and heads back to the house, moving slowly and smoothly - wary of his friend's possible injuries. He yells for Ellie – doesn't care if the neighbors complain or anything because it's Bo and Bo is hurt and the wolf will not stand for Bo being hurt again. Not like this. Not again. Not ever again. She's storming downstairs, intent to yell at him, he's sure, up until she sees Bo in his arms. Which has to be freaky enough given that she doesn't know about the wolf thing yet, or about breaking up with Brooke. Ellie lets him in and he lays Bo out on the couch. She asks him what happened but he doesn't answer, too focused on Bo to do anything other than growl out a request for the first-aid kid as he peels away the grey hoodie covering Bo's chest. Bruises. Lots and lots and lots of bruises in various stages of healing. Some shaped like shoeprints, other with the indentation of a ring that denotes a fist and that's when he knows a first aid kit isn't going to cut it. Ellie's calling 911 before Jimmy can even suggest it and within moments an ambulance is there. Jimmy forces the wolf into check. He can't stay with Bo if he loses it and if he can't stay with Bo, he will lose his control. He rides with Bo and the paramedics and Ellie follows behind them in her car. It takes a few hours, and some fallacious assertions that Jimmy is Bo's boyfriend before they let him in to see his injured friend. And Jimmy stays with him all night until, with a handful of bruised ribs, a sprained wrist and a slight concussion, Bo is released early the next morning. The police show up, but Bo refuses to say anything to them. Despite any protests Bo might have on the idea, Jimmy carries him upstairs to his – their? – room once they get home. There are things Bo needs from his old home, he knows that. School stuff, his car, important things. And he knows he'll have to take Bo back over there at some point. He's just sitting there watching Bo – as he has been for most of the day - when the other boy speaks, a hoarse sound that Jimmy has to strain to hear even with his sensitive hearing. Thanks, Jimbo, he says, and Jimmy just nods and lies down next to him for a while, assuring Bo that he's never letting anyone hurt him again. Morning comes and with it a sense of contentment from the wolf. He and Bo are curled up together in the small bed, one of his hands curled around Bo's good one. It's not until he remembers why there is a good one that the wolf seems to be reminded as well. The protective feeling he always has around Bo rolls in his chest and he fights against a growl because it might wake Bo. Ellie pops her head in the room just a few minutes later – once again surprised by their proximity– and asks if they need anything because she has to head to work. Jimmy shakes his head in the negative and she leaves quietly. But, just a second after the door closes; Bo's breathing changes and his eyes slowly open. Shouldn't you be at school? Bo asks, and Jimmy doesn't even dignify that with an answer. He's not letting Bo out of his sight for a long time. Maybe never, he decides, as he runs his fingers through Bo's unruly bed-head. Bo's ready to go back to school a few days later and Jimmy knows what that means. He's not letting Bo go alone, though. Not a chance in hell of that happening. He does convince Jimmy to give him a head start, to see if anyone's even home in the middle of the day. Unfortunately, there is someone home. Bo's dad. The military looking man who still smells residually of Bo's blood. Bo is pulled inside and the door slams shut and Jimmy is on his heels, bursting through the door just seconds later. The man has Bo pressed against a wall and a fist poised to strike, and that's just not going to happen. Bo's father demands to know who the hell he thinks he is barging in like that. He asks – moreso mocks, really – if he's the one his queer son has been running off to all those nights. Jimmy doesn't answer. Can't. The wolf – technically dormant since it's not the full moon, but still there, always there, and still aware that Bo is in danger – spurs Jimmy on and he grabs the man by the back of his shirt and hauls him off of Bo, shoving him into a wall in return. He motions for Bo to go upstairs and set about collecting whatever he needs to, says that he'll be up in a minute to help. It's only when Bo is out of sight that Jimmy lets the wolf do as it pleases. He growls, and his fingernails start to shift into claws where they're tightly clamped on Bo's abuser's shoulders. He glares death at the man; speaking low and threateningly and making it abundantly clear that if he ever, ever touches Bo again… He doesn't even see fit to finish the sentence. He's pretty damn sure the guy gets the picture. Jimmy releases his grips and backs off. He motions toward the door and the man begrudgingly leaves, spitting curses as he walks. Jimmy wants them out of here yesterday. He finds Bo upstairs, packing a bag. He's already got his school stuff together. Now it's just clothes and things. Jimmy slings the first backpack over his shoulder and helps however Bo asks him to. It takes just fifteen minutes for them to get everything Bo needs and load it into the back of the red Camaro in the driveway. It's only when they are safely inside it, as well, that Bo finally seems to relax. Jimmy asks if he's okay, and doesn't get an answer, so he drives them part of the way back home – just in case Bo's dad gets any ideas - and they sit in the parked car for a while in silence. You're safe here, you know. You'll always be safe with me. I won't let anything hurt you. Jimmy promises that much and more now that he knows the wolf wouldn't dare. He's been doing some reading up on wolf and werewolf stuff. Mates and packs and yeah. The wolf seems to have picked Bo as its mate. And Jimmy's okay with that. Bo nods because yes, yes, he does know that and he wouldn't trade knowing that for anything in the world. He smiles when Jimmy laces their fingers together, squeezing lightly. That feeling of complete contentment washes over Jimmy again and he knows that the wolf is happy, too. He leans over to press his lips to Bo's for a brief moment. Home, he suggests. They should get home.

The shit that you had to do just to impress somebody was crazy. 101 ways to get a second date? If you have to remember all this shit Jimmy knows he will be alone for the rest of his life. Brooke realized soon enough how big of a loser Jimmy was. She dumped him after the second date, realizing that he somehow lost the bad boy rep he gained for a few days during the werewolf fiasco, Bo still hung out with him, having experienced the werewolf incident with him caused them to have some sort of bond. It was hard to explain. Plus, Bo was now at his level on the popular scale once Brooke told the whole school he was gay. He wasn't terribly upset about Brooke dumping him, he knew that she was way out of his league and it was only a matter of time anyways. \"How's Cosmo Girl?\" Jimmy looked over at Bo who had been staring at him the whole time. \"I'm never going to get a girl.\" Jimmy threw the magazine across the room and buried his head into the pillow. \"There are other options besides girls you know.\" Bo was staring at him still, and you know, Jimmy really liked Bo, he really did. Bo had been a great friend to him ever since the werewolf thing and they had gotten really close, but Bo still bugged him about the gay thing practically everyday and it gets old after a while. Yeah, Bo is attractive and Jimmy has entertained the idea, but that would be just one more checkmark on the freak list and that is all Jimmy needs. \"Bo, Shut up.\" Jimmy looks around for the magazine to get out of this always awkward conversation. \"Just one kiss and I promise I will leave you alone.\" \"Just one?\" Jimmy can't believe he is even entertaining the thought, but if it will get Bo to stop talking about it then he will do it. \"Just the one.\" Jimmy gives up on the magazine, and sighs. \"Fine.\" Bo obviously didn't need to be told twice as he got onto the bed and looked Jimmy right in the eyes again. Jimmy was about to back out, not wanting to lead his friend on when Bo leaned in for the kiss. Bo's lips were a little chapped, or maybe those were his lips, he didn't really care but it was still pretty hot. As Jimmy relaxed into the kiss, even letting Bo slip his tongue in for a little while, he finally decided fuck it. What's one more checkmark anyways?

He jogged back towards Bo's car, one of thenfew still left in the lot, one hand raised in the air to wave.

Soon, 'Lovegame'nfaded away, and he sighed dramatically. \"Just a few more minutesnuntil we get to my house.\" Zacarinwas just about to open his mouth when another song filled the car. Hensmirked and turned up the volume instead. \" Younspin my head right round, right round when you go down, when you gondown down.\" Bo'sneyes widened and he looked over at the boy in the passenger's seat,nwho began to sing along with the chorus. \"This song is all aboutngiving head…\" He hissed. \"Inknow.\" Zacari replied with a laugh. \"It's hilarious.

Afternlooking at the speedometer, he removed his foot from the gas pedal.nHe was almost 20 miles an hour over the speed limit.

Zacarinreached over to turn down the music. \"Something wrong?\" \"No.\"nBo forced a smile as he turned into his neighborhood. \"No, justnthinking.\" \"Aboutnthat Brooke girl?\" Zacari asked seriously. \"One of the guys innthe office was talking about how you broke it off with her becausenshe cheated on you with some other guy.

He stopped at the bottom of the staircase in awe.n\"Bo, this is awesome!\" Thenentire floor was covered in wrestling mats. A full collection of worknout equipment stood in an adjoining room. It was a wrestler's dreamnroom. Bonwalked into the middle of it, dropping his bag on the floor. \"Inknow, right?

Thenvoice in his head was needy. He subtly adjusted his jeans. \"Okay,nif that's what you want.\" He swallowed as he watched Zacari thrownthe shirt in the general direction of the stairs and his backpack.nThe shorter boy kicked his own bag off of the mat before squaring hisnshoulders. \"Ready?\" Zacarinnodded, mimicking Bo's position. \"What do I do?\" Bongrabbed Zacari's wrists and brought the other boy's hands to hisnshoulders. \"Grab me here, and throw me down on the ground.\" Henwas almost immediately off his feet, Zacari's face inches from hisnown. He swallowed hard. \"G-good. Um, are you sure you've neverndone this before?\" Zacaringrinned as he helped the smaller boy to his feet. \"I've watchednprofessional wrestling for a while, so I know a little bit. Butnmostly the entertainment moves, which is why I'm asking for yournexpertise.\" Bonlet out a small chuckle and shook his head from side to side. \"Well,nyou're good for what you know, then.\" He smiled when he sawnZacari's eyes light up from the praise. \"One more time?\" Thendark haired boy couldn't help that he loved the way it felt whennZacari manhandled him. It gave him a rush to know that the other boyncould take control of him like that. He ended up flat on his backnonce more within seconds. He didn't want to admit to anyone,nincluding himself, that he highly enjoyed it. Zacarinhad fallen as well with the force he exerted. He now knelt on the matnon his hands and knees, just inches to the right of Bo. \"Sorry, Inmust have thrown you too hard. Sorry.\" He pushed off from thenground before reaching a hand out to the other boy. Bo,nmeanwhile, could feel himself verging on hyperventilation at thensudden closeness of their faces. He coughed to clear his throat as henreached up to grasp Zacari's hand. The other boy pulled him upnfirmly, and Bo stumbled against him. \"It-it's okay. It's cool,nI was just surprised.\" \"Again?\"nZacari asked, a nervous smile crossing his handsome face. \"Inpromise I won't hurt you.\" Bongrinned. \"Actually, how about we start from the floor? There'snsome more floor stuff I think I should teach you.\" In actuality, henwanted to feel Zacari closer to him. He fell to his hands and kneesnand glanced over his shoulder at the taller boy. \"Come behind me,noff to my left.\" Zacarinblushed and moved into the position Bo asked him to before waiting tonsee what the boy wanted him to do next. \"Now what?\" \"Grabnmy left arm with one hand, the other goes on my back.\" Bo bit backna sigh of delight when the warm hands landed in the specifiednpositions. \"Good.\" He took a deep breath before giving Zacarinanother instruction. \"I'm going to fight my way out of this. Trynto get me on my back.\" A blush crossed his features at the wording,nbut he didn't take it back. Zacarinnodded, bracing himself. At Bo's whispered 'go', he began tonpull and fight at the smaller man to flip him over. Bonbreathed in harshly when he felt Zacari press against him. He blushednand stiffened his arms. 'No, you will not do this. Not today.nYou will not let yourself be turned on while wrestling him.' That train of thought left the station when Zacari's hand subtlynand obviously thoughtlessly cupped his ass. Bo squeaked softly,nleaning into the touch. He gasped and jerked away. \"Bo?\"nZacari fell back from the other boy. \"Are you okay?\" \"F-fine.\"nBo felt like crying. He hated himself. He didn't want to scarenZacari off. He liked him way too much for him leave. \"I just…Inpinched a muscle. I need a minute.\" He began to rub a spot justnbetween his shoulder and his neck. The spot didn't hurt, at all,nbut it made him feel better to have something to do. Anything to keepnZacari from leaving. \"Sorry, I didn't mean to freak you out.\" Zacarincrawled forward and dropped his hands to Bo's shoulders. \"Let mentry.\" He began to rub at the sides of the other boy's neck,ndigging his thumbs in deep. \"I've been told that I'm very goodnat fixing kinks.\" Bonblushed at Zacari's statement and bit his lip. \"I-I feel okay,nreally. You don't have to. Let's just, uh, get back to wrestling,nhuh?\" He turned to give the cute boy his crooked smile. \"I'mnready to go again if you are.\" Zacarinquirked a brow but conceded after a moment, patting Bo's backnreassuringly. \"Same position?\" Fornthe next ten or so minutes, Bo and Zacari sparred on the mats,nneither gaining on the other. Bo was surprised to find that the grinnon his face was a genuine one. He was enjoying himself. But he wasnfinding himself becoming increasingly turned on every time he feltnZacari anywhere near his hindquarters. He finally collapsed on hisnback on the mat, releasing a breathless giggle. He glanced over whennZacari mimicked him. \"Want to go get something to drink?\" Zacarinlaughed, reaching across the small gap between them to ruffle Bo'snhair. \"I don't think I can move, dude. My legs don't want toncooperate.\" Bonsighed happily as he rested. \"Yeah, mine either.\" He was contentnto lie next to Zacari for as long as was humanly possible. Just beingnin the same room, sharing the same space, being near each other, thatnwas all Bo needed. \"I'm so tired.\" Zacarinrolled over slightly, propping his head up on one arm. The spacenbetween them seemed to shrink at the movement. Bo blushed when henrealized that all Zacari had to do was lean down and their lips wouldnbe touching. \"So…what was up with the other guys today? Why werenthey messing with you like that?\" Bonsighed. He knew this conversation would come. \"It's no big deal,nman. It's just something that happened over the weekend. AfternFriday's tryouts.\" He turned toward Zacari and rubbed his neck.nHe felt his face flushing even further. \"It's not reallynsomething I'm comfortable talking about right now…\" \"Henwas assaulting you, you know.\" Zacari said seriously, leaningncloser. \"That could have gotten him expelled.\" Bo'snface heated up. He didn't know such a high-octane blush wasnpossible. It felt like he was on fire. \"They, uh, they found outnthat I…I'm…\" He coughed, trying to cover the final word.n\"…gay.\" Zacari'sndark eyes widened at the output. They softened when he saw Bo closenhis eyes in embarrassment. \"Bo…that's no big deal. Being gay innHollywood? Not like that's weird.\" He chuckled and set a hand onnthe smaller teen's cheek. \"Aww, Bo, come on, let me see thosenpretty hazel eyes again.\" Boncouldn't help the warmth spreading in the pit of his stomach.nZacari had called his eyes pretty. And he actually knew the color andneverything! Slowly, he cracked open one eye. \"So, uh, you're not,nlike, weirded out or anything? Not scared of me feeling you up whilenwe wrestle?\" Zacarinlaughed. \"Bo, you're so cute when you're dense.\" He leanednforward to give a surprised Bo his first kiss from a boy. \"I'mngay, too.\" He couldn't help the chuckle that escaped his throat.n\"I thought it was obvious!\" Boncouldn't believe his ears. His lips still tingled from the heat ofnZacari's kiss. \"O-obvious?\" He set a hand on his chest.n\"Oh…my…God…\" He glanced up into the other boy's eyes. \"Incan't believe this…\" Zacarinmoved his body closer hesitantly. \"Can I maybe…kiss you again?\"nHe smiled softly and dug his hand into Bo's curly hair. \"And thennwe can go get that drink?\" Bonnodded, leaning forward. Their lips met softly at first, and Zacarinwrapped his arms around the smaller teen and hoisted him up on hisnown chest. He deepened the kiss as much as he could from his positionnand let Bo take the lead in the kiss. Theirntongues began to battle, slickly tracing over each other. Bo concedednthe victory to Zacari. He submissively gave the inside of the othernman's cheek a swift lick. A small squeak escaped him when Zacari'snhands pushed into the back pockets of his jeans to give his ass ansqueeze. Breakingnapart for air, Bo laid his head against Zacari's neck. \"I nevernthought I'd find someone else.\" He sighed happily and kissed thenother boy's throat. \"I think you're the cure to my heartache.\" Zacarinsmiled and buried his face in Bo's dark hair. \"You're mine,ntoo, Bo.\" He shifted slightly. \"Now, how about that drink?\" \"Soundsnlike a plan to me.\" Bo laughed, standing. He knew that this wouldnbe the best ride of his life. He felt like he was in love, for thenfirst time.

I. Relief and nerves are making him light headed and making it hard to focus. He runs a red light all because he can't stop picturing it in his head. Over and over again, different scenarios each time. It's just…he's never felt like this before. It's the nerves he gets right before a big meet or the thrill he gets when he's driving his car well passed the speed limit on the back roads, music blaring and no one around. And it's this feeling that he's not quite as alone as he'd thought that over powers all of the other emotions running rampant through him. It's new and scary and addicting as hell. All he can think of is how soft those lips must be. So he sucks in a deep breath, steels his nerves and knocks on the door. And words are spilling from his mouth and yeah, he's probably not making much sense but who can blame him? And Jimmy keeps glancing at the door like he's busy, like he has something he needs to be getting back to and Bo hopes like hell it's not a guest or his sister because he knows exactly how this is going to play out. So he leans in, cups Jimmy's face and- Jimmy pulls back. Stumbles back, panicked and looking cornered and Bo has no idea what's going on. \"I'm a werewolf .\" Bo's heard some pretty lame excuses before but nothing like this. And Jimmy, he looks like he believes it. Jimmy backs up and disappears into the house as Bo calls out to him. They're not done; they can't be done- not when Bo had been so close to finding someone…like him. He'll talk to Jimmy and Jimmy will admit that the whole werewolf thing is just a cover story or something and then he'll agree to go out with Bo and everything will be awesome . But then Jimmy comes bursting through the door, chased by his monster dog and Bo forgets how desperate he was to escape the loneliness, to find someone who understood , and focuses on helping Jimmy. II. They're tentative friends. Years of bullying suddenly turned to friendship would leave anyone wary. Bo takes it slow- takes his time and gets used to just being friends with Brook and Jimmy. Brook and Jimmy who have been on two dates and are letting Bo tag along for a third because his social life is non existent now. The movie is a romantic comedy. Bo is there for the popcorn and just to get out of the house and away from his family. He's seeing the movie solely for the sake of seeing a movie. Jimmy holds the popcorn with Brook on one side and Bo on the other and Bo watches the shadows play across his new friends face and grins as he tries to smother a yawn. He nudges Jimmy's knee with his own and shares a grin. Brook seems enraptured by the movie and isn't paying them any attention, even when Jimmy slides an arm over her shoulders to Bo's dismay. He watches them and in a sudden fit of possessiveness or something, nudges Jimmy's shoulder so the other teenager looks at him. Bo catches his eye, brining a hand up to brush lightly against Jimmy's cheek. And when the other teenager doesn't immediately pull away, eyes wide and dark in the theatre, Bo starts to lean in, feeling brave. And they're close, so close. Warm breath puffs against his lips and there's barely any space separating them- his pulse is racing and he thinks this is it. But at the last moment Jimmy turns his face to the side and Bo's lips ghost across his cheek, against warm skin. Bo sighs, disappointment hitting him and Jimmy turns his head slightly so their noses bump lightly and foreheads are pressed together and somehow this feels so much more intimate than any kiss he's ever had. It feels very much like an apology. Or a question. His breath catches in his throat and his hand clenches and unclenches because all he wants to do is reach out, slide his hand across warm skin and feel the muscle beneath. Jimmy pulls back, eyes downcast and turns back to the movie, his arm still around Brooks shoulders. III. They're drunk. New seniors celebrating the end of the previous year with fake ID's and bottles of the strongest stuff they could find. Ellie is gone for the weekend and instead of throwing a party, like most normal teenagers his age, Jimmy has invited them over to sit on the living room floor and drink. The hard wood floor is cool underneath him as he lays on his back, face too warm and head a little dizzy. He traces absent patterns in the condensation on his bottle, catching drops of water before they can slide all of the way off the label. \"She won't do it.\" Jimmy says confidently, his own bottle balancing on a finger. Bo stares and stares but he cannot figure out how he does it. Must be a werewolf thing, he decides. \"I dunno,\" Bo pushes himself up, blinking as the room spins and crosses his long legs. \"You don't know half of the stuff she's done.\" Jimmy frowns momentarily at this, like he doesn't understand how he couldn't know everything about Brook even though they broke up two months ago. Sometimes Bo thinks that Jimmy forgets that Bo and Brook was Bo and Brook before Jimmy came along. \"Done!\" Brook comes running back into the room, face flushed, hair wild and sliding… She tumbles to the floor, landing half on Bo. Her laughter is infectious and Bo's laughter slips free, followed soon by Jimmy. His cheeks hurt and he's out of breath when she finally manages to untangle them and crawl back to her section of the floor. \"I can't believe you did it!\" Jimmy stares at her, shocked. Bo just grins. \"I was planning on cutting it anyways.\" Brooks says and runs a hand through her hair, now a good deal shorter and falling just passed her ears. Bo had no doubt that she'd go through with the dare. He takes a long drink and frowns as the bottle empties. \"Here.\" Brook tosses him the bottle of tequila sunrise. \"My turn! Bo- truth or dare?\" And he would say truth but the game has become more dare or dare and there are some truths he doesn't even want his closest friends to know. So he takes a long drink from the bottle, passes it to Jimmy and says, \"Dare.\" The look on Brooks face is down right evil and she doesn't even pretend to consider what to say, looking Bo straight in the eye. \"Kiss Jimmy.\" Bo nods easily. \"With lips and tongue.\" She pauses and this time does consider it. \"Lots of tongue.\" Jimmy is hiding his face in his hands, the bottle of tequila on the floor next to him so Bo crawls over to his friend, grinning at Brooks cat calls and reaches up, peeling Jimmy's hands from his face. \"You've got to be kidding.\" Jimmy says, licks his lips and his eyes dart from Bo to Brook and back again. Bo gives him his best I'm gonna make your toes curl with pleasure grin and leans in. Jimmy flushes red but doesn't move and Bo thinks this is it. His hand comes to rest on Jimmy's thigh and he can feel the muscle beneath his jeans, can feel the heat and he squeezes, licking his lips and swallowing around a dry mouth. But as he gets close, Jimmy starts to lean back. Bo keeps leaning forwards, further and further while Jimmy leans back and he blinks and suddenly Jimmy has darted out from underneath him and Bo is left half sprawled on the floor, ass in the air. \"Boo!\" Brook shouts, hands cupped over her mouth but eyes twinkling. Bo glances over his shoulder to where Jimmy is hovering across the room, face beet red. Damn werewolf tricks he thinks. But he spots how Jimmy's eyes bounce around the room, gaze landing on Bo's ass like he can't help himself from looking and Bo grins. Not a complete loss. +I. Bo is about to lock up for the night, exhausted after a long shift at work and ready to just crawl into bed for the next year when there's a weird scratching at the door. He pauses, about to untie his apron, and considers just ignoring it but the scratching continues so Bo leaves his white apron over his black pants and manoeuvres through the tables towards the front of the restaurant. He's surprised when he opens the door and a golden retriever comes running inside, darting forwards to lick his hand and just generally cover his black work clothes in fur. He's even more surprised when he realizes that he knows the dog. So he's crouching down to pet Zipper when Jimmy comes hurrying up to the door, just like Bo knew he would. He looks up, grinning as Jimmy slips in through the door into the dimly lit restaurant. \"Sorry, he just got away from me. He does that sometimes.\" Jimmy crouches down on the other side of Zipper and starts scolding the dog for running off. And this might work except that Bo had heard a story once about how Brook and Jimmy had met. \"Jimbo.\" Bo says, voice pitched low in the small space between them. \"What are you doing out this late?\" \"Well,\" Jimmy grins, something small and soft and stands, attaching Zippers leash to his collar. \"I was in the neighbourhood and remembered you worked here and that you were working tonight.\" Bo raises an eyebrow and stands as well, brushing some of the fur off his black, buttoned shirt. The act catches Jimmy's eye and his gaze darts up and down Bo before darting away again. \"I thought you might want some company.\" Bo is the last person in the restaurant and is about to close up anyways so he turns and shrugs. \"Sure.\" When he gets back from hanging up the apron and grabbing his bag, Jimmy is still standing at the front door but there's a look of determination on his face and Bo watches silently for a moment before joining the other teenager again. A grin wipes away the previous look but something of it still remains in Jimmy's brown eyes. \"You okay, Jimbo?\" Bo asks as they step out of the restaurant. He locks the door and turns around, about to ask the question again because Jimmy isn't saying anything when suddenly there are hands cupping his face. Bo blinks and freezes. Jimmy stares at him, like he would a particularly hard math problem and then he's leaning in . Jimmy's lips are just as soft as he'd imagined they would be, over and over again. They brush his lightly, tentatively and Bo is terrified to move on the off chance that Jimmy will come to his senses. And then Jimmy pushes forwards, and Bo kisses back, against the door with the handle digging into his spine. He ignores it, wrapping his arms around the other teenager, gripping fabric and trying to drag him closer. Bo licks his lips as Jimmy pulls back, knows what he must look like because he can see it reflected on Jimmy's face. He grins, lips twitching into a smile and resists the urge to give the few people still out this late at night, a show. \"So.\" Bo says because Jimmy is grinning back, looking incredibly pleased . It's hot. \"So.\" Jimmy parrots and glances down the street to where Bo's car is parked. \"There's a late night monster marathon on. Nothing with werewolves.\" Bo's not that tired after all. \"Sounds awesome.\" Zipper leads the way to the car, pulling Jimmy along and Jimmy reaches out, grabs Bo's hand and threads their fingers together so he's pulled along as well.

Cursed não me pertence. Se me pertencesse, o Bo ficaria com o Jimmy no fim. Fanfic betada por Anne Asakura. O chamado do lobo Eu sou Um pouco de insegurança Um tanto quanto inconfidente Porque você não entende Eu faço o que posso Mas às vezes eu não faço sentido - Linkin Park, \"Faint\" (Tradução) Jimmy encara o teto branco e o acha incrivelmente liso. Pensamento idiota, mas, para ele, qualquer coisa serve para ignorar a porcaria da situação em que se encontra. E como se recusa a encarar a pessoa a seu lado, qualquer porcaria que pense ou que faça está bom para ele. Isso , Jimmy pensa, é coisa da maldição do lobisomem. É, definitivamente é coisa da maldição do lobisomem. Se não fosse por isso, eu não teria esses pensamentos e nem faria essas merdas que eu ando fazendo agora. A pessoa ao seu lado solta um grunhido cansado e ele se mexe desconfortavelmente na cama ao sentir a pele quente dela encostar de leve em seu braço, num movimento inesperado e inevitável, porque aquela ainda é uma cama de solteiro. Claro, Jimmy poderia se levantar e sair dali, mas está muito cansado pelo que fez (sexo ) nessa noite e aquela ainda é sua casa – e foi escolhida porque Ellie viajou a trabalho. É uma situação estranha essa , conclui, tentando se acalmar, nunca pensei que teria esse problema . A pessoa deitada a seu lado na cama não é Brooke. \"Jimbo?\" A voz de Bo ecoa cansada e um pouco distante, mas logo ele abre seus olhos marrons e encara Jimmy na escuridão do quarto. \"Hey\". A hesitação na voz dele é tão evidente que dói. \"Algum problema?\" \"É que... Bom... Você sabe...\" E Jimmy suspira. \"O que eu fiz com você – o que nós fizemos – não passa de um vestígio da maldição\". \"Não entendi.\" \"Bo, o simples fato de eu ter feito, hã...\" E lhe falta sinônimos melhores. \"...Sexo?\" \"É, isso mesmo. E com você, ainda, não que isso seja algo horrível, mas não é do meu feitio porque eu sou...\" \"Hétero?\" \"Sim.\" \"Então por que estou aqui no seu quarto esta noite?\" \"Exato! Porque a maldição me fez fazer isso! Digo, ainda há vestígios de lobo em mim e ele me faz fazer essas coisas impensáveis e que não são do meu feitio! Porque eu sou hétero, mas dormi com você, que também é homem!\" \"Por que você acha que ser um lobisomem te faz fazer coisas impensáveis?\" \"Eu entrei para o clube de luta, Bo\". \"...Faz sentido\". Um silêncio estranho paira entre eles e nenhum dos dois ousa quebrá-lo. É como se isso causasse uma guerra, ou destruísse o que quer que eles tenham agora. Então Bo suspira e vira de lado, seus olhos encarando a silhueta séria e nervosa de Jimmy. \"Por que eu?\" \"Como é?\" Os olhos de Jimmy ainda encaram o teto branco e que ele acha incrivelmente liso. \"Por que eu fui escolhido pelo vestígio de lobisomem ou seja lá o que você quer dizer com isso?\" \"Não sei\". Jimmy admite. \"Talvez porque você seja meu amigo\". Bo dá uma risada cínica e breve. \"Seu amigo? Eu sou um gay que te encheu por anos e só começou a ser decente com você porque me senti atraído por você. Não acho que sejamos tão amigos assim\". \"Tanto faz. Talvez ele tenha gostado de você\". \"Está me dizendo que seu lobisomem era gay?\" \"Não estou dizendo isso, só estou falando que ele talvez tenha sentido alguma coisa por você, porque você sempre me provocava e lobisomens adoram provocação, assim como a louca que me transformou, que adorava matar pessoas que se aproximavam de seu 'príncipe'\". \"Ok, então ele era bissexual\". \"Pare com essas brincadeiras, porque elas não têm graça\". \"Desculpe\". O silêncio que se forma agora é mais desconfortável e um pouco mais idiota. Bo boceja e o hálito quente roça na pele de Jimmy e o faz ter arrepios estranhos. \"Vamos discutir isso amanhã, ok?\" E Bo fecha os olhos, claramente cansado. Minutos depois, os olhos de Jimmy se desviam do teto branco e que ele acha incrivelmente liso e pousam no outro. Seus orbes analisam cada traço, cada movimento que seu peito ( nu ) faz enquanto respira lentamente e o quanto ele parece sereno. E, enfim, o cheiro de suor misturado com o almíscar – odor natural do corpo de Bo – chega em suas narinas como se dançassem com a brisa que entra pela janela. Então algo no peito de Jimmy explode e ele sente, mais uma vez, a dominadora idéia de tocar Bo da mesma maneira como ele toca Brooke. E ele sabe que precisa reprimir esse fato, porque é errado. \"Ah sim, só para avisar... Eu não me senti atraído por você quando você se tornou um lobisomem. Eu já gostava de você antes, eu acho – senão eu não te irritaria tanto, não é?\" Em sua mente, um ser ruge alto e eloqüente, sendo o mais direto possível e, sem pensar, Jimmy aproxima-se de Bo e beija seus lábios levemente. Assim que Bo percebe a ação e sente a mão quente do outro em seu rosto, entreabre os lábios e aproxima o seu corpo do de Jimmy. Eu estou certo, afinal , Jimmy pensa, enquanto perde suas mãos e seus lábios no corpo de Bo e sente o outro fazendo o mesmo, até tornarem-se uma confusão de gemidos, sussurros e suor, o resquício de lobisomem é quem me faz fazer e sentir isso . ( O lobo clama por Bo ) N/A.: Nesse caso, o \"lobo\" não é bem o lobisomem, e sim as emoções, o sentido e o desejo ( podemos colocar a libido também ) de Jimmy por Bo. O que quer dizer que o que o faz se sentir assim não é a maldição, e sim seus sentimentos. Não posso dizer que sou fã de \"Amaldiçoados\" mas o filme é interessante, os personagens são bons e o Bo é definitivamente gay – nada de mentira ou insinuação, ele realmente fala isso – e ele se \"apaixona\" pelo Jimmy, protagonista, no decorrer do filme. E ter um gay num desses filmes é digno, ok? Ainda que a idéia principal fosse um maldito drabble e essa daqui tem três páginas no Word, foda-se, porque eu achei digna o suficiente para um casal tão Cannon e gostei do resultado. E eu entrei num fandom de teias de aranhas, mas... ...Jimmy x Bo é amor e eu espero ver reviews ! 8D (Ou seu coração na minha escrivaninha e seu corpo para o It) ","Summary":" Sumário: O lobo clama por Bo.

Bo stands at the window, hands braced on the wooden frame, gaze distant as he takes in something Jimmy cannot see. Snow is falling softly outside, winter is just beginning with Christmas around the corner and Jimmy can feel it in the chill that permeates the room. Cold air hits his bare shoulder and he pulls the blankets, warm with body heat, higher. He watches for a long moment as Bo stands, still and loose at the window. Jimmy suspects that if he were to go stand exactly where Bo is standing now, there would be indents in the floor, fitting to Bo's feet and dwarfing Jimmy's. This has become their routine. Mornings are the worst because they are filled with hope that threatens to rise up and choke them until they're left gasping for breath they cannot find. Jimmy stays still in the bed and studies the other man if only to hold onto the precious silence for a little bit longer. The other side of the bed still smells strongly of Bo and is still warm, so he can't have been standing there too long. The sun is rising over the winter world outside and it's time to get up if he wants to make it to his class. Part of him would rather stay in bed all day. Or longer. \"Come back to bed.\" Jimmy murmurs, sitting up and feeling the cold air hit his skin. Bo jerks, as though broken out of his trance and turns with a small smile on his face. \"You have English today.\" He opens his arms and Jimmy crosses the room to him, lets himself be wrapped up and nuzzles at Bo's neck playfully. \" That I remember.\" Jimmy nips lightly at the skin of Bo's neck, restrains himself from trying to mark Bo as his and then tilts his head, getting a lazy, warm, good morning kiss. \"I could skip. Its just review.\" Bo gives him a look. They get dressed in the bedroom. They eat breakfast together, feet bumping under the table and talking about the weather (a drastic change from LA), or Ellie's wedding in the spring or just letting the silence wash over them, comfortable. \"I'll be back at two.\" Jimmy promises. Bo leads him to the door and helps man handle him into his thick, brown jacket. He's never needed a coat this warm before; the soft fur lining is comforting. \"And I'll have my phone on.\" Bo hands him his bag, smallest of smiles breaking through his mask. \"If you need anything , even if you might not think it's important,\" \"Jimmy!\" Bo breaks through his tirade, hands on his shoulders. \"I'll be fine. I swear I'll call if I need anything.\" \"Anything?\" Jimmy asks doubtfully. Bo nods, laughs softly and kisses him quickly. Then he herds him to the door, tugs the zipper on his jacket up as high as it will go and watches him go. Jimmy climbs into Bo's car and watches the other man standing in the doorway in the rear view mirror until he turns the corner and their home is out of sight. DI The time between the accident and the time when Bo wakes up rates is the scariest period of Jimmy's life. And this is beating out the time with the werewolf and the time with his softball tryouts in grade six. The doctors warn them about what could happen, tells them it may either be a matter of time or not at all. They go into great detail and Jimmy grabs each positive reassurance and hides them away, deep within his heart in a safe, protected spot. He thinks it's where the wolf resides in him. \"Hello.\" Bo looks up as the door opens. But it looks nothing like the other man. He's pale, as pale as the sheets he lays upon, with dark circles under his eyes. There is a large, sterile bandage wrapped around his head, covering chestnut brown locks. \"Hey.\" Jimmy manages to say but it sounds strained. He looks over his shoulder for his sister but she's out in the hall with the doctor still. \"So.\" Bo says and Jimmy realizes he's hovering. He quickly crosses the room and throws himself down in the visitor's chair next to the bed. \"They won't tell me anything.\" \"I don't think they really know what happened.\" Jimmy says and thinks about werewolves and the supernatural and how sick and tired he is of LA. \"It was an animal attack.\" Bo raises an eyebrow. \"A big one.\" Jimmy continues, wiping damp palms on his jeans. \"Like a…wolf.\" \"Oh.\" Bo says and frowns, squints his eyes into the distance as though he's trying to remember. \"So,\" He says again. \"Who are you?\" Jimmy tries to breathe but it feels like he's been punched in the gut. \"Jimmy.\" He says. \"My name is Jimmy.\" DI Ellie moves in with Richard, a doctor from the hospital she's been dating for months. They get engaged in the fall. Jimmy likes Richard; he seems like a nice, normal guy who doesn't question why his fiancé and her brother have some strange habits. Like, sniffing people or an obsession with biting . She doesn't want to leave him but Jimmy has had a half formed plan in his head for awhile and now is as good a time as any to implement it. Bo's parents seem relieved to have Jimmy take him off their hands. It makes him sick. It makes the wolf want to claw to the surface and tear them apart for treating his… something this badly. Bo can still do everything for himself, he doesn't need their help, he just can't remember. Together they pack up Bo's possessions, load some of the boxes and bags into Bo's car, the others into a moving truck with Jimmy's and then drive. Ellie and Richard make the trip with them and the three cars form a parade driving down the empty highway. The new house is in a small rural town, hours away from hot weather and unexplained animal attacks and LA. It's a two-story home bought with the sale of the home he and Ellie had grown up in and with some of their savings. It's his and Bo's home now. The white paint is faded and one of the steps creaks ominously when they walk up the porch but Jimmy can fix it up easily. He finds he's excited about the prospect. Richard and Ellie start directing the unloading of the boxes and furniture while the new occupants of the house step inside. \"What do you think?\" Jimmy asks nervously. He doesn't want Bo to feel pressured by all of this, is terrified that Bo is going to realize this is a mistake and demand to go back to LA. Bo reaches out, grasps Jimmy's hand and squeezes. \"I think it's great.\" DI They spend long evenings in the living room, on the couch, Jimmy sitting while Bo sprawls out resting his head in Jimmy's lap. The lights stay off, save for the lamp next to the couch. Some nights they watch television or a movie, other nights they light the fireplace and just soak up the atmosphere. Tonight the lamp stays on and Jimmy balances his textbook on the arm rest of the couch, chewing half heartedly on a pencil while his other hand brushes distractedly through Bo's hair. Bo for his part is sound asleep, long eyelashes smudges on his face and lips slightly parted. Bo loves the warmth from the fireplace, loves being warm in general. Sometimes Jimmy feels guilty about taking him away from the place they had lived their entire lives. Sometimes he doubts himself and wonders if Bo wouldn't have remembered everything by now if they had stayed in LA. But then he remembers the attack, remembers his own attack and tells himself that they had to leave. Bo shifts restlessly on the couch, murmurs softly and buries his head deeper in Jimmy's lap. He stops chewing on the pencil and his hand stills as he glances down at the sleeping man. He can see Bo's eyes moving restlessly behind closed eyelids. Jimmy brushes some stray strands of hair off of the other mans forehead and whispers reassuring nonsense and hopes that it will work. One thing that has become apart of their routine is nightmares- for both of them. But Bo jerks and curls in on himself, twisting as the nightmare worsens. Jimmy jerks back and just misses a flailing hand headed for his face. \"Bo.\" He shakes the other man and watches, as he starts awake. Brown eyes blink slowly, dart around the room and relax as they come to rest on Jimmy's face. \"Bad one?\" Bo asks and pushes himself up so he's sitting, leaning against Jimmy's side. \"Yeah.\" Jimmy wraps an arm around him and drags him closer. \"What was it this time?\" Bo sucks in a breath, eyes falling shut momentarily. \"Wolves.\" He murmurs, low and desperate. Jimmy forces himself not to tense and pulls Bo even closer and presses a kiss to the brown locks. \"It's just a dream.\" He says. \"Are you sure?\" Bo asks, meets Jimmy's eyes and Jimmy thinks this is it , this is where he tells Bo about werewolves and the supernatural and why they left LA and Bo remembers . But what comes out is, \"I'm sure.\" Because the truth is sticking in his throat and he doesn't want Bo to run because of monsters. DI Something wakes him in the middle of the night when the moon is high in the sky, almost full, what's left of the wolf clawing inside of him for some way to escape. Shadows slide across the room but he can see as clear as day. Bo lays on the other side of the bed, blanket hiked up high over his shoulder and tucked under his chin to ward off the cold. There's barely any space between them but it feels like miles. Brown eyes blink at him, troubled and clouded. \"What are you doing awake?\" Jimmy breaks the silence and clenches his hand in the sheet to stop from reaching out. They lay on their sides, mirroring each other. \"You talk in your sleep sometimes.\" Bo says so quietly that he almost misses it. \"What about?\" Jimmy's heart skips a beat and he has to force the words out, to sound casual. \"About wolves.\" Bo's voice is soft in the room and he cannot tell if there's any anger to it. \"About animal attacks.\" He pauses. \"About me leaving.\" Jimmy opens his mouth but he isn't sure what to say. \"Jimmy,\" Bo sits up and the blanket falls. Jimmy wants to reach out and pull it back up, cover Bo because he must be feeling the chill that lingers in the room. \"Tell me the truth about that night.\" Jimmy closes his eyes. He can see the restaurant where they went on their second date, can see the long stretch of sidewalk right by the woods. The wolf inside him senses it before he does but it's all a blur and he's trying to protect Bo from the other wolf but he's not really a werewolf- and he remembers how it felt like the ambulance took hours to get there and all the blood and- \"Okay.\" He says. He takes a breath. Opens his eyes and the images stop. And all he can see is Bo, maybe a little broken but so beautiful as the moonlight bathes him and so alive . \"Okay.\" He says again. DI One morning he wakes to the smell of bacon cooking. The other side of the bed is empty, sheets cool. Jimmy dresses, grabs the textbooks he'll need for class and his uniform for work and carries the pile downstairs, dropping it in the living room before heading for the kitchen. \"Morning.\" He murmurs sliding up behind Bo, wrapping his arms around his waist and pressing a kiss to his cheek. \"What are you doing up so early?\" Bo scoops some bacon onto a plate and balances it on the counter, leaning into Jimmy's embrace. He hasn't had bacon since back in LA. Bo had never asked for it and Jimmy had never bought it- but he loves the stuff. \"It seemed like a day to celebrate.\" \"And why's that?\" Jimmy asks, nuzzling Bo's neck, content. Bo shrugs and laughs when he finds a particularly ticklish spot. \"Just because.\" Is his answer. Jimmy laughs; Bo's good mood is contagious. He pulls back, grabs one of the other mans hands and spins him around until they're chest to chest, dancing to the radio quietly playing in the corner. \"We should go out to dinner to celebrate our day.\" Jimmy says and Bo spins him. \"Maybe some dancing.\" \"I thought we were dancing.\" Bo shoots back humour lacing his voice. Jimmy smirks and dips Bo gracefully; Bo barely weighs anything in his arms thanks to the wolf inside of him. \"And,\" Bo pulls him close again to whisper against his ear. \"I have a surprise for you.\" \"A surprise?\" Jimmy grins hands sliding down Bo's back and into the back pockets of his worn jeans. Bo groans and presses back into the touch, head falling to rest on Jimmy's shoulder. \"Yes.\" Bo says, a little breathlessly. The sound does all kinds of things to Jimmy that is going to make it difficult to get to class on time. \"But later .\" Jimmy pouts a little as Bo pulls back and a plate of bacon is presented to him. He leans against the counter and eats, shoulder bumping Bo's. The plate ends up in the sink, to be washed later he insists when Bo starts to protest and his texts and uniform end up in his backpack. Bo follows him to the door like he does every morning, before he gets on with his day working at the family owned restaurant a few blocks over, to see Jimmy off to his college classes. But today as Bo helps Jimmy with his coat and bag the smile he wears his huge like he has a huge secret and is holding it inside as long as he can. Jimmy can't wait to find out. Bo leans in to kiss him and the intensity of it is shocking. Their teeth clack together as Jimmy fists his hands in Bo's hair and hands settle on Jimmy's waist. They're pressed so close together that he doesn't think anything could separate them and still he wants to be closer. Bo's back hits the wall and Jimmy feels it through the kiss, feels it in the way that their lower halves are pressed tighter together. \"Jimbo,\" Bo lets his head fall back against the wall, breathless and laughing and amazing. \"You have to get going.\" Jimmy whines against Bo's throat, hands drifting down and resting on Bo's thighs. \"I can be late.\" He licks and nips and lets his hands wander higher, but Bo squirms out of his grasp, still laughing softly, eyes sparkling. \"Later.\" He promises. \"To celebrate . We can even skip dinner if you want.\" Jimmy grins and leans in for another kiss, a quick one because then Bo is turning him around and gently pushing him towards the door. \"Oh, Jimbo!\" Bo calls from the door as Jimmy is getting into the car. \"If you get the chance, we're out of milk!\" Jimmy promises to try and pick some up and drives off, smile still on his face. He's lucky, he thinks, to have this. Even if Bo doesn't remember what came before the accident, he thinks he's okay with it, okay with this being their life now. No- he's more than okay with it. And Jimbo , he laughs softly to himself at the nickname, he hasn't heard it…- the grin slides off his face- he hasn't heard it in months. Since before the attack. Jimmy slams on the breaks and if it were LA he'd probably have caused a severe accident. But considering where they live he gets an angry honk from the only other car on the side road. He has the car turned around as fast as he can, even faster to get back to the house. Jimmy nearly drops his keys as he tries to jam them into the lock and then he's in the house, hoping, praying that Bo hasn't left for work yet. \"Bo!\" He calls out a little desperately, tracking snow and slush into the house as he searches the first floor. \"Bo!\" \"Jimmy?\" Bo appears at the top of the stairs, black work shirt hanging open. His face is furrowed with concern as he takes in Jimmy's state. Then he's hurrying down the stairs and Jimmy climbs the first two to meet him. \"What is it? What's wrong?\" Jimmy tries to catch his breath but his heart is pounding so fast in his chest, it makes his head spin. \"Jimbo, come on- talk to me.\" Bo reaches out, cups his cheek and he looks scared. Jimmy never wants to see that look on Bo's face ever again. \"You remember .\" He breathes and a smile breaks across his face. \"What? I…\" The concern melts off Bo's face only to be replaced with a smile just as bright as Jimmy's. \"Yeah, I guess I do.\" \"For how long?\" Jimmy takes Bo's hand in his own and sits them down on the stairs, Bo half dressed and Jimmy still in his winter coat. \"A week or so? Maybe more? Probably more. I wasn't sure if they were memories or not. They just seemed like scattered dreams. But then I remembered how much you loved bacon and the name Jimbo .\" Jimmy feels giddy with relief. He leans forward, rests his forehead on Bo's shoulder and breathes in his mates scent. \"I don't remember everything, I barely remember anything right now but it's coming back to me, a little at a time.\" Bo cards a hand gently through Jimmy's hair, soothing. \"And I still don't remember my parents or LA but I remember you and it does explain a few things.\" Jimmy tenses slightly but there's no anger or fear in Bo's voice, only calm acceptance. His heartbeat is slow, steady in his chest. \"And I know I don't really say it but thank you.\" Jimmy lifts his head and Bo leans in, pressing a slow kiss to his lips. \"Thank you for helping me, thank you for protecting me, thank you, thank you, thank you.\" A kiss is pressed to his forehead and then his nose and then his lips again. Jimmy wants to say I would do anything for you , he wants to say thank you for giving me this , he wants to say a million things but he's smiling so hard it hurts and feels warm, happy, loved . \"I'm calling in sick to work.\" Jimmy says instead. \"And I'm skipping class, you're calling in to work too. We're going to celebrate! Just the two of us, dinner, movie, whatever you want.\" Bo grins and nods, tangling their hands together, standing and pulling Jimmy to his feet. \"How about we stay in?\" He suggests. \"Order some take out put on some music and dance .\" Jimmy squeezes his hand. \"I think it's perfect.\" ","Summary":" Disclaimer: Nope, don't own.

BonVentimiglia was kicking himself for what he had done. Coming out ofnthe closet. Admitting, finally, that he was a gay man. He had done itnunder the pretenses that Jimmy Eisenberg, his current crush, wasnactually a homosexual as well. But it hadn't gone down that way.nJimmy was straight, as straight as they come, and now he was datingnBo's ex-girlfriend. Bonsighed and pressed his face further into the pillow. He couldn'tnfigure out how to fix things now. He was friends with the boy he andnhis friends had been making fun of for four years, all of highnschool, and that boy was now with his girlfriend. How would theynreact when Brooke and Jimmy began spreading the news that Bo, thencaptain of the wrestling team, the most eligible man at school, wasnactually gay? His friends wouldn't hang out with him anymore, thatnwas for damn sure. He would most likely be ousted socially. Kickednoff the team he had worked so hard to captain. And he wouldndefinitely not be getting a date to prom. Bonjust wanted to fit in. That's all he had ever wanted. He wantednpeople to like him, to want to be his friends, to be everyone'snhero. He wanted to be popular. And he had screwed all of that up innone night. One night of finally knowing what he wanted. And hencouldn't even steal a kiss, of all things! \"Bo!\" Therenwas his mother's voice. She sounded worried, her frantic knocks onnthe door were enough to tell the teenager that. \"Bo,nplease open the door! I want to talk to you!\" Bo,nknowing he would regret this moment in about a minute, grudginglynopened the door a crack. \"Mom, I really don't want to talk aboutnanything right now. I really kind of just want to be alone.\" \"Bo,nplease, I'm your mother.\" Ruth Ventimiglia was a short, blondnwoman, with large brown eyes. Her manicured hand set itself on thendoor, as if she was going to push it open. \"Sweetheart, you knownyou can tell me anything. What happened tonight? Where did you go?nWhat happened to your nose?\" Bonsighed and continued to keep the door only part of the way open.n\"Mom, please. I don't want to talk about it.\" He knew how shenwould react to her only child being gay. She was Catholic. She wouldnthrow him out. \"I'm just not in a good mood.\" \"Didnyou go see Brooke?\" Ruth asked in a hushed voice. Her hand stillnhadn't left the door. Bonhesitated at that. His mom loved Brooke. She saw her as herndaughter-in-law already. How could he tell her that Brooke and he hadnbroken up? \"Yeah.\" He finally choked out. He knew he soundedntearful. Not over Brooke and he, though. He was definitely going tonstay friends with her. No, over her being with the one boy he was innlove with. \"We, uh, we…broke up.\" His voice was strained. \"Brokenup?!\" Ruth squeaked. \"You two broke up?! Why?\" Bonswallowed hard and looked away from his mother's eyes. \"We just…Indon't know, we weren't feeling like…She fell in love with mynfriend Jimmy.\" 'And so did I…' He added silently tonhimself. Why was she making this so hard? \"Mom, it's really nonbig deal, we're all staying friends. Brooke said she'll stillncome hang out and stuff, and she'll bring Jimmy with her.\" Oh,nplease, God, let her bring Jimmy with her. Just seeing him puts ansmile on my face, even if he's not mine. Ruthnsighed and took a step back from the door. \"Bo, you know I love younand I want you to be happy, always. If anything else happened, pleasentell me, okay? You have school tomorrow, too. Are you ready to faceneveryone? You can stay home, if you like.\" Thatnsounded like a great idea. Bo weighed the options in his mind. If henstayed home, he wouldn't have to deal with the questions that henwas sure everyone would ask about him and Brooke. He wouldn't havento tell everyone that Jimmy and Brooke were telling the truth, thatnhe was gay. But, that thought stopped him. He wouldn't get to seenJimmy. He wouldn't be there to hang out with him and Brooke. Henwould be missing out on seeing the boy he loved. \"Nah.\" He gavenhis mom a tight smile. \"I'll go.\" Ruthngave him a pointed look, as if she was trying to read his mind. Boncould feel a sweat breaking out on his forehead in fear that she knewnwhat was going through his head. But then she smiled. \"Okay, honey.nGet some rest today, huh? Just sleep as long as you can. It'll makenyou feel better for tomorrow. And don't let anyone make up liesnabout you and Brooke breaking up. They're just jealous of you.\"nShe leaned forward and kissed his cheek. \"I love you, Bo.\" Bonforced a smile on to his face. \"I love you, too, Mom.\" He closednthe door when he finally saw her retreat down the hallway to her ownnroom. With a sigh, he collapsed against the firm wood. \"I wish you could understand.\" XxXxXxXxXx Thenvery next day, Bo couldn't believe that he was back at school. Henfelt like everyone was staring at him. He continued to walk with hisnhead down, unwilling to meet the eyes of any of his peers. Just thenthought that they knew that he was gay scared him. He was not readynfor that to be spread to the people he had known since he was five. Atnlunch, he joined Jimmy and Brooke at the table. The can of soda innhis hand shook when he tried to pop the top. \"I'm quitting thenteam.\" He stated sadly. \"I can't be the captain of thenwrestling team if they all know I'm gay.\" His dark eyes werenfocused on the hard plastic top of the table. A heavy hand on hisnshoulder startled him. He slowly looked up and into Jimmy'snbeautiful eyes. He had to bite his lip to remind himself that henshould not kiss the boy. \"Bo,nyou can't do that. You worked so hard to be the captain. You'renthe best!\" Jimmy gushed, glancing to Brooke to back him up. \"Justnbecause you're gay doesn't mean you can't wrestle.\" \"Yeah,nBo.\" Brooke added, one hand snaking out to hold the dark hairednboy's. \"You're the captain. They can't kick you off. Likingnboys has nothing to do with talent.\" Bonsighed, feeling even more tearful for some reason. \"But it does.nThe other guys won't wrestle me now, because they'll think I'mntrying to get in their pants. I can't stay on the team after this.nThey'll eat me alive.\" He paused for a moment. \"And not in angood way.\" He sighed and took a deep swig of the soda. \"Itndoesn't matter what I did anymore. There's no way I can be thenwrestling captain when all they talk about is how much I must enjoynrubbing against the other guys.\" Jimmynand Brooke exchanged worried glances with each other. \"Bo, don'tnthink like that.\" Jimmy started, throwing his arm around the darknhaired boy's shoulder. \"No one's going to be that mean, they'venbeen your friends for ever.\" Itnwas then that three boys, all in varsity jackets with bulgingnmuscles, walked behind the threesome. One of them elbowed Bo in thenback, sending him almost face-first into the table while anotherncoughed 'faggot' into a closed fist. The other turned and begannto laugh. \"Hey, Bo, at practice today, can you try not tonpull down your shorts and ask us to fuck you? We're not into that.\"nHe pantomimed holding a body by the hips as he air-thrusted into hisnhands. The three jocks began to laugh wildly at their own joke. Bonturned his eyes to Jimmy, clearly thinking 'I told you so.' \"I better go to class.\" The wrestling captain sighed and threwnhis trash into a garbage can at the end of the table. \"Thanksnanyway.\" With that, he squared his shoulders and walked back intonthe building. XxXxXxXxXx Bonwas dreading his last class of the day, weight lifting. He did it tonkeep in shape for wrestling, the sport that he was planning to quit.nThis class was full of the other wrestlers. He changed hurriedly innthe locker room, before any of the other students showed up, andnfound himself in the weight room almost five minutes before classnofficially started. He began to warm up, sitting on the floor withnhis legs stretched out on either side of him. He bent towards firstnone, and then the other, making sure that he felt a pull in hisnmuscles before releasing himself from the stretch. He cocked one armnbehind his head. The dark haired boy grabbed his own elbow and pulledndown, listening to the satisfying pop that his shoulder made. Henrepeated the gesture on the other arm. A tap on his shoulder startlednhim. \"Wha?!\" He cried, turning. Anotherndark haired boy stood behind him. He was taller than Bo by at leastnfour inches. His body was thin, but muscular. His hair was semi-long,nthe ends brushing the back collar of his shirt. His eyebrows werenthick over his dark eyes. \"Hey, sorry. You're, uh, you're Bo,nright? The captain of the wrestling team?\" His voice was smoothnlike silk, and his hands fidgeted at his sides. \"I was, uh, I wasnjust transferred here and I wanted to try out for the team.\" Henblushed at Bo's intent gaze. Bontook a moment to register the words of the boy. He shook his headnwhen he realized he was staring. \"Sorry, uh, yeah, I'm Bo.\" Henreached out a hand to shake. The other boy reciprocated the gesture.nA bolt of electricity ran down his arm at the simple gesture. \"Andnyou are?\" \"Zacari.nZacari Quinto.\" Zacari grinned happily at the acceptance. \"Callnme Zac.\" He glanced over his shoulder when wrestlers, many of them,nbegan to file into the room. \"Oh, so this is the, uh, weightnlifting class?\" \"Yeah.\"nBo replied, moving to stand near the door. He couldn't help thenshiver that ran through him when Zacari followed. \"Coach is ournteacher. Only wrestlers take the end of the day weight lifting class.nYou have a schedule yet?\" \"No,njust signed up a little bit ago.\" Zacari blushed. \"I mentionednthat I wanted to wrestle and the office told me to find you. Theynsaid you're my 'go-to guy'.\" He glanced around the room.n\"Whoa, these guys seem kinda big, huh?\" \"Nah,nthey're a bunch of pussies.\" Bo whispered back. \"Don't letnthem know that I said that, though. They don't like me very much.\" \"Whynnot?\" Zacari asked, genuinely amused by the statement. \"You'renthe captain.\" \"It'sna long story…\" Bo didn't get to continue his speech before onenof his ex-friends, Craven, or Crue, as he liked to be called, steppednup behind him and began to massage his buttocks through his shorts.nBo moaned reluctantly at the very pleasurable feeling.n\"P-Please…don't…\" \"Ooh,nhear how the little fag is moaning for me? He wants me to make him mynbitch. Don't you, Bo? You'd like that.\" Crue hissed into Bo'snear as he began to reach for the waistband of his shorts. \"You wantnthis.\" \"Crue…\"nBo whimpered, grabbing at the other boy's wrists. \"Please, stop.nPlease.\" Thenwhole time, Crue's two flunkies, J.D. and Brodi, stood behind him,nlaughing. But suddenly, they fell silent. Bonopened one eye slowly. He hadn't realized that he'd closed themnin fear of being hurt. The first thing he saw was Zacari's angrynface, narrowed eyes seeming to burn into Crue's head. The next wasnthe way the other teen's hands gripped Crue's wrists so tightlynthat his knuckles turned white. \"Ifnyou weren't listening, the boy nicely asked you to stop. Either younlisten, or you will be hurt. Now, why don't you go back to yournwork out machines before I decide to break your wrists.\" Zacarinsaid in an even tone as he pushed the wrestler's hands back towardsnhis body. \"You're lucky I didn't do that immediately.\" Cruenglared at the taller boy as he backed away. \"Let's go, boys.nLooks like these two are in the middle of a little date. Keep it offnthe team, fags!\" He turned and moved to the other side of the roomnas the coach walked in. Bonraised his eyes to Zacari slowly, swallowing. \"Uh, thanks. Thanksnfor helping me out back there.\" \"Whyndid he do that to you?\" Zacari asked in a serious, low voice. \"Bo,nyou could get him on sexual harassment there.\" The taller boynplaced a warm hand on Bo's shoulder. \"Now I'm gonna worry aboutnyou all the time.\" Bonfelt a flush rise to his cheeks. \"He has good reason…\" \"Whatncould be a good reason to humiliate you in front of someone?\" Bonsighed and turned to the weight machines. He began to lift as hencontemplated his answer. \"I don't really feel comfortable tellingnyou right now…\" He felt tears sting his eyes and damned hisnemotional reactions. \"Maybe another time, though?\" Zacarinmoved to face Bo once more, looking as though he were ready to arguenbefore rethinking himself and smiling. \"Okay. Another time. Need anspotter?\" He put his hands under the dumbbell that Bo was lifting. \"Thanks.\"nBo smiled, though he was decidedly over-excited. He had been sonseemingly-disowned by his own friends to the point where he thoughtnno one would want to talk to him anymore. \"Thanks a bunch.\" \"Nonproblem.\" Zacari grinned back. \"Hey, think you could maybe trainnme a little bit in wrestling? You know, so I can succeed in tryouts?\" Boncouldn't help the way his smile stretched even wider at thenprospect. Zacari wanted to see him outside of class. He wasn'tnousting him. But he still didn't know that Bo was gay. \"Yeah,nsure. Come to my house after school today, there's no practice andnwe can just hang out. My basement is full of wrestling pads.\" Henchuckled. \"It'll be fun. I'll drive you.\" Zacarinsmiled back. \"Sounds good. Can't wait.\" Theynfell into a comfortable silence. Bo couldn't seem to stop hisnexcitement at having a boy, a cute, crush-worthy boy, over at hisnhouse to practice wrestling moves on. He had to remember to reelnhimself in, though. He didn't know if Zacari was even in to boys.nBut by the time class was over, Bo had begun to think… Maybenhis heartbreak wasn't so permanent.

This is the second part of Chances, which is now what I'm calling the 'Firsts' series. Chances was First Kiss. This is First Date... and we'll see how things go from there. Out of all the fic ideas and schoolwork vying for my attention right now, this won out. So, enjoy! Just three days ago, when Jimmy had strolled across campus with his arm around Brooke, he'd been one of the popular kids. The schools jocks acknowledged his existence in their realm without inflicting bodily harm. He'd felt the eyes of the cheerleaders follow him in and out of rooms. It was all so surreal. Like a dream… Only today it was a nightmare. By now, word had gotten around that he, Jimmy Meyers, had broken up with Brooke Mueller. And not only dumped her, but had been seen making out with her ex. Oh, ho, the schools gossips were having a field day with this. Hushed whispers, some discreet and others obviously not meant to be, followed the two boys throughout the longest school day of their lives. Every encounter with Brooke left her glaring death at them. Every cheerleader sniggered to herself and whatever friends she had around. The jocks were just looking for an excuse to injure them. Not that Jimmy and Bo minded. Bo had been kind of out since the day after the werewolf incident. Not everyone knew, but most of his friends did. Not advertising, but not denying either. \"Why is everyone so shocked? I mean, everyone thought I was gay before.\" Jimmy questioned, climbing into the passengers seat of Bo's Camaro at the end of the day. \"Yeah, but, as soon as everyone got over that piece of information, you kind of proved it right.\" The other boy pointed out, as he started he drive to Jimmy's. \"We still on for tonight?\" They'd spent the majority of their weekend together, both boys finding it surprisingly easy to just be around each other, to not have to prove anything to the other. On Saturday they'd gone to a movie - they'd both agreed to avoid any and all werewolf movies - and then gone back to Bo's for dinner. His two sisters had been thrilled that their brother was not as dating inept as he had seemed. They apparently were not fans of Brooke and they practically adopted Jimmy the second he walked in the door. Sunday was spent at Jimmy's because Bo had volunteered to help repaint the kitchen with Jimmy after the damage Jake and Zipper had caused. Which had led to questions like 'There are like a bazillion claw marks in your ceiling, why?' and 'Who would have thought blood was so hard to clean up?'. There had been more kissing, though. Lots and lots of kissing. Tonight, the plan was to hang out at Bo's and work on the assignments they had due in their Lit class the next day. Jimmy nodded. \"Of course. I'll be over around six.\" They spent the remainder of the drive talking about the ideas for their project, as well as anything else they could do once that was out of the way. \"Hey, you know there's a concert at Pacific Park tonight.\" Bo suggested, as he pulled up to Jimmy's house. \"If you wanna go.\" He hadn't been to one since Bowling For Soup played the night Jimmy was bitten. \"Yeah, sure.\" Jimmy agreed. \"Who's playing?\" \"John Mayer, I think.\" Bo replied. While Jimmy's taste in music tended to be slightly more obscure, they both liked a lot of the same bands, it turned out. The other boy nodded. \"Sounds good. I'll see if I can get over to your place earlier so we can get done with the schoolwork faster.\" He promised, not at all surprised when Bo leaned over to kiss him. It was become something close to an addiction, not that he was complaining at all. \"I'll see you soon.\" \"See ya.\" Bo echoed, as Jimmy climbed from the car. As it turned out, Ellie had no problem with him leaving early at all. In fact, she couldn't get rid of him fast enough. He suspected she had a date. \"I'll probably just end up crashing at Bo's, then.\" He assured her anyway, throwing a change of clothes into a spare bag. Bo only lived a short while away, so he was there in just a few minutes, his school backpack slung over his shoulder, the one containing his overnight stuff in hand. Megan and Katie, Bo's two older sisters, spotted him before Bo did, ushering him inside. \"Bo'll be down in a minute. I think he might actually be cleaning his room. Why couldn't you have come along like… five years ago? Imagine how clean it would be here!\" Katie teased, just as Bo came down the steps. Jimmy laughed, and Bo rolled his eyes at the friendly repartee he was all too used to. \"So, Jimbo. You wanna get this done down here or upstairs?\" \"Just what are you two planning on doing, anyway?\" Megan questioned, joining in on the mockery. \"Oh, you're just hilarious. It's a lit assignment, perverts.\" Bo responded, before towing Jimmy upstairs. Bo's room looked better clean, Jimmy decided. When he'd been here over the weekend, it was in a state similar to his own - like a tornado just ripped through it. Now it was devoid of the plethora of laundry that had been covering pretty much the entire floor. They could sit on the carpet - which was blue, Jimmy now noted, without sitting on tossed about magazines or dirty socks. \"I'm impressed.\" He teased. \"Do you clean for all your dates?\" Bo snorted. \"Nope. So far, just you.\" He grabbed a thick textbook and a notebook from the desk in the corner of the room and sat beside Jimmy on the floor. It was hardly a hard assignment. They just had to prepare for a discussion on one of Robert Frost's poems for class the next day. By seven o'clock they had studied 'Two Roads Diverged' enough to appease the teacher, as well as any siblings who happened to ask after how much studying they'd done versus how much making out. The answer to that inquiry would have to be about a fifty-fifty split. \"If I read that poem one more time, I think I'm going to scream.\" Bo declared, tossing the textbook in the general direction of his desk. \"The concert starts soon, right?\" \"Not for an hour or so. We could maybe grab dinner before, if you want?\" Bo proposed. Jimmy nodded in agreement, putting his own books away before he followed Bo downstairs. Bo hastily informed Megan of their plans and the two were quickly seated in the Camaro. Ultimately, they ended up at the same diner they'd been at the night Jimmy had broken up with Brooke. The food was good, and fast, but Bo chose it for the grin that appeared on Jimmy's face the second he realized where they were going. \"Thought you'd like it.\" He laughed, as they exited the restaurant some time later, now ready to go to the concert. \"Yeah, hard to believe it's only been three days, though.\" Jimmy replied, the two walking across the parking lot hand in hand. Louis, one of the guys from the wrestling team, and if Jimmy recalled correctly, the first one he'd beaten with his wolf strength, was unfortunately lurking about in the parking lot. He'd obviously spotted Bo's Camaro and had been waiting to spout off some choice words stating just what he thought about their ex-captain turning to the dark side. This having been nowhere near the first insult of the day, the couple ignored him, which triggered another burst of colorful vocabulary from the blonde. They both knew he wouldn't try anything further. Not after they'd all seen Jimmy power-lift Bo. They didn't have to know there wasn't a chance in hell of him ever doing that again. \"It's gotta be kinda weird for you.\" Jimmy commented, as they retreated to the car. Bo turned up the radio to drown out the outside noise. \"It is, a little. I had a few weeks on you, though. And if they can't handle it, that's too bad for them. Guess they weren't really my friends then.\" Bo leaned closer, his hand resting on Jimmy's neck as he pulled the younger teen toward him for a kiss. \"Plus, I got you out of it, so, it most definitely was worth it.\" Jimmy smiled. \"Can't argue with that, can I?\" \"Nope, my logic is just so undeniable.\" Bo stated, as he started the drive to Pacific Park. \"And so modest, too.\" He snorted. The park was already crowded by the time they had found a place to park and made it to the stage. It was a popular spot, obviously, and bands were there all the time, from local ones to major ones. The Santa Monica pier was filled with the usual sights and sounds of a busy carnival, the lights of the Ferris wheel flashing bright in the sky above them. \"They'll start playing soon.\" Bo shouted, over the roar of the impatient crowd. He and Jimmy had managed to shuffle pretty close to the stage with little difficulty, but it was clear they weren't getting any further, as made evident by the wall of people in front of them. \"Come on, I have an idea.\" Bo prodded, pulling Jimmy through the horde of fans and toward the ticket booth for the rides. He purchased two for the Ferris wheel and continued to lead the other boy toward the towering ride. \"Not only will we still be able to see and hear what's going on, I can think of some other things we can do up there.\" Jimmy playfully smacked him. \"Pervert.\" That wasn't to say, of course, that he wouldn't be participating in any of those other things. Luckily the line moved swiftly, and by the time John Mayer came out on stage, Bo and Jimmy had just climbed aboard the ride. They reached the top just as 'You Body Is A Wonderland' started blasting from below. \"Well, this was certainly one hell of a first date.\" Jimmy grinned, his hand settling on Bo's knee as they watched on. Bo smiled back, shifting closer. \"Hey, Jimbo?\" He asked, pressing a lingering kiss to the other's lips. \"Yeah?\" Another kiss. \"Thanks for giving me a chance.\" ","Summary":" Implications If I owned it, Brooke would have been pleasantly absent.

I had to write this for my Cursed OTP Jimmy/Bo, who were actually the first gay coupling I actually wanted to get together in a movie, mostly probably because Milo was just so hot and Jimmy was hot as his werewolf self and I started thinking of wrestling scenes turning into sexing----yeah---WAY off of course here! Okay, so, I hope you enjoy this short little oneshot about Jimmy/Bo. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Somehow, in some way, the curse hadn't lifted completely. Sure, he didn't turn into a big, hairy, drooling canine every full moon and he had no trouble handling silver, but Jimmy could feel the difference still inside of him. He still had that air of sexuality that attracted people, and he wasn't the big dork on campus anymore. But somehow, somehow things were different. Bo was his best friend now and Brooke was his girlfriend and yet to Jimmy it felt like it was the other way around. He was close with Brooke, they had a good time together, but whenever he was with her alone in his room and they were kissing, something just wasn't right. He---he couldn't react to her. And she was noticing that every time she tried to get intimate he'd find an excuse to stop and slide away. Things were getting tense between them because of it. And the fact that he was so close to Bo wasn't helping. Despite the fact that Bo had come out to the school he was still in the wrestling team and had inspired a couple of the boys in school to be brave enough to come out as well. And yet he was hanging around Jimmy more, and they'd become the best of friends, and there wasn't a day that Jimmy didn't find himself searching the handsome taller boy out, didn't need to talk to him, to see him, to fill himself on his scent . Yeah, to fill himself on his scent. That was just one of the reasons why Jimmy was so sure his inner wolf was still there. Funnily enough though it only reacted to Bo . He knew Bo's scent completely, felt a little anxious whenever he'd gone a while without scenting it, without seeing Bo's smile, without feeling the touch of his skin during one of their many casual touches. It'd gotten to the point where the day Brooke broke up with him he'd hardly even heard her, completely angsty and agitated because he hadn't seen Bo at all the whole day. He'd been looking around, trying to find his face amongst the sea of faces, trying to scent him above the other distracting scents. He hadn't noticed at all when Brooke had shaken her head and stalked off. His mind had just been on Bo. Just like now. \"Date?\" Jimmy asked, proud of the fact that his voice was so calm despite the fact that he was biting back the growl that threatened to reverberate out of his mouth at the very word. \"Yeah, a date .\" Bo announced, sitting on the floor by Jimmy's bed, game consol in hand. \"I wasn't going to accept it, but I thought about when I came out to you that night, remember?\" He blushed slightly. \"It made me feel good that you were there for me, and I think he needs that support right now.\" \"So to support his coming out you're going to go on a date with him?\" Jimmy couldn't keep the growl completely out of his voice this time as that cursed word was uttered. \"Yeah.\" Bo nodded, looking a little confused as to why Jimmy was so obviously upset. He was dressed in a tight black shirt that showed off the lean muscles his body boasted of, thanks to years on the wrestling team, and his hair was falling in black curls into his face. \"I don't think you should do it.\" Jimmy announced, making his eyes go back to the screen where Bo was currently kicking his ass due to the fact that he was also fighting with the instinct inside of him, the instinct that growled and snapped and ordered him to mark his territory, to make his 'bitch' know who his alpha was. Jimmy didn't think Bo would be too happy to know that the wolf within apparently considered him his bitch . \"Really?\" Bo asked, surprised, gaze on the screen as well, continuing to kick Jimmy's ass. \"Why not?\" \"I just don't think you should, especially if you're not really interested in this Dick.\" \" Dirk .\" Bo corrected, performing what should have been an illegal move. He knew all these cheat moves and usually Jimmy called him on them but tonight he was too preoccupied with other things to do so. \"Well, what if Dirk falls in love with you?\" Jimmy posed the question as innocently and nonchalantly as he could. \"You'd be hurting him more than helping him, you'd have made his first crush or whatever a complete heart break. You shouldn't do that to him.\" \"Well, maybe I could fall in love with him.\" Jimmy froze, not even pretending to be interested in the game anymore. \"Huh?\" He turned to Bo, unable to keep the frown off of his face. \"I thought you said that you were doing this to support him? When did feelings enter the equation?\" \"Well, now .\" Bo still wasn't looking at Jimmy, eyes glued determinedly on the screen. \"I mean, Jimmy, I, uh, well, I was thinking. I've been out for what, a year now?\" \"About.\" Jimmy nodded. \"And in that whole year, how many guys have I dated?\" Bo wanted to know, finally turning to face Jimmy. \"I mean, I've been on more of your dates with Brooke than I have on my own! That's pathetic , and so not fair on Brooke.\" \"Brooke and I broke up.\" Bo blinked, surprised. \"What? When?\" \"Two weeks ago.\" Jimmy admitted. Bo put down the consol and turned to Jimmy, frowning. \"Jesus Jimbo, why didn't you tell me?\" \"It's no big deal.\" And it wasn't. He hadn't even really paid attention to the breaking up, his mind had just been on Bo. \"Yes it is , you've been in love with her since you were in diapers!\" \"Fifth grade.\" Jimmy corrected. \"Same difference.\" Bo shrugged that aside as unimportant. He reached over and placed a hand on Jimmy's shoulder in a comforting gesture. \"I'm so sorry man, we, we'll work together and get her to take you back, okay? I mean, it's probably some of my fault anyway. I knew that she wouldn't be okay with you dragging me along every single one of your dates but----.\" \"No, I brought you along because I'd have more fun if you were there.\" Bo blinked in surprise. \"Uh, uhm,\" he ducked his gaze, coloring slightly as he pulled a black curl out of his face and behind his ear. \"Thanks Jimbo, that means a lot, but I don't think Brooke would understand the mixing of date night and Boys Night, you know? I don't think any girl will understand that.\" He pulled his hand away. Jimmy didn't like it. He didn't like the change this conversation was promising. \"So I was thinking, if I got a boyfriend we could do things like double dating or something.\" Bo announced, turning to look at the screen once more and picking up his consol. \"That way it wouldn't be like me crashing your dates or being the third wheel or anything, and who knows? Maybe Dirk's the guy for me.\" \"I doubt it.\" Jimmy winced. Maybe he'd said that a little too fast. \"Why not?\" Bo groaned, turning to look at him once more. \"You don't even know him, how can you know that he's not the one for me?\" \"Well, for one ,\" Jimmy began grasping at straws desperately. \"What would you call him?\" Bo blinked, obviously confused at the direction this conversation was going. \"How about Dirk ?\" \"No, you see, you don't call the one you love by their name .\" Jimmy announced. \"And there's nothing you can call the guy other than Dir or Irk , and let's face it, those two are retarded. You don't want a boyfriend you have to call Irk , it bodes bad on the relationship from the start.\" \"Jimbo, you're insane.\" Bo grinned. \"Names aren't really all that. I could just call him honey or something.\" Jimmy made up his face, putting down his consol, shaking his head furiously. \"No, no, no. You're gay, I get it, but you're not a honey gay. You don't go around calling people sugah or something. You know you wouldn't feel comfortable doing that anyway.\" \"Well, you could be right.\" Bo sighed, hugging his knees to his chest. \"So you don't think I should go out with Dirk because I'd have to call him Dir .\" \"Or Irk .\" Jimmy reinforced. Bo grinned, shaking his head. \"Don't ever think of ever becoming a lawyer, Jimbo, stick to being an adorable student for as long as you can.\" Jimmy pouted for a moment, ignoring the jab, wondering what else he could use against Dirk, which was hard considering that he had no idea who exactly this Dick character was. \"Well, what does he look like?\" Bo was silent for a moment, looking kinda uncomfortable. \"Well, he's about your height, has curly brown hair and brown eyes.\" Jimmy frowned. That actually sounded familiar. Maybe he had seen this guy somewhere. \"It's actually his looks that made me wonder.\" Bo admitted, looking kinda embarrassed as he ran his hand over his hair. \"He---he reminded me of someone and I thought, well, he's my type, and he's gay, and he likes me, so, you know, why not?\" \"So you told him yeah.\" \"I told him I'd think about it and tell him tomorrow.\" Bo corrected, scratching his head and dark gaze darting to the right. By Myself by Linkin Park began to play, and Bo reached for his phone, looking at the screen and blinking. \"It's him.\" \" Dick ?\" Jimmy couldn't help himself. \" Dirk .\" Bo looked at the screen. \"I can't believe you gave him your phone number .\" Jimmy grumbled, snatching the phone away from Bo right as the other boy was about to answer it. \"Hey!\" Bo tried to reach for his phone but Jimmy held it far behind him and somehow Bo stretched until he tumbled forwards onto Jimmy and they were wrestling for the phone. Jimmy decided to cheat and began to tickle Bo with his free hand, and Bo went down hard and fast. He let out some very unmanly squeals as he crumpled to the ground, Jimmy finding his way on top of him and continuing to attack while the phone call ended, neither noticing, both laughing and taking in deep, desperate breaths. \"You cheater !\" Bo let out between breaths, grinning broadly up at Jimmy. Jimmy laughed down at Bo, and only when the laughing subsided to soft, breathy chuckles, did he realize that that he was straddling Bo's hips, leaning over him, face so close . That wolf in him whimpered. Suddenly Bo stopped chuckling, gazing up at into Jimmy's face in intense silence before wetting his lips. Jimmy followed the movement with his eyes, realizing how his breathing got heavier, how he was unable to tear his gaze from those lips, all he wanted to do was kiss and nip and lick. The cellular rung. Bo's gaze went towards it, breaking the moment. Jimmy growled. Bo's gaze returned to Jimmy's rapidly, shocked. \" Jimbo ?\" Jimmy didn't even try to keep his wolfish tendencies in check anymore as he lowered his face to Bo's and trailed his nose against the curve of the other boy's cheek, taking in a deep whiff of his scent. \" Jim ?\" Bo's voice was barely a whisper. Jimmy found himself following the curve of Bo's neck, nipping at the skin, delighting in the taste of Bo's skin, in the sound of his shocked but pleased whimpers. \" Jimmy …\" The phone rang again. They both ignored it as Jimmy pulled away to look at Bo. \"How about you and I go on another date, a real one, one in which Brooke isn't the third wheel anymore?\" Bo's dark gaze was shocked, surprised, and hopeful. \"I thought I was the third wheel during those dates.\" Jimmy smiled as he shook his head. \"I think the three of us were unsuccessfully trying to convince ourselves of that.\" He whispered before he lowered his face until their lips were nearly touching. \"I want to kiss you.\" Bo smirked before bringing his hand to cup Jimmy's cheek and pressing upwards, melding their lips together in a kiss that should have happened a long time ago. Jimmy groaned and dropped the phone, wrapping his arms around Bo and pulling him closer, his inner wolf alive and howling in ecstasy as they melted into each other, neither hearing the now forgotten phone as it rung again. There was nothing in their world other than the wolf and his boy. Just like it should have always been. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Review?

He seemed to be incredibly intoxicated. Occasionally, the mad man refrained from pulling –quite frankly- disturbing faces, just for the purpose of yelling \"bitches out the way, the swag mobile is coming through, muthafukers\". He then met up with an archaeologist who looked sort of like Indiana Jones but there was something a little off so he only looked a teensy bit like Indiana Jones. Boobiehagen then sat down across the table from the Indiana Jones looking guy. \"MOTHERFUCKING ANTICHRIST! HOLY ARSEBURGERS!\" \"Calm yo' titties,\" replied the archaeologist. \"I'm a fucking archaeologist not a priest. Take your religious shit out of my face.\" \"No!\" \"Okay,\" the Indiana-Jones-looking-guy relented. \"So basically we're going to go into this really dangerous ancient tomb thing so we can see some paintings a mentally ill man did on a slab of rock at the height of insanity. Apparently they're paintings of the antichrist and are his exact alikeness. Also we're not gonna bring anyone who could help if the tomb thing caved in.\" \"Seems legit.\" The Indiana Jones looking guy finished his drink and then boarded the swag mobile with Boobiehagen. The archaeologist was perturbed by the lewd and obscene comments Boobiehagen yelled at the Arabic people who passed by them. Ultimately, he decided that the guy's name was Boobiehagen and it wasn't really that surprising. The tomb thing was really shit but Boobiehagen still took a picture of it and put it on instagram along with a few selfies. The archaeologist was starting to regret this. They entered the tomb thing and Boobiehagen became extremely animated and started talking about the whore of Babylon even though it was obvious a fucking painting of medusa. It was actually really weird because this was probably somewhere in Arabia, right? Why the fuck are there paintings of Medusa in Arabia? Isn't Medusa a gorgon from the religion of the ancient Greeks? Then again, an awful lot of modern Christianity takes an awful lot of influence from ancient religions. \"Hey look it's the antichrist,\" said Boobiehagen. \"OMG, this proves all the things I'm really sorry for ever doubting you!\" Whilst the tearful apology and acceptance of said apology took place a swagalicious crow sat down on the top of the tomb. He was wearing his fave snapback which said 'obey' on it and he was feeling pretty dope. The little bitches in the tomb thing were gonna fuck up some of the shit Satan planned so the crow did a thing and then the tunnel caved in and Boobiehagen and the Archaeolist died. I guess. I don't know, man. I mean they probably did.[Chapter 2] Seven years later, after the death of Boobiehagen and the Indiana-Jones-looking-guy, Damien was living with his sort of aunt (AN: It took me seven hours to remember how to spell that fuking shit, wtf?) and uncle. Damien was brooding because his military school uniform looked more swagilicious on his sort of cousin, Jamarcus. Jamarcus generally had a better wadrobe than Damien which was probably because Aunt Marion was a fucking bitch. Once she had gone so far as to give Damien's rhinestone jeans to Jamarcus. Aunt Marion really liked to snort cocaine and she knew that Jamarcus always kept a baggie of Colombian marching powder in his coat pocket. This was probably why she preferred the blond boy. The morning was drawing on and the two boys were almost ready to leave for their first day of military school. However, Aunt Marion started snorting cocaine with crazy straws in the middle of the corridor. Aunt Blonde-Lady-With-Short-Hair sighed and backhanded the old crone. \"Pull your shit together.\" \"Fuck you, it's my body and I'll do what I want with it,\" Marion hollered. To quote Ringo Starr, there was a long silence. Damien then decided he was four thousand per cent done and left, leaving Jamarcus alone with Aunt Marion. \"I don't think you should hang out with that boy anymore,\" said Aunt Marion. \"WTF. He's my cousin and we live in the same house, that's would be really fucking hard. Also he's my friend.\" \"So you're homosexuals?\" Aunt Marion gasped. \"What the fuck?! We're related. This isn't Texas, it's Chicago,\" replied Jamarcus. His feathers were somewhat ruffled by the fact that \"he's my friend\" automatically translates to \"we are boyfriends\" but then again Aunt Marion had found Damien's tumblr the other day. It was mainly a swag blog but every now and then \"fandom\" stuff popped up. Aunt Marion was now really aware of today's lingo and she was so proud of her self that she bought a pack of crazy straws for hardcore cocaine snorting. \"I don't believe you but whatever. Also, I think he stole some of your Colombian marching powder, so yeah. Have fun at your shitty little military school.\" \"I'm actually going to trumpet school. That was why I was holding a trumpet a few minutes ago.\" Aunt Marion then took the trumpet and threw it out the window which was really distressing for Jamarcus because he really liked that trumpet and had been eager to learn how to play 'Thrift Shop' on it. Jamarcus then left the house and got in the car with Damien. It was actually really awkward because he just realised he forgot his iPod and everyone knows car journeys suck when you can't listen to music whilst the scenery buzzes past your window. \"Why were you in there for so long?\" asked Damien. \"Because Aunt Marion murdered my trumpet!\" \"WTF?\" \"And I never learned to play 'Thrift Shop' on it.\" \"Isn't it 1978 right now? Has that song even come out yet?\" \"Of course it has, Macklemore is quite the lyrical genius. His music is so good that Doctor Who went back in time and gave everyone an iPod consisting of all of Macklemore's songs. And also 666 copies of 'Call Me Maybe',\" said Jamarcus, rolling his eyes at his sort of cousin's stupidity. \"Oh yeah, that was a really weird day.\"[Chapter 3] AN: SO I CANT REMEMBER THE EXACT ORDER OF EVENTS BUT I THINK THAT IT'S MILITARY SCHOOL, AUNT MARION'S DINNER PARTY, AUNT MARION'S DEATH, MILITARY SCHOOL, THORN INDUSTRIES The car pulled up outside of the military school. Jamarcus cried in adoration of the school. Damien was really impressed with his black coat though. It was a really nice coat. Even though he thought that brown looked better on him than black. A few minutes later the school decided to kick off the new year with an impromptu cheer routine. The cheer routine, unfortunately, involved trumpets which caused Jamarcus to break down in grief over the death of his beautiful trumpet. It was really embarrassing. Like when you go to the city centre with your friends and they tell you not swear so loudly (AN: REAL LIFE YO). Jamarcus then decided to get his head in the game and continued to do the cheer routine. \"Alright, so now it's time for your names.\" Sergeant Neff (AN: I think this is his name but im not actually sure. this was the first sergeant 2 come up on IMDB. I paid very little attention to the names. I spent almost the entirety of the film making jokes.) stood in front of a kid with huge glasses. The glasses looked really ridiculous. There was silence. And even more silence. Then an extra dash of silence for the last bit of silence. \"What's your fucking name? JFC!\" \"Oh! I thought you were going to give us names,\" replied Glasses McGee. \"If you read the narration, you'll find my name.\" \"Yes but you're supposed to say you're name despite of the fact the bitch writing this just wrote your name.\" \"My name is Glasses McGee,\" he replied. Then the twat head who just called me a bitch walked around and asked more people their names. He then stopped in front of Jamarcus. \"My name is Jamarcus Thorn.\" \"The fuck name is Jamrcus, though?\" replied Sergeant Neff. It was a fair point. \"I don't know. I don't even think it's a real name at the moment but we have all of Macklemore's music and 666 different copies of call me maybe so it's okay.\" Sergeant Neff shrugged and then moved on to the next kid and then fell in love. Like when Cecil went to the town meeting and Carlos smiled and he fell in love instantly. Only in this instance it was a 13 year old boy and he was scowling quite pointedly. \"Um, excuse me, Sergeant, aren't you going to move on to me?\" another voice said but Sergeant Neff ignored them so he could continue oggling Damien. Damien was starting to become extremely uncomfortable. The oggling went on for nearly five hours and everyone thought that the sergeant was just asserting his authority. \"That's a great name,\" sergeant Neff finally said before moving on. He hadn't actually learnt his name because he'd been to busy rewriting Twilight so that he and Damien were the main characters. However, this was a boarding school and so it wouldn't be that difficult to find out what his name actually was. Meanwhile, at the Thorn Manor, there was a dinner party and Aunt Marion kept trying to give everyone rohypnol. However, they were on to her and so they just didn't drink for the evening. Aunt Marion felt sad about the failure of her plan and started snorting cocaine in the middle of dinner which was really awkward. \"So, I don't like Damien and I'm going to give my share of the company to charity.\" \"What a lovely thing to do, Marion,\" smiled Ann. \"JUST KIDDING BITCH. I WILL SPEND IT ALL ON CRAZY STRAWS!\" \"Marion, no,\" said Richard. \"Then I'll snort cocaine with said crazy straws.\" \"Marion, stop,\" cried Ann. \"You can't fuckign stop me im invincible.\" Aunt Marion proceeded to swoop down from the table whilst yelling about the fact that she did 7 cocaines. The dinner party resumed in a harmonious conduct after the disturbance. Charles mentioned he had bought some slides from his latest excavation. Ann became extremely excited because she thought they were the kind of slides that you get in the park. She was extremely disappointed when they were just pictures of rock and sand. At one point there was actually a woman and so Ann asked who the woman was. \"That's Joan Hart. She's a pimp. I mean journalist and archaeologist.\"[Chapter 4] As the sun descended to a distant side of the Earth, the night sky blanketed itself over Thorn Manor. Aunt Marion began her nightly routine, firstly she retrieved some bath salts and added them to her bath. Afterwards she snorted the bath salts and ate one of the maids' faces. Aunt Marion then went to her bedroom to sleep. Little did she know that Swag Bro the Crow was waiting for her. Whilst Marion counted her drug money, Swag Bro the Crow replaced her nightly sugar cube with really hardcore LSD. Marion didn't like hippies and had therefore, never tried LSD. This was her first trip and was most certainly her last. She started hallucinating some really freaky shit. The shit was so freaky that she had a heartattack and died (AN: That's about as likely as me taking a horror film seriously). Swag Bro the Crow fled the scene of the crime by flying away. What a sneaky bastard! As Aunt Marion died, she could only faintly hear the cries of \"Caw caw, mother fuckers.\" When the sun pulled itself up from the distant country it had been shining over, Ann sauntered into Aunt Marion's so that she could wake the old bitch up. However, Aunt Marion was dead. It was really awkward because she had shit herself postmortem. \"Oh no! She's dead, that's so bad. I'm like so sad. It was probably all the drugs and... crazy straws,\" said Ann between a few early morning yawns. Whilst sergeant Neff was scribbling \"Damien Thorn + Sergeant ( AN: His first name is sergeant, gots a problem w/ dat?) Neff = Love 5ever\" in his 'Hannah Montana' notebook (AN: Doctor Who also gave everyone Hannah Montana stationery, fo realz), there were things occurring in what I imagine is the common room. \"ZOMG, the guy in dis pic is totes gay,\" said a person \"That's my dad,\" said Damien. \"Didn't he try to kill you in the first film?\" \"...No.\" \"I'm pretty sure-\" \"NO SUCH EVENT TRANSPIRED!\" And with that, Damien sauntered out. \"You're cousin is a douchebag,\" said a person. \"I know but I'm going to beat you up for saying that, despite the fact it's true,\" screamed Jamarcus! He then started delicately hitting a person with a marzipan spoon. Within 0.0002 seconds Jamarcus had been pinned to the floor by a person and was getting his 12 year old arse handed to him. It was almost as awkward as Miley Cyrus' recent performance at the MTV awards. Then Damien came back because he realised he had left his marzipan spoon in the common room. \"What are you doing? he asked. \"I'm beating up your cousin!\" \"No, what are you doing to my MARZIPAN SPOON!\" \"What?\" \"You squashed it, you piece of shit! Now I'm going to intensely stare at you!\" \"It's on! I am the best at it intensely staring,\" a person yelled as he threw his military jacket off to prepare himself for the intense staring session. However after a few minutes, a person threw himself against the wall whilst simultaneously shitting his pants. \"How did you make him do that?\" Asked Jamarcus as he attempted to reattach his arm to his torso. \"I don't know, it's probably nothing weird, though.\" \"Oh and thanks for defending my honour,\" Jamarcus added. \"Uh yeah, that what I was doing, for sure.\" Sergeant Neff then stormed into the room and everyone quickly gathered into an organized formation. He hadn't remembered why he had come in but he noticed his crush was there so he decided to act like there was a legitimate reason. \"There are surprise overly padded rugby... I mean football tryouts.\" He then noticed a person on the floor. \"The fuck are you doing? Get your ass up,\" he commanded, though he instantly regretted it when he realised that a person had shit himself.[Chapter 5] AN: So I rewatched the film and I know a bunch of shit isn't in order so ill try 2 fix it mayb the way im writing this not is deterior8ing in 2 bs sooo dont hold me 2 dat. Also I found that Sergeant Neff's first name is danyul but i fink sergeant is a better first name anywais Richard thorn's car pulled up outside 'The Thorn Blog' building, the most populour blog on Tumblr. And with all the staff manning it, there was no surprise the blog was so popular. They received hundreds of asks, submissions, and fanmail hourly. Since Bill had left his post, or died (it was hard to tell), a replace called Paul Buher had stepped in. Apparently Paul had a habit of being a cunt and ignoring asks because he didn't want to fuck with the post limit. He was almost as much of a dick as fucking JOHN FROM FUCKING ACCOUNTING WHAT A PIECE SHIT HE IS. Paul, a guy with an impressive moustache, another mustached guy, and Richard drove a mini swagmobile around the marijuana plant. In order to make better quality posts, Paul had decided that the bloggers should start smoking cannabis. The impressively mustached guy took a sprig of the cannabis to see how good it was. If he were to rate it on a level of 1-10 it would be a firm 5 and a half. \"Is it growing cannabis illegal?\" asked Richard. \"Yes but it's the 70's so it's totally fine!\" \"Sir dere is a fon cal fo yo,\" someone called to Richard. It may have been an intern called Brett, they were unsure. \"I'm fucking busy rn!\" \"But it's important!\" Richard relented and decided to answer the phone. Paul took some of the weed so he could smoke it later. Richard returned with a grave look on his face. \"Marion just died of a drug overdose, or a crazy straw overdose.\" \"Well, all this cannabis here is totally insensitive so we should just burn it!\" \"Wouldn't that just make everyone high?\" asked the man with the impressive moustache. \"What? No, defo not! That would not even happen, like ever! Come on guys that's just plain silly,\" Paul laughed, hoping they would take the bait. Meanwhile... Sergeant Neff sat at his desk and he was really happy to finally be alone with the object of his affections. \"Is there any point to this? You've been staring at me for five hours,\" Damien said. Sergeant Neff turned around, taking a deep breath. \"Yes, there's a point to this.\" \"Which is?\" \"I lo- I loudly think you should be the school quarterback.\" \"I didn't try out!\" \"We're both orphans!\" \"WTF?\" \"We have something in common.\" \"Okay...\" \"So... uh... yeah, do you want to be quarterback?\" \"Not really.\" \"Well you're going to be and you're going to be amazing at it.\" \"...Okay. Can I leave now?\" Sergeant Neff nodded. He then cried a bit. How could he fail so dramatically? No matter there was always next time. But for now he would reconcile with 666 copies of call me maybe and 'Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream'. Also FUCKING MEANWHILE... \"Holy shit we're in a museum,\" said Ann. Charles nodded. He was the curator of the Thorn Museum which was dedicated to all the best Tumblr posts The Thorn Blog had ever posted. They had set aside some room for a new exhibition about Charles' recent excavation in Arabia. It was going to be about some cray-cray religious shizniz. Ann didn't approve but decided not to say anything. She knew that if the Thorn Blog got too religious then they would lose followers and then they would lose money. \"Oh yeah, here's that photo of a ten headed dragon that you hated!\" \"Eugh!\" \"Hi bitches, I am not a pimp,\" a strange English voice called. It was a big floating red coat. Ann rolled her eyes, large red coats could be so rude sometimes. \"OMG! big bird why did you die yourself red?\" Chares cried. \"I'm not big bird you fucking idiot, I'm Joan Hart!\" \"Oh,\" said Ann and Charles in unison. That made a lot more sense. \"Yeah and I've got a cracking tale to tell. I swaggered up to Richard Thorn and at first he wouldn't let me in his car because he didn't want people to think he was talking to a pimp. Then he let me in and I told him his nephew is all fucked up and evil and he kicked me out. What a douchebag!\" \"Joan, that was only something John from accounting would do,\" cried Ann ANN-grily (AN: PFFT). \"Yeah, you can't say things if you don't know for sure.\" \"I do kno-\" Catching a glimpse of her reflection in the mirror Joan realised she had to change her clothes. Her coat was truly awful! She stormed out of the museum and straight to her car. AN: short chapter i kno but im like recovering from sickness atm and i got shit to do such as fake diary pages for my session w/ my psyhcologist[Chapter 6] An: Yesss, omens 2. Update. It's been a year. I'm a different person now. but im always loyal 2 u, omen 2... Joan was driving in her car in a casual fashion. Images of her reflection and the fashion disaster on her shoulders made her feel dizzy. She randomly pulled into a military school parking lot because Macklemore told her too (And you know what they say about Mr Mackleman). When she stumbled out of the car, haunted by her hideous coat, she stumbled around and then she saw him... John from Accounting! She cried and burped and vomited at the same time. Then she looked again and realised it was a fucking twelve year old who was being a lil' bitch because he was forced to be the school quarterback. \"Holy shiettt! That's the anti-christ!\" she said in her over the top 70's English accent. All of a sudden Swag Bro the Crow swooped down menacingly. \"Oh no! It thinks I'm a bird pimp! It wants to get bird bitches from me!\" She screeched like a wraith. She all but dove into her car and slammed the gas and began to speed away down the long, long country road. She didn't know where she was going, her only direction was away. About twelve minutes and forty nine seconds later, her car ran out of gas. She began to hyperventilate. However, she remembered the techniques the author's psychologist taught her and began to think positively. \"He couldn't possibly still be following me. He must know that if I ran away, I couldn't possibly have bird bitches to pimp out to him.\" Then out of the corner of her eye, a black shadow swooped down. She chanted \"It's nothing\" under her breath repeatedly. But when then glass shattered and Swag Bro the Crows beak poked through the window, she couldn't deny the truth. She opened the car door and began to run out onto the road in order to evade the predatory messenger from Hell. \"U WOT M8?\" Swag Bro the Crow squwaked. \"I can fly, you cheeky knut. You've messed up now, m8.\" The menacing creature began to peck at her hair and tried to lift her from the ground. She managed to slap him away, so he went in for the eyes and pecked them out. A gang of swaggy pals joined in and left Joan Hart unable to keep an eye out for Selena. She found herself walking out onto the road, in front of an oncoming truck. Hearing the trucks horn blare, she knew what was coming. In a last ditch effort to survive she activated her magical coat powers but only managed to levitate into the truck and die on impact and somehow fall underneath the penultimate wheel on the right and thus get pumelled twice. \"Wow, Damien, many people sure are dying!\" Jamarcus exclaimed to his Cousin. \"Shut the fuck up, Jamarcus! I'm trying to enjoy your shit birthday party that you made me leave my room from! God damn it, Jamarcus, I'm trying to go through my fucking goth phase and all I have is the g-major version of 'Call Me Maybe.' Why do you have to be such a fucking asshole?\" Damien responded, calmly. \"You, sure got that right pal,\" Hannibal Lecter said. But it was the 2012 version of Hannibal Lecter. \"Hannibal Lecter? What are you doing here?\" Damien gasped. \"Well, in the 2012 prequel to Hannibal everyone is much younger than they are in the original films, which are set in a time prior to the prequel. So, it's a cannonical storyline in season 5 that Doctor Who sends us back in time to fix the storyline.\" \"We all know that. We learned that in History in like 5th grade,\" Jamarcus said. \"He meant: why are you here at my party, specifically?\" \"Oh, I have provided a delicious banquet for your birthday, as head-caterer. I think you will especially enjoy the cake and the burgers.\" \"Wow, Hannibal, thank-you so much. You're like the nicest man in history. You're my hero,\" Jamarcus said. \"Yes, I'm really well known for being really nice and cool in general,\" Hannibal smiled. Richard Thorne lit the candles on Jamarcus' cake. Jamarcus began to try and blow out the candles but it was oddly difficult. \"Come on, Jamarcus, blow them all out,\" Damien laughed. Jamarcus stood up straight and turned to look at Damien with his hands on his hips. \"I'm sorry I don't have as much experience in blowing things as you,\" he said. Everyone \"ooh'd\" because they could not even believe how badly Damien had been rekt by Jamarcus swaggy parr. \"Bamboozled!\" Richard Thorn yelled, the pride in his heart was over-flowing with pride with his son's swag. \"He just got rused,\" Aunt Marion's ghost sighed happily before she was smothered by Hannibal, but no one noticed because shes a bitch.

It only has a part 2, because I was having trouble transitioning into the next scene, so... yeah, that'll be up in a day or two. Enjoy! There were several lasting effects still lingering from Jimmy's recent experience as a lycanthrope. He still subconsciously growled at times, a habit he'd developed when things didn't go his way. He still had some remnants of his wolf-strength, though he wouldn't be power lifting anyone anytime soon. And his senses of smell and hearing were still rather sensitive. Things he'd become familiar with as a werewolf, mostly Ellie and Bo, were still intensified by his wolf senses.[Chapter 2] When You're Heart Stops Beating Gah, I'm so sorry this took so long to get up. I had it done like last month but forgot to post it. Ummm... the boys aren't mine, original characters are. Hope you liked! Enjoy! After having been exiled to the waiting room and doomed to sit in one of the blinding neon orange chairs, Jimmy resigned himself to his fate. With an undetermined amount of time to wait for any news on his friend's condition, he called Bo's two sisters, Megan and Katie, as well as Ellie, to inform her he wouldn't be home anytime soon. It took Bo's sisters minutes to get there and another five seconds to start interrogating him on their brother's situation. Jimmy had met them before, under more pleasant conditions, a few days after the whole werewolf incident, and they had more or less adopted him into their family. Bo's parents, as usual, were overseas on business and could not be reached. After filling them on how he'd found Bo, the three of them settled in for the wait, alternating between pacing, sitting, and questioning the nurse at the information desk for news. \"They still haven't told us anything.\" Jimmy was seething by this point, hours later, shooting death like glares at the nurse who kept stonewalling their questions. \"Should it be taking this long?\" Before Megan could take her turn at pestering the on call nurse again, two uniformed officers approached them. \"Hello, I'm Detective Daniels, this is Detective Mitchell, are you here for a, ugh,\" the man consulted his notepad. \"Bo Reeves?\" \"Yes.\" The three of them said simultaneously. \"We'd like to inform you that four boys on the wrestling team who attacked him were apprehended. They confessed to the assault.\" Detective Daniels said. \"Are you the one who found him?\" He looked to Jimmy. He nodded. \"Yeah, that was me.\" The other detective spoke. \"We'll need to get a statement from you, as well as from your friend when he wakes up.\" \"Of course.\" Jimmy agreed. \"You, ugh, wanna do that now?\" The detectives nodded and he followed them out to the hallway to talk. \"Lemme know if he wakes up.\" He called back to Bo's sisters. It was hours before Bo was well enough to have visitors; he'd spent another 45 minutes with the police. He fell asleep just after the detectives had finished, and that was when Katie and Megan had been allowed in. It was only after Bo's older sisters had thrown a fit that Jimmy had even been permitted to see him. \"Bo,\" Jimmy called, unsure if his friend was awake, asleep, or even conscious again at all, as he slowly stepped into the overly sterile hospital room. \"Hey, Jimbo.\" He managed a small smile, letting it fade after he winced in pain. A wave of déjà vu overwhelmed Jimmy yet again as he approached, pulling the chair beside the bed closer. Bo was in quite a state, bruised, but no longer bloodied, he looked marginally better, but still nowhere near himself. The boys on the wrestling team had not shown mercy, that was for sure. And even after hours of unconsciousness, he still looked exhausted. \"You holding up okay?\" Jimmy asked, eyes still scanning what he could see, inventorying the injuries. Cast on his arm, black eye, busted lip, bandage on the head wound. He'd bet a few ribs were broken, too. Bo only shrugged in reply to his question. \"Your sisters are out there talking to the doctor now. If you want to see them.\" He said, trying to fill the silence that had fallen between them. \"No, stay.\" He answered quickly, still blinking away the cobwebs the pain medications were clouding his mind with. \"I, ugh, wanted to thank you for, you know…\" Jimmy dismissed the rest of the sentence. \"Hey, we're friends right? There was no way I was leaving you there. Did the cops tell you they caught the guys?\" \"Yeah, some of my old friends were the ones who orchestrated it.\" Bo looked totally defeated by the prospect. Jimmy, or rather the remnants of the werewolf, did not like the feelings emanating from his friend. So, he decided to try to take his mind off of it. \"So, ugh, I believe I owe you something, don't I?\" Bo shifted, looking even more uneasy. \"Um, Jimbo. You don't, you know, you don't have to kiss me. I'm sure I'm a mess right now and if you did ever do that, I'd want it to be cause-\" The other boy pressed closer, his lips brushing over his injured friends in a soft kiss. \"I wanted to?\" Bo only nodded, still partially in shock from the realization that Jimmy might like him back. \"That's good. 'Cause I did.\" ","Summary":" When You're Heart Stops Beating This has been in my 'In-Progess' folder for a while, but I finally "},{"Movie":"Omen","Title":"Brother, My Brother Part I: Promised","Author":"Kaen Okami","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7060685","Passage":"[Chapter 1] ~0~ Damien. Damien. Protect him. Damien. Every muscle in Adrian's young body burned with the ache of fatigue and his lungs screamed in protest; he had been running so hard and fast, speeding in the direction of the church. A small, idle part of his mind considered the irony of their dire situation: He and Damien both detested that place with every fiber of their being, and yet now both of them were racing for it as though their very lives depended on it, even though one of them was being taken quite against his will. The knowledge that Damien's life did depend on his catching up to Thorn, reaching them in time to save Damien, spurred him on even more. Faster. Go faster. Move faster. Save him. Can't die. Can't die. No. He can't die. Live. He has to live. I promised him… The memory of his own words, spoken five years before, flowed into his head once more, his own desperation burning them into his brain. \"Don't be scared, Damien. I'm your big brother. And I'll always look out for you. I'll never let anything hurt you, ever. I'll always be there for you. I'll always protect you.\" Protect him. He'll kill him. No. Get there first. Have to save him. He'll be killed. No. Damien. Can't die. No. Damien can't die… The hated building was in his sights now, towering over him; seeming to be staring down at him. The stained glass window looked like an eye to him, an enormous, contemptuously staring eye. It was like the church thought it was God Himself looking down on Adrian; resenting him and despising him. Loathing his very existence. Making him feel powerless and shunned by everything in the universe. He knew he was sprinting as fast as he could, but it felt like he was moving in slow motion through a world where everything else moved at double speed. The church grounds… hallowed ground …it was lowering his influence and strength…weakening him. He felt as though what strength he had was being sucked out of him…until he noticed something that urged him on and sent his power surging back. Thorn's car was already there, he realized as a sick feeling of dread crept through his insides. Parked and empty. Thorn had gotten there first! No! Damien! Adrian yanked the knife he had brought from where it was wedged in his belt. Thorn would not kill Damien. Thorn would die. Both Thorn and Adrian would die before he let that happen. He charged for the doors, fighting the forces that held him back, those forces that wanted nothing more than to see his beloved brother lying dead on the altar. Adrian did not intend to give them that satisfaction. The voices burst suddenly into his head in counterpoint with the frantic alarm-pounding in his brain that reminded him with each beat of Damien's peril. The voices physically pained him with their force, their holy power; intertwining with his own desperate thoughts as he bolted for the doors of the church, tightly gripping the knife in his right hand. You do not belong… Damien…Damien… You are a stranger to us… Don't let me be too late… You should never have existed… I have to save him… You are a creature of Hell… I won't let you die… You were born of pure evil… I was born so you would never be harmed… You must die… I'll kill them all first … You don't know how to love… I offer no mercy… You only know how to destroy… I will protect you… You are a disease to humankind… Let them all die if they harm him… You shouldn't exist… I exist for your sake, your protection… You are the spawn of the Devil… I will always be there…I promised him I would… The sons of Satan have no place on this earth! My promise…For Damien! Adrian burst into the church, and his heart froze with horror at the sight that met his eyes. Damien, the one thing on this god-forsaken earth he truly cared for, pinned down before the altar like a sacrificial lamb, his face screwed up in distress, squirming under Thorn's hand and struggling to get free. Thorn, his face contorted into something disturbingly inhuman. The vile, sacred dagger raised above Damien's small body, about to be thrust into his chest. The sounds of terror the sight of that dagger was eliciting from the five-year-old boy seared Adrian's heart and clawed at his soul with each passing second. That is one of the only things in the world I can't take. I cannot hear you in pain. I cannot hear you scream. Adrian took all of this in in a second. His feet were still moving, racing down the aisle for Damien, his eyes flitting between his brother's eyes, dark as his own, and the ugly shape of the dagger positioned above him. Damien's head turned, and his eyes became even wider with surprise at the sight of his older brother hurtling down the aisle towards him, grasping a knife of his own. Thorn had not noticed him yet, and as such was preparing the dagger to plunge it into Damien. A cry burst from the depths of Adrian's throat; half as a deliberate distraction, half a sound of tormented despair at the knowledge that he wasn't going to reach Damien in time - that he would be killed before Adrian could get between him and that dagger… \" Damien! \" Adrian screamed his brother's name at the top of his lungs. Thorn's head snapped to the side to look incredulously at him. Adrian bitterly imagined what he was thinking: Didn't I kill you already? Why did you come here? Why won't you die? How did you get here? Why can't you just die? Thorn kept glancing quickly from Damien, still wriggling on the floor; to Adrian, quickly and fiercely approaching with the knife clenched in his fist. Abruptly, he raised the dagger above his head, and this time Adrian knew there would be no hesitation: the blade would slice unhindered through the air and pierce Damien's heart in a matter of seconds. An image flashed into his mind of Damien. Barely hanging onto life, the dagger stuck into his chest, blood gurgling in his throat, trickling out of his mouth, the stab wound gushing more and more crimson blood, streams of the violently red liquid pouring out of Damien's body, streaming from the gash in his chest to spread over his torso and collect and form a sanguine puddle under the now-still body, the stomach-lurching scent of it piercing his nostrils. The other daggers stabbed into Damien's body in the shape of a cross to extinguish Damien's physical and spiritual being, drawing forth still more blood, sickeningly red rivers of blood, from the nearly-bled-white corpse; so much blood, so much, too much for such a small body to have held…the deep vivid red liquid blanketing Damien's unmoving form, trickling slowly into his blank eyes, the corpse lying in a scarlet pool of blood, the outskirts of it beginning to flow in narrow streams down the carpeted steps, equally bright, fatal red… \"Adrian! Help! \" Damien's high, terrified cry broke the vision's hold on Adrian. He was at the foot of the steps in another stride and in that same time the dagger had traveled halfway through the space between its starting point above Thorn's head and its destination in Damien's heart. Adrian dove for Thorn's dagger to block it with his own knife, his own body if need be, but he wasn't fast enough, he was going to be too late, too late… \"Adrian!\" Damien's voice again. But this time something strange happened. His vision began to blur and contort, like mist cleared away by the breeze. His consciousness became hazy and seemed to slip from the grasp of his mind. And the sanguinary scene before him vanished suddenly from his awareness, to be replaced by Damien's unafraid, curious face staring down at him. \"Adrian?\" he said, cocking his head to one side. \"Are you awake?\" Adrian made a drowsy, just-pulled-from-sleep kind of noise as he blinked several times and slowly sat up on his bed, as Damien moved back to give him space. He felt as though something was not quite right, but he couldn't pinpoint just what. He rubbed the back of his head, as the shadow of the dull pounding alarm remained, making him uneasy. He glanced toward Damien again, to reassure himself. Yes. Damien was fine. Nothing would happen to him, as long as Adrian remained vigilant. Adrian crawled out from under the blankets and sat down in front of Damien, his right leg dangling off the edge of the bed. Damien crept closer to him. \"What were you dreaming about?\" he inquired. \"What?\" \"You looked like you were having a bad dream. I came to wake you up for breakfast and your face looked like – \" Damien illustrated his words by scrunching up his face, jerking his limbs, and pawing at the air, clearly his idea of a frightened Adrian. He relaxed his body and waited for an answer. But Adrian didn't quite have one to give him. \"Uh…\" he muttered, racking his brain and trying to recover the faded fragments of the dream from his subconscious. But all he could recollect was a faint, misty dark-redness. And that could have been anything. \"I don't know. I can't remember at all,\" he said somewhat apologetically. \"Oh.\" Damien said simply, and hopped off the bed; apparently something else had attracted his attention. He started for the door and was halfway out of the room they shared when he stopped, seeing that Adrian was not following. \"Come on, Adrian!\" he said. \"Mummy's making pancakes ,\" he informed Adrian happily. Adrian smiled and slid off the bed. \"I just need to get dressed. Go on and eat, I'll come down in a few minutes.\" Damien nodded and started to run off when Adrian, remembering something, asked him to wait. \"I can't believe I almost forgot…Happy day-before-your-birthday, Damien,\" he said with a grin. Damien laughed and returned the grin before scampering out the door and down the hallway, and then Adrian could hear him rushing down the stairs; and he pictured the excited beeline Damien would make for the stacks of lavishly buttered pancakes, drizzled with sweet maple syrup. He strode across the room to his closet, running his fingers through his mussed goldenrod hair in an attempt to tame the bedhead and thinking. Damien had a great destiny before him, though he was hardly aware of it. In a few decades he would have risen to full prominence, humankind kneeling before him, Adrian his fiercest enforcer and resolute shadow. Their respective purposes fulfilled. Adrian laughed to himself, softly and gravely, as he dressed. All mankind at his feet someday, and all the Antichrist needs to be satisfied now is a plateful of delicious pancakes. How funny. He finished dressing and started for the door, and caught a whiff of breakfast cooking downstairs. The appetizing scent wafting up through the halls drew him towards the kitchen and immediately made him rethink his ideas about the pleasure the five-year-old Antichrist derived from a simple plate of pancakes. Suddenly it didn't seem so ridiculous to Adrian, and he licked his lips in spite of himself, hurrying his stride. All traces of his gruesome dream had disappeared from his mind. It did not trouble him further. All that was on his mind now was getting downstairs and enjoying breakfast with his little brother. The ultimate protector of the Antichrist has got to eat too, doesn't he? ~0~[Chapter 2] ~0~ Adrian silently gazed out over the horizon, taking in the picturesquely beautiful dawn sky. On the mornings when he arose early, it had become a pleasurable habit of his to slip out of the house to watch the sunrise (and when he could sneak away at dusk he watched the sunset as well). Every part of it intrigued and impressed him. The light, wispy clouds bathed in varying shades of magenta and lavender. The endless expanse of the sky turned into nature's canvas, painted flawlessly; streaked with brilliant reds, golds, blues, silvers, purples, and every hue imaginable in between. The landscape before him that stretched out to the edge of the horizon to meet the sky - formerly dim and melancholy under the cloak of night - becoming pleasantly bright; and optimistic, in a sense…the darkness washed away by the rising sunlight pouring over the earth. But what interested Adrian most was the sun itself. He leaned against the railing of the deck, gazing at the distant, brilliantly shining circle nestled in the soft, airy clouds; his thoughts wandering and focusing themselves around it. From so very far away, the sun looked merely beautiful. Only that, just something to admire from afar. Only having beauty to its name. The light and warmth something to enjoy, not marvel at. But Adrian also considered the strength behind that enjoyable light and warmth. His father – no, Adrian reminded himself, Robert Thorn was definitely not and never would be his father – Thorn has once shown him pictures of the sun up close on seeing his fascination with it, and he remembered his amazement at what he had seen, what he had really been looking at on all those mornings. The sun, he had discovered, was actually an enormous sphere of endless fire; a great, incandescent form suspended in the despairingly dark, star-studded void of outer space. It shone intensely, with a light that was unrivaled in its glory. And it seemed to Adrian that the sun knew it; and that was why it went on, proudly shining, forever. Thorn had told him, though, that scientists suspected that even the sun had its limits and someday it would run out of its power, and one day would burn no more. That was an idea that was unfathomable to Adrian. The sun appeared so powerful, like no force in the world could stop it from burning and shining. Even when the night fell and the moon rose to prominence in the darkened sky, the sun still shone somewhere else; Adrian just couldn't see it, was all. Adrian could not accept the idea that something so great could ever be ended, that such power could ever be restrained. If the force of the sun was so powerful, it could never be stopped, no matter who or what ever tried to. Complete and utter power, Adrian reasoned, was the ultimate force that could be attained by anything, and thus could never be defeated. Similarly, he concluded, the sun would shine forever, in radiant glory and splendor. Unhindered by anything, no matter what anyone thought, said, or did. \"Adrian! There you are!\" Holly . Adrian mentally cursed her for breaking the silence he had been pleasantly sinking into, and turned to face her. He smiled like he was happy that she had joined him, like she had not provoked the fury of hell by disturbing his peaceful morning. Childish naivety, that was the way to go, he had learned. And usually it was not difficult to do. He did not hate Holly. He was really quite fond of his sweet, empathetic caretaker, but there were times, such as now, when she could be very irritating to him. But he had always acted the part of a polite, guileless child, and as such, she never suspected him of doing anything bad on purpose. The act was even better for hiding his and Damien's true natures. Also, a fault Adrian had discovered in Holly was that she could be quite naïve and too trusting, and he had become adept at using this to his advantage. Again, like now. She wasn't angry that he had slipped away from his room very much at all. She looked more confused than angry with him. \"What are you doing out here, Adrian? You should be in bed right now!\" she chastised him with both hands on her hips. Adrian changed his expression to one of wounded innocence, and lowered his head slightly in faked shame. \"I was just watching the sunrise,\" he murmured. And enjoying it, too, before you came along. \"Just watching and thinking,\" he said, louder, looking back toward the sun. Holly looked understanding. \"I know, it's very pretty, isn't it?\" Adrian nodded. \"But it's still too early for you to be up. Come on back to bed; you can't be too tired to celebrate Damien's birthday today,\" she said, putting a hand on his shoulder and leading him back into the house. Adrian went with her willingly – he did, admittedly, get tired from waking early to look at the sunrise - but turned his head back for a moment to gaze longingly back at the sun, which was just barely showing itself, greeted by the swirls of color in the sky all around it. ~0~ \"Yo, Adrian.\" Adrian turned to see a seemingly human figure, clothed in ashen gray, materializing out of the heavy fuscous mist surrounding him. \"Shaeido,\" he returned the greeting. \"Boy, have I got things to tell you,\" the rangy, honeydew-eyed demon drawled, putting his hands behind his head and interlocking his fingers. He was always relaxed that way, like it was impossible for anything to go wrong in his world. He could be serious, angry, even grave, but Adrian had never seen Shaeido frustrated or stressed, and he didn't think he ever would. Sometimes Shaeido's casual coolness calmed him as well; but sometimes, like now, when he felt that sense of impending danger flow through his veins and chill his blood with apprehension, it irritated him that he could be so easy-going. \"So then tell me.\" \"Heh, heh…alright. I came to give you a heads-up about two new protectors coming to look after Damien soon. Straight from hell, just like yours truly.\" \"New protectors?\" Adrian didn't know why, but he had always felt somewhat territorial about his place as Damien's protector. It did not feel right to him to have others assume his role. \"Why? I'm doing fine on my own,\" he protested. Shaeido laughed softly. \"Yeah, but you don't know what's coming.\" \"If you tell me, then I'll know.\" \"Hmph. The new protectors will let you know.\" New protectors. Adrian did not like the sound of that at all. He almost felt silly about asking Shaeido the question growing in his mind, but he asked anyway. \"Am I…being replaced?\" To his chagrin, Shaeido laughed again. His laughter sounded like the high yip of a hound. But his words soothed Adrian's worry. \"No, are you kidding me? Of course you're not being replaced!\" He said the last two words like they were the most ridiculous things that could have come out of Adrian's mouth. \"You were born to be Damien's strongest line of defense. Everything about you was all planned out so you would be his most efficient protector. You literally can't be replaced.\" Shaeido's laughter ceased for a moment, and his face became serious. \"You want to know why you're getting reinforcements? Because, whatever you might think otherwise, you need them.\" Adrian cut Shaeido off. \"I've protected Damien well before, haven't I? Am I not doing a good enough job? What's wrong?\" \"Nothing you're doing is wrong,\" Shaeido assured him. \"But there was nobody coming for you before. There is now. The forces of God are moving, and they're coming fast.\" Adrian's blood froze cold. God. He inherently hated and feared that name, or more accurately, the force and being it represented. It both unnerved him and lit a wildfire in his soul. It shook him to his core and made him feel like he could take on anything daring to try and harm Damien. He looked at Shaeido, and saw the same feelings reflected in his grim expression. \"They're…coming after Damien?\" \"Yeah. And you can't repel them by yourself. Like I said, you were born to be Damien's strongest protector, but you aren't there yet. The new one will be training you as well as watching out for Damien.\" \"These new protectors. Tell me about them.\" \"Well, I'll just run through what's going to happen today, and you'll get to know them when you meet them.\" \"Alright then.\" \"You know your nanny? Uh…Harriet?\" \"Holly.\" \"Yeah, her. She's the one who's being replaced. See, one of the new protectors will assume the role of your and Damien's new nanny.\" \"What'll happen to Holly?\" Adrian asked, confused. \"Yeah…\" Shaeido said, dragging out the word. \"She's going to have to die,\" he said, like a doctor saying he'll have to give you an unexpected shot. \"What?\" Adrian had known, always, that the path to Damien's and his ascension to power would be littered with the corpses of those sacrificed in the name of their purposes. But the sudden news that Holly would have to be killed shocked him. \"Does she…I mean…Does Holly have to die?\" The words spilled out of his mouth before he had even begun to think about them, and he instantly felt foolish about them. There was no changing the way things had to be. He understood and accepted that. Shaeido fixed him with a stern gaze. \"You know it must happen this way.\" Adrian shook himself. Of course he knew. \"Yes. I was just a little surprised, is all. How is she going to die?\" \"The other protector will take care of that. Look carefully and maybe you'll see him at work. But trust me, Adrian…\" he began; rearing his head back, shaking out his long, unruly ebony-colored hair, and grinning widely, baring short, sharp, glistening triangular teeth. His forked serpentine tongue, abnormally long and colored like a rose veiled in mist, snaked between his reptilian fangs and hung lazily out of his mouth; and his eyes glowed eerily bright and streaks of lava-bright incarnadine color, which looked like molten rock but still possessed the likeness of flesh, slashed through his hair and skin. A human would faint with shock and horror if they saw Shaeido like he was now, Adrian thought. Part of his true demon form. He must really be excited. \"You'll really get a show today,\" he promised. \"Better than any entertainment Thorn could pay for.\" Adrian smiled. Shaeido was adept at arranging bizarre deaths. He was eager to see what his mentor had come up with for Holly. And maybe getting a couple new protectors to join him would not be so bad. He had never had anyone to teach him besides Shaeido. He was curious now, to meet them and see what they were like. \"Heh…yeah,\" Shaeido said to himself, his face reverting to its normal human form. He looked at Adrian. \"You understand now? You're okay with this? No problem?\" Adrian nodded. \"Uh-huh.\" \"Hey, and you enjoy yourself at that party, you hear me? I've got everything covered. You can just hang around and watch. Oh, and when she dies, it'll only hurt her a little, so don't worry.\" \"All right, Shaeido.\" \"Good boy. Now get up and wish your brother a happy birthday for me, will ya?\" The mist hanging in the air whirled around Adrian, and Shaeido's form was swept into it. And all of a sudden Adrian found himself lying again in his bed, on top of the covers since he had not felt like getting under them. He did not know whether to smile or frown on remembering Shaeido's visit, and his messages. He opened his eyes and sat up to see Holly helping Damien get dressed. When they saw that he was awake, they cheerfully wished him a good morning. Damien waved excitedly at him, as if they were a hundred yards apart and not just across the room from each other. \"Happy birthday, Damien!\" Adrian said, equally cheerful. \"Thanks, Adrian!\" Adrian looked at Holly's smiling face and smiled back at her. The smile became less friendly and more sardonic when she turned away from him and back to Damien. She did not know she was being replaced. Only Adrian knew. Sorry, Holly. You've got to go. ~0~[Chapter 3] Shaeido had explicitly told him to enjoy himself at Damien's party, and he was admittedly happy to do so. Thorn had organized an excellent party for Damien, and Adrian was impressed in spite of himself. The only thing he could not understand in Thorn's choice of entertainment was the clown he had hired. What in my father's name was he thinking? Adrian thought to himself, catching himself staring at the freakish-looking clown distributing balloon animals, while he practiced backflips on the inflatable bouncer. That is decidedly not funny, that is creepy. The guy looks like a child molester, for crying out loud! But his misgivings about Thorn's decisions on who to hire to entertain a yard full of kids were forgotten soon enough. He was happy enough seeing Damien grinning and laughing and having fun on his birthday. He wondered, as Damien grabbed him by the wrist and pulled him off the bouncer toward the slide, insisting Adrian join him in doing everything at the party, if this was what a parent felt, the emotions he felt for his brother. He sometimes wondered what Thorn and Katharine felt about Damien. Katharine's emotions, he guessed, were likely the closest to what a real parent would feel for her blood related sons; as she knew nothing about their adoptions or what had happened to her real children. He could not decipher Thorn's feelings toward them, with Thorn's knowing that they were adopted and his real children were dead. This lack of knowledge worried Adrian. He had made it a point to spend patient hours figuring out exactly what each person that affected his life knew about them and thought about them. He knew that knowledge was a major form of power, and holding this power over those that would oppose him and Damien was of great importance to him. One day, Adrian had known for a while, his \"parents\" would discover the truth about their adopted children, at which point they would become his enemies and he would have to fight them, for Damien's life and his own. He had given careful thought over the years as to how he would fight this battle when it came, but his plans were constantly shifting, as new knowledge, ideas, and variables were thrown into the mix of swirling thought. The truth was Adrian was not at all sure he was prepared. This thought only reinforced his feeling that perhaps he needed the knowledge a new protector would have to pass on to him. As he pondered this, a bright flash he noticed out of the corner of his eye distracted him, and he turned to look and find out what had caused it. A photographer, of course. The flash had come from a camera, from the photographer taking a picture of a smiling Holly. Adrian briefly wondered why. Holly was pretty enough, but likely the photographer wanted pictures for a newspaper. Why would he need to take pictures of Holly? And why would a newspaper cover a politician's five-year-old child's birthday party, anyway? Wasn't there anything better to cover? Adrian dismissed these thoughts from his mind, and was about to follow Damien to the carousel, when something else caught his eye. It was a dog; a burly-looking Rottweiler, hidden by the shade of a large tree, a distance behind Holly. He would have wondered how a dog had gotten onto the property without Thorn's consent if he hadn't felt a strange presence about this dog, a sort of familiarity. A feeling of friendliness and comradeship directed at him. It was similar to the feeling of kinship he and Shaeido shared. He stared at the dog and it stared back, smiling its dog-smile with the pink tongue lolling out of its mouth; the kind that seemed to be saying, \"Hello.\" The way the dog looked at him made him feel like it knew him. Like they were friends that had met years ago and not seen one another until now. \"Adrian?\" said a puzzled voice behind him. \"Adrian? Don't you want to come?\" Damien had turned back to see why he was not coming to ride the carousel with him. Adrian did want to, but he also wanted to stay and find out if his perceptions were true, if this dog was one of the new protectors Shaeido had said were coming. \"You go ahead; I'll be there in a minute. I'll come as soon as I can.\" Damien deemed this acceptable and ran off. Adrian turned back to study the dog, and realized that he wasn't the only one who had caught sight of it. Holly was looking at it too, he saw. But it didn't look to Adrian as though she felt the same connection to the dog as him. It had caught and held her gaze, as it had done to him, but it was different. They stared at each other, amber canine eyes into coffee brown human eyes, but the effects were not the same. Holly did not sense what he had sensed in the dog's eyes, which burned with unusual intelligence. She did not feel what he felt. In fact, it didn't look like she felt much of anything at all. A sort of dullness had come over Holly's eyes and body, and she looked like her spirit had been washed away, had faded out of her. Her movements looked numb and unconscious of her will as Adrian, puzzled as to her sudden change in behavior, watched her walk away as if in a daze towards the house, or more accurately, to the tool shed. It looked to Adrian almost like she was in a trance of some kind. That's it, he realized. She's hypnotized. Or something like that. The dog hypnotized her – no normal dog could do that! It's got to be one of the new protectors. He whipped back around to face the dog again, fearing for the fleeting moment it took for Adrian to turn back around that it would not be there. He worried that it had disappeared, its purpose completed. But he found it had remained there, and that it had not moved from its position at all. He gazed at the dog again, now knowing for sure what it was. It may have been his imagination, but its canine smile seemed to widen a little. Then it closed its mouth and assumed a more formal expression. Adrian wordlessly raised his right hand to it in a half-wave. The dog in turn bowed its large head, never breaking eye contact with Adrian. Then it turned and loped away into the trees. Adrian, after watching the dog retreat into the shadows until it vanished from his sight, turned and walked off, remembering what Shaeido had said about leaving everything to the protectors, to rejoin Damien. He had to admit, that carousel looked fun to him, and he was eager to try it out. All I have to do now, he thought, is sit back and wait to see how Shaeido plans to finish off Holly. ~0~[Chapter 4] \"So, Damien,\" Thorn said, puffing a little as he jogged alongside the carousel to talk to Damien and Adrian, and looking quite comical in doing so. \"How are you enjoying your birthday?\" \"Great!\" Damien chirped with a grin. \"Glad to hear it,\" Thorn said, ignoring the chuckles coming from the people around him, Adrian included. \"Are you both having fun?\" \"Uh-huh!\" \"Yes,\" Adrian said, with a half-fake smile. \"But sometime,\" he added, voicing a conclusion he'd come to a few minutes ago. \"I want to learn to ride a real horse!\" Adrian had imagined himself astride a strong and proud midnight black stallion with a starlight-silver mane, galloping faster than anything across varying terrain: across a solitary plain of soft, downy grass falling before the breeze with crystal clear waterfalls and rivers around, deep in a pine forest at sunset, mountain ranges with the wind tearing through the air around him, something with a lot of glorious fire that he hadn't come up with yet… Thorn's voice broke into his thoughts. \"All right, Adrian, I'll see about getting you riding lessons.\" Adrian smiled, for real. He'd enjoy that more than riding an artificial horse around and around in aimless circles. Damien seemed to agree. \"What about me? Can I do it too?\" he asked excitedly, wanting to do the same fun-sounding thing as Adrian. \"I don't see why not.\" \"Yay!\" Adrian laughed quietly at his brother's exuberance. Then his attention was directed elsewhere by a disembodied voice. \"Damieeeeen…Damieeeeen….\" Damien's head jerked up at the sound of his name. Someone was calling him, and it sounded strange to Adrian. He and Thorn, and Katharine, who was nearby, looked over too. \"Damien! Look at me! I'm over here!\" Katharine lifted Damien off the carousel horse and held him in her arms. Damien pointed towards the house. \"Look, there's Nanny!\" It was Holly. Adrian climbed off the carousel and went to stand beside them. He stared intently at Holly's form, trying to see what she was doing. She was standing on the very edge of the balcony –the same one, in fact, that Adrian had been watching the sun rise from just a few hours before – with a strangely frozen, smiling expression. He studied her more carefully, trying to figure out what was happening and what was going to happen. Adrian wanted to see if he could figure out what Shaeido's plan for Holly's death was before it was fully executed. He thought he had it. Holly was in a precarious position on the edge of the balcony, in danger of easily falling. Adrian thought she might fall from that height and die that way; an image of her broken corpse, her limbs splayed out and her body twisted and bent at awkward, abnormal angles, the odd smile frozen on her lips, flashed into his mind. He frowned. Rather uncreative, Shaeido. I expected something a bit more inventive coming from you . Then he noticed a small detail about Holly he had missed before. Adrian's eyes traced the length of rope tied to the roof above Holly's head, stretching down to Holly and snaking around her neck, and realized what Shaeido's real scheme was exactly one second before Holly jumped off of the balcony. The first pang of shock pulsed in Adrian's heart at the same time Holly's neck snapped, and tore through his veins as her body swung back and smashed into the window. It numbed him, stunned him. Whoa , he mouthed, and made a mental note never to underestimate Shaeido's talent of causing an imaginative death again. You promised over-the-top entertainment, Shaeido, and you definitely came through. He glanced at Damien to see how he was taking it. Katharine, speechless with horror, had mouthed, My God ; and turned Damien's head away to shield him from the sight. She looked down to Adrian, and he made like he was shocked and terrified – turning himself into what he thought a regular child would look like if he had just witnessed his nanny leap from a balcony and hang herself. Thorn put his arms around the three of them to comfort his family. Katharine welcomed the embrace, but Adrian slipped out of it to Katharine's other side, to see how Damien was. He seemed to Adrian rather dispassionate about his nanny hanging dead from the balcony. But he was only a child, and he probably didn't really know what had just happened. He looked at Adrian, only his eyes moving, his head resting on Katharine's shoulder. Adrian put a comforting hand on his brother's back, just in case he was frightened at all. Damien smiled, happy to have Adrian with him, and Adrian returned the smile, glad that Damien seemed to be okay. Then Damien's eyes flicked away suddenly, and then he looked back at Adrian and said, in a muffled voice since his head was still on Katharine's shoulder, \"Look.\" Adrian looked, and saw the dog. It was smiling in a self-satisfied way, pleased with itself at having done its job well. Hey, boss, it seemed to be saying. Are you pleased with me, too? And Adrian was. The dog had carried out its task thoroughly and efficiently, succeeding also in impressing him enough for Adrian to accept it as having the makings of an excellent protector for Damien. He glanced at Damien, who did not seem to feel threatened by the presence of a large fanged animal so close to him. He slowly lifted his little hand and wiggled his fingers in a friendly wave at the dog. See you later . Adrian turned back to the dog and bowed his head slightly, keeping his eyes locked onto the dog's face . A job well done. You're dismissed. The dog turned and bounded away into the bushes. Adrian stepped away from his grieving parents to look unrepentantly at Holly's body, swinging slightly due to the momentum. I wonder what your replacement will be like, he wondered idly. ~0~[Chapter 5] Adrian sat on the edge of his bed and watched Damien as he busied himself with getting his paints, brush, and paper set up on the floor. It had only been a day since Holly's death, and Thorn and Katharine had been concerned about how witnessing her sudden suicide would affect Adrian and Damien, but they need not have worried. Damien seemed to have forgotten what had happened already. He apparently didn't think it was that big of a deal. Adrian had been informed of Holly's fate beforehand, and as such was nonchalant about the whole affair. Katharine had thought his cavalier attitude strange at first, but had evidently jumped to the conclusion that it was the eternally calm Adrian's way of \"dealing with his own emotions,\" as he had overheard her telling Thorn last night as he was walking past their door, on his way to the balcony to view the sunset and hoping that the mess of shattered glass from the broken window had been cleared away. Adrian did not think much about Holly's death, but thought constantly about what would come of it. The second new protector was supposed to arrive soon, and Adrian wanted to make a good impression on him or her. He didn't want this protector to think of him as an immature, incompetent child who was unfit for his monumental task of watching over Damien. He had to show he was just the opposite. He was inexperienced and young, true, but that didn't necessarily mean he wasn't a capable protector. But how was he to prove himself? He rolled over onto his back and stared at the ceiling, as though it might hold the answer to this question. Finding no such revelation, Adrian pulled himself back up to a sitting position and focused his gaze on the flames dancing in the fireplace behind Damien, who was busily painting. Why is there a fire burning in a room with a two unsupervised kids in it? he wondered. Then his attentions were directed back to Damien. \"I'm painting a tiger!\" Damien announced to him. He lifted his hands like paws, curled his fingers into claws, and let out an aggressive but very non-threatening roar. \"Graaaaawr!\" Adrian smiled and did the same to humor Damien. \"Raawr.\" \"Wow.\" Damien was impressed. \"You do it really good! You sound just like a tiger!\" \"I do?\" Adrian was unaware that he was capable of making realistic sound effects. Put that on my résumé for proving my worth. \"Yeah!\" Just then the doorknob clicked, and Adrian's eyes snapped to the door immediately. Damien either didn't notice or didn't care. It opened, and a woman that Adrian estimated was in her early forties stepped in. Adrian went into a watchful, catlike stance as he observed her. He sensed the same aura about her that he sensed around Shaeido and the dog that had sent Holly to her death. A new protector? She noticed Damien first, as he was the more conspicuous of the brothers. He looked up and noticed the newcomer, and he regarded her with curiosity, not shyness as usual. They looked at one another for a second, Adrian a silent, unseen observer, and then the woman said cryptically, \"Have no fear, little one. I am here to protect thee.\" Damien smiled, finding the statement friendly. To Adrian, it was almost ominous. Adrian's thoughts were confirmed. This woman was the new protector. \"I'm Mrs. Baylock,\" the woman said, in a normal voice. \"I'm going to be your new nanny.\" \"I'm Damien,\" Damien said brightly, gesturing to himself with the paintbrush. \"I'm five. And that's my big brother Adrian. He's eight.\" He turned and pointed across the room to Adrian, motionless on his bed in the shadowy corner, the light of the flickering fire illuminating his impassive face and alert, attentive eyes. Mrs. Baylock turned more slowly to face Adrian and appraised him, smiling. She looked back down at Damien, who had resumed painting his tiger, which to Adrian resembled an orange and black striped potato with blocky legs, a straight and rigid tail, and a head that looked like an upside down tree stump with pointed ears. He wasn't paying attention to either Mrs. Baylock or Adrian, absorbed in his artwork. Mrs. Baylock looked up at Adrian, and turned to go into her new room, which was adjoined with theirs. She motioned with her hand for Adrian to follow, which he silently did. Once they were in her room, it didn't change much at first. She continued to look him over; and Adrian stood and solemnly looked back, doing the same. She honestly did not look very strong or very impressive to him. But she was likely acting to avoid suspicion, just as he was; and he realized he probably did not look very strong or impressive at first glance himself. His eyes shot down to look at himself: dressed in his favorite outfit of a brilliant flame-red collared shirt and coal-black jeans, his short, thick gold hair combed neatly back, and his simple yet nice-looking pendant of tiger's eye in its place around his neck. He had examined his eyes in mirrors occasionally, and knew they burned with intelligence and inner power. He exercised and practiced fighting techniques that Shaeido had taught him frequently, thinking with satisfaction of his well-worn punching bags, and he liked the way his wiry limbs looked. He was certainly stronger than most other children his age. Then again , he thought wryly, most other children my age aren't the offspring of Satan . But the point remained: he was still just a child, a state that was irritatingly unfit for fighting Damien's enemies to the death. \"You don't need to look so tense. You're not in trouble,\" Mrs. Baylock said. She smiled knowingly. \"Trying to look intimidating?\" Adrian hesitated before admitting, \"Yes. Actually, it comes sort of naturally. Thorn is always saying 'There's no need to look so battle-ready all the time, Adrian'.\" He half-smiled, appreciating the irony. \"If he only knew,\" Mrs. Baylock agreed. \"So. You are Damien's current protector?\" \"Yes, I am. And you are one of the new protectors?\" \"Yes,\" she said. \"The second will join us soon. I believe you've met him already?\" She spoke lightly, having the same feelings about Holly's death as Adrian. \"He was the Rottweiler I saw at Damien's party, right?\" \"Correct.\" \"Is he a hellhound?\" \"I suppose you could call him that. But enough about him. It's you I'm interested in.\" \"Where to start then? Do you want to know about my position? My knowledge? Or my abilities?\" Mrs. Baylock thought for a moment. \"Let's begin with what you know. You are fully aware of your heritage?\" \"I know that my biological father is Satan, and I inherited much of his powers. I'm far stronger, faster, and more agile and intelligent than I should be for my age, for instance. But, I know nothing of my mother except that she died giving birth to me.\" Adrian's voice rose at the end of his sentence in an inquiry, and he raised his eyebrows questioningly. He had always wondered and wondered who had been his mother, and he hoped wildly that he might get some clues as to his mother's identity from Mrs. Baylock, since Shaeido had never told him anything regarding her. But she shook her head, saying, \"I'm sorry, Adrian. I wasn't told about your mother. Only Damien's.\" \"In that case, who is Damien's mother?\" He was in the dark on her identity as well. \"Her name was Maria Scianna.\" Mrs. Baylock seemed hesitant to tell him the rest. Adrian did not want to wait patiently. \"And…who was she? What kind of a person was she?\" The time it took for Mrs. Baylock to answer was agonizingly long, and he was greatly disappointed by the answer: \"My apologies, Adrian. But I'm not sure you're ready to know all the details about your and your brother's births just yet.\" Adrian opened his mouth to object almost before she was done speaking, but closed it again and swallowed hard. \"I understand.\" \"Now, let me hear about your knowledge of the purpose that comes with your origins,\" Mrs. Baylock said, deliberately changing the subject. \"It was determined that the Antichrist should have the most powerful protector as possible, and I was specially born to be that protector. My purpose in existence is defending him from those who want to kill him before he can realize his own destiny. When he is old enough to begin doing that, I am going to assist him, and act as his second-in-command.\" \"Excellent,\" Mrs. Baylock said, with the air of a teacher applauding a student. Suddenly, she laughed and remarked, \"You realize that when you both come of age and Damien is fully aware of his own purposes, you'll be taking orders from your little brother?\" She inclined her head to the door, beyond which Damien was occupying himself. Adrian laughed a little, finding it difficult to picture himself one day taking orders from his five-year-old brother. \"So is that all you wanted to know, regarding my understanding of what I'm meant for?\" \"One more thing. You are completely aware of what your purpose entails? The things you will have to do?\" Adrian knew what she meant. \"I accepted the sacrifices that would have to be made long ago,\" he said with finality. \"I see bloodshed and death as necessary. It's something that must happen for our purposes to be fulfilled. It doesn't disturb me.\" \"And you realize the danger that you are in? That you will have to fight and endure a great amount of pain?\" \"I know. I've been trained to fight for a long time now and pain…\" Adrian thought for a moment, looking hard for the right words to describe his feeling. \"Pain just doesn't seem to bother me most of the time. I feel it like any other person, but it affects me differently, I think.\" Mrs. Baylock looked slightly puzzled by his explanation, but seemed to understand to some extent. \"I see. You have been trained for your purpose? By who?\" \"Do you know a demon named Shaeido?\" Mrs. Baylock's eyes narrowed slightly, and she frowned. She knows him , Adrian thought, though he guessed from her expression that their relationship was far from friendly. \"Shaeido? Untamable dark black hair, vibrant green eyes, fair skin? Wild and roguish, reckless, devil-may-care personality? Does that sound like him?\" Adrian nodded. \"That sounds exactly like him. He's my mentor.\" \"I'm genuinely surprised you're so well-mannered and conscientious, with someone like him teaching you. He's known well, first for his recklessness and second for his…prowess in certain areas.\" \"Do you know him personally?\" Adrian wanted to know. \"I don't want to offend you by saying 'unfortunately,' but I have to: Unfortunately, yes, I have met him and have had to work with him personally.\" Adrian felt the need to defend his friend. \"He's an excellent mentor. He's taught me very well.\" \"I'm sure he has. If he weren't one of the most powerful, he wouldn't be mentoring you. I have to say I don't like him very much, but one has to respect his skills if nothing else. But where were we? Ah…So, what kind of fighting has he taught you?\" \"He mainly taught me all kinds of martial arts: Karate, kung fu, jiu-jitsu, tae kwon do, judo, and some others. He also taught me to use anything I can for defense, and to be resourceful that way.\" \"Have you ever had to use what he taught you?\" \"Well…No, not yet,\" Adrian admitted. \"But he warned me I would need to soon. They…They're coming for Damien soon, right? And I need to be ready.\" Or he could die. Mrs. Baylock's voice and expression were equally grim. \"Yes. That's why I'm here; to make sure that you both are safe.\" She looked a little sad, but she looked him firmly in the eyes when she said 'both.' She's trying to say I matter as much as Damien? Adrian thought, contemplating raising one eyebrow and deciding against it. I suppose I do, but either way Damien is the priority, whether she thinks so or not. And I don't need to be looked after. I can fight for myself , he thought, and said so. \"I'll fight to the death to protect Damien if I have to. Don't underestimate me. I can take anything.\" Adrian looked away and tried to make himself sound brave. When he looked back, Mrs. Baylock was still looking at him intensely. \"You're not afraid?\" It sounded like half a question, and half trying to catch him out or challenge him. The words struck a nerve in Adrian, though he would never show it. Ever since he had fully realized what he was expected to do, he had expended a lot of effort beating the tough core of fear at what he was facing down inside of him so that it barely existed. The fact he tried the hardest to deny was that it still did exist. To his mind, in a truly powerful being, there was no room for any fear. He clenched his fists and teeth, and he felt his eyes narrow. \"Fear is not a part of me,\" he declared, trying to make himself believe it. \"Fear is a human emotion. Fear is for the weak. I am not weak!\" Mrs. Baylock looked at Adrian for a few moments before quietly responding. \"Fear is universal. Fear is felt by all beings. There is no escaping it. If you feel fear in yourself, you are not weak.\" \"Then why does the slightest edge of apprehension make me hate myself for feeling it? Why does it make me feel less than what I could be? If fear does not make you weak, why do I feel weak because of it?\" \"Because fear is not weakness. It's giving in to your fears and letting them overcome you; that is the weakness.\" Adrian was taken aback. Was that what was going on? How was that happening to him? He could not be weak. And he did not give in to anything! \"That…I'm not weak like that!\" he protested. That didn't sound good . \"I'm not weak at all! I have to be the most powerful, if I'm to perform my duty properly! How could I be weak?\" Mrs. Baylock waited to let him breathe for a moment before answering. \"You are not weak in terms of physical strength. Pure power runs in your blood, and merely needs to be cultivated, enhanced, and refined to bring out your full potential. But you are still young, and a young mind, even one as brilliantly precocious as yours, Adrian, can be easily corroded. If something can make a profound effect on you, you could begin to doubt yourself, or believe something you are not meant to believe.\" Was she trying to say Adrian would stray from the path he had been chosen for? Never . \"I won't do that. Nothing will make me abandon my fate.\" Mrs. Baylock locked her gaze onto him. \"Even the strongest of warriors have a weak point. You must learn to overcome yours before it becomes your downfall.\" Adrian remained silent. He had no protestations or any other words. What could he say to this? \"Go back with your brother. It's getting late, and I can't keep you here all night. There will be work to do, but not just yet. Besides, your dreams are quite important to you, aren't they?\" She said this with a knowing smile. Adrian nodded, not returning the smile. \"Yes. My dreams are either prophetic, or Shaeido wants to talk with me, but can't see me in person.\" Adrian paused before asking the next question. \"Shaeido can shape-shift, and appear in a person's dreams, and he has several other abilities as well. I don't know the extent of a demon's power, since Shaeido was the only one I knew until now. Do you have the same abilities?\" \"Well, I can shape-shift. You don't think this is my actual form, do you?\" She moved her hand downward from her head as she said this. \"But I can't affect dreams the way he can. That is a talent possessed by few of us, and Shaeido happens to be one who possesses this talent.\" \"Okay. I'll go now?\" When she nodded in farewell, Adrian turned and left the room. He took his former position on the bed, staring at the ceiling. Fear. She had said his weakness was fear. No –his fear was getting the better of him, and that was what was making him weak. The true impact of that hit Adrian as he lay there, thinking about what Mrs. Baylock had told him. The hidden shadows of fear within him, silently gnawing at him and preying on his emotions, were a virtually unavoidable weakness. He was unwilling to admit even to himself that the realization unnerved him. But , he contradicted himself, how can that be? There is nothing I truly fear. I am not afraid of any creature. I am not afraid of any human. I am not afraid to fight. I am not afraid to die. Adrian's mind then turned to his inherent enemy. I have never faced anyone of God before. I don't know exactly what I should do to fight such an opponent, that seems so strong and prevalent. I have no idea what I'm up against, really. Could that be it? Fear of the unknown…It seems so natural, but it's also glaringly obvious that it would make one weak… Adrian rolled over on the bed, thinking he had pinpointed the source of his apparent weak point, and thinking of ways to rectify it immediately. But his thoughts stopped short when he caught sight of something else. His little brother, humming something to himself as he put the finishing touches on his tiger painting. On completing it, he held it up and admired his work, and smiled with satisfaction. To his eyes the amateurish painting was a work of art, worthy of a place on the refrigerator, even. He got to his feet and placed the painting on his nightstand. He turned and saw Adrian watching him. \"Do you think Mummy and Daddy will like it?\" he asked brightly. \"I think they'll love it, Damien,\" Adrian answered quietly. He realized now, what the immense fear was that made him weak. But it also made him strong. He didn't want to get rid of it, but he couldn't have it impairing him. What was he to do? His greatest fear was losing Damien. The nagging fear that he would fail the mission he had been born to complete, and some mistake on his part would cause Damien's death. This fear had, he saw now, grown inside him when he learned in full what exactly he was to protect Damien from, and had taken root there. It made him rethink his every move, and threatened to become consuming of him. But protecting Damien was his only duty in life. The very real danger that he could fail, that Damien could be killed, was a large part of his motivation. The fear that his brother could die if he failed greatly fueled his innate drive not to fail, to keep that fear from coming true by giving everything of himself to defend him. Adrian rolled off the bed suddenly. With this new protector for Damien and apparently trainer for him, and this new revelation of weakness in himself and the need to combat it, he needed sometime to be alone to think things over. Without a word, he crossed the room to the door. He turned his head to see Damien watching him, his dark eyes at first questioning, but then remembering where his older brother often went in the mornings and nights. He nodded assent, and turned his attentions to his toy chest in the corner, looking for something else to do before bed now that his painting was done. Adrian pushed open the door and strode out to watch the sun set. ~0~[Chapter 6] \"So, don't you like me better than Baylock?\" Shaeido said. It wasn't a question. Adrian internally smirked. He did prefer Shaeido over Mrs. Baylock, thought he liked both of them, but he decided to tease Shaeido a little. \"Well,\" he began, drawing out the word. \"I don't know. You're more familiar, but she does seem more experienced than you are, and just a little bit smarter, too.\" Shaeido scowled. \"Don't get mouthy with me, kid.\" \"I'm just expressing my opinion,\" Adrian said, letting the impish smirk show on his face. \"And I can see her in person more, too.\" That was a true benefit of having more protectors, Adrian thought: being able to actually see them and interact with them. As close as he and Shaeido were, he barely ever saw him in the real world. Usually, they only saw each other and spoke when Shaeido contacted Adrian in his dreams and that wasn't all that often, either. He didn't like to admit it, but it made him a little upset. Shaeido's expression softened, knowing Adrian didn't like the fact that they didn't see one another that much. \"Hey, I wish I could see more of you too, kid. I kind of like you, you know. But I've got things to do, places to be, people to stalk.\" \"What do you mean?\" Adrian asked. He knew Shaeido well, but what he did exactly, outside of mentoring him, was a mystery to Adrian. \"Well, since you asked,\" Shaeido began, with a grim smile. \"See, there's this priest. He's called Father Brennan. And he's a traitor to our kind.\" \"Traitor?\" Adrian was confused. Priests were humans, and didn't \"their kind\" mean satanic creatures like Shaeido and Mrs. Baylock, both demons, and he and Damien, the children of the Devil? \"Ah,\" Shaeido said, picking up on Adrian's confusion. \"Let me explain. Brennan used to be a follower of Satan, but he feared divine punishment for his sins when he died, and so left our ways and became a priest.\" \"I see. So why is he so special that you're hunting him down?\" \"You catch on quick, kid,\" Shaeido remarked. \"He might not be so bad if he only converted and performed normal priestly duties, but he's doing things that have made him a threat, and we can't let it go unpunished.\" \"What has he been doing?\" Adrian asked, and then thought the words over for another moment. \"Wait. He's become a threat? Do you mean…he's trying to go after Damien and me?\" \"You got it. Clever boy. What Brennan's doing is trying to warn Thorn of who his children truly are. He's tried to tell him that you both must be dealt with or more people besides Hallie -\" \"Holly,\" Adrian automatically corrected, internally bristling at what this man was doing to them, and the fact that he had been referred to as Thorn's child. \"Yeah, her…Anyway, what he tried to say was that the two of you would cause more deaths than hers. He tried to tell Thorn where you really came from – \" \"Wait. You keep saying, 'tried to.' Did he not get the words out completely?\" \"No. And Thorn, like any reasonable person, didn't believe what he had been able to say, and had Brennan escorted out of his building. It's kind of like in a horror movie,\" he added. \"Skeptics never believe the truth until too late, and by then, it's well, too late.\" Shaeido shrugged his shoulders in an 'Oh, well, too bad' gesture and smiled. \"It's a safe bet Thorn won't realize the exact kind of trouble he's in until he's in too deep and drowning, and then…\" Shaeido made a cutting motion across his throat with his index finger to indicate death. Adrian said, \"Is there any way I could know just what he said? I'd like to know exactly what he told Thorn.\" \"And what would you do with that?\" Shaeido asked. Adrian knew he expected a certain right answer before he told Adrian anything, but was confident that his was the right answer. \"I want to know how much Thorn knows, and how much knowledge he might be able to gain from it. I also want to know what he thinks about what Brennan is trying to tell him, if any effect has been made.\" \"In short, you plan to use Brennan's meeting with Thorn to your advantage.\" \"Right. So do I pass?\" Shaeido gave a short laugh, and then nodded. \"All right, kid, have a look.\" His bright honeydew eyes locked onto Adrian's dark black ones, and appeared to flash once. Adrian saw a spark of white, and then he saw what could only be Thorn's office. He was not 'there,' rather, he was seeing the events like a movie that took up all of his vision. Adrian took in the scene before him. Thorn sat at his desk, with two men standing before it. They had clearly been in the middle of conversation when Thorn's intercom buzzed. \"Yes?\" Thorn answered it. \"There's a Father Brennan here to see you,\" a businesslike female voice said. \"Who?\" asked Thorn. \"A priest named Father Brennan from Rome. He says it's a matter of urgent personal business.\" Rome, thought Adrian. Isn't that where Damien and I were both born? \"Never heard of him,\" Thorn said, a light note of puzzlement in his voice. \"He says he just needs a minute. Something about a hospital.\" Our births, Adrian realized. That's what Brennan tried to tell him. He still detested the man, but part of him was eager to hear whatever Brennan could get out, to see if he could unravel by himself the secret of who had brought him into the world. \"Donation time?\" one of the men in front of Thorn suggested, and they both smiled as though the idea were funny. Thorn, however, did not, and said, \"All right, send him in.\" \"Didn't know you were such a soft touch,\" the same man said, and he turned and left the room. The second man paused in his departure. \"On that trip to Saudi Arabia,\" he said, \"why isn't it the right time?\" Saudi Arabia? Adrian thought, confused at first, then he remembered Thorn talking about taking a business trip there, and that it could be quite profitable for Thorn Industries. Did he decide not to go? \"Oh, it's personal, Tom, I just…don't feel like leaving home right now.\" Ah. So he skips a chance to strike it rich in Saudi Arabia in favor of time at home? Adrian thought, wondering about the reason behind Thorn's decision. Somehow I don't think that's all. Both men had left the room, making way for Thorn's new guest. Adrian eyed the large silver crucifix hanging on a chain from his neck, standing out against his dark suit, and identified him as Father Brennan. \"Yes, Father?\" Thorn asked conversationally. \"We haven't much time,\" Brennan said, in a quiet, cryptic voice. \"You must listen to what I have to say. Clearly, he's not the kind for pleasantries, Adrian thought. \"All right, what is it?\" asked Thorn, keeping the same light, friendly tone, but Adrian could sense slight unease behind it. \"You must accept Christ as your savior. You must accept him now.\" Thorn definitely looked uneasy now, and confused. \"Forgive me, Father, but didn't I understand that you have a matter of some urgent personal business?\" But Brennan offered no direct explanation, yet. \"You must take Communion,\" he went on. \"Drink the blood of Christ, and eat His flesh.\" What? Adrian thought, wrinkling his nose. Now I'm even gladder I'm not Catholic, Christian, or anything of that nature. It sounds revolting. \"For only if He is within you can you defeat the sons of the Devil!\" Brennan declared. \"I see,\" Thorn muttered, and Adrian knew he had no idea what Brennan was going on about. \"They've killed once! They'll kill again!\" Brennan said, his voice rising, and becoming more urgent. \"They'll kill until everything that's yours is theirs!\" Technically, it was Shaeido and that dog that killed Holly…not me or Damien. Adrian mentally contradicted. But then again, I may have to do some killing later on…Brennan has a point. \"Father, would you please – \" Thorn started to say something, but Brennan cut him off. \"Only through Christ can you fight them!\" he said, stepping closer to Thorn's desk. Then his voice lowered again, entreating Thorn to listen to him. \"Accept the Lord Jesus. Drink his blood.\" Thorn apparently didn't think it was worth dealing with this priest any more, and reached for the buzzer to call somebody. \"I've locked the door, Mr. Thorn,\" Brennan said. \"Yes?\" the female voice answered Thorn's call. \"Would you send for a security guard, please?\" he said calmly. Brennan knew his time to speak was short, and his voice betrayed his desperation. \"I beg you, Mr. Thorn, listen to what I have to say.\" The buzzer went off, and the female voice answered Thorn in a slightly worried voice, \"Ambassador Thorn?\" \"I was at the hospital, Mr. Thorn, the night your son was born!\" Brennan said. That grabbed Adrian's attention. He listened now with rapt attention. \"Which of my sons are you referring to?\" Thorn asked coolly. \"The younger boy. I witnessed the birth.\" Adrian's heart fell at the knowledge that Brennan wasn't saying anything about his mother, but he perked up again when he remembered that finding out about Damien's mother was almost just as good. Almost. The buzzer went off again. \"Sir?\" \"I beg you…\" Brennan said again. The buzzer went off insistently. \"All right,\" Thorn muttered to the intercom. \"Stand by.\" Then he addressed Brennan. \"What do you want?\" \"To save you, Mr. Thorn, so Christ will forgive me.\" Adrian remembered what Shaeido had told him: that Brennan had once followed Satan, but had converted to faith in God. He thinks that if he can save Thorn's life by helping to kill Damien, he will receive retribution for his sins? Well, I can't let him succeed, no matter how desperate he is. \"What do you know about my sons?\" Thorn demanded. He looked both apprehensive of and interested in Brennan's words, and Adrian knew that he too wondered about the birth parents of his children. \"Everything.\" \"And what is that?\" asked Thorn, with strained calmness in his voice. \"The younger one. I saw its mother.\" Adrian's heart leapt at the words, but his lip curled in contempt when Brennan referred to Damien as 'it.' \"You saw my wife,\" Thorn said. Adrian didn't know what he was trying to do by attempting to keep their adoptions hidden, but he knew one thing: His lie wasn't fooling any of them. \"I saw its mother,\" Brennan repeated, more forcefully. \"You're referring to my wife.\" Thorn's voice had grown more aggressive as well. \"Its mother, Mr. Thorn!\" Thorn stood up angrily. \"If this is blackmail, then come out and say it! What is it that you're trying to say?\" \"Its mother was a jack – \" Brennan's shout was cut off by the security guard kicking down the door, after his repeated knocks had gone unanswered. \"Everything all right, sir?\" he inquired. \"You sounded strange,\" said his secretary, who had followed behind the guard. Adrian realized it was probably her voice on the intercom. \"The door was locked.\" \"I want this gentleman escorted out of here,\" Thorn ordered, looking at Brennan. The guard obeyed immediately. \"Okay, let's go.\" He took Brennan by the upper arm and started to half-lead, half-pull him out of the room. Brennan did not resist, but turned back to Thorn once. \"Accept Christ,\" he said simply. \"Each day. Drink His blood.\" Then he allowed the guard to take him out of the office. The secretary stayed behind a moment, looking worriedly at Thorn. He nodded for her to go, and she left, closing the door behind her. Thorn was left alone in the room with a somber, contemplative expression on his face, and then Adrian's vision swept away into a whirlwind of color. In a few seconds, he found himself back in the gray misty world of his dream, and Shaeido stood before him. \"So, what did we learn from that?\" he said, and then went on before Adrian could open his mouth to answer. \"That Christians are vampires.\" He guffawed at his own joke, which he had probably told a thousand times before, but Adrian wasn't satisfied. Tactical information was useful to an extent, but now that the vision was done, Adrian was frustrated that he hadn't gotten the answers he had been looking for. \"Don't joke with me, Shaeido,\" he said. Shaeido's grin faltered, but he didn't seem too affected. \"I did learn a lot from that,\" Adrian went on, staring at Shaeido and focusing his gaze on the dark pupils of his light green, honeydew eyes, \"but not enough. I want to learn one more thing from you, too.\" Shaeido's jaw set. He knew what was coming, and he prepared himself for a fight. Adrian was ready to give one. \"Tell me who our mothers were. Damien's. And mine.\" ~0~ Aaagh. Was that a bad cliffhanger? I think it was. Bleh. Anyway, R&R;, please! Adrian: Hey, R&R; means READ and review in fanfic-speak, doesn't it?

I woke early I don't know what time it was because I was to tired to look at my clock. It was still dark out and it was silent so it was before seven in the morning. I heard dad calling me from downstairs, '' C'mon Raven.'' ''Ok, ok I'm coming.'' I got up and went into the bathroom. I changed into my black and purple Shakespearean type shirt and black jeans. I went back to my room and got a couple of books and my boots, which took less time than I thought to put on. I ran down the stairs and grabbed my satchel that was hanging on the banister. I put my books into my bag and looked at dad. He smiled knowingly, like he always did when he was about to use my real name teasingly but he knows I don't like to be called by my real name. ''Rowena it's a two hour drive to the Thorn estate, I really don't think you'll be able to read all three books.'' ''Well you never know. Better to have something and not need it than to not have something and need it.'' Dad chuckled at this and lead me out the door to his Bentley outside. Carl, our driver, started the car once we were inside. As the car pulled out of the drive I was lost in thought. I knew dad was going to see a friend of his from the military academy he went to when he was growing up. I think his name is Richard Thorn and he has a son, Mark Thorn, and a nephew, Damien Thorn-who is living with him after his parents died. I think Mark and Damien are the same age as me, which is 15. I twirled my black hair around my finger as I looked out the window at the chilly December morning in thought. About two hours later I closed my book and put it back into my bag. The car stopped in front of the Thorn estate and Carl opened the door for dad and me. I stepped out and followed dad to the front door. He knocked and the door opened. Richard and his wife, Ann, greeted us. ''Charles its good to see you again.'' Richard shook dads hand. ''You too Richard,'' dad looked at me ''and this is my daughter Rowena.'' Richard smiled and shook my hand. ''Charmed to meet you Rowena.'' I smiled ''Thank you Mr. Thorn but please call me Raven.'' ''Of course Raven.'' Then Richard and Ann lead us inside to the sitting room. As we sat, the butler offered to take my coat and bag. I nodded and handed them to him. Richard smiled and looked toward the grand staircase. ''The boys should be coming down soon.'' As if right on cue two forms approached the top of the stairs. They were both in suits of a dark blue. Ann spoke, ''Boys there is someone I want you to meet.'' The boys exchanged glances as they walked down the stairs. They stopped at the end of the couch and looked at me. Richard cleared his throat. ''Boys this is Raven. Raven this is my son, Mark.'' Mark smiled and bowed '' And this is my nephew Damien.'' Damien stepped forward and took my hand. ''Its lovely to finally meet you Raven.'' He let go and stepped back. I was positive that I was blushing. I heard Ann tell dad something. ''Always the gentleman Damien is .'' Richard stood up. ''Ann, Charles lets leave them to get to know each other better.'' He glanced at Mark and Damien with a look that said 'Don't do anything stupid'. Ann, dad and Richard left the room. Mark and Damien sat on the opposite couch. I looked at them, unsure of what to say. Damien had a skeptical looked on his face. ''Hmm I don't think Raven is your real name Raven.'' Mark looked at me then Damien with a confused look. ''What are you talking about Damien? It has to be her real name.'' I chuckled causing them to look at me. ''Damien, you caught on to that quicker than I thought. My real name is Rowena but I really don't like it so Raven is my name.'' I explained easily. They looked at me and Mark shook his head. ''I think Rowena is a perfect name.'' He smiled at me. Damien chuckled ''Raven is right….although Rowena has a regal air to it.'' I smirked ''I'll keep that in mind.'' ''So Raven, do you have any hobbies?'' ''Yes actually. I love to read and write. You?'' ''Ah yes sports and reading. Mark here, only has an eye for sports.'' ''I do not. I also enjoy going to the military academy.'' ''But you have to go'' I listened to them bicker. I looked at Damien and smiled. He looked up and smiled back. Mark's eyebrow twitched slightly. I glanced away for a second. I could feel my face heating up. Granted it was easy to tell that Mark was a bit jealous. It seemed that they both where trying to get my attention. I think I kind of liked the attention. Mark decided to change the subject. ''So Raven what books do you like?'' ''Well I love vampire novels, not the romance kind mind you. I can't stand sappy romance novels. I also like anything supernatural from ghosts to demons.'' ''So you like action, thrillers and suspense right?'' ''yes I do.'' ''With vampires and supernatural beings, correct?'' Damien chimed in ''yes.'' I could literally see the gears working in their heads, uh oh I think I might find extra books at home. ''Anything else?'' Damien's question snapped me from my trance. ''Well…..manga I guess.'' ''What?'' ''Manga, Japanese comic books. They are read right to left.'' ''What..manga's do you like?'' Mark seemed to struggle with saying 'manga'. ''Naruto, Yu Yu hakusho, Yu-Gi-Oh, Defense Devil, Inuyasha, and that's only some of them.'' I don't think they even heard of most of them by their expressions. ''What?'' ''Sorry Raven, spaced out for a minute.'' ''yeah, that's a lot to remember. I should have wrote it down.'' Mark then realized what he said ''oops.'' Damien shot him a glare. ''Remember and write down?'' then realization dawned on me. ''You know it takes a lot more than lavishing me to get on my good side.'' ''Hey you can't blame a guy for trying.'' ''No I can't but be warned, I do have a hard time making up my mind sometimes.'' I smirked deviously. Mark's eyes could have been sparkling at that point. Damien smiled at me. My little internal voice was chastising me '-Raven do you have any idea what you are doing?-' Oh yes this might end badly. Later on, when dad brought me home I checked my E-mail. There was one unread message in the inbox. I opened it and smiled sadly. Mom finally decided to E-mail me. She told me all about her trip but I could see that she seemed to use false words with me. She is on a 3 month 'holiday', as to say 3 months away from me. I know its sad to say that she never wanted a child and my birth was a mistake but its true. She wants nothing to do with me and dad knows it. Ever since day one he has always been there when mom hasn't. The only time mom had anything to do with me was when they were discussing my finical future with the insurance agency. Dad has twice the amount of love for me than most fathers had for their daughters. I quickly replied and sat back in my chair. I glanced around my darkened room and sighed. I picked at the edge of my sleeve of my black nightshirt. My window was cracked slightly to let in enough cold air to keep me comfortable. I got up and started to walk to my bed when I heard a growl. It came from outside and it sounded like a dog. I cautiously walked over to the window and looked down to the ground. There was a Doberman staring at me. I couldn't look away then suddenly there was a flutter of wings. A crow landed on the Doberman's back and stared up at me. It seemed like the bird's and the dog's eyes pierced into my soul, holding me transfixed in their gaze. Just as quickly as it started they broke their gaze and departed. I felt chilled to my very core. I closed my window and pulled the curtains closed. I stumbled my way to my bed and crawled to my favorite spot, not before I closed to bed hangings on the sides of the mahogany, royal four-poster bed--a gift from my father--, and fell into a deep sleep.[Chapter 2] The Omen Chapter two: Cold I woke on a chilly morning. The remnants of last nights incident came flooding back. That dog and bird seemed to know me somehow. I stretched and sighed. I got up and when my feet touched the cold hardwood floor I jumped. ''Ah! cold, cold!'' When my feet got used to the cold I stood up. I put on my black satin robe over my nightclothes. I opened my door and stepped out into the hallway. As I made my way downstairs I heard a voice that made me freeze. ''You know Charles I did really miss you both.'' I was astounded. She was back already. I slowly came downstairs and into the sitting room. My mother was sitting in a chair with a smug look on her face. I almost glared at her but I caught myself just in time. ''Mother.'' That was all I could say. Mom stood up. ''Hello honey.'' She used that false sickly-sweet voice of hers. I hated it and this time I will not just let her get her way. ''Just drop the act, alright?'' ''What are you talking about sweetie?'' ''You know what I'm talking about mother.'' My voice was sharp. Dad had the expression of an anime character sweat-dropping. ''Rowena Von Hayle don't you dare use that tone with me. I am you mother.'' ''You don't act like it. You are never here!.'' She gasped. ''I am appalled Rowena.'' ''But its true. You are always away on 'holidays' or shopping trips. Never once you said you loved me. And I know for a fact that you never wanted a kid! I was a mistake!'' I was fuming. ''I'm sorry you feel that way, but I really do love you.'' I scoffed at that, ''If you really loved me you would be here instead of some where else!'' Then someone cleared their throat. I looked up and relaxed a little. Paul, our butler, was holding two packages, one was a box and the other was a basket wrapped in black velvet. ''Miss Raven, Mr. Mark and Damien Thorn sent these to you.'' ''Alright, umm I'll just take them to my room.'' I started to walk over to get them when my I-got-to-know-everything mother stepped in front of me. ''I'll take those.'' ''But mom they are for me not you!'' But it was too late she already took them. She opened to box first. She pulled out a card and read it. '' 'For a very special girl who has my heart. -Mark Thorn.' '' Then she smirked ''I can't believe that you got Mark Thorn interested in you…..and Damien too.'' She glanced at the black velvet covered basket. I clinched my fists. I glared at her. ''I've had enough mom. I want my stuff. NOW!'' She met me with an icy stare. ''I have a right to know who is interested in my daughter.'' ''And I have a right to my privacy!'' I retorted. I forced myself to walk over to her. I picked up the basket before she could get to it and I took the box and card from her hand. I glared at her then stalked to my room. I slammed the door shut and put the things on my desk. I flopped onto my bed and fumed. I must have fell asleep. I felt groggy, just out of it. I glanced at my clock. It was two in the morning. The gifts where still there so mom didn't take them. I sat up and sighed. Suddenly something felt odd, like there was someone watching me. I looked around my darkened room frantically. Something didn't feel right. I got up and walked to the corner farthest from my bed. It seemed that I was drawn there. Something cold touched my shoulder, and I jumped. I turned around but saw nothing. I went back to my bed and tried to sleep. This was going to be a long night[Chapter 3] Finally an update! This took me forever to type stupid writers block A special thank to TheProphecyChild, CutiePie, and takara410 for reviewing :) Thx so much guys:) and an other special thanks to the Composers of O Fortuna and Requiem for a Dream's main theme for getting me through my writers block. and to a very special friend who convenced me not to give up on my writing :) Disclamer: I do not own the Omen (even though i wish i did) Flames will be used to make popcorn ^^ Enjoy! Chapter 3: Jealousy I woke late in the day. I got up and headed down stairs. Dad was gone, left for work. There was a note on the table Raven, you mother is staying at the Benburg Inn. She said she needed time to think. She may drop by but I'm not sure. There should be stuff in the kitchen to munch on. Love dad. I smiled to myself. Ever since I was old enough to stay at home by myself during breaks dad would always leave a note for me. I got something to eat and tried to occupy my mind. As the day went on I began to feel odd, like I was being watched. It did not feel sinister, nor comforting. I glanced around, I'm not one to get scared easily. I peeked around the corner of the stairs. Nothing. I turned around and bumped into someone. I froze and slowly looked up. I sighed when I saw who it was. ''God Paul, don't sneak up on me like that.'' ''My apologies Miss Raven, but Mr. Damien would like to see you again.'' He gave a slight bow. \"Um ok, when do we leave?'' ''Actually Miss Raven, Mr. Damien is-\" \"Already here.'' Damien chimed in, as he walked around Paul. \"I will go inform Mr. Hayle of Mr. Damien's arrival.'' Paul turned on his heal and walked away. Damien smiled at me. ''Well Raven, did you like my gift?'' ''Yes I did, but you know it's the thought that counts.'' ''Yes, but alas a girl like you deserves much more.'' He smiled. \"Well thank you Damien.'' I blushed. I felt all fuzzy, but I was a bit over cautious. Damien stepped a bit closer. ''Raven, you look ravishing today.'' \"I-I do?'' I couldn't help but squeak a little. He smirked at me. \"Yes even more so with that blush.'' He lightly caressed my cheek with his fingertips. \" Um shall we go to the sitting room, instead of standing here.'' I tried to keep my voice calm. ''Alright, lead the way.'' He motioned me to go first with is hand. I lead the way and sat on the couch. Damien sat beside me…a little to close. I thought I heard the phone ring in the distance. Damien leaned in closer to me. ''Um Damien, d-do you think that this a little bit too close?'' I stammered. ''If you don't want me this close then tell me.'' ''Well I think that this is going too fast, you know?'' ''Don't worry Raven, I won't do anything until you tell me too.'' He leaned away and scooted back a little. ''Thank you Damien.\" I relaxed a bit. I heard some one clear their throat. ''Ahem Mr. Damien, Mr. Mark would like to speak to you on the phone.'' Paul spoke in usual British drawl. Damien nodded and left with Paul. -3rd person p. o. v- Raven waited patiently in the sitting room waiting for Damien. Damien furrowed his brow in frustration. \"Mark what do you want?'' ''Well I was just wondering, where in the world are you?'' Mark hissed. \"I'm at Raven's, and you're not'' Damien added snidely. ''You know perfectly well that I was going to go over to Raven's today.'' ''Well looks like I got here first.'' Damien smirked \"And besides she is defiantly not your type.'' ''Oh wait till I get my hands on you. I swear I will-\" Mark was cut off when Damien hung up the phone. He snickered to himself. ''Raven will be mine.'' -normal p. o. v.- Damien came back and sat beside me again. He smiled, \"Sorry about that Raven. Mark was just wondering where I was.'' ''Oh ok.'' I smiled. I felt like he wasn't telling me everything. \"So where were we?\" He leaned toward me. I blushed profusely. He put he right hand around me waist and put his left on my cheek. I felt light headed and my heart was pounding. My eyes slipped closed just as I felt Damien's lips press against mine. Something felt right, like this was meant to be. But it was over just as soon as it began. I opened my eyes and smiled at Damien. \"That was nice.'' \"I'm glad you liked it. Raven I have something to tell you.'' \"Yes Damien?'' I smiled. ''Will go out with me?'' Damien was sincere. I didn't know what to say, but I made up my mind. ''Yea, of course.'' I smiled. Damien smiled back.[Chapter 4] An other chappy up! thank to all who reviewed R&R; Disclamer: I no own the Omen ...but i wish i did hehe Chapter Four: Things just couldn't get better, could it? Later in the evening that day I went up to my room. I sat at the vanity mirror that was dust covered. I never really used it, and this was a very rare occasion. I wiped the dust away and looked at myself to the fullest. Storm-grey eyes, long dark-black hair, pale skin, half-full red lips. This was me…..even if I like it or not. I'm not one who wants to perfect her looks. I'm just happy with natural beauty. I never really wear make up, or anything like that. That is just a waist of my time. But I do get really tired of guys hitting on me when I'm book shopping…..and that is when I curse natural beauty. Sometimes I wish that I looked a bit more, I don't know, more normal. I sighed and turned around in the swivel chair, so I was facing my bookshelf. I scanned down the rows. Nothing caught my interest. Then, from outside my door I heard the sound of foot steps and paws on the hardwood. A soft knock echoed through my room. \"Doors open.\" I called slowly getting up. The door slowly opened and a Doberman came bounding in. He jumped up and started licking my face. I tried to keep him down until I heard a chuckle. \"Well, I see that he likes you.\" Mom walked into my room. \"Mom? You got me a dog?\" \"Yep, sort of like a 'forgive me' present.\" \"Mom you can't just buy forgiveness, or love.\" I added. The Doberman whined sadly and pawed at my leg, wanting attention. I patted his head, still looking at mom. \"But honey, he really likes you and besides it will do you good to have a pet.\" \"Alright I'll keep him, but or not forgiven yet.\" I saw her face brighten. \"But stop trying to buy my love. If you really love me then show it through your heart, not your check book.\" \"Oh alright. So what are you going to name him?\" \"Hmmm….I'm thinking Lucifer.\" \"Lucifer! B-But that the name of the devil!\" \"Ah but before he was cast out he was the Light Barer. And his name translates to Light Barer.\" \"You really done your research.\" \"I read a lot.\" \"I see. Well I guess you want some time to get acquainted with….Lucifer.\" She shuddered. She turned to leave but I put my hand on her shoulder. \"Mom wait. Thank you and I'm sorry about the way I acted yesterday, but you are never home. It seems as though you want to be on shopping trips than at home with dad and I. It really hurts to think that you don't really love us.\" \"Raven, sweet heart, I love to more than shopping. The truth is I was away because I thought you didn't want me home, that you preferred your father over me.\" \"I guess all we needed was to talk it out huh?\" \"Yeah, I guess.\" She smiled and hugged me. I hugged her back. Lucifer whined and jumped up. I smiled and petted him. \"Well its late and time for you to get to bed.\" \"Oh mom I'm not a little kid you know.\" \"I know but I never really got a chance to say that.\" She smiled and headed for the door. \" Good night Raven.\" \"Good night mom.\" I smiled. She closed the door. As I got ready for bed Lucifer made himself comfortable at the foot of the bed. He watched lazily as I finished up unpacking the presents from Damien and Mark. I blushed as I held personalized card that Damien slipped into one of the books he got me. I could tell that he made it himself and it looked like a professional had done it. I opened it and read the poem. ' Gentle as the sky. Lovely as the rose that only blooms at midnight. If I only knew the reason why, I was ensnared by love at first sight.' I set the card on my desk and sat on the edge of my bed. Lucifer looked up. I smiled and crawled under that blankets and fell asleep. I woke to sound of whimpering and scratching. I was up and rubbed my eyes. \"Lucifer, you need to go out?\" I looked over to the door but he wasn't there. I sat up and looked in the direction of the whining. Lucifer was scratching at the window, staring at the ground. I got up and went over to the window. The same dog and bird that I saw a night or two ago where there again. I shivered, Lucifer looked at me and whined. The dog and bird cocked their heads still staring intently at me. Lucifer scratched at the window, wanting out. I looked at him and petted his head. \"No Lucifer you're not going out right now.\" When I looked back out the window the dog and bird where gone. Something wasn't right. Lucifer calmed down and went back to the foot of the bed. About an hour later I still couldn't sleep. I tossed and turned but to no avail. The door opened slowly and Paul came in with a leash. \"Time to go for a walk Lucifer.\" Paul jingled the leash. Lucifer jumped up and ran out the door. I smirked, my eyes still closed. A/N: I know that some of your thoughts on the real Lucifer are different from mine, but no flames ok?[Chapter 5] An other chappy! thanks to all who reviewed :) Disclaimer: i do NOT own the Omen or its characters Chapter Five: Snow Something cold and wet nudged my face. I groaned and rolled over. A paw scratched at my back and the whining started. I sat up and stretched. \"Alright, alright I'm up.\" I looked over at Lucifer. He barked happily. I got up and opened the door. He just sat there with a look on his face as if he was saying 'Are you coming too?' \"I'll be down soon.\" I chuckled. Lucifer got up and ran downstairs. I went over to my dresser and got my clothes. I walked over to the bathroom. I started to change when something didn't feel right. I brushed it off and finished changing. I went over to the sink and did the basic morning ritual, brushing hair and teeth. As I turned I thought I saw something red in the mirror. It defiantly wasn't me. I shakily switched off the light and opened the door. There was a thing standing right in front of me. I backed away but the thing shuffled closer. It had on a long red robe with the hood up. The thing looked up and I saw its face. I wanted to run but I couldn't. It had the skull of a jackal! It raised its arm revealing a skeleton paw. I closed my eyes and wished this was just a really bad nightmare. I peaked and saw that the thing was gone. I sighed with relief wand cautiously walked out of the bathroom. As I walked down stairs I looked out the window. It was snowing. I smirked, this was why I liked winter so much. Everything was snow covered and still. So silent that even if you take the quietest breath, everyone can still hear it. I yawned as I walked into the kitchen slash dinning room. \"Good morning honey.\" Mom put a plate of bacon and eggs in front of me after I sat at the table. \"Morning mom.\" I mumbled. She chuckled and went back to the kitchen. As I ate Lucifer whined from under the table. I cautiously slipped him some bacon. \"Raven don't feed the dog table scraps, he'll get spoiled that way.\" Mom called from the kitchen. I smirked, funny how parents know things. I continued to eat, thinking absent mindedly about the snow. As soon as I was done I put my plate in the sink and walked over to the door. I put on my snow boots and jacket. I called over my shoulder. \"I'm going for a walk mom.\" \"Ok, and take Lucifer with you. From what Paul has told me, he loves the snow.\" As soon a mom mentioned the snow, Lucifer jumped up and trotted over to the door. I chuckled and got his leash. I walked over to him and hooked the leash to his collar. I opened the door and he all but bolted out. He jumped into a pile of snow. I chuckled and coaxed him out of the snow. Lucifer trotted beside me as we walked down the street. The air didn't have its usual stillness. I seemed heavier that before. I wasn't watching where we were going until Lucifer pulled at the leash. I ran along with him into the alcove of trees. After an hour I started to hear voices. Lucifer was almost flat against the ground as we got closer. I stifled a gasp when I heard a familiar voice. \"Thanks for everything.\" It was Mark. I peaked through the brush and I couldn't believe what I saw. Apparently Lucifer found a short cut to the Thorn's estate. There was a banner up near the house. ' Happy Birthday Mark.' So today was Mark's birthday. I was tempted to stand up and walk over, when Lucifer growled. \"What's wrong Lu?\" There was something that I didn't like about this. \"Come on we are going home.\" I stood up and turned around. I started to walk back but Lucifer pulled against the leash to stop me. He growled again still facing the Thorn estate. The mumble of voices stopped and someone walked over. As the person got closer I saw that it was Mark. I really didn't want to talk to him if I have to explain the Damien and I are together. \"Raven? What are you doing here.\" He pulled back the brush. Lucifer growled. \"Just walking Lucifer. He kinda found a short cut from my house to here.\" I rubbed the back of my neck. Lucifer barked at Mark. \"Lucifer hush.\" I bent down and tried to calm him down. \"I didn't know you had a dog.\" \"Just got him last night, a present from mom.\" \"Oh, and the occasion?\" \"She was just trying to be nice, that's all.\" I stood up, but Lucifer whined. Mark got closer too me, and Lucifer barked at him. Marks shushed him, still getting closer to me. \" You know, I never realized how pretty you'd look silhouetted against the snow, but you are gorgeous.\" He was smiling. \"Um Mark?\" \"Yes my angel?\" \"I'm kinda with Damien.\" I saw his face fall. He backed away a foot or two. He looked hurt. \"Oh, ok then, I have to get back to the party.\" He stalked back to his house. I could see in his eyes that he was way beyond angry. Lucifer looked at me with eyes that said, 'Can we go home now?' \"Come on lets go\" I walked back through the alcove of trees and Lucifer gladly followed. (-) After I got home, Lucifer was curled up by the fireplace and I was in the chair reading. Dad still was at work and mom went to do some grocery shopping. Suddenly the T.V came on, which was on the other side of the room. I turned around, my eyes narrowed. It was on the news and the reporter was saying something about a journalist that was killed this morning around nine o-clock. I got up and turned off the T.V, but my mind was hard at work. Lucifer was acting very strange around that time…oh what am I thinking? My mind was just tired that's all. I moved to the couch and stretched out. All I needed was a good nap.[Chapter 6] A/N: Yes, I have discontinued this until farther notice... but I do have my reasons...It has been years since I wrote the first chapter, and in re-reading it, I do admit that it is on the Mary Sue side. So, I will be doing a complete rewrite. Scrapping the whole thing and starting over maybe. But, I do hope to make it less Sue-y.

She meets Damien when her father took "},{"Movie":"Ballerina Leap!","Title":"Heart strings","Author":"LadyLuriel","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13197452","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Monate vergingen wie einzelne Tage, seit Felicie an der Opera Garnier tanzte. Alles in ihr liebte das Tanzen mehr als alles Andere. Zusammen mit Odette, die für sie wie eine Mutter geworden war, wohnte sie in dem Zimmer im Dach des Opernhauses. Camilles Mutter, Regine le Haut, wurde wegen versuchten Mordes in Haft genommen und saß ihre rechtmäßige Strafe hinter Gittern ab. Niemand würde mehr ihretwegen verletzt werden. Camilles Sorgerecht ging somit an ihre Tante. Camille und Felicie man konnte es kaum glauben, hatten sich tatsächlich angefreundet und wenn sie nicht gerade mit trainieren beschäftigt waren, verbrachten sie jede Pause miteinander. Befreit von ihrer rachsüchtigen und strengen Mutter hatte Camille eine Wende gemacht, die Jeden überraschte. Jedoch, übertraf sie Felicie beim tanzen immer noch um weitesten nicht. Es war ein regulärer Tag in der Oper. Pause um es genau zu sagen. Unterrichtspause und Camille und Felicie hatten sich aus dem Pausenraum geschlichen um wie jeden Tag durch die Oper zu spazieren. ,,Felicie\" flüsterte Camille während sie liefen ,,hast du das eigentlich auch bemerkt\"? Die rothaarige starrte ihre Freundin irritiert an. ,,Was bemerkt\"? ,,Na Merante\" kicherte die Blondine. ,,Was soll mit ihm sein\"? Felicie blinzelte. ,,Er verhält sich komisch\" Camille zog ernsthaft die Augenbrauen zusammen ,,äußerst merkwürdig\". ,,Aha\"!? Felicie runzelte die Stirn ,,Und in wie fern? Mir ist nichts aufgefallen, er ist doch wie immer\". ,,Er ist komisch. Komisch fröhlich\" erwiderte Camille. ,,Er hat einen guten Tag\" erwiderte Felicie und zuckte mit den Schultern. ,,Ist doch gut wenn er fröhlich ist. Besser als wenn er einen schlechten Tag und miese Laune hat, dann ist er wie ein Gewitter\". Camille zog die Luft durch die Nase. ,,Nein, das meine ich nicht. Er ist fröhlich, fröhlich\" versuchte Camille zu erklären. Plötzlich hallten Schritte über das frisch geputzte Marmorpaket und die Mädchen versteckten sich hinter einer der vielen Säulen. ,,Das ist er, da ist Merante\" flüsterte Camille. ,,Shht\" ermahnte sie Felicie und wagte einen flüchtigen Blick über die Schulter ihrer Freundin. Merante schritt geradewegs die Treppen hinunter und pfiff vor sich her während er ging. Sein eleganter Gang schien ebenfalls lockerer als sonst. ,,Siehst du\"? beharrte Camille ,,Das meinte ich. Er pfeift\" stellte sie fest. ,,Ja und\"? Felicie beobachtete ihren Tanzlehrer weiter, bis er kurz vor ihnen vorbei lief. ,,Das ist es ja, er pfeift nie\" entgegnete Camille. ,,Sei leise\"! mahnte Felicie erneut, als Merante kurz den Kopf in ihre Richtung bewegte, als hätte er etwas gehört. ,,Ist gut\" hauchte Camille. Nach wenigen Sekunden der Stille lief Merante weiter, doch Felicies Haare, welche sie zu einem Zopf gebunden hatte, kitzelten ihre Freundin an der Nase und sie musste niesen. Erschrocken fuhr Felicie zusammen und riss geschockt die Augen auf. ,,Mist\"! Nicht weniger geschockt, hielt sich Camille den Mund zu. Leider zu spät des Guten. Ihr Lehrer hatte sie bereits bemerkt. Die verzweifelten Versuche sich zu verstecken misslangen den Beiden Mädchen hoffnungslos. ,,Was macht ihr da\"? kam die strenge und gleichzeitig verwunderte Frage. ,,Uhm...\" und schon kam ein roter Haarschopf hervor. ,,Wir uhm, wir wollten uhm, auf die Toilette. ,,Auf die Toilette\"? Skeptisch hob Merante eine seiner Augenbrauen. Mit einem breiten, aufgezwungenen Grinsen, stieß Felicie Camille mit ihrem Ellenbogen an, bis auch sie hervor kam. ,,Monsieur Merante, Guten Tag\" grüßte ihn die Blonde ,,Wir...wir wollten wirklich nur auf die Toilette\". Merante hob das Kinn ,,Die Toiletten, befinden sich im Oberem Stockwerk Mademoiselle\". Spätestens jetzt, fürchtete Felicie, dass ihre Ausrede aufgeflogen war. ,,Oh ja richtig\" holte die Rothaarige gespielt aus ,,und da wollten wir auch gerade hin\" sie grinste weiterhin so breit wie nur möglich und packte Camille am Handgelenk. ,,Oh so spät\" sie tat so als würde sie die Uhr sehen\". ,,Ohwaia, die Pause ist bald um, wir sind dann mal, eh, auf dem Weg, zur, eh, Toilette\" und sie rannte los. Camille hinter sich herziehend. Auf der Mitte der Treppe drehte sie sich noch einmal um. ,,Bis gleich\" rief sie und ließ einen völlig verwirrten Merante zurück. Seufzend und Kopf schüttelnd wandte sich der schwarzhaarige Franzose wieder seinem Weg zu. ,,Was war das denn\"? fauchte Felicie, sobald sie Camille vor die Eingangstür zum Tanzraum gezerrt hatte. ,,Deine Haare, sie haben meine Nase gekitzelt\" verteidigte sich die Blonde verschränkte ihre Arme. Felicie seufzte. ,,Was auch immer. Das Erkunden der Oper können wir verschieben\". ,,Hey\" meinte Camille ,,du wohnst doch quasi hier, du hast doch mehr Chancen als ich dazu\". ,,Denkst du wohl\" erwiderte Felicie und winkelte ihren Mund an ,,Odette erlaubt es mir nicht, alleine in der Oper herum zu laufen\". ,,Apropos Odette\" Felicie kratzte sich am Nacken ,,Sie verhält sich in letzter Zeit wirklich etwas merkwürdig\". ,,Siehst du\"? holte Camille aus ,,Ich sage ja, die verhalten sich komisch\". ,,Die\"? Jetzt war Felicie definitiv verwundert. ,,Wie jetzt, Die\"? ,,Na Odette und Merante, Genie\" Camille rollte mit den Augen. ,,Du hilfst mir nicht gerade auf die Sprünge\" entgegnete Felicie. ,,Gut dann helfe ich deinem Gedächtnis mal auf die Sprünge\" erwiderte Camille und wedelte mit der Hand vor der Nase ihrer Freundin. ,,Der Nussknackerauftritt, weißt du noch\"? ,,Ehm, ja\"? Felicie legte den Kopf leicht schief. ,,Der Wangenkuss, ich habs genau gesehen\" erzählte Camille euphorisch. ,,Ein Wangen was? Kuss, wer wie\"? Felicie stutzte. ,,Odette und Merante\" Camille biss sich auf die Unterlippe. ,,Wie jetzt? wer hat hier wen geküsst\"? Felicie blinzelte irritiert. ,,Meront hat Odette geküsst\" wiederholte die Blonde. ,,Ew, so genau wollte ich das gar nicht wissen\" entgegnete Felicie und verzog ihre Nase. ,,Ew\"? wiederholte Camille ungläubig ,,ew sagst du? Nein, dass ist doch romantisch\" und sie zog die gefalteten Hände an die Brust. ,,Hmpf\" machte Felicie. ,,Warte\"! Holte Camille aus ,,Jetzt verstehe ich das\" Camilles Gesicht erhellte sich, als hätte sie die Erleuchtung des Jahrhunderts. ,,Sie sind verliebt in einander\" quietschend rüttelte sie Felicie an den Schultern. ,,Verliebt, Felicie\". ,,Du spinnst\"! meinte die Rothaarige und befreite sich von dem Griff ihrer Freundin. ,,Was denn? Warst du denn noch nie verliebt Felicie\"? fragte sie Camille. ,,Ich? verliebt? Pff\" Felicie lachte und wank ab ,,Ich doch nicht\". Das fette Grinsen welches sich mittlerweile auf Camilles Gesicht ausgebreitet hatte, sah sie nicht. ,,Ach wirklich\"? Plötzlich klang Camille sehr ironisch. ,,Meronte war nicht der Einzige der einen Wangenkuss verteilte\". Jetzt blieb Felicie im Gang stehen. So plötzlich wie ein Blitz bei einem Sommergewitter traf sie die Erinnerung. Sie hatte Victor einen Wangenkuss gegeben. Als Dankeschön und Camille hatte ihre Augen natürlich überall. Für einen Moment, klappte der jungen Tänzerin der Mund auf. Kühn wie Felicie aber war, hielt der Schock nicht lange. Beindrucken, lies sie sich davon eher wenig. ,,Camille, das war ein Dankeschön, eine Geste\" erwiderte Felicie während sie sich umdrehte und spielerisch rückwärts lief. Camille immer im Augenkontakt. ,,Viktor ist mein bester Freund, das ist alles\". ,,Uhm hm\" schmunzelte Camille doch plötzlich schwand ihr Grinsen und wandelte sich zu einer Grimasse. Dabei fuchtelte sie wild mit den Händen und deutete hinter Felicie. Zu spät aber reagierte die Rothaarige und schon stieß sie mit ihrem Rücken gegen einen Wiederstand. ,,Oh\" machte sie überrascht und hob dann den Kopf um zu sehen an wen sie gestoßen war. ,,Salut Prinzessin\"! Wurde sie schwunghaft gegrüßt, während sie direkt in zwei himmelblaue Augen starrte. Gepaart von einem strahlend weißen Gebiss welches so eben grinste. Die blonden Haare des jungen Mannes fielen ihm etwas ins Gesicht. ,,Woah\"! Felicie taumelte von dem Jungen weg. ,,Rudolf, hey, hab dich nicht gesehen\"! Und er lachte. ,,Sicher doch\" und er nahm sie am Kinn. ,,Mich kann man gar nicht übersehen. Ich ziehe dich an wie ein Magnet\". Kopfschüttelnd streifte Felicie die Hand von Rudolf von sich und schlenderte an ihn vorbei. ,,Hey, wo willst du hin\"? Fragte der Blonde überrascht. ,,Zum Unterricht Mister unübersehbar\" scherzte Felicie ,,Ich will nicht zu spät kommen. Aber wenn du zu spät kommst, will ich mal sehen wie Meronte das später übersieht\" sie schmunzelte und machte den Matrosengruß. ,,Salut\"! Damit verschwand sie im Trainingsraum. Blinselnd und irritiert stand Rudolf da. Die Nase gehoben stolziere Camille gönnerisch an dem blonden Russen vorbei. Kurz vor der Tür blieb sie kichernd stehen und biss sich auf die Unterlippe. ,,Ich bin übrigends immer noch die richtige Camille\" neckte sie ihn und zwinkerte amüsiert. Rudolph spitzte beleidigt die Lippen. Den Spruch rieb sie ihm schon seid Wochen unter die Nase. Mittlerweile lachten die Mädchen über die Vergangenheit. Allerdings was Viktor anging, war sich Camille nicht so ganz sicher. Viktor war in Felicie verliebt und das nicht erst seid Gestern. Mehr aber als sich Gedanken über Verliebtheit zu machen, stand Felicies Geburtstag an. Ihr Dreizehnter und sie wollte ihrer Freundin ein ganz besonderes Geschenk geben. Eines das ein Geschenk war aber auch eine Entschuldigung. Camille war nicht die Einzige, die fleißig an einem großem Geschenk arbeitete. Viktor hatte ebenfalls Einiges vor. Und wenn das nicht schon vielversprechend genug wäre, waren da ja noch Odette und Merant, die sich so merkwürdig verhielten. Geheimnisvolle Erwachsene führten immer etwas im Schilde nur merkte man es ihnen schwerer an. Felicie für ihren Teil, dachte noch nicht einmal an ihren Geburtstag.[Chapter 2] Fünf ganze Minuten waren vergangen, nachdem Merante die Mädchen darauf aufmerksam gemacht hatte, dass das Training für Heute beendet sei und Felicie tanzte immer noch. Fröhlich lachend wie immer. Mit einem amüsierten Kopfschütteln wartete der Tanzlehrer darauf, dass seine beste Schülerin aufhören würde. Camille seufzte tief ,,Felicie\" rief sie aber ihre Freundin schien alles zu überhören. Nach einer weiteren Weile räusperte sich Merante schließlich und stieß seinen Gehstock auf den Boden. ,,Danke für die extra Einlage Mademoiselle\". Mit einem breiten Lächeln hörte Felicie auf und schnaufte erschöpft. ,,Danke Monsieur\". ,,Nun, wenn ihr mich entschuldigt, ich habe noch etwas zu erledigen\" bemerkte Merante ,,Ihr könnt gehen\". Camille warf Felicie einen eindringlichen Blick zu. ,,Na dann\" entgegnete Felicie und lief vorraus. ,,Kommst du später mit in den Park spazieren\"? Fragte sie nach einer Weile Camille, die neben ihr herlief. ,,Ich würde ja wirklich gerne, aber ich habe noch ein paar Dinge zu erledigen\" erwiderte die Blonde. ,,Oh, na gut\" lächelte Felicie ,,Das nächste Mal dann vielleicht. Wie wärs mit Morgen\"? Camille schüttelte entschuldigend den Kopf. ,,Tut mir leid\". Etwas enttäuscht zog Felicie die Lippen zur Seite. ,,Hmm schade\". ,,Hallo\"? Camille wedelte vor Felicies Gesicht ,,Hast du vergessen was übermorgen ist\"? Die Rothaarige blinzelte irritiert ,,Freitag\"? Camille starrte ihre Freundin kurz fassungslos an. ,,Das ist ein Scherz Felicie. Du hast übermorgen Geburtstag\"! Und die Erinnerung kam zurück. ,,Oh\" machte Felicie ,,ja richtig. Ich habs voll vergessen\" sie lachte. ,,Wie kann man denn seinen eigenen Geburtstag vergessen\"? japste Camille. ,,Naja\" hob Felicie an ,,im Waisenhaus gab es so viele Kinder, Geburtstage wurden nie groß gefeiert\" sie hob die Schultern ,,nur Viktor hat mich mit aufs Dach genommen und den Abend mit mir verbracht. Eigentlich wie immer. Er hat noch nie meinen Geburtstag vergessen. Immer kam er mit einer neuen Erfindung\". Camille staunte. ,,Ein richtig toller Freund was\"? ,,Der Beste\"! lächelte Felicie stolz. Camille schmunzelte wissend. Sie wusste ganz genau was Viktor plante. Allerdings rätselte sie an Merante und Odette. Außerdem waren da noch die anderen Schülerinnen, die ebenfalls eine Überraschung planten. Rudolph würde auch nicht mit leeren Händen auftauchen. Der blonde Romeo war zwar ein Draufgänger und Charmeur aber auch ein Gentleman. In gewisser Weise und sicherlich hatte er ein gutes Herz. Vor dem Tor der Oper hielten Beide noch einmal an. ,,Also Felicie, ich gehe jetzt in die Stadt. Meine Tante wartet dort auf mich\". Felicie hatte sie schon einmal gesehen. Diane le Haut war das komplette Gegenteil von dem Monster einer Mutter, welches Regina war. Mutter konnte man sie eigentlich gar nicht nennen. Diane war die Schwester von Camilles verstorbenen Vaters. Eine edle und liebevolle Person. Soweit Camille es Felicie erzählte hatte, wusste sie, dass Diane eine Schneiderei führte. Felicie brachte ein dezentes Lächeln über ihre Lippen. ,,Viel Spaß Camille. Bis morgen\". Die Mädchen umarmten sich. ,,Bis Morgen prima Ballerina\" lachte die Blonde und Felicie erwiderte die Geste. Sehnsüchtig, sah die Rothaarige Camille zu, wie sie ihrer Tante in die Arme lief und gemeinsam mit ihr in einer Kutsche verschwand und davon fuhr. Etwas machte Felicie traurig. Camille hatte eine leibliche Familie. Felicie hatte Odette und sie war wie eine Mutter für sie geworden, aber es stand nicht auf Papier und somit hatte sie weiterhin keine richtige Familie. Eigentlich hatte sie nie eine. Sie war schon sehr lange eine Waise und schon immer war sie mit Viktor zusammen gewesen. Apropos Viktor. Das Lächeln kam zurück als sie an ihren besten Freund dachte und sie beschloss zu ihm zu gehen. Später würde sie Odette beim Putzen der Oper helfen. Und vielleicht wenn keiner mehr da war, könnte sie in den Opernsaal schleichen und dort auf der großen Bühne tanzen. Sie liebte die Vorstellung. Sie schloss ihre Augen und in ihrem Inneren sah sie dann die hellen Lichter, das volle Publikum und sie konnte einfach eintauchen in ihre Fantasie. Odette beobachtete sie dann immer heimlich und schmunzelnd. Es machte die junge Frau überglücklich, die kleine Felicie so tanzen zu sehen. Felicie hatte ihre Zukunft offen und sie würde tanzen. Sie würde tanzen mit Herz und Seele und Odette würde alles in ihrer Macht stehende tun, dass das auch so bleiben würde. Manchmal stach es Odette auch wie süßes Gift ins Herz, dass sie nicht mehr tanzen konnte. Der Vorfall vor 17 Jahren war daran Schuld. Zur falschen Zeit am falschen Ort. Außgerechnet unsere Prima Ballerina, hieß es damals. Die Zeilen waren groß auf schwarz weiß gedruckt überall in Paris umgegangen. Es war eine Katastrophe. Ein schrecklicher Brand. Sie hätte sterben können, damals in dieser Nacht. In der Nacht in der alle Lichter für sie erloschen und nur das lodernde Feuer den Himmel von Paris erhellte. Gerade am Putzen und gerade heute erinnerte sich Odette. Sie erinnerte sich weil sie an Felicie dachte. Sie würde Übermorgen dreizehn werden und sie wollte ihr einen ganz besonderen Geburtstag schenken. Sie hatte nur wenig Geld aber sie arbeitete seit Monaten härter als sonst. Ihre Beziehung mit dem Tanzlehrer Louis Merante hielt sie so gut geheim wie nur möglich. Es war eine Schande, ein Jammer und ein Missgeschick. Es wäre ein Fiasko, würde man herausfinden, dass sich ein so wohlhabender und hoch angesehener Mann der Oper Garnier einer einfachen Putzfrau versprach. Sie lebten nun mal in einer Zeit, in der es im Folk nicht gerne gesehen war, wenn Reiche und Arme zusammen waren oder gar heirateten. Wie sehr es Odette verletzte, dass man schon lange vergessen hatte, wer sie einst gewesen war. Mit sechzehn Jahren war sie die beste Tänzerin von ganz Paris gewesen. Eliteschülerin Nummer 1 unter den Mädchen und Prima Ballerina. Merante war das männliche Gegenstück. Damals war alles so einfach gewesen. Damals waren Beide auf dem selben Stand. Er und sie und wäre das Feuer nicht gewesen, dann wäre es einfacher sich der Liebe hinzugeben und eine Beziehung ohne Angst einzugehen. Seit Jahren liebte sie ihn. Seit Jahren sah sie zu ihm auf. Seit Jahren bewundere sie ihn. Und bis vor wenigen Monaten hätte Odette nicht mal im Traum gedacht dass ihre Gefühle erwidert würden. Nie hätte sie gedacht, dass er genauso fühlte. Er war es gewesen, er hatte sie gerettet und auch er war immer für sie da gewesen. Aber sie hatte es immer abgetan. Plötzlich vernahm die Brünette eine Melodie. Ein Stück, dass sie nur zu gut aus der Vergangenheit kannte und es jagte ihr eine Gänsehaut über. Das konnte nicht sein oder? Bestimmt war es Rudolph der für seinen Auftritt übte. Aber waren die Übungszeiten nicht schon längst um? Eine Seite in Odette zog sie förmlich in die Richtung von der die Musik kam und die andere Seite wehrte sich mit Hand und Fuß dagegen. Vielleicht war es aber auch einfach nur die sogenannte Vernunft die Erwachsene hatten. Wäre sie jetzt Felicie, wäre sie ohne Zögern hingelaufen das wusste sie. Nach einigem Überlegen fand sich die Brünette doch kurz vor dem Raum für Eliteschüler der damaligen Generationen. Ein Raum der schon seit mehreren Jahren nicht mehr genutzt wurde. Die Musik kam tatsächlich aus ihm und Odette lunzte etwas um die Ecke um durch die Glasscheibe der Tür zu spähen. Was sie sah, hatte sie tief in ihrem Inneren schon beinahe erwartet nur abgestritten. Es war nicht Rudolph, nein es war kein anderer als sein Tanzlehrer. Louis Merante. Eigentlich müsste es für Odette ein gewohnter Anblick sein. Merante tanzte nicht erst seit gestern und es war auch nicht so, als hätte sie ihn noch nie tanzen sehen. Etwas in ihr hatte sich gerührt. Und während sie damals hysterisch rot angelaufen wäre und davon gerannt, dass er sie bloß nicht sieht. Lehnte sie sich nur schnell gegen die Wand und legte sich die Hand an die Brust. Ihr Puls war in die Höhe geschossen und ihr Gesicht fühlte sich doch leicht hitzig an. Wie ein Reiz musste sie erneut hinsehen um sich zu versichern, dass sie keine Geister sah. Im Prinzip verhielt sie sich wie eine Idiotin. So fand sie. Sie war keine sechzehn mehr sondern ganze dreiunddreißig Jahre. Eine erwachsene Frau und dennoch brachte sie der Anblick dieses Mannes völlig um den Verstand. Wie sollte sie jetzt vorgehen? Vor dem Raum weiter putzen und so tun als hätte sie nichts gesehen? Oder an der Tür klopfen? Nein das wäre zu offensichtlich. Schließlich nahm sie den Wischmop und huschte an der Tür vorbei. Den Blick gesenkt. Wie ein fieses Omen öffnete sich die Tür kurz nachdem sie vorbei gegangen war. ,,Odette\"? Bei dem Klang der Stimme, zog sie leicht die Schultern hoch während sie sich um den Wischmop krallte. Ok ganz ruhig. Sie musste einfach so reagieren wie immer. Seit dem Auftritt von Felicie, seit dem Kuss und seit dem sie wusste was er empfand, war es teilweise unmöglich einfach ruhig zu bleiben. ,,Ja Louis\"? Und sie drehte sich um. Sekunden darauf weiteten sich ihre Augen und sie blinzelte. Von allem was sie erwartet hatte, war ein Oberkörper freier Merante das Letzte gewesen. ,,Auch du meine Güte\"! schnappte sie nach Luft und hob die Hand an die Stirn. ,,Überrascht\"? Und er kam auf sie zu. ,,Überrascht? Hm\" und sie räusperte sich laut. Atmete tief durch um wieder einen klaren Kopf zu bekommen. ,,Sollte ich überrascht sein\"? Und sie klang wieder selbstsicher und standfest. Innerlich lief sie allerdings gerade über vor Scham. Himmel und wie sie überrascht war und wie gerne sie diesen wohl gebauten Körper länger angestarrt hätte. ,,Wenn du mich entschuldigst, ich habe noch Arbeit zu erledigen\" erwiderte sie rasch. Gerade wollte sie sich wegdrehen, um der Situation zu entfliehen, da wurde sie am Handgelenk gezogen. In einer Walzerdregung landete sie wieder in den den Armen ihres Freundes. ,,Oh\" Erneut schnappte Odette verblüfft nach Luft. Gesicht an Gesicht sahen sie sich nun in die Augen. ,,Deine Arbeit kann warten\" schmunzelte Merante. ,,Ich bin da anderer Meinung\" schluckte sie, während sie sich etwas nach hinten schob um eine Distanz zu schaffen. ,,Du arbeitest ein wenig zu hart in letzter Zeit\" bemerkte Merante ,,ich habe dich beobachtet. Du solltest eine Pause einlegen\". er seufzte besorgt. ,,Das geht nicht\" Odette befreite sich nun gänzlich aus der Umarmung. Wieder im Ernst der Lage, sah sie ihn an. Zweierlei Dinge drückten sie zusammen. Das Erste war, dass sie in der Position kaum ein Recht hatte sich auf eine Beziehung mit Merante ein zulassen und Zweitens musste sie doch härter arbeiten. Für Felicie. ,,Was ist los mit dir Odette? So kenne ich dich gar nicht\" Merante musterte sie. ,,Es geht nicht...\" meinte sie nun ernst. ,,Was geht nicht\"? Und seine Worte waren sanft. Tränen begannen in ihren Augen zu brennen. Sie konnte es nicht. Sie brachte es nicht fertig es ihm zu sagen. Wusste er wie hart es war? Was sie durch machte? Jahrelang als Putzfrau zu arbeiten? Merante könnte sich einer wohlhabenden Frau versprechen. Einer Frau in einer anderen Situation. Nicht einer einfachen Putzfrau. Mittlerweile hatte Merante wieder seine übliche Alltagskleidung angelegt. ,,Lass uns darüber reden\" liebevoll legte er seinen Arm um ihre Schulter und führte sie den Gang entlang. ,,Es ist wegen Felicie...\" hob Odette an und es war teilweise die Wahrheit. ,,Sie hat doch übermorgen Geburtstag. Ich möchte ihr mehr bieten als das was sie bisher kannte. Ich weiß dass sie mit weniger zufrieden ist aber..\". ,,Verstehe\" Merante hob die Hand an sein Kinn. ,,Ich möchte dir weiterhin helfen\" bemerkte er. ,,Du müsstest wissen wie ich empfinde\". Odette starrte ihn an und für diesen Moment wollte sie nicht fort laufen. Ein Lächeln huschte über ihre Lippen. Nicht mal wenn sie wollte würde sie wegrennen. Sie konnte es gar nicht mehr. ,,Aber Ich bin doch nur eine Putzfrau\" murmelte sie und Merante hob ihr Kinn sodass sie ihm wieder in die Augen sah. ,,Du bist viel mehr als das und das weißt du\". Sie schwieg. Den Tränen näher als vorher. ,,Ich war Louis...\" wieder wollte sie den Blick abwenden aber er lies es nicht zu. ,,Denkst du ich werde zulassen, dass dir noch einmal ein Unrecht geschieht? Ich habe mich für dich entschieden und daran ist nichts falsch. Gib mir nur etwas Zeit an den Feinheiten zu Arbeiten\". Odette wollte weinen am liebsten wäre sie jetzt wieder ein paar Jahre jünger. Vielleicht auch deshalb weil sie dachte, dass jüngere Frauen eher einen Nervenzusammenbruch haben durften. Vielleicht war sie aber auch einfach zu stur. Manche Reaktionen konnten aber auch nicht aufgehalten werden. Tief ein und ausatmend legte sie ihren Kopf an seine Schulter. ,,Ich danke dir so sehr\". Sofort zog er die Arme um ihren Rücken dichter zusammen. ,,Ich verspreche dir und Felicie die Zukunft zu geben, die ihr verdient Odette ich verspreche es dir\".[Chapter 3] Sommer 1863 - Paris Odette = 16 Jahre Louis Merante = 18 Jahre Regine Le Haut = 17 Jahre Cloé Belmonte = 16 Das Opernhaus von Paris. Das Gebäude für Kunst und Musik. Schon seit Odette auf ihren eigenen Beinen stehen konnte, tanzte sie. So erzählte es ihr ihre Mutter. Immer begeistert für die Musik und für Tanz. So kam es auch, dass Odette so früh wie es nur ging, Ballettunterricht nehmen durfte. ,,Eure Tochter ist ein Naturtalent\" hieß es ,,Sie sticht heraus aus der Menge, sie hat etwas, was viele nicht haben. Leidenschaft\". Den Satz behielt sich Odette im Kopf. Mit Leidenschaft tanzen. Ja, anders durfte es gar nicht sein. Wer nicht mit Herz und Seele tanzte, tanzte nicht richtig. Man musste die Musik spüren. Im ganzen Körper. Von den Fingerspitzen bis in die Zehen. Man musste sich darin verlieren können. Nur noch die Musik spüren, sie durch Herz und Seele fließen lassen und mit dem Körper das Innere Gefühl zum Ausdruck bringen. Seit einer ganzen Weile tanzte Odette schon an der Pariser Oper und hatte sich mit Recht den Platz an der Spitze erkämpft. Gruppenbeste aus der Elite Klasse und beliebt bei allen. Fast allen. Natürlich gab es hier und da neidische Augen, aber Odette scherte sich nicht darum. Sie war ein sehr selbstbewusstes junges Mädchen. Zielsicher und schlagfertig. Es war ein Tag wie jeder andere und Odette kam gerade in den Gang, der zu ihrem Trainingsraum führte. Das erste was der jungen Brünette auffiel, wahr die Lautstärke. Es war lauter als sonst. Schließlich richtet sich ihr Blick auf den gequetschten Haufen von Tänzerinnen. Merkwürdigerweise, hatten sich alle Mädchen aus den Klassen an einer Tür zu einem weiteren Trainingsraum versammelt und hingen dort wie Schmeißfliegen. Schubsten und drängelten. Stellten sich auf die Zehenspitzen. Quiekten wie Mäuse und schwärmten. Kicherten, Gackerten und tuschelten. Odette rollte die Augen. Was auch immer so interessant war, es kümmerte sie nicht. Sie war nicht die Art von Mädchen, die mit dem Strom schwamm. Wenn es alle interessierte, würde es sie nicht interessieren. So war es in den meisten Dingen. Was andere taten war ihr egal, sie folgte ihren eigenen Schritten und richtete sich nach niemanden. Also seufzte die Brünette nur und lief unbeeindruckt an dem Bündel vorbei. ,,Odette\"! einer der Mädchen hatte sich umgedreht. Die hellblauen Augen strahlten. Die blonden Locken hatte sie zu einem hohen Dutt gebunden. Ein paar wenige aber, kringelten sich an ihrer Stirn. Cloé hieß sie. Einige der wenigen, mit der sich Odette wirklich gut verstand. Sie war die eine, die man als beste Freundin bezeichnen konnte. Etwas irritiert runzelte Odette die Stirn. War sie nun verwundert oder eher enttäuscht, dass ihre Freundin auch in dem Getümmel an der Tür stand um, was auch immer es war, zu beobachten. ,,Cloé\" erwiderte Odette und versuchte dabei gleichgültig zu klingen. ,,Hast du es nicht mitbekommen\"? japste die Blonde und biss sich dabei auf die Unterlippe. Ihre Augen glänzten vor Begeisterung. ,,Was mitbekommen\"? Odette blinzelte. ,,Louis Merante, er ist hier\" Cloé fiepte vor Aufregung. ,,Verzeihung, wer\"? Odette zog die Augenbrauen zusammen. Ihre Freundin gegenüber riss ungläubig den Mund auf. ,,Sag nicht, dass du nichts von Louis Merante gehört hast\"? Bei der Euphorie ihrer Freundin, machte Odette einen Schritt rückwärts. ,,Wow, es ist kein Weltverbrechen nicht von einer Person zu wissen die man nicht kennt\". Cloé blinzelte. ,,Odette, Schätzchen, wir sprechen noch einmal wenn du ihn gesehen hast. Er ist der beste Tänzer von ganz Paris und jetzt tanzt er an unserer Oper\". Ohne auf die Brünette einzugehen oder nach ihrer Meinung zu fragen, zog Cloé Odette zu der Tür\". ,,Sieh ihn dir an\". Cloé presste ihre Freundin an die Glasscheibe und was Odette dann sah, jagte einen Schauer durch sie. Ein junger Mann tanzte in dem Raum. Ganz alleine. Mit einer Kraft und Eleganz, die sie nie zuvor gesehen hatte. Mit einer Grazie, so leicht wie eine Feder. Anmutig und stolz und die Leidenschaft ging über auf jeden der ihn tanzen sah. Förmlich gefangen von dem Anblick, unfähig den Blick abzuwenden, starrte Odette auf ihn. Dunkle Haare, rabenschwarz, muskulös und stattlich gebaut. Schlank und in seinen Augen lag der Wille einer Raubkatze. Er wirkte beinahe wie ein Panther, ein schwarzer Panther. Vor lauter Trance hatte Odette gar nicht mitbekommen, wie die Mädchen von der Tür weggetreten waren. Der Junge hatte aufgehört zu tanzen und kam nun aus dem Raum. Odette stand immer noch direkt vor der Tür, unfähig sich zu bewegen. Wieso passierte das auf einmal? Dieses Gefühl kannte sie nicht und es gefiel ihr teilweise überhaupt nicht. Es passierte gegen ihren Willen, unaufhaltsam. ,,Odette\" flüsterte Cloé aber Odette rührte sich nicht. Die anderen Mädchen staunten auf, als Merante aus der Tür trat und vor Odette stehen blieb. ,,Hat dir der Tanz gefallen\"? kam es nun von dem jungen Mann und erneut sauste ein elektronischer Schauer durch Odette. Um Himmelswillen, was geschah hier gerade. ,,Hmm...\" der Junge beugte sich etwas zu ihr hinunter und musterte sie mit einem amüsierten Schmunzeln ,,Sprachlos wie ich sehe\" er richtete sich wieder gerade auf und hob stolz die Augenbrauen ,,Gut, dann habe ich ja alles richtig gemacht\" Mit hoch erhobenem Haupt, lief er an ihr vorbei. Alle Mädchen waren für einen Moment verstummt, doch als er dann an ihr vorbei war, ging das Gekreische wieder los. Sie tummelten sich um ihn, fragten ihn aus und flirteten. Und irgendwie schwand das Gefühl, das Odette eben noch festhielt und sie atmete in einem langen Seufzer tief aus. ,,Odette\"! Cloé schmiss sich an ihre Freundin und schüttelte sie. ,,Was war das denn? Wie kannst du nur da stehen und nichts machen? Du hattest eben eine wahnsinnige Chance gehabt\". ,,Ich bitte dich\" meinte Odette ruhig. ,,Er ist nur ein normaler Mensch. Wie jeder andere auch. Wenn ich mit ihm sprechen will, dann werde ich es tun, aber bestimmt nicht so wie all die anderen wild gewordenen Hühner\". Sie schnaufte abfällig. ,,Stürzen sich auf ihn, wie die alten Leute auf die Ware am Marktplatz\". Sie schüttelte den Kopf. Cloé verzog ihr Gesicht zu einem Grinsen ,,Oh Odette, ich habe deinen Blick gesehen, du warst hin und weg von ihm\". Jetzt drehte die Brünette den Kopf die Augen zu schlitzen verängt und die Augenbrauen hochgezogen. ,,Ich war von seinem Tanz beeindruckt ja, aber ihn? Ich finde absolut nichts an ihm. Dieser eitle Pfau ist doch sicher viel zu sehr mit sich selbst beschäftigt\". Cloé legte den Kopf schief. ,,Vielleicht schätzt du ihn falsch ein, vielleicht ist er ganz anders als du denkst. Du bist doch auch die beste aus der Eliteklasse und du bist nicht eingebildet\". Odette schenkte ihrer Freundin ein warmes Lächeln. ,,Wenn du mich entschuldigen würdest, ich gehe jetzt üben\". ,,Ja, schon klar. Für die Rolle der Odette, dem Schwan, ich weiß\" Cloé grinste. ,,Irre ironisch, du trägst den selben Namen\". Odette lachte. ,,Ich werde bestimmt nicht wegen dem Namen die Rolle bekommen, sondern wegen meinem Talent\". Die Blonde nickten nur. ,,Mach du nur, ich warte dann auf dich\". Odette wank ihrer Freundin noch einmal zu, bevor sie in einen etwas abgelegeneren Raum ging. Sie bevorzugte es alleine zu sein und vor Allem, ihre Ruhe zu haben. Nachdem sie sich ordentlich aufgewärmt und gedehnt hatte, legte sie die Schallplatte auf und begann zu tanzen. Schwanensee. Es dauerte nicht lange, da hatte sie jene Konzentration auf das was um sie geschah vergessen und es gab nur noch die Musik und sie selbst. Alles verschwand und sie spürte die Musik in ihrem ganzen Körper. Sie floss durch sie wie ein Fluss. In jeden Muskel in jeden Winkel bis zu den Fingerspitzen und sie fühlte sich unbeschwert und leicht. Alle Sorgen waren ausgeblendet. Sie liebte das Tanzen, sie liebte es mehr als alles andere. Erschöpft seufzte Louis auf, als er durch die Gänge lief. Endlich hatte er den lästigen Haufen quirliger Mädchen abgeschüttelt. Nicht einmal in ruhe tanzen konnte man. Schließlich hatte er sich für die männliche Hauptrolle beworben. Plötzlich drang eine bekannte Melodie an seine Ohren und er drehte den Kopf. Jemand musste für die weibliche Hauptrolle proben. Neugierig folgte Merante der Richtung aus der die Musik kam und fand sich schließlich vor einem der vielen Räume. Erstaunt weiteten sich seine Augen, als er das graziöse Geschöpf erblickte, das da tanze, als wäre es das einfachste auf der Welt. Als gäbe es nichts anderes. Noch nie hatte er jemanden so tanzen sehen. Jede Bewegung war flüssig und leicht und es sah aus, als würde sie schweben. Verzaubert und hingerissen von dem Anblick beobachtete Merante die Tänzerin und er meinte sie wieder zu erkennen. Es war das Mädchen von vorhin, dass ihm beim tanzen zu gesehen hatte. Interessiert hob er die Hand an sein Kinn. Er war völlig fassungslos und baff und das passierte ihm selten. Er würde sie auf jeden Fall nach ihrem Namen fragen. Es stand außer Frage, dass sie das meiste Potential für die Hauptrolle hatte. Er brauchte sich die anderen Mädchen gar nicht mehr ansehen, für ihn würde es keine höhere Perfektion mehr geben. Die Musik verstummte und er fand es beinahe schade. Am liebsten hätte er dem Mädchen weiter zugesehen. Plötzlich öffnete sich die Tür und vor ihm stand sie. Ihre blauen Augen schimmerten überrascht. ,,Du\"? sie verschränkte die Arme. ,,Du hast mir zugesehen\" stellte sie fest. ,,Du bist gut\" erwiderte Merante sofort ,,Ich bin beeindruckt\". Odette öffnete ihren Mund ein wenig. Das merkwürdige Kribbeln kam wieder hoch und ihr Puls beschleunigte. ,,Ich..\" sie räusperte sich. ,,Ach was\" und sie strich eine Haarsträhne ihres Ponys hinter ihr Ohr. ,,Nein wirklich, ich finde dich sehr..\" und jetzt stoppte Merante in seinem Satz. ,,Dein Tanzen ehm...\" jetzt räusperte er sich ebenfalls und kratzte sich verlegen am Hinterkopf. ,,Dein Tanzen finde ich sehr gut\". Odette blinzelte und plötzlich fingen ihre Ohren an zu glühen. Schnell sah sie zur Seite um ihr errötetes Gesicht zu verstecken. Merante selbst wurde etwas rot um die Nase. ,,Ich uh, muss jetzt gehen\" hetzte sie ihre Worte und wand sich an ihm vorbei. ,,Warte\"! rief Merante und griff nach ihrem Handgelenk. ,,Ich weiß nicht wie du heißt\". ,,Odette\" hauchte sie und drehte ihre Kopf nicht um. ,,Deinen richtigen Namen\" kicherte Merante und Odette wurde nur noch röter. ,,D-das ist mein richtiger Name\" Ihre Stimme wurde immer leiser vor Scham. Wieso musste er ihr Handgelenk festhalten? Wieso konnte sie nicht einfach gehen? ,,Das ist ja ein außergewöhnlicher Zufall\" bemerkte Merante erstaunt. ,,Ich würde jetzt gerne gehen\"! Entgegnete Odette. Hoffend er würde sie loslassen. ,,Ein sehr schöner Name\" stellte er fest und ließ dann los. Odette stolperte etwas, blieb dann aber kurz stehen. Den Rücken immer noch zu Merante gekehrt. ,,Ich heiße übrigens Louis Merante\". Jetzt drehte sie sich doch zu ihm um. Sein Blick war sanft und sein Lächeln ehrlich. Wie konnte sie nur denken, dass er eingebildet sei. Er war stolz und selbstsicher, schlagfertig und elegant, aber eingebildet war er definitiv nicht. Das wusste sie jetzt. Kurz bewegten sich ihre Lippen als wollte sie etwas sagen, aber es kamen keine Wörter. Sonst hätte sie ihm jetzt gesagt, dass sie seinen Namen bereits kannte. ,,Schön dich kennen gelernt zu haben Odette\" sprach er weiter und lief etwas auf sie zu. ,,Dann sehen wir uns ab sofort öfter\" Sanft strich er ihr noch einmal über die Schulter, als er an ihr vorbei lief. Wie vom Blitz getroffen zog Odette die Schultern hoch. ,,Oh, uhm, ja\" und sie sah ihm nach, wie er graziös den Gang hinunter lief\". Immer noch den roten Schimmer auf den Wangen. Ihre Mutter hatte ihr einmal gesagt. Der richtige Mann ist der, der dir den Kopf verdreht ohne ein Wort zu sagen und dir den Verstand raubt mit einem einzigen Wort. Hatte sie sich verliebt? In einen für sie noch völlig Fremden? Sie kannte jetzt seinen Namen aber wenn sie ihn tatsächlich mochte, wäre sie nicht die Einzige. Aus der Oper heraus, wehte Odette ein angenehmer Wind entgegen. Es kühlte die aufgewärmte Haut in ihrem Gesicht und es tat ihr gut. Sie musste wieder einen klaren Kopf bekommen, aber egal was sie versuchte, das Gesicht von Louis Merante klebte förmlich an ihrem inneren Auge und wehrte sich zu verschwinden. Ihr Puls pochte ihr immer noch bis zum Hals und rauschte in ihren Ohren. Reis dich zusammen Odette. Ermahnte sie sich selber, als ihre Freundin Cloé in Sicht kam. ,,Da bist du ja endlich\"! rief die Blonde und schüttelte den Kopf. ,,Wo warst du so lange\"? ,,Ich habe etwas länger geübt\" erwiderte Odette. Das Zusammentreffen mit Merante, verschwieg sie mit Absicht. Nach dem Tohuwabohu um den attraktiven Tänzer, war es die schlechteste Option Cloé davon zu erzählen. Auch wenn Cloé ihre beste Freundin war. ,,Odette\"? Cloé beugte sich etwas vor. ,,Irgendwas ist doch passiert\". ,,Huh\"? Die Brünette blinzelte. ,,Was meinst du\"? ,,Du bist so abwesend\". ,,Ich bin müde\" bekräftigte Odette und seufzte leise. Von allen Dingen die ihr jetzt vor der dem großen Auftritt in die Quere kommen konnten, musste es ausgerechnet dieser junge Mann sein der ihn ihr Gefühle auslöste die sie total aus der Bahn schmissen. Andererseits sie aber auch anspornten alles zu geben. So wie die Tage vergingen, vergingen auch die Wochen. Abseits von den neidischen Augen der anderen, trainierten Louis und Odette jeden Tag zusammen. Er baute sie auf und sie ihn. Sie waren ein eingespieltes Team. Jeder ergänzte sich und obwohl keiner von Beiden es wagte seine Gefühle auszusprechen, sah man es in der Leidenschaft des Tanzes. Als das Vortanzen für die Hauptrollen kam, stand es außer Frage, dass die beiden sie bekamen. Zu Odettes Überraschung freuten sich alle für sie. Cloé hattevor Freude ununterbrochen geweint. Nur aus einer Ecke stachen wütende Augen hervor. Drohend ruhten sie auf Odette. Regine hieß die junge Frau und sie missgönnte jedem das Glück, welches ihr nicht zuteil wurde. Ihre Seele war düster und egoistisch. Tyrannisch und unzufrieden. Ein dunkles Herz voller Hass und Missgunst. Sie plante Rache, Rache an Odette, die alles hatte, was sie jemals wollte. Den schönsten Mann, der besten Tänzer von Paris, die Hauptrolle, die Aufmerksamkeit. Grausame Menschen existierten leider und sie lauerten überall wie blutrünstige Raubtiere. Kauernd, bereit sich auf ihre Opfer zu stürzen und sie ins Verderben zu ziehen. Regine war eine von diesen Menschen. ,,Ich bin so glücklich\" strahlte Odette ,,Ich kann es nicht glauben, ich werde morgen Abend die Hauptrolle tanzen\". ,,Ich habe keinen Moment an dir gezweifelt\" hauchte Louis und schmunzelte dabei. ,,Moment\"! und Cloé sprang auf von ihrem Platz an dem sie gesessen hatte. ,,Ich habe keine Sekunde an ihr gezweifelt und das lange bevor du aufgetaucht bist Prince Charming\". Merante rollte mit den Augen. ,,Oh sicher doch, ich hatte nicht vor den \"Beste Freundin Status\" zu stehlen\". Odette errötete etwas um die Nase und rieb sich die Stirn, während Cloé empört schnaubte. Als Odette den Blick abwandte, traf sie Regines Blick und ihr wurde unwohl. Sie gar nicht bemerkt, wie eifrig Cloé nun in ein Gespräch mit Louis vertieft war. Etwas in ihr verkrampften sich, stach ihr ins Herz machte sie irgendwo wütend aber auch traurig zugleich. ,,Ich muss gehen\" murmelte sie schließlich und drängelte sich durch die Beiden hindurch. Sie wusste nicht ganz, was sie dazu bewegte, aber sie musste raus. Raus aus der Situation. Überrascht über Odettes plötzliche Reaktion, sahen sowohl Cloé als auch Meranten auf. ,,Odette warte mal\". Rief Cloé ihr nach, aber Odette eilte schneller als ihr lieb war. Wie auf Stichwort wurde sie wieder am Handgelenk gepackt. ,,Lass mich los\"! befahl Odette grob. Tränen rollten ihre Wangen hinunter. Was bloß tat ihr so weh? Sie wusste es selbst nicht. ,,wieso läufst du weg Odette\"? Metante klang besorgt. ,,Ich muss gehen\" hetzte Odette ,,lass mich jetzt bitte los, die anderen starren\". ,,Dann lass sie starren. was ist los\"? Odette blinzelte ,,Es geht dich nichts an, lass mich jetzt los Merante\"! Geschockt riss Louis die Augen auf. So hatte sie ihn nie genannt. Seit der ganzen Zeit nicht und es verletzte ihn. Mit einem geschlagenen Seufzen ließ er sie los und sie rannte davon. Während Odette die Treppen hinunter eilte, zog sie gleichzeitig ihre Ballettschuhe aus und packte sie in ihre Tasche. Holte dann ihre normalen Schuhe heraus, zog sie hastig an und eilte aus der Oper. Draußen huschte sie um eine Ecke und ließ sich die Wand hinunter um zu weinen. Wieso tat es plötzlich so weh ihre beste Freundin so mit Merante zu sehen? Und dann war da noch Regine. Dieser Blick. Dieser Blick, der vor Hass loderte und sie förmlich zerriss. Odette verstand es nicht einmal. Wieso war Regine so abgrundtief böse? Wieso hasste sie sie so sehr? Odette hatte der jungen Le Haut nie Unrecht getan und dennoch wurde sie von ihr gehasst. Sie wurde bloß von Claire le Haut adoptiert, nachdem ihre Eltern verstorben waren. Claire le Haut war eine langjährige Freundin ihres Vaters gewesen. Zittrig atmete Odette aus und wischte sich die Tränen fort. Sie durfte sich nicht so von den Gefühlen runter ziehen lassen. Immerhin musste sie morgen Abend alles geben. Wie angewurzelt starrte Merante in die Richtung in die Odette gerannt war. Was hatte sie so auf einmal aufgebracht? Hatte er etwas falsch gemacht? ,,Louis\"? Cloé wank vor seinem Gesicht und er blinzelte. ,,Entschuldige\" er sah zu der kleinen Blonden. Brummend zog sie ihm an seinem Ohr zu sich hinunter. ,,Ouch\" japste er überrascht. ,,Was auch immer du gemacht hast, dass Odette jetzt weint mom amie, du gehst ihr jetzt nach und entschuldigst dich! Aber tout suite\". Merante nickte nur. Zufrieden ließ Cloé sein Ohr los und lies ihn davon rennen. Mittlerweile hatte sich Odette in dem Vorhof der Oper auf eine Bank gesetzt und den Blick gesenkt. Ihre Gedanken waren ein chaotisches Gewirr, ebenso wie ihre Gefühle. Plötzlich setzte sich jemand neben sie. Wenig später fühlte sie einen sanften Druck auf ihrer Schulter. ,,Wieso bist du mir nach\"? Hauchte Odette. Sie musste sich nicht umdrehen, um zu wissen, wer neben ihr saß. ,,Weil ich mir Sorgen gemacht habe\" bestätigte Merante. ,,Aber du warst doch bei Cloé\". ,,Ja das war ich. Sie hat mir die Ohren voll geschwärmt wie eh...\" Louis stockte mitten im Satz. Jetzt hob Odette doch den Kopf nur um in das errötete Gesicht von Merante zu sehen. Überrascht sah Odette in an. ,,Was hat sie gesagt Louis\"? ,,Sie sagte wir beide wären...\" er räusperte sich. ,,Was\"? Wiederholte Odette. ,,Ein gutes Pärchen\" beendete Louis den Satz. Leise und verlegen. Sofort schoss auch Odette die Röte in die Wangen. So war das also. Und sie hatte völlig über reagiert. ,,Odette ich..\" begann Merante, mit dem Ziel seine Gefühle zu beichten, konnte seinen Satz aber nicht fortführen da er gerufen wurde. Ein paar Meter weiter weg, stand Merantes Vater. Ein stattlicher Mann. Ein sehr guter Geschäftsmann und gerne gesehen unter dem reichen Volk. Odette hingegen hatte ihre Familie schon lange verloren und wurde im Haus le Haut aufgenommen. Einer ebenfalls reichen Unternehmensfamilie die eine Restaurantkette führte. Claire le Haut war ein Mensch von dem man sagen konnte, sie gehörte zu den liebsten Personen der Welt. Richard le Haut, war eher streng, aber keines Falls böse. Odette fragte sich, was bei Regine so furchtbar schief gelaufen war. Da sie ihren Eltern so gar nicht ähnelte. Gut nur, dass Odette bei ihren Eltern Schutz fand. Allerdings führte dies kein Bisschen zur Besserung . Auch wenn Odette sich eine bessere Gesellschaft denken konnte, war es im Moment das Beste, dass sie haben konnte und sie durfte tanzen. ,,Au revoir Odette\" meinte Merante entschuldigend ,,Ich muss jetzt gehen, wir sehen uns morgen. Vergiss nicht, ich glaube an dich\". Odette lächelte nur. ,,Mercie\". Zu schnell war er in der Kutsche seines Vaters verschwunden. Sehnsüchtig und verträumt sah sie ihm hinterher. Beinahe enttäuscht darüber, dass sie nicht mehr hören konnte, was er ihr sagen wollte. Große Gedanken machte sie sich aber nicht. Wenn es wichtig war, würde er es ihr noch sagen. Sie starrte so lange der Kutsche nach, dass sie Cloé gar nicht bemerkte, die mittlerweile an ihre Seite getreten war. ,,Odette! Bist du taub geworden\"? Endlich drehte die Brünette den Kopf. ,,Verrate mir mal was das vorhin war\" motzte Cloé ,,Einfach so weg rennen, ohne ein Wort\". Kurz starrte Odette ihre Freundin an und fing dann urplötzlich an herzlich zu lachen. Völlig irriteirt stand Cloé vor ihr, den Mund offen, sah sie Odette zu, bis sie sich ihre Freudentränen wegwischte. Cloé wusste sich keinen Rat mehr. Was war nur in sie gefahren? ,,Ich war eifersüchtig Cloé! kannst du das glauben? Ich war eifersüchtig auf dich\". ,,Wiebitte\"? Die Blonde riss die Augen noch weiter auf, verschränkte ihre Arme und legte die Stirn in Falten. ,,Wieso in aller Welt solltest du...? 0h...\" und sie stoppe. Ihr Mund formte sich kurz spitz und dann beugte sie sich verdächtig schmunzelnd zu ihrer Freundin hinunter. ,,Jetzt hast du aber keine Ausrede mehr Odette. Du liebst ihn\"! bemerkte die Blonde und Odette zuckte erschrocken zur Seite. ,,Ich... was..Nein\"! Und erneut schoss ihr das Blut in die Wangen. ,,Gib es doch einfach zu. Du magst ihn\" Cloé hob gönnerisch die Augenbrauen. ,,Na schön\" lachte Odette ,,Ich mag ihn\". ,,Aha\"! Rief Cloé siegessicher und deutete auf ihre Freundin. ,,Ich wusste es\"! Kopfschüttelnd stand Odette auf. ,,Begleitest du mich Nachhause\"? Wechselte sie das Thema. ,,Klar\" lächelte Cloé und gemeinsam liefen sie bis zur Villa Le Haut.[Chapter 4] Fröhlicher als sonst kam Odette in die große Villa le Haut. Sie plante noch etwas zu üben und dann früher schlafen zu gehen. Immerhin war morgen der große Tag. Ihr großer Auftritt. ,,Bin wieder da\"! rief sie und schon kam Claire le Haut direkt auf sie zu geeilt. ,,Odette, Liebes, ich habe schon davon gehört. Wie großartig! Ich bin so stolz auf dich\"! Verlegen strich sich Odette einer ihrer Haarsträhnen hinters Ohr. ,,Mercie Madame. Aber ihr solltet stolzer auf eure Tochter sein. Sie hat auch eine wichtige Rolle bekommen\". ,,Der schwarze Schwan\"? Claire wank ab und schüttelte den Kopf. ,,Regine ist so mürrisch, nicht so ein Sonnenschein wie du\". ,,Madame, ich bin nicht eure Tochter\" hauchte Odette bescheiden und sah zur Seite. ,,Unsinn\" entgegnete Claire. ,,Ich habe dich adoptiert. Du bist genauso meine Tochter wie Regine es ist\". Von dem obersten Treppengeländer starrte die Genannte hinunter zu ihrer Mutter und Odette. Hass lodernd wie Flammen. Mit einem letzten Blick verschwand sie. ,,Ich werde jetzt noch etwas üben und dann schlafen gehen\" bemerkte Odette. ,,Gut, aber iss etwas, und übertreibe es nicht ja\"? Claire gab Odette einen Kuss auf die Wange. Schnell eilte Odette die Treppen hinauf, sie strahlte vor Freude. Kurz vor ihrem Zimmer wurde sie plötzlich und völlig unerwartet an die Wand gedrückt. Der Druck der Hände an ihren Schultern war unsanft und so fest, dass die Haut darunter anfing zu brennen. ,,Nicht so schnell kleine Ratte\" fauchte Regine in einem unheimlichen Ton. ,,Du glaubst ich sehe nicht, wie Mutter dich bevorzugt. Wie Jeder dich bevorzugt\". ,,Regine, du verstehst das falsch, ich wollte nicht...\". ,,Schweig still\"! schrie Regine sie an. ,,Mich interessieren deine Ausreden nicht\". ,,Regine du tust mir weh\" fiepte Odette aber Regine lies nicht locker. ,,Ich sage dir, das wird nicht für immer so sein. Du wirst noch sehen, dass es ein riesen Fehler war mir in die Quere zu kommen. Ich werde dafür sorgen, dass du alles verlierst und dann wirst du dir wünschen, du wärst in der Gosse geblieben aus der du kamst\". Regina lachte und warf sich das rabenschwarze Haar über die Schulter. ,,Ach ja und noch etwas, Straßenköter\" sie warf Odette einen verächtlichen Blick über die Schulter zu, nachdem sie sie losgelassen hatte. ,,Eines Tages wirst du mich um Hilfe anbetteln\". Unfähig etwas zu sagen, stand Odette an der Wand. Ihre Lippen zitterten. Ebenso wie ihr restlicher Körper. Tränen brannten in ihren Augen. Alles in ihr war für den Bruchteil des Momentes zerschmettert. Schnell schlüpfte Odette in ihr Zimmer. An der Innenseite der Tür atmete sie tief durch. Erst jetzt, ließ sie ihre Tränen laufen. Schluchzend ließ sie sich an der Tür hinunter um zu weinen. Wie konnte jemand nur so grausam sein? Nach einer Weile, hatte sich Odette wieder gefangen. Tief ausatmend, stand sie auf. Sie durfte nicht auf das hören, was Regine sagte. Sie hatte etwas, das sie nicht hatte. Leidenschaft. Sie wusste was Merante und Cloè dachten und sie würde daran festhalten. Lange übte sie noch, bis die Müdigkeit sie überkam und sie auf dem Teppich mit dem Kopf an ihrem Bett angelehnt einschlief. Es war Morgen. Die Sonnenstrahlen blendeten Odettes Gesicht und sie öffnete blinzelnd die Augen. Wie lange hatte sie gestern noch geprobt? Wie lange hatte sie geschlafen? Nach dem Vorfall von Gestern Abend, traute sie sich kaum aus dem Zimmer heraus. Schließlich schlich sie die Treppen hinunter und wurde von Claire le Haut direkt begrüßt. ,,Guten Morgen Odette\" rief sie, während sie sich an den großen Tisch setzte. ,,Guten Morgen Madame\" murmelte Odette. Monsieur le Haut war schon außer Haus. Deutlich unwohl hielt sie den Blick gesenkt. Sie wusste, dass Regine sie ansah und auf Alles lauerte was sie sagen und tun würde. ,,Heute Abend ist dein großer Auftritt\" schwärmte die Madame. ,,Ja\" Odette brachte ein schwaches Lächeln hervor. Sie fühlte sich eingesperrt. ,,Ich werde noch üben gehen\" bemerkte Odette nachdem sie ihr Frühstücks Croissant eingepackt hatte. ,,Willst du nicht mit uns frühstücken\"? Hob Claire an und Odette stand kopfschüttelnd auf. ,,Vielen Dank Madame, aber ich möchte lieber so viel wie möglich proben. Regine wandte den Blick ab. Mit einem letzten Nicken eilte Odette aus der Villa und seufzte sofort laut, nachdem sie von dem Grundstück war. Eines Tages würde sie sich von dem Schatten befreien, der auf ihren Schultern lag. In der Oper angekommen, suchte sich Odette wieder ihren Raum in dem sie alleine und ungestört proben konnte. Etwas in ihr hoffte, dass Louis auftauchen würde um mit ihr zu proben, aber sie bezweifelte es. So kurz vor dem Auftritt und dann noch so früh am morgen, würde Herr Merante seinen Sohn kaum zur Oper lassen. Zielstrebig wie Odette war begann sie zu tanzen. Der Abend rückte näher. Am Nachmittag war Odette noch gemeinsam mit Cloé im Park spazieren gewesen. Cloé hatte ihr Mut gemacht. Den ganzen Tag gab es keine Spur von Louis Merante und es machte Odette etwas traurig. Gerne hätte sie noch einmal mit ihm geprobt. Aber sie wusste, sie würde ihn bald sehen. Hinter der Bühne und auf der Bühne. In seinem Kostüm, Als Prinz. Der Gedanke machte ihr wieder Herzflattern und sie errötete. ,,Odette\"!? Cloé wank vor ihrer Nase. ,,Du bist in der Tat merkwürdig. Und du bist rot im Gesicht\". Odette begann zu schmunzeln. ,,Ich freue mich bloß Cloé. Es ist eine große Sache. Die Hauptrolle zu tanzen\". Cloé hob die Augenbrauen. ,,Ja klar, wohl eher die Hauptrolle mit Louis zu tanzen\". Odette stoppte und riss die Augen auf. ,,Nein. Das ...das stimmt doch gar nicht\". Sie senkte den Blick und strich sich wieder eine Haarsträhne hinters Ohr, wie sie es immer tat, wenn sie nervös wurde. ,,Natürlich nicht Odette\" murmelte Cloé ironisch und kringelte einer ihrer Blonden Locken. ,,Das du in ihn verliebt bist sieht ein Blinder mit Krückstock\". Odette öffnete ihren Mund ,,Das ist doch Unsinn\"! ,,Du brauchst dich gar nicht raus zureden\" konterte Cloé ,,Ich habe es mit eigenen Ohren gehört. Du hast es gestern selbst zugegeben\". ,,Was habe ich bitte zugegeben\"? Erkundigte sich Odette ,,Ich habe überhaupt nichts gesagt\". ,,Oh doch\" beharrte Cloé ,,Du hast gesagt du magst ihn\"! ,,Ja\" bestätigte Odette ,,Richtig. Du hast mich bloß darum gebeten zu zugeben, dass ich ihn mag. Ich mag ihn. Mehr nicht\". Cloé schnaubte ,,Pff, mögen, lieben. Ist beides das Selbe\". ,,Ist es nicht\"! Erwiderte Odette. ,,Du bist verliebt\" rief Cloé. ,,Bin ich nicht\"! Konterte Odette. ,,Bist du wohl\" behaarte Cloé. ,,Ich höre dich nicht\" rief Odette. ,,Oh du hörst mich sehr wohl Odette\" rief Cloé zurück ,,Ich sagte du liebst ...\". ,,La la la la ich kann dich nicht hören\"! Odette hielt sich die Ohren zu und lachte als ihr Freundin sie knurrend anstieß. ,,Odette\" motzte Cloé spielerisch laut. ,,Du bist unmöglich\". Odette lachte noch mehr. ,,Ich weiß\". Fröhlich und lachend liefen beide zu Oper zurück. Es war Abends. Die Sonne war untergegangen. Auf den Straßen von Paris leuchteten die Straßenlampen. Das Opernhaus war voll und es ertönte Musik. Alle Mädchen hatten sich hinter der Bühne versammelt und dehnten sich. Odette holte gerade ihre Tanzschuhe hervor. Plötzlich fiel ihr Gesicht in blankes Entsetzen. Was sie in den Händen hielt, waren keine Schuhe mehr sondern zerschnittene und demolierte Überreste. Kreidebleich sah Odette um sich. Sie brach in Panik aus. Ohne Schuhe würde sie nicht tanzen können. ,,Cloé\"! Wisperte sie und sofort hob die Blonde ihren Kopf. ,,Odette was ist los du bist ja ganz blass\". ,,Cloé...meine Schuhe\" und sie zeigte ihr die kaputten Spitzenschuhe. ,,Ach du liebe Zeit...Odette! Wie ist das passiert\"? ,,ich weiß es nicht\" fiepte Odette und sah panisch um sich. ,,Madame La Retté wird durchdrehen\" Cloé hielt sich die Hand vor den Mund und Odette stiegen Tränen in die Augen. ,,Was mach ich jetzt nur\"? Aus einer Ecke trat ein höhnisches Lachen. Regine kam auf Odette zu und sah ihr über die Schulter. ,,Oh Weh, was ist denn da passiert\"? Ihre stimme klang gespielt besorgt. ,,So wirst du nicht tanzen können\". Odette ballte die Fäuste. ,,Du warst das\". Ihre Stimme bebte. ,,Was ich\"? Regine legte die Hand auf die Brust und blinzelte. ,,Wieso sollte ich? Wer nicht auf seine Sachen aufpasst ist selber Schuld\". Cloé knurrte. ,,Regine du mieses Biest. Wie konntest du nur, das werden wir Madame la Retté erzählen und dem Direktor und deiner Mutter\". Regine zog die Augenbrauen zusammen\". ,,Das würde ich schön bleiben lassen, wenn dir die Stelle deines Vaters als Koch lieb ist\". Cloé schluckte und trat hinter Odette. ,,lass gut sein Cloé\" hauchte Odette. ,,Ich gehe zu Madame Le Retté und sage ihr dass jemand anders für mich einspringen muss\". ,,Odette warte\" rief Cloé, aber Odette war schon auf dem Weg. Ein leichter Stoß an der Stirn ließ sie aufsehen. ,,Oh Entschuldigung ich habe sie nicht gesehen\". ,,Ich bins doch nur\" kicherte eine bekannte Stimme. Und tatsächlich sie sah in Merantes Gesicht. Jetzt liefen ihre Tränen. ,,Louis\" weinte sie und er nahm sie überrascht in die Arme. ,,Was ist passiert? Solltest du nicht proben und dich dehnen\"? ,,Regine\" schluchzte sie ,,Meine Schuhe Louis, sie sind ruiniert, ich kann nicht tanzen\". Geschockt betrachtete Louis die Schuhe in Odettes Händen. ,,Meine Güte.. das ist ja furchtbar\". ,,Ich werde Madame La Retté sagen dass ich nicht tanzen kann\". In dem Moment aber begann Louis zu grinsen. ,,Hmm andererseits hättest du die ollen Dinger eh nicht gebraucht\". Geschockt starrte sie ihn an. ,,Was\"? ,,Ja ganz genau. Du hast mich richtig verstanden. Die ollen Dinger gehören wirklich in den Müll\". ,,Louis...wieso sagst du...\" und weiter kam sie nicht da er ihr eine Schachtel in die Hände drückte. ,,Was ist das\"? Odette blinzelte ihre Tränen weg. ,,Ein kleines Geschenk für dich\". Merante lächelte sie an. ,,Ich muss jetzt proben\" Er zwinkerte ihr zu und lief dann lächelnd an ihr vorbei. Überrumpelt öffnete Odette die kleine Schachtel in ihren Händen. Zwei samt rote Spitzenschuhe lagen darin. Begeistert betrachtete sie das Schuhpaar. Jetzt konnte nichts mehr schief gehen. Das Ballett hatte begonnen. Der Saal war gefüllt mit tausenden von gut gelaunten Zuschauern. Der Direktor eilte umher und gab eine Anweisung nach der Anderen. Es durfte nichts schief gehen. Alles musste glatt laufen heute Abend. Odette dehnte sich mit den anderen Mädchen, aber ihr Puls wollte einfach nicht runter gehen. Sie wusste schon gar nicht mehr, ob es an der Nervosität zum Auftritt lag oder an Louis Merante, der in seinem Bühnenoutfit übte . Nach einer Weile drehte die Brünette wieder den Kopf und erschrak beinahe über Cloé, die sie eindringlich beobachtete. ,,Na was ist das denn\"? grinste die Blonde. ,,Was ist was\"? Odette zog verwirrt die Augenbrauen zusammen. ,,Dein Blick, die Spitzenschuhe, Merante\"? sie spitzte die Lippen. ,,Ok, was läuft da zwischen euch\"? ,,Was zwischen uns läu...bwa nein, nein. Nichts läuft da! Du verstehst das falsch\"! Odette wank mit ihren Händen aber die Farbe auf ihren Wagen verriet etwas anderes. ,,Ja, ja. Rede dir das nur selber ein\" erwiderte Cloé und stütze beim Dehnen ihr Kinn auf ihre Hände. ,,Du hast doch selber zugegeben, dass du ihn magst vergessen\"! Odette rollte die Augen ,,Das schon wieder\"? ,,Du sagtest du warst eifersüchtig auf mich und im dem Fall heißt das, dass du ihn mehr als nur magst Odette. Ich bin keine Gefühlslegasthenikerin und blind bin ich auch nicht\". Odette seufzte über ihre beste Freundin. ,,Na schön, dir kann man echt nichts vormachen. Ich mag ihn sehr\". ,,Du liebst ihn\" verbesserte Cloé besserwisserisch, woraufhin Odette die Augen rollte. ,,Ich lass dich mal in dem Glauben\". Plötzlich wanderten Odettes Augen von Cloé über ihren blonden Lockigen Kopf hinüber und alle Wörter wurden stumpf und leise. Da stand er, in seinem Kostüm. Edel und stattlich. Stolz und elegant. Für Odette war dieser Junge Perfektion. Auch, wenn das bei Menschen gar nicht möglich war. ,,Hallo\"? eine Hand wank vor Odettes Nase und sie blinzelte. ,,Wa..\". ,,Hörst du mir überhaupt zu Odette\"? Cloé zog die Augenbrauen zusammen. ,,Ich oh..ja\" Odette räusperte sich. ,,Also ich sagte da war...\" begann Cloé erneut den Satz, aber wenig später wanderte ihr Blick wieder hinüber zu Merante, der sich warm machte. ,,Ok Odette\" meinte Cloé jetzt etwas lauter. ,,Was auch immer interessanter ist als deine Beste Freundin, hat zu warten, bis ich mit dir geredet habe\". Odette winkelte ihre Lippen an, den Blick immer noch abgewandt. ,,Hm hm\". ,,Ok. Schluss damit. Was zum...\" Doch als sich Cloé umdrehte und Louis entdeckte begann sie verschmitzt zu schmunzeln. ,,Na schön Misses 'ich bin nicht ihn ihn verliebt'\". Odette schnaufte empört ,,Ich bin nicht..\" und mitten im Satz drehte Merante plötzlich den Kopf. ,,Ich...eh...ich bin nicht warm genug, muss mich dehnen. dehnen genau\" und sie beugte sich hinunter zu ihrem Bein um dem Blick auszuweichen. Ein Dong ertönte. Alle hoben ihre Köpfe. ,,Es ist soweit, Louis Part\". Cloé sprang auf ihre Füße und zog Odette mit sich. ,,Na los geh zu ihm, schnell\"! ,,Wa-\" und schon hatte die Blonde Odette zu Metante geschubst, sodass sie kurz vor ihm zum stehen kam. ,,Odette\"? Merante drehte überrascht den Kopf und musterte sie. ,,H-hey Louis..ich ähm\". Wieder strich sich die Brünette eine Haarsträhne hinter ihr Ohr. ,,Ich wollte dir nur sagen...\". ,,Louis\"! Madame La Rette sah zu ihm hinunter. ,,Es ist Zeit\". ,,Ja Madame\" erwiderte er und lächelte noch einmal zu Odette, die völlig überrumpelt blinzelte. ,,Louis warte ich..\". ,,Na los raus mit dir auf die Bühne\" scheuchte Madame La Rette und Merante sah entschuldigend über die Schulter. ,,Viel Glück\"! rief Odette laut und Louis zwinkerte ihr schnell zu. Mit einem Grinsen, das breiter war als der Vollmond zog Odette ihre Hände an die Brust und sah ihm zu. Die Musik setzte ein und sie verlor sich in dem Geschehen. Alle hinter der Bühne staunten. Louis Merante tanzte mit einer Leichtigkeit und Grazie, als wäre es das Selbstverständlichste auf der Welt. Odette vergaß alles was um sie geschah. Dass sie bald auftreten würde und sogar ihre Nervosität. Als Louis als krönenden Abschluss mehr Umdrehungen schaffte als jemals jemand vor ihm, rastete das Publikum und alle hinter Bühne komplett aus. Odette sprang und jubelte. Euphorie strömte durch sie und gab ihr Kraft. Jetzt musste nur noch sie selber so einen phänomenalen Auftritt hinlegen. Endlich kam Louis wieder auf sie zu. Ihr freudiges Lächeln schwand, als sie sah, wie blass er plötzlich wurde. ,,Louis, ist alles ok? Du warst wirklich...\" Odette unterbrach ihren Satz, als der junge Tänzer plötzlich seine Hand auf ihr Schulter legte. ,,Urgh\" machte er ,,mir ist...\" und schon beugte er sich in die Ecke um sich zu übergeben. Die anderen Mädchen begannen sofort zu quieken und vor Ekel. Cloé und Odette weiteten ihre Augen. ,,Oh weih, oh weih\" Madame la Rette kam sofort an getakelt. Die Absätze ihrer Stöckelschuhe hallten. ,,Du meine Güte, Louis, ist alles in Ordnung\"? Fragte die Tanzlehrerin. ,,Wie sie sehen ist er nicht in Ordnung\" motzte Cloé, während Odette Louis den Rücken streichelte. ,,Hmn\" Madame la Rette rümpfte die Nase ,,Putzfrau bitte\"! Nach einer Weile richtete sich Merante wieder auf und schnaufte. Odette reichte ihm ein Tuch. ,,Danke dir\" nuschelte er beschämt. ,,Odette\" Madame la Rette klatschte in die Hände. ,,Regine tanzt gerade, ihr Auftritt ist gleich zu Ende. Mach dich bereit\". ,,Ja Madame\" Odette neigte den Kopf. ,,Du schaffst das schon Odette\" meinte Louis noch leicht aus der Puste, aber er schaffte es zu lächeln. ,,Natürlich schafft sie das\" erwiderte Cloé mit verschränkten Armen. ,,Wenn sie nicht so viele Umdrehungen extra macht. Mister Tanzmeister\". Verlegen kratzte sich Louis den Nacken. Odette stand schon am Rand des Bühneneingangs und beobachtete Regine. Sie tanzte gut, aber ihr fehlte die Leidenschaft. Das Herzblut. So Jemand wie sie würde auch niemals mit Herz tanzen können. Odette wusste das. Das schwarze Kleid passte zu ihrer Persönlichkeit. Odette seufzte. Sie wollte ihre gute Laune nicht weiter herunter ziehen. ,,Du schaffst das Odette\"! meinte Cloé, die mittlerweile neben ihr stand. ,,Danke\" Odette lächelte. ,,Das wird der beste Abend meines Lebens. Bis jetzt\". Cloé nickte. ,,Ja, rock die Bühne Odette\". Regine verneigte sich und machte eine Show eines Abganges, die für den Geschmack der beiden Mädchen maßlos übertrieben war. Neben Odette stoppte die schwarzhaarige kurz. ,,Viel Spaß bei deinem Auftritt Schwanenprinzessin\" raunte sie. ihr Ton war unheimlich ruhig und düster. Es jagte beiden einen Schauer über. Louis für seinen Teil, beobachtete Regine mit hoher Skepsis. Er mochte sie nicht und es gefiel ihm gar nicht, wie sie mit Odette umging. ,,Odette\" rief Madame la Rette ,,bist du bereit\"? Odette nickte. ,,Warm genug\"? Wieder nickte die Brünette. ,,Ok, dann viel Glück da draußen\". Cloé hielt die gedrückten Daumen hoch und grinste breit. Merante war neben sie getreten und lächelte ihr liebevoll zu. ,,Viel Glück\" riefen Beide und schon schritt Odette auf die Bühne. Die Musik ertönte und Odette war sofort in ihrem Element. Die Musik floss durch sie und jede Bewegung war so leicht als wäre es das einfachste auf der Welt. Als wäre sie eine Feder. Jeder Sprung von ihr war graziös und elegant. Alles war flüssig. Kein einziger Fehler. Alle, sowohl hinter der Bühne als auch im Publikum waren maßlos begeistert. Odette war erst sechzehn Jahre alt und trotzdem tanzte sie, als wäre sie schon eine professionelle Ballerina. Louis war Feuer und Flamme mit dem was er sah. Die Musik, der Tanz und vor allem der Tänzerin selbst. Cloé hingegen machte einem Goldfisch Konkurrenz.. Ihr Mund stand offen während ihre Augen immer größer wurden. Die Musik wurde immer schneller und lauter und dann setzte Odette zum Sprung an. Wie ein Reh so leichtfüßig und dann war es, als würde sie schweben. In all dem bezaubernden Geschehen merkte kaum jemand den plötzlich merkwürdigen Geruch. Ein stickiger, beißender Geruch. ,,Cloé\" flüsterte Louis etwas beunruhigt. ,,Riechst du das\"? Cloé schnupperte kurz und dann fing sie an zu husten. ,,Ja, irgendwas...irgendwas brennt glaub ich\". Und genauso schnell, wie die Beiden bemerkten, dass es nach Qualm stank, brach plötzlich ein Geschrei aus. Schwunghaft drehten Loius und Cloé ihre Köpfe zu der panischen Menge. Über ihnen brannte das Bühnendach. ,,Feuer\"! wurde geschrien. Odette war gerade bei den letzten Umdrehungen, als die Musik abbrach. Das Publikum hatte ebenfalls angefangen zu schreien, als die lodernden Flammen auf die Vorränge übersprangen und in Sekunden zu einem hohem Brand wurden. Rauch dichter als Nebel stieg auf und Odette begann heftig zu husten. Ihre Sicht wurde versperrt und sie wusste nicht mehr wo sie stand. ,,Hilfe\"! schrie sie erstickt und versuchte von der Bühne zu eilen. ,,Raus hier raus sofort! Die Bühne brennt! Schnell\"! Eilend führte der Direktor die die Meisten Tänzer gemeinsam mit Madame la Rette hinaus. ,,Odette\"! schrie Cloé panisch. ,,Odette, wo ist sie\"? keifte Louis. ,,Ich weiß es nicht, sie ist noch nicht von der Bühne\" jammerte Cloé verzweifelt. Alles ging so schnell. Zu schnell. Das Feuer wurde immer größer, je mehr Sekunden verstrichen. ,,Hilfe\"! schrie Odette erneut ,,Ich kann nichts sehen\"! der Rauch brannte in den Augen. Vor noch knappen fünf Minuten war alles in Ordnung und jetzt stand alles in Flammen. ,,Louis\"! schrie Odette. ,,Hilfe\"! und erneut hustete sie. ,,Odette\"! schrie Merante zurück, als er ihre Stimme vernahm. ,,Louis\"! Cloés Augen waren panisch aufgerissen. ,,Oh Gott Louis sie ist irgendwo da im Rauch\". ,,Geh Hilfe holen, schnell\" mahnte Louis und Cloé rannte los. ,,Odette wo bist du\"? schrie Merante erneut, als er sich durch den Rauch kämpfte. ,,Louis, Hilfe\"! Das war ihre Stimme. ,,Odette\"! hustend wedelte er den Rauch vor sich weg. Es war heiß, sehr heiß und die Luft wurde knapper. ,,Er müsste sich beeilen, sonst würden beide an einer Rauchvergiftung sterben. Plötzlich krachte vor ihm ein Holzbalken hinunter und ein Schrei zerriss die Stille. ,,Odette\"! jetzt rannte Louis zu dem Balken und was er sah zerschmetterte alles in ihm. Der dünne Balken war auf Odettes Hüfte gestürzt und jetzt war sie eingeklemmt. ,,Louis\" Odette hob den Kopf. Tränen strömten über ihre Wangen. ,,Bleib ruhig\"! Mit all seiner Kraft hob er den Balken hoch und warf hin zur Seite. ,,Ich kann nicht laufen Louis\" weinte Odette. Ohne zu zögern packte Louis die verletzte Brünette, hob sie in seine Arme und rannte stolpernd los. Ihm selber wurde schwindelig. Binnen Sekunden hatte er den Ausgang erreicht, in dem schon die Feuerwehr auf ihn zu steuerten. Alles um ihn war verschwommen. Stimmen klangen stumpf und dröhnend. Er hatte nur Angst um Odette. Man sprach mit ihm und nahm ihm Odette aus den Armen. ,,Nein nicht\"! rief er aber er wurde von Ärzten fest gehalten. Er wollte sie nicht los lassen, wollte sie nicht gehen lassen. Nachdem die Sicht wieder etwas klarer wurde, konnte er erkennen, wie die Ärzte Odette auf eine Liege legten. Madame la Rette war in Hysterie ausgebrochen. Weitere Ärzte mussten sie beruhigen. Der Direktor sprach mit der Polizei. Was war überhaupt geschehen? Wie konnte ein Feuer so plötzlich ausbrechen? Zwischen den Wirren Chaos konnte Merante kaum einen klaren Gedanken fassen. Nur einen. Odette. Panisch sandte er ein Gebet. ,,Bitte lass sie leben\" Das einzige was Odette noch spürte waren Schmerzen. Unerträgliche Schmerzen. Alles brannte. Ihre Lunge, ihre Augen, ihr Hals. Ihr war fürchterlich heiß. Louis trug sie und sie hatte furchtbare Angst. Ihr Bewusstsein schwand immer mehr. Ihre Ohren fiepten und ihr war schwindelig. Würde sie sterben? Ihre Augen begannen zu flattern. In der Ferne konnte sie Silhouetten erkennen, die auf sie zu kamen. Es mussten Feuerwehrmänner sein und da waren Sirenen. Ein letztes Mal kämpfte sie wach zu bleiben, aber ihr Körper war zu schwach und der Schmerz zu stark. Ihr wurde schwarz vor Augen und dann sank sie in die Bewusstlosigkeit.[Chapter 5] Eine ganze Weile lang verharrte Odette mit ihrem Kopf auf Mérantes Schulter. Am liebsten hätte sie ihren Gefühlen nachgegeben. Aber sie konnte nicht. Sie durfte nicht. Nicht hier. Mérante war ein wichtiger Mann an dem Opernhaus und gut angesehen in der Gesellschaft. Er hatte sich seine Karriere aufgebaut und Odette wollte sie nicht zerstören. Es war schon schlimm genug, dass sie niemand mehr erkannte und sie ihre Beziehung zu dem Tanzlehrer geheim halten musste. Ein Jahr lang waren sie schon zusammen und dennoch kam sie sich albern vor. Es war ein furchtbares Gefühl ihn in der Öffentlichkeit beim Nachnamen zu nennen und sobald sie sicher alleine waren, konnte sie ihn beim Vornamen nennen. Kurz nach Félicies Debüt waren sie zusammen gekommen. Noch wusste die junge Rothaarige nichts davon. Es würde Odette viel zu sehr verletzen, würde Louis ihretwegen böse Blicke erhalten. Die Brünette seufzte tief. ,,Was hast du\"? erkundigte sich Louis sanft. Er hatte den plötzlichen Stimmungswechsel sofort bemerkt und sah seine Freundin nun eindringlich an. ,,Wenn das einer erfährt...\" begann Odette schließlich und drehte sich von ihm weg ,,Das mit uns...\" sie schluckte schwer ,,Dann könnte das fatale Folgen haben für dich Louis\". Er sah sie kurz überrascht an, lächelte dann aber. ,,Und du denkst wohl das wäre mir wichtiger\"? Perplex wandte sich Odette wieder um ,,Wie meinst du...\"? Liebevoll schob der Schwarzhaarige seine Freundin wieder zu sich ,,So wie ich es gesagt habe\". ,,Ja aber..\" setzte Odette an. ,,Nichts aber\" brachte er sie zum Schweigen. ,,Regine ist fort und wird dir und Félicie nie wieder etwas antun. Du wurdest damals von Claire Le Haut adoptiert. Du hast nichts zu befürchten. Du müsstest nicht einmal mehr als Putzfrau arbeiten\". Odette sah zur Seite. ,,Ich kann das nicht\". ,,Warum nicht\"? Mérante folgte ihrem Blick. ,,Es würde ihr das das Herz brechen, würde sie erfahren, dass ich es bin. Dass, dass ich so tief gesunken bin. Von Prima Ballerina zur Putzfrau\". Louis Augen weiteten sich. ,,Odette, sie mich an\" und er hob ihr Kinn. ,,All die siebzehn Jahre haben sich meine Gefühle für dich nicht verändert. Im Gegenteil. Ich könnte alles verlieren und es wäre mir egal. Dich zu verlieren allerdings...\" Er kam ihr verdächtig nahe. ,,Ich dachte du erkennst mich nicht wieder\" hastete Odette. ,,Ich habe dich sofort wiedererkannt\" bemerkte er mit einem stolzen Schmunzeln. ,,Ich glaube kaum, dass irgendjemand etwas gegen uns haben würde. Ich habe mich für dich entschieden\". ,,Die Leute werden starren\" erwiderte Odette. ,,Dann lass sie starren\" konterte Mérante und sofort erinnerte sich Odette. ,,Felicie war auch eine Weise und schau was aus ihr geworden ist. Sie ist auf dem besten Weg in deine Fußstapfen zu treten. Wer urteilt nach ihrer Herkunft? Sie ist mutig, leidenschaftlich, selbstbewusst, ehrlich und liebenswert. So wie du\". Über Odettes Lippen breitete sich ein zaghaftes Lächeln aus. ,,Also\"? ,,Also\"? Wiederholte Louis. ,,Was hast du jetzt vor\"? erkundigte sich die Brünette. ,,Das erfährst du heute Abend\"! Mérante drehte sich von Odette weg und schmunzelte über seine Schulter. Odette blinzelte irritiert ,,Louis...\". ,,Ich hole dich heute Abend ab. Pünktlich um sieben Uhr\" bestimmte ihr Freund und schritt voraus. ,,Louis jetzt warte mal\" unterbrach ihn Odette. ,,Wie stellst du dir das vor? Was soll ich Felicie erzählen\"? Louis drehte sich nochmal um. ,,Sag ihr du bist mit ihrem Geburtstagsgeschenk beschäftigt\". Odette zog nun auch schmunzelnd die Lippen zur Seite, schüttelte den Kopf und verschränkte die Arme. ,,Also wirklich Louis, ich werde die Kleine nicht anlügen nur um mit dir auf ein Rondevouz zu gehen\". Mérante hob eine Augenbraue und begann zu kichern ,,Oh wer sagte denn, dass es ein Rondevouz wird\"? Nach der Aussage nahm Odettes Gesicht ein tiefes Rot an. ,,D-das meinte ich nicht so ...also ich dachte ..ich meinte..\". ,,Aber wenn du es schon so erwähnst meine Liebe...\" Louis machte wieder ein paar Schritte auf sie zu ,,Muss ich gestehen, dass das sogar zum größten Teil meine Absicht war\". ,,Ok Don Juan, dann vertraue ich dir mal\" Odette hob das Kinn und lief an ihrem Freund vorbei. ,,Ich habe noch ein paar Dinge zu erledigen. Ich sollte mich beeilen\" sie zwinkerte. ,,Touché\" grinste der Tanzlehrer und verließ dann selber die Oper. Allmählich wurde es Abend. Odette war fertig mit dem Putzen und begab sich zurück zu ihrem Zimmer. Ein wenig wunderte sich die Brünette doch. Sonst kam Felicié immer noch einmal um ihr zur helfen. In letzter Zeit aber verbrachte die junge Tänzerin viel mit ihren Freunden. Besonders viel allerdings mit Victor. Die Beiden standen sich nach wie vor sehr nahe. Man konnte sie nicht trennen. Wie Pech und Schwefel, nannte sie Louis. Auf Odettes vorsichtigen Fragen hin, ob Feliecé Victor denn mehr als nur mögen tat, wich ihr die Rothaarige jedes Mal geschickt aus. Wir sind nur beste Freunde, war dann die Antwort. ,,Odette\"! riss sie eine bekannte Stimme aus den Gedanken. Sofort drehte die Brünette ihren Kopf. ,,Felicié\" rief sie zurück. Die Rothaarige kam gerade den Gang entlang gerannt, direkt in Odettes Arme. ,,Wie war dein Tag\"? erkundigte sich die Brünette mit einem lächeln. ,,Toll wie immer\" antwortete Felicié. ,,Wie immer\"? Odette lachte als sie die Tür zu ihren Zimmer öffnete. ,,Ja, naja, die machen alle ein riesen Geheimnis um Morgen\" entgegnete Felicié und folgte Odette in den Raum. ,,Kann ich verstehen\" erwiderte Odette während sie den Besen und den Putzeimer in ihre Ecke stellte. ,,Es ist ja auch dein Geburtstag\". Felicié lächelte verlegen. ,,Bisher haben sich noch nie so viele Mühe gemacht. Ich meine Viktor...er ja. Er hat jedes Jahr etwas für mich. Ich bin es einfach nicht gewohnt\". Odette lächelte über die Worte der jungen Tänzerin. ,,Nun, ich bin sicher, dieses Jahr wird es ein ganz besonderer Geburtstag\". ,,Ehrlich\"? Damit hatte Odette Feliciés Neugierde geweckt. ,,Oh nein\" Odette hob eine Augenbraue ,,Ich kenne diesen Blick\". Felicié biss sich auf die Unterlippe. Wie gerne wüsste sie was Odette vorhatte. Mit einem Schmunzeln auf den Lippen, drehte sich Odette zu den Schränken um, um das letzte Stück Brot und Aufschnitt hervor zu holen. Feliciés brennenden Blick konnte die Brünette förmlich auf ihrer Schulter spüren. ,,Hör auf mich so zu beobachten, ich verrate es dir nicht. Das ist ein Geburtstagsgeschenk\". Hob sie streng an. ,,Ich weiß ja\" entgegnete Felicié kichernd und spielte mit ihren Fingern. ,,Also\"? Odette legte das Brot auf einen Teller und gab es Felicié. ,,Danke\" erwiderte sie. ,,Bitteschön\" Odette setzte sich ebenfalls. ,,Isst du denn nichts\"? hob die Rothaarige an. Odette blinzelte. ,,Nein, schon gut\". Kurz sahen sich beide an, bis Odette den Blick abwandte. Tatsächlich arbeitete sie in letzter Zeit härter als sonst. Aß kaum etwas um Geld zu sparen und schlief noch weniger als sonst. Alles nur um Felicié das Kleid zu schenken, dass sie in einer Boutique gesehen hatte. Ein schönes kurzes Kleid, dass ihr bis zu den Knien reichte. Es war himmelblau mit weiser Spitze. Es war wie gemacht für Felicié. Odette erinnerte sich noch ganz genau, wie sie mit ihr in der Stadt unterwegs war. Sie kamen gerade vom Markt, da war Felicié plötzlich an einem Schaufenster kleben geblieben. Die Augen geweitet, starrte sie auf das Kleid. ,,Felicié\"? rief sie Odette, aber die Aufmerksamkeit der jungen Tänzerin war völlig auf das Kleid gerichtet. ,,Odette schau mal\" hauchte sie ,,Ist es nicht traumhaft\"? Odette, die neben sie getreten war, lächelte und schaute nun auch in das Schaufenster. Ihr Magen verkrampfte sich allerdings, als sie den Preis sah. Viel zu hoch für sie. Dafür müsste sie Überstunden machen. Als sie Felicié so sah, konnte sie nicht anders. Sie liebte das kleine Mädchen wie eine Tochter und außerdem hatte sie kein Geburtstagsgeschenk. Deshalb nahm Odette all die Arbeit auf sich und kaufte Felicié das Kleid. Felicié aß ohne sich zu beschweren. Im Waisenhaus hatte es auch nichts sonderlich Besseres gegeben. Nicht nur da die junge Tänzerin es gewohnt war kein Festmahl serviert zu bekommen. Sie gab sich auch zufrieden, denn sie wusste wie hart Odette arbeitete. Nach dem Essen machte sich Felicié schnell Bett fertig, huschte unter die Decke und wartete. Odette setzte sich auf den Bettrand neben sie. ,,Freust du dich auf Morgen\"? erkundigte sie sich. Felicié grinste ,,Ja, ich habe ja dich und Victor, Camille, Nora, Dora und Rudi\". Odette lächelte und strich Felicié liebevoll über die Wange. Auf die Geste hin, richtete sich die Rothaarige auf ihre Knie und umarmte Odette. Sofort erwiderte sie die Umarmung und drückte die Kleine noch enger an sich. ,,Ich habe dich so lieb\" flüsterte Felicié. ,,Oh\" machte Odette ergriffen und vergrub ihre Nase in Feliciés Haaren. ,,Ich dich auch\". Zwischen den Beiden war eine tiefe Verbindung entstanden. Odette war jeden Tag dankbar die Kleine zu haben. Sie konnte sich gar nicht mehr vorstellen ohne sie zu sein. Sie wartete noch, bis Felicié eingeschlafen war und stand dann vorsichtig auf. Liebevoll zog sie die Decke bis zu dem Kinn der Rothaarigen hoch, gab ihr einen Kuss, strich ihr über die Stirn und warf dann einen Blick auf die Uhr. Kurz vor Sieben. Sie seufzte. So wie sie Louis kannte, würde er mehr als nur pünktlich erscheinen. Eilig schaute sich Odette noch einmal im Spiegel an. Wirklich gefallen tat sie sich nicht. Sie hatte abgenommen. Teilweise fragte sich die Brünette, was Louis überhaupt an ihr fand. Ein Klopfen an der Tür riss Odette aus ihren Gedanken. Auf Stichwort begann ihr Puls höher zu schlagen. Seufzend strich sie sich den Rock glatt und öffnete dem Tanzlehrer. ,,Bon soir mon Cher\". Meranté neigte den Kopf. Überrumpelt blinzelte die Brünette. ,,Guten Abend Louis\". ,,Felicié\"? erkundigte er sich. ,,Sie schläft\" entgegnete Odette knapp. ,,Gehen wir\". So leise wie möglich schloss sie die Tür hinter sich. Eine Weile schwiegen Beide, bis sie etwas von der Tür entfernt waren. Meranté beobachtet Odette, ihm war sofort aufgefallen, dass sie etwas bedrückte. ,,Odette\"? er wartete, da sie beschämt den Blick zur Seite gewandt hatte. ,,Tut mir leid, dass du mich so ansehen musst\". Louis hob eine Augenbraue ,,Was meinst du\"? ,,Sieh mich doch an Louis\" Odette drehte sich zu ihm ,,Ich sehe furchtbar aus im Gegensatz zu dir\". ,,Pardon\"? Meranté stutzte. ,,Sei bitte ehrlich zu mir\" sie sah erneut zur Seite, da packte sie der Tanzlehrer an den Schultern und sah ihr ernst in die Augen. ,,Hör mir zu Odette\" sein Tonfall war streng. Überrascht weitete Odette ihre Augen. ,,Ich will, dass du nie wieder, und damit meine ich, NIE WIEDER, so etwas über dich sagst. Du bist so viel mehr als nur das Äußere Odette. Weißt du denn immer noch nicht wie sehr ich für dich empfinde? Ich kenne deine derzeitige Lage. Denkst du das beeinflusst mich? Habe ich mich jemals anders verhalten\"? Die Brünette schüttelte den Kopf. Tränen sammelten sich in den Augen. Liebevoll hob Louis eine Hand an ihre Wange um sie zu trösten, da fing sie an zu weinen. Sofort nahm der Tanzlehrer seine Freundin in die Arme. Wie lange hatte sie ihre Gefühle in sich gefressen? Wie lange hatte sie sie runter geschluckt und verdrängt? Es war höchste Zeit, dass Odette los ließ. All den Schmerz, all die Zweifel. Nach einer Weile fing sich die Brünette wieder. ,,Danke\" schniefte sie und strich sich mit dem Daumengelenk die Tränen weg. ,,Du musst dich nicht entschuldigen Mon Cher\". bekräftige Meranté. Odette formte ein Lächeln und zusammen verließen sie die Oper. Draußen war es mittlerweile dunkel geworden. Die Straßenlampen waren angegangen. Es war Frühling und noch etwas kühl in der Nacht. ,,Wo gehen wir hin\"? Erkundigte sich Odette. ,,Lass dich überraschen\" entgegnete Louis, woraufhin Odette schmunzelnd die Augen rollte. Eine Weile lang liefen sie, bis sie vor einem Restaurant stehen blieben. ,,Belmonte\" laß Odette den Namen des Restaurants. Ihre Augen weiteten sich. Angst überkam sie, als die Erinnerungen ihr Gedächtnis fluteten. Cloés Vater hatte damals in dem Restaurant von Claire le Haut gearbeitet. Hatte er sich nun selbstständig gemacht oder war es Zufall? Odette hatte Cloé seit Jahren nicht mehr gesehen. Damals nach dem Unfall, musste Cloé gemeinsam mit ihren Eltern nach Amerika. Regine le Haut hatte später das Restaurant ihrer Mutter übernommen. Nachdem sie ins Gefängnis kam, ging die Führung an denn Mann von Richard Le Hauts Schwester. Diane. ,,Ist das etwa..\" begann Odette. ,,Ja ist es\" bestätigte Louis. ,,Ich kann da nicht rein\" fiepte Odette ,,Was wenn Cloé da drin ist. Ich will nicht, dass sie mich so sieht\". Liebevoll legte Louis seinen Arm um Odette. ,,Keine Sorge, Cloé ist im Moment nicht da. Du wirst sie treffen, wenn du dazu bereit bist\". Kurz sah Odette Louis an, nickte schließlich und folgte ihm in das Restaurant. Odette staunte, das Restaurant war edel und hochwertig. Sie freute sich für Cloé und ihre Familie. Zusammen suchten sich Odette und Louis einen Platz in der Ecke. Bevor Odette auch nur den Stuhl berühren konnte, hatte Louis ihn schon für sie zurück geschoben. ,,Bitte\" er lächelte sie an. Odette erwiderte die Geste dankend und setzte sich. Louis nahm Odettes Poncho und seinen Mantel und hing sie an den Kleiderständer. ,,Gefällt es dir\"? Erkundigte er sich, nachdem er sich ebenfalls gesetzt hatte. ,,Sehr\" entgegnete Odette glücklich ,,Es ist nur..\" ihr Lächeln schwand etwas. Louis sah sie fragend an. ,,Das ist so ein edles Restaurant und ich...Schau doch wie ich gekleidet bin\". Liebevoll reichte Louis seine Hände über den Tisch um ihre zu fassen. ,,Wenn Jemand etwas an deiner Kleidung auszusetzen hat, soll er sich an mich wenden. Ich denke, aber, dass in diesem Restaurant keiner so unhöflich wäre\". Odette lächelte wieder. ,,Also\" hob Louis an ,,Was möchtest du essen? Du kannst bestellen was immer du magst\". ,,Hmm\" neugierig nahm Odette die Speisekarte. Wie lange war es her, dass sie so reichlich essen konnte? Kurz wanderten ihre Augen über den Rand der Karte. Louis sah sie direkt an. Überrascht über den intensiven Blickkontakt, errötete Odette. Wie gut, das die Karte das meiste von ihrem Gesicht verbarg. Nach einer Weile, hatten beide bestellt und begannen zu essen. ,,Ich weiß gar nicht, wie ich dir danken soll Louis\" fing Odette an ,,Für Alles\". ,,Hey\" entgegnete Louis sanft ,,Alles wird gut werden. Vertraust du mir\"? Verblüfft hob Odette ihren Blick zu ihrem Freund. Sein Gesichtsausdruck war weich und gefühlvoll. In seinen Augen jedoch, lag ein geheimnisvoller Schimmer. ,,Du hast mehr vor als nur Essen in einem schicken Restaurant hab ich recht\"? Erkundigte sich Odette und Louis begann ertappt zu schmunzeln. ,,Erwischt\" erwiderte er. Odette kicherte amüsiert. Sie genoss es seit Langem wieder so ausgelassen mit Louis zu sprechen. Sie unterhielten sich über viele Dinge. Über vergangene Erinnerungen und schließlich über Felicies Geburtstag. ,,Und deswegen habe ich härter gearbeitet..\" erklärte Odette seufzend. ,,Das dachte ich mir\" gab Louis zu ,,Du hättest doch zu mit kommen können\" er strich über ihre Hand. ,,Ich weiß\" murmelte Odette ,,aber es war mir unangenehm\". ,,Dir muss überhaupt nichts unangenehm sein. Nicht bei mir. Du weißt, ich würde alles für dich tun\". Odettes Herz schlug einen Takt höher, als sie die Worte vernahm. ,,Louis..\" sie sah zur Seite. ,,Lass uns draußen weiter reden\" entschied Louis, stand auf, zahlte und half Odette mit ihrem Poncho. Gemeinsam liefen sie in Richtung Eifelturm. Odette hatte ihren Arm unter Louis seinen eingeharkt. ,,Ich verstehe es immer noch nicht\" fing die Brünette ihren alten Satz wieder auf. ,,Wieso Louis? Wieso mich? Ich bin dünn, arm, ich kann kaum laufen\". Louis stoppte abrupt und drehte sich zu seiner Freundin um. ,,Weil ich dich liebe Odette\"! entgegnete er standhaft ,,Ich liebe dich\" wiederholte er und nahm abermals ihre Hände in seine. ,,Sagt dir das denn gar nichts? Ich lege kein Wert auf all diese Dinge. Ich liebe dich für den Menschen der du bist. Das habe ich schon immer getan\". Völlig ergriffen, starrte Odette ihn an, Tränen in den Augen. ,,Es war nicht der Tanz oder dein Talent, in das ich mich verleibt habe sondern du. Du ganz alleine. Hast du wirklich geglaubt, ich würde aufhören dich zu lieben, nur weil du nicht mehr tanzt? Nicht mehr richtig laufen kannst? Oder etwas an Gewicht verloren hast\"? Odette schluckte. ,,Odette\" Louis holte Luft ,,Ich habe nie aufgehört dich zu lieben. Ich wünschte ich hätte es dir damals gesagt\". Odette blinzelte. Unfähig auch nur ein Wort zu sagen hörte sie ihm zu, während Tränen über ihre Wange rollten. Das wollte er also damals sagen? ,,Was passiert ist tut mir so unfassbar leid. Ich wünschte ich hätte für dich da sein können\". ,,Du bist jetzt da\" hauchte Odette und er schloss seinen Mund zu einem dankbaren Lächeln. ,,Ja\" entgegnete er ,,Und ich werde dich nie wieder alleine lassen\". Schluchzend drückte Odette sich in seine Arme. All die Ängste die sie hatte, verfolgen. Wie konnte sie nur so ignorant sein? Sie wusste doch wie Louis empfand. Jetzt fand sie es beinahe zum Lachen. Siebzehn Jahre lang liebten sie sich. Und siebzehn Jahre, hatten sie gebraucht um zusammen zu kommen. Tief ausatmend, löste sich Odette von ihrem Freund und sah zum Eiffelturm rauf. ,,Übermorgen ist Felicies Geburtstag\" bemerkte Odette nach einer Weile. ,,Kaum zu glauben, dass es schon ein Jahr her ist\". Beide lächelten bei den Erinnerungen. ,,Sie bedeutet dir viel, habe ich recht\"? Louis sah sie wissend an. ,,Oh ja\" bestätigte Odette ,,Sie ist wie eine Tochter. Fehlt bloß...\" sie brach ab. ,,Ein Vater\"? Ergänzte Louis den Satz. Überrumpelt blinzelte Odette ihren Freund an ,,Louis was...\". Und eben hatte Odette noch geglaubt, es könnte sie nicht noch mehr überraschen, da ging Merante tatsächlich vor ihr auf die Knie. Fassungslos öffnete Odette ihren Mund und ihre Augen weiteten sich. Alles in ihr verkrampfte sich für diesen Moment. Passierte das gerade wirklich? War sie wach, oder träumte sie? ,,Odette\" begann er, während er eine kleine Box aus seiner Manteltasche hervor holte. ,,Würdest du mir die Ehre erweisen mich zu deinem Mann zu nehmen\"? Immer noch starr vor Schock, starrte Odette den schwarzhaarigen Tanzlehrer vor sich an. Die Hände an ihre Brust gezogen, blinzelte sie. Vorsichtig öffnete Louis das kleine Kästchen und präsentierte einen goldenen Ring. Zwei winzige Schwäne trafen sich und und trugen einen Diamanten in der Mitte. Für ein paar Sekunden, glaubte Odette bewusstlos zu werden, aber sie blieb bei sich. ,,willst du mich heiraten\"? Wiederholte Merante seine Frage. Nach Luft schnappend, blinzelte Odette ihre Tränen fort. Ihre Lippen zitterten, doch endlich riss sie sich aus ihrer Schockstarre um völlig aufgelöst zu nicken. ,,Natürlich will ich\"! Und fiel ihrem Freund geradewegs in die Arme. Freudig und überglücklich, schloss Merante seine Arme um Odette. Er hatte nicht gezweifelt, dass sie, Ja, sagen würde, aber dennoch hatte er für den Bruchteil einer Sekunde einen Anflug von Nervosität gespürt. Lächelnd sah er sie an. ,,Wenn ich bitten darf\"? Immer noch weinend, hielt Odette ihm ihre Hand hin, sodass er den Ring über ihren Finger schieben konnte. Begeistert betrachtete Odette das Schmuckstück. ,,Oh Louis, der ist wundervoll\" hauchte sie. ,,Ich bin froh, dass er dir gefällt\". Über den Fakt, war Merante erleichterter als er sich anmerken ließ. ,,Und die Schwäne\" sie kicherte leise ,,Ich hätte auch, Ja, gesagt, hättest du mir einen Holzring gegeben\". Louis rollte mit den Augen und zog seine frisch Verlobte an sich. ,,Und ohne Ring\"? Die Frage überhörte Odette mit Absicht und legte stattdessen ihre Lippen auf seine. Leidenschaftlich erwiderte Louis den Kuss. ,,Waren das die Feinheiten, von denen du gesprochen hattest\"? Erkundigte sich Odette nachdem sie sich von einander gelöst hatten. ,,Nicht ganz\" gab Merante zu. ,,Nicht ganz\"? Odette hob ihre Augenbrauen ,,Was kommt als Nächstes? Mehr als das hier, wird es mich nicht mehr überraschen\". ,,Es hat etwas mit Felicie zu tun\" bekräftige Merante. ,,Louis\"? Odette beobachtete ihren Verlobten skeptisch. ,,Ich habe dir versprochen dir und Felicie das Leben zu geben, dass ihr verdient\". ,,Das hast du aber..\" Odette hob die Hand an ihren Mund, als Louis eine Rolle Papier hervorholte. ,,Was ist das\"? Fragte Odette. ,,Mach es auf\" forderte Merante liebevoll. Kurz verstummte Odette, als sie konzentriert auf das Papier sah um es zu lesen. Wenige Sekunden später hob sie den Kopf mit nicht weniger Schock geweiteten Augen. ,,Aber das ist ja...\". Louis schmunzelte nur. ,,Adoptionspapiere\" stellte Odette atemlos fest. ,,Richtig\" entgegnete Louis ,,Wenn du das möchtest\" fügte er noch hinzu. ,,Louis\"! Und sie fiel ihm erneut um den Hals. Hätte ihre Hüfte es zugelassen, wäre sie gesprungen. ,,Meinst du das ernst\"? Er lächelte immer noch. ,,Wir wären dann eine richtige Familie\". Tief ausatment, sah Odette ein weiteres Mal auf die Papiere ,,Glaubst du Felicie ist damit einverstanden\"? Louis legte seine Hand auf ihre Schulter ,,Wieso sollte sie es nicht sein? Sie sieht in dir genauso eine Mutter, wie du eine Tochter in ihr\". ,,Und du, ich meine wir? Das mit uns...\". ,,Felicie ist ein cleveres Mädchen\" hob Louis an ,,Wenn mich nicht alles täuscht, dürfte sie es schon längst heraus gefunden haben\". Flashback - Felicie POV Lächelnd schloss Felicie ihre Augen. Sie war so glücklich wie noch nie. Sie konnte es kaum glauben. Sie erinnerte sich an das vergangene Jahr, welches ihr komplettes Leben verändert hatte. Niemals hätte sie gedacht, dass die Flucht von ihr und Viktor, zu dem Leben führen würde, welches sie jetzt hatte. Dass Camille le Haut ihre beste Freundin werden würde und Odette eine Mutter. So sehr Felicie auch versuchte einzuschlafen, die Vorfreude hielt sie wach. Aufstehen konnte sie nicht mehr, also lauschte sie einfach nur, wie Odette vom Bettrand aufstand, ihr einen zarten Kuss auf die Stirn hauchte und dann über ihren Kopf strich. Felicie kannte diese Art von Zärtlichkeit nicht. Im Waisenhaus hatte man ihr keine Gutenachtgeschichten erzählt. Kein Schlaflied gesungen und schon gar nicht hatte man ihr einen Gute-Nacht-kuss gegeben. Dies waren Dinge, die eine Mutter tat. Odette selber ertappte sich dabei, immer wieder aufs Neue, überrascht zu sein, wie gut sie die Mutterrolle einnahm. Felicie öffnete ihre Augen einen winzigen Spalt. Odette hatte ihre Arbeitsschürze ausgezogen und stand nun vor dem Spiegel. Felicie hörte sie seufzen. Die junge Rothaarige hatte schon längst bemerkt, dass Odette etwas belasten musste. Sie arbeitete mehr. Plötzlich klopfte es leise. Instinktiv zog Felicie die Decke höher an die Nase, um nicht ertappt zu werden. Sie hörte, wie Odette die Tür öffnete. ,,Bon soir mon Cher\"! Hauchte eine Stimme die Felicie nur zu gut kannte. Merante? Jetzt war die Neugierde in der jungen Tänzerin erst recht geweckt. Vorsichtig öffnete sie ihre Augen um zu der Tür zu spähen. Tatsächlich, da stand ihr Tanzlehrer Louis Merante. Ein breites Lächeln huschte über Felicies Lippen. Natürlich hatte sie gewusst, wovon Camille sprach. Es hatte ihr einfach Spaß gemacht, ihre Freundin ein wenig aus der Reserve zu locken. In Wahrheit, war Felicie sogar die Erste gewesen, die bemerkt hatte, dass Odette und Merante starke Gefühle für einander haben mussten. Umso glücklicher war sie nun, dass die Beiden Zeit miteinander verbrachten. Felicie freute sich ebenso wenn Odette glücklich war. Nach der Zeit mit Regine hatte sie es mehr als nur verdient. Odette hatte Felicie nie von ihrer Vergangenheit erzählt, aber es interessierte sie unheimlich. ,,Guten Abend Louis\". Hörte Felicie Odette antworten. Ihre Stimme war leise und zurückhaltend. ,,Felicié\"? Hörte sie Merante ihren Namen sprechen. Gerade rechtzeitig, schloss Felicie wieder ihre Augen, als die beiden Erwachsenen in ihre Richtung sahen. ,,Sie schläft\" kam die Antwort von Odette. Puh! Dachte sich Felicie innerlich. ,,Gehen wir\" vernahm sie noch Metante sagen und dann schloss sich die Tür. Sofort riss Felicie wieder die Augen auf, richtete sich etwas auf im Bett und spähte zur Tür. Odette war fort. Ihr Lächeln wurde noch breiter und sie kicherte. ,,Ich glaubs nicht\" sie biss sie auf die Unterlippe ,,Odette und Merante. Ich wusste es\"! Schnell eilte die Rothaarige an das Fenster, um hinunter auf die Straße zu sehen. Wenig später sah sie tatsächlich Odette und ihren Tanzlehrer die Straße hoch laufend. Interessiert, beobachtete Felicie die Beiden. Plötzlich blieben sie stehen. ,,Hhm\"? Felicie zog die Augenbrauen zusammen. Wieso blieben sie stehen? Es schien als würden sie miteinander reden. Plötzliche nahm Merante Odette in den Arm. ,,Man, ich würde jetzt echt gerne Mäuschen spielen\"! Bemerkte Felicie zu sich selbst. Im selben Moment, dachte sie daran, wie Camille wohl ausflippen würde, würde sie wissen, dass Felicie schon lange vor ihr wusste, dass Odette und Merante zusammen waren. Noch eine Weile sah die junge Tänzerin aus dem Fenster, bis Merante und Odette nicht mehr zu sehen waren. Gähnend, drehte sich Felicie um und schlurfte zu ihrem Bett zurück. Jetzt war sie doch müde geworden. Erschöpft kroch sie unter die Bettdecke, rutschte ein paar mal umher bis sie in einer für sie gemütlichen Position lag und schloss dann die Augen. Während sie sich noch fragte, was Odette und Merante nun taten und was für Geschenke sie wohl übermorgen bekommen würde, bemerkte sie gar nicht, wie sie langsam aber sicher in einen tiefen erholsamen Schlaf fiel.

Took one hell of a time but I love it! Please let me know if you enjoyed this and comment down below. Please look at my profile if you'd like to message me a story recommendation. Hint: Slight Angst and Miscarriage mentioned, fluff too! Enjoy! Months has gone by, as it was a brand new day for Félicie and Odette, but this day was gonna be special. Félicie was officially adopted by Odette after the Ballet and it was so surreal, but it was the happiest day and Christmas they ever had. Ever since Odette found out she couldn't conceive anymore , and had the accident, it made her cold, and concealed herself from the world that brought so much pain, but when she met Félicie, she was given a new opportunity to love and care for the child that brought so much joy. It mended her heart and gave her hope. You could say that Mérante has made her life happy in a way, considering they had a night out together alone. It was magical, of course lets not get into detail. Let's just say finally got what she deserved... Happiness. Though a few days later after the date, she felt... Off. She was more tired and hungry. This has been going on for awhile, she tried not to get it further, but it still lingered in her mind. Was something going on and she didn't know? Her mind was cut off by a small red haired girl who spoke. \"Hey mum, I'll be visiting Victor, he said that he has a new invention he wants me to see.\" Félicie said, tightning her shoe laces. Odette looked up from sweeping, looking at her new daughter and ray of sunshine. \"Alright but don't be late\". \"Don't worry mum, I won't.\" Félicie said walking in to her adopted mother and kissing her on the cheek, and leaving, shutting the door. Odette chuckled. She was so proud of Félicie, all the things she went through just to be a ballerina was beyond confident. Odette swept for awhile until she felt cramps. 'Maybe It was something I ate? Should I lie down?' She thought. Her mind kept on swarming until another cramp hit her, making her bend down, clutching her stomach. Waiting a few minutes to just breathe it out, she stood up, getting her cane and wobbled to the chair. It took a few minutes but she was utterly exhausted by then. Sighing, she tried to think of the symptoms. Cramps, tiredness and alittle hungrier than usual. She couldn't think of anything but a cold. Her mind didn't even think twice if she was pregnant because she was barren... Isn't she? \"Okay... Time to get u- ah!\" Odette felt water dripping from her thighs. Without even hesitating she sat down clutching the cane. The pain was unreal. She breathed heavily, laying he head on the cane that supported her. She felt pressure and had the urge to push. What was going on with her?! Finally easing alittle she heard a knock. Oh no, she totally forgot about the date Mérante they were gonna do. He opened the door and saw Odette with a red face, she looked in pain. \"Odette!?\" Mérante rushed to her side wondering what's going on. \"Are you okay?\" \"N-no I think something is wrong with me\" she panted. Mérante have never seen Odette in this pain before the accident. He didn't know what or how to help his lover. Taking a moment to think he saw blood on the Madam's dress. \"I-i think I n-need to look down under your dress\" he said trying to act all professional, but inside he was blushing hard. Odette nodded, not even caring, she just wanted to know what was going on down there. Carefully pulling up the ragged dress he took a peek and instantly pulled down, trying to process it. His face looked like he'd seen a ghost. Odette finally looked up and saw his surprising and worried face. \"Is something wrong?!\" Odette asked trying to figure out Mérante freezing face. It took a few moments until he said something that only Odette could dream of. \"Odette... Your having a baby...\" What?! No. She couldn't. She's barren. She couldn't have kids anymore after the devastation. This hit her like a rock. She didn't say anything until a cram- contraction her, making an instinct of expelling the child out. Oh dear, dear, dear. \"So... Hehe.\" Victor laughed nervously. Félicie had something white on her nose. She looked up at Victor and hit him on the back of the head with her hand and proceeded walking back home. \"Oh come on Félicie, it wasn't that bad.\" Rubbing the back of his head and running to catch up with Félicie. She stayed silent and Victor sighed \"Okay, okay you win... Igniting the firework in the room wasn't such a good idea, we learned our lessons and I'm a butt... Will you please forgive me?\" Félicie stopped and sighed, laughing afterwards. \"Fine I forgive you, but if Odette finds out you'll probably 6 inches shorter\" She smirked. Victor chuckled nervously. The white thing on her nose was something to help recover the damages. They made jokes and laughed until they heard a scream. It sounded like her adopted mother screaming. With that Félicie ran ahead to see the outcome of the scream was about. Finding the door to her home she immediately opened and froze to see Odette sitting, breathing heavily and Mérante his jacket off of him for once and a squabbling baby letting out warbles of cry in his hands bewteen Odette's legs. \"Uhhh...\" Félicie continued until Victor caught up with her and was about to ask about why she ran ahead until... \"Hey Félicie why did y-... Oh... OH!\" Félicie just stood there waiting for someone to respond, until Victor spoke up \"W-well I think this is a family issue so um... Bye!\" He lunged out the door, scrambling out. The baby's cries grew worse. Shaking her head she carefully went towards the couple and they didn't speak to her. \"So anyone going to explain this...?\" Félicie whispered. Mérante nodded alittle \"Later.\" Félicie nodded and looked back at the squirming baby who was still crying it's heart content. She looked at Odette who was still processing this. How? She couldn't conceive and yet she did? This didn't make sense. Her thoughts ended as the baby was clearly looking for it's mother. Odette let go of her cane letting it drop to the ground, and held out her hands. Showing she wanted to hold them. Mérante got the hint and handed the baby to her. She carefully supported the head with her hand and their body close to her body. She didn't know how to hold a baby but it seemed to make the baby stop crying. Instead they opened their eyes and a glimmer of infatuation came when she saw those beautiful blue eyes. \"Woah...\" Félicie put a shoulder on Odette \"So... Does this I have a sibling?\" She laughed quietly. Odette chuckled for a moment and looked down to see the baby was- a girl. She looked up at her daughter and smiled, nodding her head. \"Actually... A new sister.\" \"Wow... This is so sudden, but... Who's the father?\" The couple stayed silent until Mérante spoke quietly and quickly \"Uh me...\" Félicie knew that Odette and Mérante had a thing for each other but she definitely didn't expect to get that close for awhile. She let out a sigh and smiled \"Does this mean I get to call you dad?\" Mérante shook his head but let out a tired chuckle. Félicie laughed alittle to by her joke. Odette didn't even chuckle, she was to focus on the baby in her arms. Alittle while after, they got Odette situated in a bed with still the baby in her arms. They didn't have clothes for the new addition considering they didn't expect to get pregnant. So they wrapped the new baby girl in a small blanket that would at least keep them warm until then. Mérante leaving to get some clothes for the new bundle, Félicie sat beside the bed next to Odette. They stayed in comfortable silent until Félicie asked. \"So, when did you tie the knot with Mérante?\" Odette looked away from the baby glanced at Félicie who was waiting for an answer. \"Probably a few months ago...\" She guessed. She didn't know when but probably around 9 months to actually give birth. What was strange is that, she didn't grow, nor gain weight or have symptoms of pregnancy. \"Were you expecting this?\" Félicie asked. Odette smiled tiredly at the small child in her arms and whispered softly \"No... But it was certainly a Miracle.\" Félicie nodded at that. Before she was adopted by Odette. She thought she hated Kids.. especially orphans but she managed to change that. She didn't think that her mother was barren, and didn't even want kids of her own... Maybe she was wrong. \"Does that mean you thought you were...?\" \"Barren? Yeah... I thought I was too. After I had my misscar- I mean accident, I went to the doctors they confirmed I would never have kids.\" \"Oh... Well I guess they were wrong...\" Félicie raised her eyebrow on what she was about the say, but decided not look further into it. Odette nodded, her eyes still locked to the baby in her arms. \"Got any Names you want for her?\" Félicie asked, trying to lighten the mood. \"I was thinking... Felicity? I don't know yet. Didn't expect to have another child.\" She sighed, rubbing her thumb over the baby's soft, smooth skin. The baby whimpered at her mother showing discomfort, but she got used to it. Félicie smiled. \"I think that's a beautiful name.\" It was almost close to Félicie's name. \"Then Felicity it shall be.\" Odette smiled at Felicity who was still sleeping. How is this thing still sleeping? If anything it would probably be Odette who would be sleeping. They stayed in silent until Odette noticed her daughter had a white cloth pressed against their nose. She moved the baby into the other arm and put a hand on Félicie's cheek who jumped alittle. \"What happened to your nose?\" Odette asked, showing her mother protectiveness side. Félicie sighed, \" Victor decided to ignite a firework, I didn't Move fast enough, and it hit me right in the nose. I'm fine though, it's just sore.\" \"Your friend there is a nitwit, but at least your okay.\" Odette said sighing, taking her hand off of Félicie cheek. \"Just be careful alright?\" Félicie nodded. \"Don't worry, I'll be okay.\" Mérante came back with some clothes for his new daughter. Being a new father was definitely not a great thing, especially when he only found out right before the birth. He already knew the name and it made his heart Soar with pride. \"I got some clothes for her, if you'd be okay with this, I can dress her into more comfortable clothes than just a blanket.\" Mérante said stretching his arms outwards to hold his daughter. Odette was albeit reluctant to let anyone hold her new daughter, but no, it was his daughter too and he should hold her. Letting Mérante hold her and seeing him go to a different area to change her. She didn't relax though. Instead of lying down, she kept her eye in Felicity and Mérante to make sure they were okay. Félicie noticed and chuckled. \"Ooh someone is having a motherly moment?\" Odette rolled her eyes but smiled. Trying to be a good father, he tried putting the baby in some Pajamas, instead he got a big cry when he put her hand in the wrong hole. He tried shushing her so Odette won't have to worry, but she only grew louder. Odette heard this and was about to calm her daughter, despite her leg and giving birth not long ago, she wasn't gonna let her child cry without comfort. Félicie shook her head at and made her lie back down. Odette was about to object but Félicie went towards the new father and crying sister. She looked up at Mérante who gave in and let Félicie try. She nodded and smiled at the bundle. Odette and Mérante were observing quite hard on her but it didn't bother her. With that she fixed the Pajamas and put her arms in the right hole. \"Mérante... You do realize that you were dressing her with the Pajamas upside down?\" Félicie asked as she held her new sister. The new father chuckled nervously. \"One of the joys of being a new father am I right?\" Félicie smiled and nodded. \"Don't worry, I can help. During my days in the orphanage, they're were always new babies coming in, so we would have to take care of them until they were old enough to make their own decisions.\" She stated. Both of them nodded and let out a relief. They both didn't know how to take care of a newborn baby, considering it was their first time being parents. Odette outstretched her arms, wanting to have the newborn in her arms again. Félicie took the note and gave Felicity a kiss on the forehead before giving her to Odette. Felicity immediately felt her mothers warmth and snuggled closer to Odette's chest. She smiled at the view and gave a small peck on the small forehead too. A few moments later and Mérante spoke up, trying to be professional but kind of backfired because he was still to shock to become a father. He didn't think he'd ever would. \"So now that I have a new daughter and your her mother, its only fair to live with me and be a family, of course Félicie is welcome because she is your daughter too.\" Félicie looked at Odette and Odette looked at Félicie, trying to find the right answer. They knew they would have to say yes. They wouldn't have room for her if they lived here, and knowing that Odette is his lover... Its only right. Besides they're close to be family anyways. \" Good idea, we can do that tomorrow, for now let's rest... It's been a long day.\" Odette said. They nodded. \"Would you like for me to watch her while you sleep?\" Mérante asked. Odette shook her head. \"No it's okay, I like watching her. She can sleep with me.\" He nodded decided to leave to make room for them in his home, besides... He has to baby Proof the house. After leaving it was just the 3 of them. Félicie was keeping the fire up to make sure they had warmth, while Odette was nursing. It was definitely weird but she wouldn't have any other way. It was one of those moments where she was a mother nursing ber baby. Best feeling ever. With Félicie by her side it was more than best... It was perfect. A few minutes later, Odette was finished with nursing little Felicity when a knock on the door, she immediately shielded the tiny baby from harm. She wasn't gonna let anyone take her now that she had a miracle in her hands, It was like loosing Félicie, Her heart would break all over again. Félicie noticed this tension and knew she would probably have to get the door. Opening the door she expected Mérante to come by again to make sure everything was okay but it was- \"Victor?\" \"Uh hehe... Hi\" Victor said nervously. \"Thanks for leaving me in the dirt\" Félicie chuckled alittle. \"It was more on the line of... Leaving because family business?\" Victor said. \"Also I had no idea what to do by then.\" Félicie rolled her eyes and let her Victor inside her home abode. Victor walked in and saw Odette and a tiny baby sleeping against their mother's chest. He didn't know even what to say. It was so small and kinda looks like an Alien? \"Wow, it's so pretty\" Victor said trying to compliment the newfound baby. \"It's not an it... It's a girl and she has a name too, Felicity.\" Odette shot back. \"O-oh m-my bad.\" He stuttered quickly. \"It seems like you and Félicie had an accident with a firework... Bring her back with another injury, you'll be 6 inches shorter.\" She said plainly. Just like the good old days when Odette was first introduced to Victor, she said almost the same lines. \"Hehe... I guess old habits never die am I right Félicie?\" Trying to get Félicie on his side, but just said nothing and laughed about it. \"Sure Victor.\" \"So I'm presuming that the baby is your sibling?\" Victor asked. \"No, Odette just randomly found a baby and decided to adopt her.\" Félicie said trying to be sarcastic. \"Oh...\" \"Of course she's my sister, you basically saw the after birth, idiot.\" She rolled her eyes. \"I just wanted to make sure, anywho congratulations you and Mérante.\" Odette nodded \"Thank you.\" \"Well, I have to go, I got a new invention I want to try!\" Victor said, already out the door. \"Bye\" Despite being excited to have a baby sister, she was worried. What would happen to her? Will she be disowned? Neglected? It was over running Félicie mind and it made her anxious to say the least. Luckily Odette knows her Sunshine. \"Something wrong?\" Odette spoke softly, not wanting to wake up the baby. Félicie visibly straightened. \"No I'm fine.\" Odette knew that something was wrong and she wasn't gonna ignore until she knows what's wrong with her daughter. \"Félicie... You literally hunch Everytime your upset, you also can't hide your expressions very well.\" Odette stated. She sighed, of course her Adoptive mother knows her so well. \"Now what's really wrong?\" Her mother asked again. Well... Its now or never. \"Well... Now that you a biological child now, and babies are hard to take care of...M-maybe Its best if I leave... You can't train me while taking care of a baby..\" Félicie said hunching back again. Odette felt a twinch of guilt. She was paying more attention to Felicity than Félicie ever since she was born, but she can never forgive herself if she disowns or leaves Félicie alone, and become an orphan once again. \"Félicie... I'm really sorry that I have been ignoring you since Felicity was born, but I love you way to much to get rid of you. It would be even painful to let you go again. When Régine brought you back to Brittany, it was probably the most painful thing I've ever went through. Please don't think your a burden, your my sunshine and you made me whole again. Felicity is only making my heart even fuller.\" Odette said gently. \"I love you.\" Félicie's heart stopped at what Odette saidt...those three words. I love you? She has never said that until now. What is she supposed to say now? No one has ever said that to her before. It took a minute but she spoke softly \"I...I love you too.\" Odette smiled and leaned forward for Félicie to know she was going to do something, and kissed her forehead. \"Now don't think anymore of that, because I will still train you, and once Felicity is grown enough you can teach her your ways, if she wants to dance in life.\" Odette smiled. Félicie nodded and smiled. \"Yeah that would be fun.\" A few hours later, Mérante came back with a doctor, making sure the baby girl was fine. \"Hello, I'm Milei, I'm here to check the health of your baby. If you would please hand her over so I can examine her.\" The doctor said Stretching her arms outwards to take the baby. The funny thing is, it was the same office that confirmed her accident. Odette was not comfortable at all with some random doctor holding her child, she was okay with Mérante because he is the father. She was worried about the baby's health, but as far as she can see, Felicity looks fine. Félicie took a glance at Odette's anxious face and put a hand on her mother's shoulder, giving it a soft squeeze and a reassuring smile to ease her anxiousness away. Odette sighed and carefully put the small baby into the doctor arms. Taking the baby, the doctor have a full examination considering it was a unknown pregnancy, she wanted to make sure she is as healthy as any baby. Everytime the baby was away, Odette was so anxious and uncomfortable. She felt empty in her arms, it made her alittle emotional that her baby was away. Félicie knew it's hard for Odette to let anyone touch her miracle, but it's hard not to giggle when she never seen Odette this emotional or teary eyed. To give her mother reassuring thoughts she smiled and whispered \"It's going to be fine.\" Odette heard the softness and gentle voice from her Sunshine and relaxed a bit. A few minutes have gone by and the doctor came back with Felicity in her arms, smiling contently and giving her back into her mother's arms. Odette obliged and cuddled the small thing. \"Seems like everything is in check, though she is smaller than most babies, I would advise of giving her alittle more food, just so she can catch up with growing up. Her body seems to be okay, and her head is alittle bruised from sliding to fast out, but other than that, she is perfectly fine.\" The doctor said looking at Odette's paper records and trying to reassure the new parents who had alittle bit of guilt on their faces. Bruised? And smaller than other babies? Odette cleared her throat. \"Is there a reason why she's Smaller?\" Mérante nodded, his face concerned. \"You probably induced your pregnancy alittle earlier by working to hard. It's a miracle that she is okay, usually unknown pregnancies can turn into Stillborns, but because you probably were watching yourself, she's perfectly fine.\" The doctor said. \"...stillborn? Why would my mum have a still born?\" Félicie asked. The couple looked away from Félicie, unsure how to comprehend this situation. The doctor sighed \"I think this is family matters, please let me know if anything goes wrong.\" And with that the doctor left. \"You guys have been keeping secrets.\" Félicie said alittle hurt \"We're family, why couldn't you just tell me. We're supposed to help each other and not let anyone go through pain alone.\" \"Félicie, we were gonna tell yo-\" Odette was cut off. \"You wouldn't have told me anyways if you didn't have her, I know that.\" She shot back. Odette was taken back at the sharp turn her daughter gave. Mérante didn't know what to do except try to think if something. \"Tch, I knew you would keep secrets.\" Félicie said coldly. Odette felt more guilt come down on her shoulders. She should've have told her why she couldn't have kids. Maybe one of the reasons why she hated Kids and orphans especially. \"Thats enough Félicie, when your done, we'll explain to you what happened in the past..\" Mérante said quietly. Félicie nodded and pulled up a chair to sit on. \"Go on, I'm ready to listen.\" Both of them sighed. Story time. Odette started the story. \"Well, me and Mérante were a couple... Before the accident, we found out we were pregnant. We were beyond excited, and we were about to tell everyone.\" Odette looked at Mérante to finish Mérante sighed and continued. \"Probably a few months later, we still haven't told anyone. Your mother was still training but not to strain on the child she was carrying, but... An accident happened at the ballet... A fire. I was able to save Odette... But a few days later we went to the doctors, we were concerned about the baby's health... Turns out, Odette suffered a miscarriage. The fire she consumed made her unable to breathe correctly and because she was running to escape she fell and tripped, hurting her ankle.\" \"When the doctors confirmed that I suffered a miscarriage, I asked if I was able to still have children... They said no I wouldn't. Woman who suffers from Still births or Miscarry, they can turn out to be infertile. I was one of those women.\" Odette said quietly, tearing up. \"Wait, why did you guys separate after that? Why couldn't you adopt? And why did you hate children especially orphans before you met me? Félicie asked. She had so many questions but those were the ones that she was most intrigued. \"Thats alot of questions.\" Mérante said alittle overwhelmed by how many questions they were asked in one second.\" \"You should've been with me when we first met.\" Odette said smiling weakly. Félicie didn't answer, nor laugh. She was so interested on her mothers and Mérante past, she didn't even realize both of them were staring at her concernly. She snapped back and nodded \"Go on.\" The couple looked at each other and nodded trying to continue. \"Well, I didn't want to separate with Odette. She broke up with me and never told me why. I actually didn't know she was infertile until we had our date a couple of months ago. Of course I still loved her, and I never got over her.\" Mérante said passionately. \"So we never decided about adopting either. Usually men would want biological children to carry on the last name and blood line, but adopting would've been nice too. As for your mother hating children and especially orphans, I don't know why and I'm curious too.\" Mérante said In a intrigued and curious tone. \"Why did you hate children? Especially orphans?\" Peeking at the baby still in her arms. Damn shes been holding that kid for along time. No longer wanting to keep this up she spoke up. \"When I found out I had a miscarriage, and I couldn't have kids anymore... I got Jealous... Most orphans are kids who weren't planned. Their mother's had a gift but they didn't want them, but I was one of them that wanted the gift, and I did... But I lost them. I wanted to become part of the motherhood so badly, but all these mother's who given them up but had them so easily! I-I got mad that orphans were neglected and I couldn't love one of my children, so Instead, I became cold and told myself that I didn't want to connect with any children.\" Odette said, tears streaming down her face and landing on the baby's cheek, which was making Felicity fussy. \"So after that's why I told you at the beginning... Because I knew I'd probably get attached to you and I did, but it turned out the opposite on what was I thinking. I adopted you... And then I had her... My two miracles.\" Odette smiled with tears, still, but this time... It was tears of joy. She mourned so much and the world decided to give her a Miracle... Multiple ones. \"...did you name your unborn child?\" Félicie asked trying not to go over board. Odette and Mérante looked at each other. Their guilt trip wasn't over. \"No... We didn't...\" Mérante whispered. Odette couldn't bring herself to name the gift that was taken away from her and have her so much grief. She loved that unborn child, but the world decided to be cruel. When she did miscarry, she didn't even want to think, nor remember, but now... She felt guilty. Félicie went silent but then an idea came to her and sat up quickly, making Odette jump alittle. Félicie blushed embarrassingly but kept her composure. \"Well, how about now we name them. We may not know what they were, but it's kinda like.. a commemoration for them.\" Odette and Mérante looked at each other, but found that they were smiling and agreed to Félicie brilliant idea. The family had a small conversation and they all nodded on the name. Odette shedding a tear on how she was so lucky she met Félicie. If it weren't for her, she wouldn't have Felicity or get together with her lover. Unfortunately she still didn't have the other Miracle, she knows that they're in a better place and that soon they'll meet each other. \"My Esmae...\" Odette whispered the name over and over. The unborn baby was gone... But they are respected... And loved. Mérante and Félicie put a hand on each of Odette's shoulders, both giving a little squeeze. The night was pretty hectic. Mérante had to leave again to make sure everything was in place for the new baby, Odette and Félicie. They didn't even have a crib for the new born, so she had to sleep with Odette, not that Odette complained. Ever since she given birth, she's been very over protective of her. Félicie was a bit surprised from the sudden nature, she was more... Quiet and Chill, she usually let Félicie do the mistake and learn from them. Sleep wasn't in the list either. Everytime they both fell asleep, Felicity would wake up and cry, whether she needed food, diaper change or just Cranky. Odette was used to waking up pretty early, but she was never used to waking up every 10 minutes, Félicie too, she didn't groan or anything, instead she kept quiet, though her face says it all. She was tired, wanting some sleep, while Odette worries and tries to stay up. \"This is what it's like having a baby?\" Odette said trying to at least make the night more funny. Félicie nodded tiredly, but smiled playfully. \"Yep, welcomed to motherhood. The one you wanted.\" Odette laughed. Definitely couldn't disagree on that one. They stayed silent, only to hear suckling noises from Felicity while Odette nursed. \"So, do you think you'll be able to have more children?\" Félicie asked suddenly. \"Goodness, your just full of questions aren't you?\" Odette chuckled, but stopping to think about that question. \"Honestly... I don't know. Maybe this is only chance to care for a baby, either way if this it... I'm happy and I have you. It's everything I could ever ask for.\" Félicie smiled. \"I'm glad, but I'm pretty sure you won't be working any time soon, you have baby now.\" Félicie was correct in that. It didn't really worry Odette though. She had Mérante in her life and she knows he won't leave his child alone as well as Odette. \"It'll be okay, for now let's get some rest. Felicity is finally falling asleep and tomorrow is a big day.\" Odette said turning her to face Félicie, who fell asleep in he chair making her chuckle quietly. \"Goodnight my sunshines .\" Odette whispered. Hugging the small infant she fell asleep.[Chapter 2] Hey guys! Today is my birthday ! So here a birthday present to you guys! Its another freakin 5k word chapter! WHOO. I have already made the 3rd chapter and 4th! All i need to do is proof read and it'll be all good! by chapter 10 or 15, it will probably end but don't you worry! I havs other things I will be planning! LALALALALA LETS GET STARTED. THANKS FOR READING! .0.0.0.0.0.0.0. It was a very warm spring evening in the middle of April. A few months has past with moving in with Mérante and getting used to Felicity being around. Fortunately, Felicity has been doing well with sleeping through the night and Félicie is still able to do training by Odette, who has Felicity close to her chest with a baby sling, but because of her limp and a baby has shifted right on her chest, she has to sit down most of the times, not that she minded. Odette has been having separation anxiety everytime Felicity was somewhere else, whether she was with Félicie or Mérante, it made her feel uncomfortable that she doesn't see Felicity, but it has gotten better. Mérante has even gotten better with being a good father. Changing diapers, clothes and even putting her to bed, in Odette's and Félicie's room. He insisted that All of them could have their own rooms, because he has spare rooms, but Odette didn't want that, she was still to protective of her and Félicie too. It made sense, considering that it was a new area for the 3 of them, he was a patient person... Sometimes. Most of the time he spends his day at work, teaching Ballet while Félicie is with him and Odette is caring for Félicie and resting as well. Félicie walked home, worn out by the intensity dancing had become, but it was everything she could ever dream of. She still can't believe that she was an orphan who had nothing but clothes on herself, a ripped off, blurry picture, a old rusty music box and a best friend who loves chickens and Pigeons. It was definitely something she would never forget, thats how she met her mentor that turned into an Adoptive mother figure and doing the Nutcracker with a Rosita? It was the most perfect life anyone could ask for. Felicity was great to be around to, having a sister is hard, she's fussy, but she loves her from the bottom of her heart. Her thoughts ended as a mailman went towards the red haired girl and handed her a letter. \"A mail for you mademoiselle, from Camille Le Haut.\" Gasping, she smiled. She hasn't heard from Camille in months, she was lucky that the mailman caught her. \"Oh! Thank you.\" Félicie said, taking the letter. The mailman tipped his hat and went on his merry way. Although Camille was her enemy and her maniac mother tried to sabotage her, they turned out to have slot of things in common. Sadly, Camille decided to leave to find a new passion, while Ballet was part of Camille's life, it was out of force. So Camille wanted to find her true passion; her true passion was art, so she set off with her Aunt Genevieve and left the city life behind. While Félicie misses her dearly, they decided to write back at each other to update how their lives are doing. Camille even knows that Odette had a child of her own and she was beyond excited; to excited, that she sent little matched set of clothes. The mother was albeit reluctant, but soon realized that Camille was just a misunderstood child, who had a overbearing parent, and soon obliged happily. Camille was still not ready to see her mother, considering that she tried to kill Félicie and pushed her daughter over the limit to do ballet and be a snotty person, she doesn't think she'll ever get over it, but she still loves her very much, and soon enough, she'll see her again when she's older and hopefully Régine would be proud of Camille's new passion. Deciding to read the letter later, she finally got to the door. She opened the door and called out for her mother to hear. \"I'm home!\" \"Odette came out of the kitchen door and smiled at her Sunshine. \"Hi, how was your day?\" She asked. \"Good, little but tired, but I did get a letter from Camille, How's Felicity doing?\" \"Felicity is doing good, she's taking a nap right now and I'm making dinner. I'm glad you got a letter from Camille, I hope she is doing well.\" \"Yeah Camille is doing great, I sure do miss her, but I know she's in a better place.\" Félicie sighed. Odette nodded and wobbled over Félicie with her cane and kissed her forehead. \"Don't worry, I'm sure she's doing great, maybe she'll visit sometime.\" Félicie lit up at that idea. Maybe she would. \"Yeah maybe she could, and we could catch up and meet Felicity.\" Félicie smiled. Odette nodded and smiled. \"Okay, enough talking, clean yourself up and get ready for dinner.\" Félicie nodded and was about walk off, when she remembered something Mérante asked her to tell Odette. \"Oh, Mérante will be late, apparently he has a big meeting with the Rosita and the other ballerinas.\" Félicie said, now walking off to her room. \"Okay, if Felicity is up, can you bring her over?\" Odette called over. \"Yep, I got it.\" Félicie called back. Quietly opening the door, she saw Felicity who was waiting for someone to go through the door. Finally noticing, Felicity got excited and started cooing at her big sister. Félicie chuckled and picked up the baby. \"How are you?\" She asked Felicity, but all she got was a gurgle. \"I'll take that as a good day.\" Félicie smiled. Finishing up cleaning herself and Felicity, she led her way to the diner room. Odette making her way to the small group, she happily took Felicity Into her arms, giving her a kiss on the cheek. \"Dinner is ready, I just need to nurse Felicity, and I'll be joining you in a moment.\" Odette said. \"When can Felicity eat solid foods?\" Félicie asked. \"Well, she's able to suck on peanut butter, but she's not really old enough to eat solid foods yet, not until she's 1. That's what the doctor said. Besides the milk is nutritional for her.\" Odette explained. Félicie nodded and stood up to get the food from the kitchen. Being the loving daughter she got her mother's plate too. Walking towards the diners room, she saw Odette nursing. In all honestly, she wasn't that bothered that her mother nursed in front of her, at least she wears her shawl. Shaking the thoughts that ended up in her head, she laid the full plate in front of Odette. Odette smiled at her Sunshine. \"Thank you. You've been a great help.\" Félicie nodded and smiled back. Ever since Felicity was born and Odette was mostly busy with her, Félicie has been doing a tremendous job helping both of them, though she's been more tired than usual. Taking care of Felicity, making sure Odette is okay and doing intense ballet training was definitely tiring, but it won't last long. After dinner, they decided to just hang out near the fire place, listening to cackles of the fire. Odette being extra careful to make sure Felicity was out of harm's way, while Félicie warms herself. \"Oh I forgot!\" Félicie suddenly standing up and running to their room. It made Felicity and Odette jump at the sudden out burst but soon got comfortable. After they got comfortable, Félicie cane back with the letter Camille wrote to her. It was still unopened. \"I still didn't open Camille's letter, I guess I forgot.\" Félicie chuckled. \"Well, what are you waiting for?\" Odette said, making a playful smile. Félicie stuck out her tongue and went to opening the letter. She cleared out her throat to read to Odette and Felicity, because she was sure that both if them wanted to hear how Camille is doing with life, maybe not Felicity, but probably Odette. \"Dear Félicie, It's been awhile, sorry about that, I guess I've been busy. My Aunt Genevieve decided to sign me up for caring a horse, and surprisingly I really enjoyed doing it. The horse I'm caring for is really friendly and sweet, she's really big, but she loves being rode on, and I decided to try riding her. Her name is Pipi by the way. Unfortunately I'm not very good hanging on, but I'm getting lessons from a person who've been riding for years. I hope all is doing well with you, Odette, Felicity and Mérante. Tell them I said hello!\" With love, Camille Le Haut Félicie was about to speak when she saw more words and proceeding reading, but this time but speaking out loud, which made Odette alittle confused but decided to wait until she was done. P.S, That reminds me! I met a friend, named Mela. She's adopted and she's visiting Paris, I think you guys would get along great. She's really shy but one you get to know her, she's the most funniest person. She'll be visiting around in the middle of April and she's going to the Paris Opera Ballet, because her father is helping with the Choreography. Funny thing is... She fights! Isn't that awesome? Its weird, but I think its cool. \"So what else did she say?\" Odette asked, rocking Felicity to sleep. \"Camille has a friend she wants me to meet. She's adopted and her name is Mela. Apparently her father is helping choreographing at the Paris Opera Ballet. So she's visiting Paris for awhile. She thinks we'll get along pretty well... She also fights. \" Félicie answered. They stayed silent for a moment until Félicie spoke up. \"I think I would to meet her. I think I would get along, maybe even Victor too. We both know what its like to be orphans. I can show her my hobby and she can show me her hobby. It'll be fun!\" Odette hesitated. The girl can fight? Now that's something she doesn't want her daughter to learn from, then again, Mela was an orphan. She probably had to defend herself sometimes. Maybe it's a good thing. Odette sighed, but nodded. \"Okay, but please be careful if you meet her. Victor can come too, and I would also like to meet her as well. Tell me when she visits the Opera, alright? Félicie got excited and nodded happily. \"I will! I wonder if she's already visiting. Maybe that's why Mérante is really Busy.\" \"Maybe.\" Odette wondered. A few hours later and it was almost 10pm and Mérante still haven't came home yet, and it worried Odette, while Felicity was playing with Félicie's fingers, amazed at the size and started sucking it. \"Uh mom, I think she's hungry. She's sucking my fingers.\" Félicie said. Odette giggled and outstretched her arms to feed her child. Félicie gave her Felicity and wiped the wet fingers in her dress, hoping to dry it faster. Moments later, Mérante opened and closed the door quickly and went room where the fire place was. \"I'm home.\" He said as he kissed Odette's head and decided to sit right next to her. Félicie felt alittle uncomfortable and odd, Everytime they kissed each other. She didn't expect for them to tie the know that soon and unexpectedly have a child and move in. She was still processing sudden change, but it was better than ever. Soon enough she will get used to it. She still didn't call Mérante dad... At least not yet. \"Hey, how was work.\" Odette asked softly. \"Tiring, but it was good. I met Man who is helping with the Choreography. He has a daughter, we were discussing the next dance.\" Mérante responded, rubbing his head. \"Oh yeah, Camille said that her friend's dad was helping. She said I should meet her. She was adopted and she think I would get along with her.\" Félicie spoke. \"Did she? Hmm well, I suppose we can meet up. I actually haven't met his daughter, but he talks fondly of her. I can ask him if his daughter wants to meet you, me and Odette.\" Félicie and Odette nodded. \"Yeah that would be awesome.\" Félicie commented. Odette finally finished nursing and put Felicity over her shoulder and patted her back. After hearing a small burp, she handed the baby to Mérante who accepted her and started tickling her stomach. She let out some giggles and gurgles of happiness. That night was just... Family life and they couldn't be more blessed to have it. Lifting Felicity so the father could have a face to face with his daughter. He smiled and made some goody faces making Felicity giggle, until she decided to spit up. Mérante sighed while Félicie and Odette started laughing their heads off together. Shaking his head at the two, but then he played a perky smile. They have already said goodnight to Mérante who was terribly exhausted from working and were ready for bed. Odette was rocking the baby to sleep, rubbing Felicity's cheek. Feeling the mother's loving and affectionate touch, she dozed off completely, leaving only quiet snores. She smiled at the view, just staring for a few minutes to make sure she was staying asleep. She then put Felicity into the crib, and putting blankets over the litter one for warmth. To be fair, she has grown quite a bit, she might be catching up to what she was supposed when she was born. Turning around to Félicie to say goodnight, but she was already dead asleep. Odette sighed softly, but wobbled over to her other daughter without the cane and gave her a gentle kiss on the forehead, making Félicie stir, but then unconsciously smiled at the feel. Odette couldn't help but giggle. Her daughters were so special and unique to her and it was all thanks to Félicie. She now realizes that she was meant to be a mother, whether it was adopting or having a miracle, but no one should ever go through a miscarriage. She grieved properly For little Esmae, and soon let go, though she thinks highly of them sometimes and wondered what it was going to be like with them. At least they were happy thoughts. Sighing, Odette walked over quietly to her bed, unfortunately, it took awhile. With her limp and not wanting to wake up her daughters was a hard thing, but managed. She breathed in relief and fell asleep. Félicie woke up in cold sweat, her heart pounding in her chest. 'Another night terror' she whispered to herself. She couldn't sleep anymore. The night mare was to scary for her to fall asleep. She carefully took off the blanket that was once on her, and put her feet on the cold wooden floor. Standing up, she shivered at the chills and walked slowly, making some pretty loud creaks. Odette stirred for a moment, but relaxed after that. Félicie sighed softly in relief as she was at the door, until Felicity caught her big sister and started cooing loudly at her. Félicie panicked and picked her up, shushing to her, hoping that she would fall asleep. Instead she giggled happily and played with Félicie's hair. Finally making a decision to let Felicity join her for her star gazing, so Odette won't wake up and worry for her. \"Fine... You can come with me, but no more noises.\" Félicie whispered harshly. Felicity cooed softly like she understood what she was saying. \"Good...\" Félicie slowly opened the door and let herself and sister outside the bedroom, letting their mother sleep in peace. Sighing in ease, she smiled at Felicity and spoke quietly to her. \"You want to see my secret place whenever I'm awake?\" Felicity babbled. \"I'll take it as a yes, come on, let's go.\" Félicie held Felicity in one arm and went up the stairs, using her other arm to lead her and support her weight on the stairs, making sure she wont fall and hurting either of them. Finally at the top of the stairs, she took a glance at Mérante room, who had his door closed. It was good, at least she doesn't have to worry about him much. Félicie sneaked pass his room and went at the end of the hall room. She lifted her arm to reach for a string that was dangling and pulled down hard. Using 1 hand to pull down a old wooden board down was definitely hard, but she got to it and lowered it quietly. \"Welcome to my secret.\" Félicie whispered and smiled. She climbed up the dusty stairs. It was making more creaking noises, so she had to slowly for surely got to the attic. It looked like no has been up in here for years. Felicity sneezed because all the dust around them and Félicie couldn't help but laugh at the baby's sneeze. She then looked around and spotted the window. It wasn't over yet. She walked towards the crooked window and positioned Felicity into the other arm, considering her arm was getting tired from holding her to long. How does Odette hold her that long? She opened the door weakly and it finally led open. She was worried that the baby was a hassle, but it was no turning back now. She looked around a room and found a medium sized blanket. \"Maybe I could wrap her around me so I can use both my hands.\" She said to Felicity who just looked around, like she didn't even hear her. Félicie sighed and grabbed the blanket. Perfect size! She wrapped the child with it and tied behind her. \"Finally, I'm able to use both my hands.\" Félicie said looking at her hands. \"Let's go on the roof. We'll have a good looking at yeh stars.\" Félicie walked back at the opened door, and poked her head out. The road was quiet and she couldn't hear a peep. It was like the world turned off... It felt nice. Lifting herself up, she got onto the roof and looked for a spot to sit down and look at the calming sky. She found a spot and sighed in Content that she'll be able to relax now after the big exercise. Félicie untied the blanket around her chest, still holding Felicity to make sure she won't fall and wrapped themselves into the blanket so they won't be cold. Felicity was fascinated by the stars. Her eyes shine under Neath the night sky, Félicie's eyes did that same as well, they reflected beautifully. \"Look Felicity, see those stars taste are clustered together? That's called the milky way. And see that bright star? That star is called the Deneb. It's the brightest star in the constellation of Cygnus.\" Félicie pointed out. \" Those are my favorite ones.\" She glanced at Felicity who was enchanted by every star she could look at. Félicie chuckled quietly and proceeded telling her the stars that she knows. Odette awoken from a door opening slowly and closing again, making the loudest creaking noises ever. She quickly turned over to Felicity who was gone, and then turned to Félicie's bed. Both of them were gone. Odette was panicking. Where were they? Did they get kidnapped? If they were, she would probably hear the screams. She trembled at the thought if loosing them. They were only kids that made her heart full. She can't loose them. She took a Shakey sigh and decided to look for them. Maybe they're in the diner room, or maybe getting a midnight snack. Getting up and grabbing her cane, she walked as quickly as her limp can make her. She looked around the diners room and kitchen, but no one was there. She found herself near the fire place and was hoping to expect Félicie and Felicity just sitting there. Again, no one was here. She listened for any noises that maybe the kids would make. It was dead silent and she heard nothing. 'Maybe they are upstairs?' Odette thought. She looked up the stairs and sighed. It was a medium sized stairs but for some reason it reminded of Régine's old house that had a large set of them. She was afraid of falling, but eventually got the courage and lifted her foot on the first step, making her wince at the pain. In all honesty, she hasn't been upstairs yet. Since Felicity was born, she hasn't really had the time to spend time with Mérante, but now not the time to think of a new date. She has to find her missing children. A few minutes later she finally made it up the stairs. Trying to walk quietly but her Cane was making thumping noises, so she had to be even more stealthy. Passing Mérante's room, she caught more stairs that led to the attic. She groaned quietly. More stairs? She might as well clean them. Walking at the end of the hall, she used her can to lift herself up in There. She coughed at the dust and looked around. Old boxes were lying around and it seemed like the furniture were covered in sheets. There was only one that wasn't Covered in a sheet, nor any dust was seen. Odette grunted as she used the last steps. She saw a small rickety window opened. It was large enough for Félicie fit through. To be honest, so can Odette. She didn't gain any baby weight, and she was still skinny. The only thing that changed was her chest, and that was for the baby to get milk. Walking towards the opened window quietly, she was about to call out to Félicie and tell her to come down immediately, and probably give her a Stern talking-to, but she stopped at her tracks, hearing Félicie's solemn talk. Odette decided to keep quiet. She wanted to know why Félicie was pretty solemn. For a child who is always happy and cheerful, this intrigued Odette. \"You know, I always wondered, what would happen if I did leave when you were born... Its always been a nightmare to me. I always dreamt about being disowned... Thats one of the reasons why I stay up here... To clear my thoughts.\" Félicie stayed silent for a moment, but started again. \"I feel like Mela will understand what it's like being an orphan, and not having a family, but I barely know her. I just hope. I don't think Mum really approves of Mela, but I'm willing to try... Besides she was an orphan just like me, All orphans have a story of a past, and I'm excited to know theirs and I can't wait to tell them mine.\" She smiled at Felicity but went back to sober face. \"I know your a Miracle, but... What am I?\" She said quietly, but barley enough for her adoptive mother to hear. Odette could feel her heart melt. Of course Félicie would probably have nightmares. Even so, she hasn't really been paying attention to her adoptive daughter, she's been so focused on Felicity. That's probably why she thinks that. That she's a burden, and that she'll be disowned? She's rethinking about her life choices. She thinks that she should've left. Odette placed a hand on her forehead, and sighed. Has she really been a bad mother? She didn't think twice that Félicie was upset. She was always a cheerful and happy child. Maybe she's been hiding behind a mask that she didn't know. Facing defeat, she decided to let Félicie stay and give the space, instead of scaring her and Felicity. If Félicie isn't willing to talk to her, maybe she'll talk to Mela about her problems. They were 2 orphans, they will understand each other. Odette felt Useless about her daughter's problem, yeah sure, she's been alone, lost a baby, parents and a lover, but she got them back. She couldn't get her parents, but at least she got Mérante and a miracle baby. She frowned. If she wouldn't have met Félicie, all of this wouldn't have happened. Félicie made a big impact on her life and yet... She's being rejected. Her thoughts ended as she heard Félicie's voice. \"Let's go back inside, it's almost morning and we need sleep.\" Odette gasped, and literally almost flung herself to stand up and leave. She quickly went down the stairs, not caring that her ankle was aching. She didn't want to explain to her daughter that she was eves dropping and that she heard everything she had said. She got to the stairs and heard footsteps on the mini stairs. 'Shes so quick!' Odette said to herself. Down to stairs, she limped as fast as she could into their bedroom. Dropping herself on the bed and pretending to sleep, and awaited for Félicie and Felicity to come back in their room. She felt a small breeze of Félicie passing her. She half opened her eyelids to see what she was doing. Félicie rocked Felicity to sleep and put her into the crib. She yawned and walked swiftly to her bed and sad down gently. Lying down, she gave a soft sigh and fell asleep. Relieved that she was able trick Félicie that she was asleep. Upset that she's been a terrible mother. Félicie was just a fragile butterfly. She's tough, and she doesn't talk about her problems. Odette realized that about Félicie... She never talks about her troubles. She talked about her past, but she talks with a smile. Odette sighed tiredly. She'll think later on, for now she needs rest. Félicie woke up pretty late. She turned her head and her mum and sister were already gone. Must have gotten up awhile ago. Félicie stretched her arms and legs, making some cracks in the doing. Yawning, she sat down on the bed again and grabbed her shoes. Putting them and tying the laces, she got up and headed towards the closed door. She walked into the kitchen, it seems like Mérante had left for work already. Finding her mum and Felicity in the baby wrap around Odette's chest. \"Morning.\" Félicie said to her mother. Odette stopped her cooking and turned around to face her red headed daughter. \"Good morning, you slept pretty late, any reason why?\" She asked suspiciously. \"I slept fine.\" Félicie answered quickly, almost panicking. Odette raised her eyebrow, but proceeded to have a conversation with her Sunshine. \"Did you sleep well?\" Félicie asked back. Odette nodded and gave Félicie a kiss on the forehead. \"I have breakfast ready and after that we need to catch up on training.\" Félicie sighed tiredly, but retained her posture and nodded. Odette looked at her worringly. Maybe they should take it easy for today. Félicie did look more tired and even though she says she is fine, Odette now knows what's wrong with her. She just has to talk to her about it and solve the problem. The question is... How is she supposed to say that she was eves dropping. Sighing, Odette put a hand on Félicie's shoulder and spoke softly. \"How about this... When we're done with breakfast, let's go to the Opera early and see if this girl is there, sounds good?\" Félicie's face lit up and nodded excitingly. Odette smiled at the girl's excited face, but became serious. \"Alright enough talking, let's eat and finish up these chores so we can finally get to the Opera.\" Félicie moved without hesitating and began eating breakfast, quite enthusiastically, she didn't look tired, she looked more ... Livley. She must be very excited. Finishing up her chores, Félicie sighed happily as she put away the last of the dishes. After drying her hands with a rag, she went out to the living room, seeing her mother nursing Felicity. Instead of her mother looking at Felicity like she would always would, but this time she looked at the window. Giggling quietly, sneaking behind Odette, \"Boo!\" She jumped out. Odette jumped, and looked behind her back and saw her other daughter, making a scary face. She then couldn't hold her face and started laughing. \"Haha very funny.\" Odette, a playful smile on her face as Félicie nodded and sat beside her. \"I'm done with the chores, do you want to go after this it wait?\" Félicie asked. Odette sighed, but nodded. There was an uncomfortable silence as Félicie looked at her concernly. \"Is something wrong?\" \"Wha- oh no, nothing is wrong, I'm just thinking.\" Odette said rapidly, even stuttering. Félicie raised her brow in suspicious. \"Mom, something is wrong, whatever it is, I'm sure we can fix it.\" Odette smiled at her daughter's encouragement, but altered her smile into a frown. \"I'm just worried. This girl, Mela sounds... Nice? But fighting? I've never heard of a woman, let alone a child fighting. It just sounds... Suspicious. Odette sighed. Félicie stayed silent, trying to defend this situation. \"Well, you never know why she had to fight. She was an orphan... Maybe her orphanage wasn't good and that's why she had to learn to fight.\" Odette was about to talk back until Félicie cut her again. \"Also, that might be her passion. We all have our passions. This girl, Mela sounds sweet. She's very shy, maybe she won't even mention that she fights, maybe even she doesn't!\" Odette stayed quiet. Félicie is probably right. She can't judge her until she meets her and her personality. Odette thought again for a moment, but stood up, grabbing her cane and hobbled over to the door. \"You coming? Can't be late, now can we?\" Odette smiled widely. Félicie gasped and smiled, running over her mother's side and hugging. \"Thanks Mom, I love you.\" Odette's heart soared Everytime she heard that. \"I love you too.\" She said looking at Félicie with affection in her eyes. She then looked at Felicity who was gurgling cheerfully. \"And I love you too, baby.\" She said hugging Felicity and Félicie. Family hug. \"Now let's get this show on the road!\" Félicie stepped back and opened the door for the mother and the lovely sister. Odette laughed and nodded firmly. While she did limp, she did it with a smile. She never expected to have a dream come true. With Mérante, Félicie and Felicity by her side, nothing could go wrong... Nothing. .0.0.0.0.0. AHHH my fingers hurt from typing all of this! Again, thanks for reading one hell of the fic. Please comment done below and tell me what you think about this! We'll be meeting a new Character in the next chapter and I'll give you a hint on her personality: Apathetic :3 Mwah! You guys rock![Chapter 3] Back with another chapter. Whoo. I would also like to point out that Aunt Genevieve belongs to Tangled4Ever Props to her, shes pretty cool. She also has amazing fics and I love them to pieces! So check her out! The walk was pretty short, Mérante didn't live to far from the Opera honestly. While walking though, the scenery was very beautiful, besides where Régine lived. Felicity was curious about everything single detail. Unfortunately she was restrained to Odette's chest, so she couldn't really touch anything but whine. Félicie chuckled at her sisters tantrum. \"Once you'll be able walk, you can touch all get things you want.\" Odette sighed. \"As long as it's not dangerous.\" She finished. Félicie tried not to stifle a laugh at her mother's sudden protectiveness. \"Mom, I think you thinking way to hard about Felicity hurting herself. She understands our words. I'm pretty sure she's able to learn what's bad and what's not.\" She said. \"I know, but she's still not able to walk yet, or better then crawl. She's only 4 months. I just want to make sure she's safe.\" Odette insisted. Félicie nodded and from then on, the walk was silent, but both had the same thoughts. Who was this girl? What's her personality? Is she really a fighter? What's her hobbies? So many questions were swarming around their heads and none of them knew they were wondering asking the same thing. Odette spoke up after not being able to take the silent. \"So your ready to meet Mela?\" Everytime she said that name, it sounded weird. Who would name a child 'Mela'? It definitely wasn't a French name that's for sure. \"I'm really excited to meet another person just like me and Victor who were Orphans. Ever since I came here I haven't met anyone who were orphans besides Victor...\" Félicie said quietly. Odette had a twinch of guilt. She didn't realize that she was pretty different from all the rest, not to mention she was a poor orphan and became a Ballerina. It's unlikely that she made it into the academy, but Odette managed to help that and it became more than a student and a mentor, it was a daughter- mother relationship. \"I'm sure you'll have fun.\" Odette assured trying to strain a smile, even though she was nervous to meet this girl. Félicie shyly smiled and nodded happily as she gained her confidence of meeting Mela. The name for her was also odd, she hadn't heard any names like that in her orphanage but everyone has there unique names. After awhile, they arrived at the Opera and sighed in relief. Walking in they were met with the guard who gave a glare at them and grunted. Odette glared back at him quite hard, placing a hand on Felicity's back and walking off with Félicie. They stopped for a moment to think where they will be, until Félicie gave in and asked her mother. \"Where do you think they will be?\" Félicie asked curiously. Odette sighed but thought hard. Who knows? If the girl's father is a Choreographer, \"Maybe they are at the stadium?\" She answered questioning her own answer. Félicie nodded and proceeded walking to the stadium with Odette. The walk seemed climatic, as they Anticipated to meet Mela. They heard music in the stadium and manly murmuring too. They knew all to well that Mérante was in there, probably with Mela's father. They both sighed and prepared to meet them. All the insides of Félicie's and Odette's were churning and twisting. They were beyond nervous but it was now or never. Félicie opened the door and we're immediately met with Mérante who turned around surprised to see her and Odette. He turned around to a good looking middle-aged man who looked different from the rest. He wore a blue, silky, long sleeved shirt and his pants were black and looked soft. The man nodded and Mérante walked towards her Odette and Félicie. \" I see you wasted no time, meeting Mela.\" Mérante whispered quietly. \"Is she here?\" Félicie asked hopefully. \"Yes, she is, I met her and she's quite...\" Mérante stopped to say the right word which made Odette a bit uneasy \" Apathetic? She's rarely shows any emotion.\" \"Is that a good thing?\" Odette asked alittle worried. Mérante stayed silent to think of a way to explain his lover what Mela's personality is. \"Well, she's more on the side of emotional distant. She's very silent and actually very stealthy. She accidentally scared me when we met. Though she didn't look... Surprised nor scared by my reaction. I tried making conversation but she just stayed silent until her father came and made a conversation with me. She then walked off without making a noise. Her father even agrees with her personality and just said that was her. He says she's real sweet once you get to know her. Another thing is... She has two different eye colors.\" Odette and Félicie stayed quiet and tried to process what Mérante just said. Two different eye colors? Silent and stealthy? Emotional distant? This is up to trouble. Odette was at not as ease anymore. She didn't think she would like this girl. But Félicie became excited, she never met a person who had different eye colors. She couldn't wait to meet her. So what if she's emotional distant. Mérante turned towards the man, placing a hand on Odette's shoulder and Félicie's too, smiling. \"This is my lover, Odette and her daughter, Félicie. They wanted to come to meet you and your daughter. Girls, this is one of the best Chinese Choreographer I was talking about, he's also an old friend of mine. His name is Yin Zheng. Yin Zheng smiled slightly and bowed his head. Félicie and Odette looked at each other confused. They looked at Mérante who took on their confusion, \"In his culture, everyone bows or nod their head to greet others.\" He explained. Ooh... Now they understood. The group bowed their heads to respect his greeting. The man nodded back at them again and spoke in broken English, which was hard but they understood enough. \"I hear you would like to meet my Mela. She has 2 colors of eyes, and she fights, do you little girl?\" \"No sir, I do ballet in the Opera, is your daughter in ballet as well?\" Félicie asked. Odette was curious too. Was she a dancer too? Yin Zheng shook his head and smiled at the group. \" My Mela do not do Ballet, she is exceptionally proficient at throwing Stilettos. She self taught herself during her years in the orphanage.\" All of them were intrigued. Mérante hadn't heard that Mela throws Stilettos as a skill. Odette couldn't take it and decided to ask. \"Did she have that skill before you adopted her? Is there a reason why she does that...?\" He nodded but he didn't seem very happy about the other question. \"It is not for me to explain why she learned, if you like to know why, maybe ask Mela. I will just say that she had a hard time in orphanage.\" They nodded and stayed silent until Mérante spoke up to save them from the awkwardness. \"Well then, how about you and Odette find Mela while me and Yin explain some stuff, alright?\" Odette and Félicie nodded and decided to search in the classrooms, leaving both of them to discuss the matters. Félicie walked ahead of Odette excitingly, looking in each classroom. Odette who was walking behind her, a bit tired from walking especially when a baby is strapped onto her chest. \"Félicie can we stop for a moment?\" She said wearily. Félicie stopped at her tracks. She was albeit reluctant but gave in and nodded. They were on top floor and so far, no Mela had made an appearance. There wasn't any seating so Odette Sat on the floor, letting Felicity have some room from being glued to Odette's side. She cooed at her mother and started playing with Odette's fingers who Chuckled at her daughter's curiosity. She took a glance at Félicie who was looking out on a window. \"Seeing if she's outside or something?\" Félicie shook her head and sighed. \"No, I'm just looking around. It's pretty high up here and I didn't realize how high it was until now. I used to go on the roof, although I didn't look down. \"Wait, that reminds me, remember when you left with Rudy? You never came back to the Servants cottage, where did you stay?\" Odette asked, interested in what Happened to her that night. \"O-oh well, I slept... In the Opera... Yeah!\" Félicie insisted, talking fast to get this over with. Odette raised her brow and giving her the 'yeah right, tell me the truth' glare. Félicie surrendered; knowing she won't get away with this question. \"I... I slept on the... Roof.\" She said quietly hoping that she didn't hear but apparently she did, because she got a big gasp from her mother. \"Félicie! How did you sleep on the roof?! It was so cold out there and there were so many dancers who met death while doing so.\" Odette sternly talked back at Félicie who just had her head down. \"I know... But there was no place there and after I talked back to you, I couldn't go back and face you again, after I argued and I though you would be mad and you wouldn't let me stay so, I didn't come back.\" Félicie said ashamed. Odette looked down for a moment to think of a response. \"Félicie, why on Earth why would I be mad?\" \"Well, that was before you adopted me. I didn't expect to you know... Care about me. So when If I actually made it to be a ballerina you wouldn't be part of my life anymore.\" Odette looked down and sighed. \"You know... I know you were on the roof before last night with Felicity, you left the door open so I heard you. I would understand why you would feel like that... Do you want to know a secret?\" It would be the perfect time to explain now. Félicie looked up surprised on how her mother found out about her little secret, but she nodded, Wondering what Odette was going to say. \"Well, honestly... Since you came and I've gotten used to you... I always thought you were my daughter. Always determined to be a ballerina. I know I may not be your biological mother, but I always thought that you were my flesh and blood. Your my child and I love you. My sunshine...\" Odette said quietly, barley enough for Félicie to hear but boy, she heard it and she just stood there sheepishly. Walking as quiet as she could, while Odette had her down only eyeing Felicity. She didn't know what Félicie would think now. Would she leave, would she leav-, Odette's thought was cut off as a familiar, small arms were wrapped around her. She looked up to see Félicie hugging her. \"I love you mom.\" She simply stated. Odette didn't hesitate to take a moment and hugged her immediatley, tears brimming in her eyes. \"I know I haven't been all lovey dovey, but just know that I love you too.\" Félicie just simply nodded and nuzzled into Odette's chest. Felicity looked up at her sister and mother nuzzling each other. She cooed annoyingly, wanting to get into all the action. They giggled and took in Felicity. Another group hug! They stood like this for quite a awhile. \"Oh wow, you guys have such a heartfelt relationship.\" A sudden voice came. All of them froze at the mysterious voice. \"W-whos there? Who are you? Where are you?\" Félicie spoke out, trying to be all tough, but basically failed when stuttering. The voice chuckled quietly. \"That's alot of questions, but here let me help you.\" Félicie and Odette looked around everywhere but no sight of the voice. There was a sudden window opening. They both turned around to see a girl with black hair that was pretty long to begin with, sitting on the window sill. Odette and Félicie tried to capture what she looked like, but her eyes were covered and was facing towards the outside. She wore a very dark red silky shirt, looking like Yin's shirt, and her pants looked like black leggings. Ones that Félicie uses to train, only darker. \"Are you gonna tell us?\" Odette said alittle harsh. \"Aren't you alittle impatient? Alright. First, let me ask you first, what are your names and I'll tell you mine.\" She said directly. \"We don't have to tell you anything. You are trespassing. You better leave or I'll call security.\" Odette shot back, holding Felicity close to her. \"Fine.\" The girl said. She stood up and decided to climb up on the roof again to have a peaceful time, instead of hanging around them. \"Wait! I'm Félicie and this is my mom and, my sister, Felicity. Please have you seen a girl name Mela? We're looking for her and if you tell us, we'll leave you alone.\" \"Félicie!\" Odette said, shocked by how straight forward she was. The girl stopped and turned around, her head down still, \"Well, you don't have to look no more, unless you really want to.\" She said sarcastically. Félicie and Odette looked at each other. \"What?\" They both said. The girl looked up and from no doubt they both knew who she was. Just by the two different eye colors. One blue and one brown. \"To answer all your questions... My name is Mela Zheng. My father is helping Louis Mérante on choreographing. I was on top of the roof. I heard you were adopted is that so?\" She asked, sitting back down on the ledge. Félicie nodded hesitantly. The girl nodded as well and faced Odette who stood up very quickly, without her cane, and still shielding Felicity. Félicie gasped and smiled. \"Really?! Hi I wanted to meet you so bad. Yes I'm adopted and I heard you were too. I thought maybe you would like to hang out with us?\" She said quickly. Mela thought for a moment but shrugged and nodded. \"Why not? It's been boring here anyways.\" Mela stood up and jumped down,making only the slightest thump of noise. Félicie was amazed as well as Odette who just stared at her hard. \"Woah! How did you jump so... Quietly?!\" Félicie asked beaming with questions. \"Practice, now come on. I need to tell my father that I'm hanging with you guys.\" She said plainly and walked towards the door. She still haven't noticed that her hair was in the way of one of her eyes. It didn't seem like she was bothered what so ever. Passing Odette, Mela took a glimpse of her and Odette noticed. She turned her face so she couldn't see her. Noticing this tension, Mela stopped Midway and faced her. Odette then faced her. Glaring at her intensely. The girl's face still showed no emotion, only a big sigh from her. She then walked to the door, exiting without them catching up. \"I don't like her.\" Odette growled. \"She has no emotion and no real manners.\" \"Mom, calm down. Let's see her side of the story alright? Come on just trust me.\" Félicie pleaded. Looking down on Félicie, she sighed and gave in. \"Fine, but if she does one thing that makes me feel in danger, were leaving. Got it?\" Félicie nodded enthusiastically as her mother threw the towel in so quick. She then ran after Mela, saying muffled sounds. Odette sighed and grabbed her cane, hoping to catch up with them. Not at all as she didnt trust Mela. Brood looking and gloomy was what Odette probably hates the most... Even though that's how Félicie and her met, but at least she complied later on. Unfortunately it was going to be hard to change Odette's mind. Félicie and Mela walked beside each other. It was an uncomfortable air of silence. She took a peek at Mela's face, which was emotionless. She looked back down and sighed quietly. It seems like it was going to be harder than she thought. Trying to make a pleasant talk with her instead of awkward she spoke first to start. \"So, I heard you like fighting?\" Feeling alittle dumb after asking, because she heard so much from pretty much everyone who knows her... Especially her father which exceptionally knows her the best. Mela nodded, not even looking at Félicie and kept on walking. \"Yes, I fight... Are doing ballet, at the Opera?\" She asked back. Félicie perked at the question and her smile widened a bit, \"Yes! My mentor- or rather my mom, helped me be in the ballet. I was actually sent back a few weeks later after I failed to audition. Mérante gave me a deal if I made it to be part of the Preformance I can stay, or if I didn't complete it, I would leave. Unfortunately, there was a woman named Régine who looked like a witch, but turns out her daughter has alot in common... I really like dancing. Do you like dancing?\" \"No, I don't. Though I suppose fighting... Is a form of dancing.\" She answered cheerless. \"Oh, maybe I could teach you! My mom can help you too! She doesn't really trust you, but I do! We have things in common too! We were orphans and I hope we can understand each other!\" Félicie upbeat from the answer Mela gave. \"Yeah, sure. What ever you say.\" She said back, unmotivated by the young girls nature. They arrived at the stadium and Mela walked towards her father, her back visibly straightened to be more modest. She then stood right next to him. He smiled and patted her head. \"Mela, my flower, how are you? I see you met Félicie, are you two hanging out?\" Mela nodded, \" Yeah, we met after I heard her on the roof.\" Walking slowly, Félicie decided to stand behind Mérante who raised his brow and moved aside so the Mela and Yin could see her too. She smiled embarrassed how she tried to hide behind her teacher. Of course he would do that. Mérante looked around, expecting Odette to be behind Félicie, but nope. He cleared his throat, \"Ahem, excuse me Yin and Mela, I have to find my lover. I'll be back.\" He got a nod from Yin and Mela. He nodded and then walked off, leaving Félicie to stand in front of an audience. \"Félicie, I'm glad you take interest in my daughter. She never have friends.\" Yin teased. Mela sighed and rolled her eyes. \"This is the first time she actually accepted to hang out with someone.\" He continued. Félicie looked at them amazed. She was the first person that Mela actually wanted to hang out? In a million years has she thought that Mela didn't have friends. She was cool. Who wouldn't like her? Félicie stopped her thoughts as she a notion came across her mind. Maybe her emotional distance made it hard for her to make friends? And because of that, she gave up and became even more... Dispassionate. Or maybe her past was hard too? So many thoughts crowded head. \"So I suppose we're waiting on your mother?\" Yin asked. Félicie ended her conclusion and caught up with what he said. She nodded rapidly and smiled rather stupidly. They stayed silent as Mela and Yin were doing their own thing as Félicie looked down and twiddled her fingers, hoping by some freaking miracle that mom and Mérante would appear suddenly. \"Well it seems like it may take awhile... Mind telling us about yourself?\" Yin spoke. Félicie grinned and nodded. Oh boy. Mérante walked around the Opera, as he was wandering, he found Odette walking by herself, slowly, with Felicity on her chest and fast asleep. \"Odette!\" Mérante ran towards her and kissed her cheek, making sure she was okay. \"Are you alright?\" Odette nodded, but made a exasperated sigh. \"I'm fine, I'm just... Nervous. Mela seems more on the uncomfortable side. She's just... Different, from what I'm used to.\" Mérante remained silent, trying to think of a way to comfort his lover, \"Well, just give it time. She's probably just nervous.\" \"More like impassive.\" Odette mumbled. \"Odette, you have nothing to worry about. You know she isn't exactly... Social. She trains at home... She's homeshooled too. Most of her life She's never really stepped out her house ever. Yin said that she actually wanted to visit Paris and see the Ballet.\" \"She said it was boring here.\" \"Well, um. Maybe she was just lonely?\" Mérante said, trying to think of an excuse. It was once again filled with silence until Mérante broke it and placed a hand gently on Odette's shoulder. \"My love, Mela is just not an outspoken child. Félicie might be, but that's just her... Mela's way of interacting is to be quiet? Be patient, she'll come out of her shell and if she doesn't... Then we have another time.\" Odette looked at his courageous, loving eyes. The way he said it was passionate. She put a warm gently smile on her lips and nodded. \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes, I'm positive my love.\" Odette smirked and landed a kiss on Mérante's cheek, making him blush, and smile. He saw Felicity staring at him. He couldn't do anything but probably pat her head, and that's exactly what he did. Way to go. \"Now then... Let's go see them. I left Félicie with them and I have a feeling she's telling her life long story.\" He chuckled. Odette nodded and let Mérante lead the way. They walked until they heard muffled sounds that sounded like Félicie's. \"I think you were right.\" Odette laughed. Mérante laughed with Odette, of course he was right. Surprisingly he knows Félicie, she's more than a student. He then opened the door for his lover and, yup he was right. Félicie was standing the chair, using her hands to explain her life, while Mela and her father were listening. \"And that's how I met my mom. She then adopted me after! Felicity came probably after a year later.\" Félicie finished, smiling. \"Wow, that's really sweet. I'm glad you have a family.\" Yin said, smiling as well. Mela nodded too. Mérante decided to step in before she starts back up. \"Hello, my apologies for interrupting. Mela, you may hang out with Félicie outside, or at my house if you'd like to. We still have things to discuss.\" Yin nodded and looked at Mela. \"Yes! Mela please behave well.\" Mela sighed, \"Okay.\" \"Great! I want to show you everything on what, and how I used to train!\" Félicie said, vibrating with excitement. Odette who was just standing beside the door, because she wasn't that comfortable until she heard Mérante said something about a house. She was to curious for her own good. Odette walked towards the group as Félicie got jumpy, \"Come on, let's go! Mom! We'll be at Régine's house for a second! I want to show her what I did to train.\" Odette was about to object, but was interrupted. \"Mela your ready?!\" Félicie didn't let Mela answered as she grabbed her hand and ran off, making Mela tug behind her, \"Gee I can't wait.\" Mela said unmoved, while also being dragged by a giddy child. \"What's going on?\" Odette asked, unsure what was Mela and Félicie were going to do after the witch's house, also known as Régine's house. \"I told the kids that after they visit your old servants cottage, Félicie can being Mela to our home.\" Mérante explained Odette stayed still. What other words could she say? 'Oh okay, I hate your daughter but I guess she could come over.' her mind was repeating that over and over. Yin and Mérante looked at her with concern, while Odette was lost in thought with a worried expression and by then, Yin knew exactly why she was so troubled. Her thoughts were discontinued as a gentle hand was placed on her shoulder. She expected Mérante but it was Mela's father who gave a comfort squeeze. \"I really do apologise about my lethargic Daughter. Please do not think bad of her. I know she's alittle... Emotional distant, but she is really delightful. You just need to get to know her better. She had a very hard life, and she's still getting used to the fact there are happy days.\" Odette face softened back as he explained. She still doesn't know the reason why but maybe it's not his story to talk about. She exhaled some air, and then exhaled, trying to be more determined, she smiled and nodded. \"I will do my best to understand your daughter... She is just more different than my daughter who is always a ray of sunshine.\" She explained. She then guilty as his face fell a bit on how she explained her daughter's personality. He gained his posture, nodded and bowed his head. \"I thank you for taking a chance on my flower. Please be safe.\" Odette nodded and looked at Mérante who was watching the whole 'movie' she limped over to him and kissed him on the cheek and walked off with a cane on her right hand and Felicity dozing off against her chest. Mérante sighed happily as he watched Odette strolled off. He shook his head and faced him. \"Shall we discuss more, without being disturbed?\" Yin laughed and nodded. \"Yes let us continue our thoughts.\" Still being dragged by the girl, Mela resisted the tug right smack on the tracks, making Félicie almost trip backwards. She looked up and saw that they were outside the Opera. She then turned to Mela who was looking back at her. \"Why did you stop me?\", Félicie asked with a bit of annoyance in her voice. \"Shouldn't we wait for your mother?\", Mela said. Félicie stayed quiet but nodded. \"Yeah I suppose so.\" While waiting she kicked a few pebbles on the ground, while Mela was waiting. The silence was unbearable for Félicie, luckily Mela had a question, \"So why do you want to bring me to your old home?\" \"I want to show you how I trained and what my mom taught me to be a ballerina!\" Félicie said throwing her arms up as if she tried to be more dramatic. \"Okay? But isn't this where you trained?\" Mela asked as she was pointing to the large building. \"Well technically, I auditioned for the dance called the Nutcracker, and I trained at home.\" Félicie explained. Mela nodded, and proceeded being quiet again, while Félicie continued kicking pebbles and counting people passing by. \"Do you really fight?\" A question that was going around in Félicie's brain. She got a yes from her father, but was it actually true? Mela nodded again, \"Yes I do, I just don't like showing off.\" Félicie nodded, but she didn't really believe it until she saw it with her own eyes. Maybe Mela's father was lying, maybe she was lying. They stayed silent from then on, only hearing skimming of rocks being pushed. Suddenly a door opened and Félicie whipped her head around and saw Odette with Felicity. \"Hey Mom, we were just waiting for you.\" Félicie said, smiling at them. \"Sorry it took some time, I was talking to Mérante and Yin.\" She explained. They both gave a nod and Mela stood up, looking at Félicie and then at Odette, who was staring back at her like she was interrogating her. \"So... Are we going?\" Mela asked alittle impatient. Félicie smiled widely and grabbed her hand again, nodded, \"Yep! Lets go! Mom we'll go ahead alright?\" Without making Odette answer she tugged at Mela's hand and went on walking, making her walk behind her. Odette sighed. That girl. A few minutes later, the girls stood upon a large door, what was once Félicie's 'home' per say. With a bit of reluctant guts, she opened the door. They were met with a cold breeze on their faces making Félicie's spine shiver. Although it was a warm day, she couldn't help but do that. They haven't visited this place since Felicity was born. Mela was quite drawn to the eerie way the door gave. \"You ready?\" Félicie asked. \"Ready as I'll ever be.\" Mela replied back with sarcasm in her voice. They both walked foward and saw nothing but light at the end, which was the courtyard where she trained. Memories flooded in Félicie's mind making her more at ease. Ever since they left, the house has been unoccupied. Camille and her Aunt Genevieve visit this place rarely, considering that her aunt has a home of her own. It was probably dusty in there, but who knows. Meeting the end of the 'tunnel' they saw old barrels, pails of buckets that have been filled with water whenever it rained. Old rags and some clothesline still attached to wood. \"Can... Can you let go of my hand?\" Mela asked, trying to unhinge her hand that locked Félicie's hand. Félicie shook her head as if trying to regain reality. She let go of Mela's hand and smiled sheepishly at her, trying to look apologetic for doing that. \"So um,\" she walked foward and turned around to see Mela's apathetic face, \"welcome to my used-to-train-place.\" She then did jazz hands trying to spice up the enthusiasm for her and the sake of own self. Mela just rolled her eyes and looked around. The tree was rotting and everything else looked like it hasn't been cleaned for months. Kinda looked like her orphanage. \"Ooh look! This is where I used to train for my balance.\" Félicie said pointing her finger to the old barrel. \"Gee.. Looks... Safe.\" Mela answered back. Félicie ignored her comment and got up on the barrel. She then stood up and balanced on top of it. Looking back at Mela who was alittle uninterested. But that was going to change. She grinned and used her points to roll the barrel. Mela looked up at Félicie's proud face and clapped unenthusiastically. \"Im impressed.\" She said. Félicie rolled her eyes, but got an idea. \"Hey Mela, why don't you try? If your a fighter and all that stuff, you would know how to do it.\" Félicie said trying to taunt her. Mela looked at Félicie who had her hands on her hips, her eyes gleaming with a taunting look. She glanced at the barrel and nodded. \"Sure, why not?\" Félicie smirked and jumped off. \"Go ahead and try it out.\" Félicie knew she couldn't do it. It have taken her days and hours to practice to balance on the barrel. Félicie didn't even realize that she was growing quite impatient for her unruly behaviour towards everyone and she was sick and tired of it. So why not give her a taste of her own medicine? Not a moment later, both of turned around hearing clanking noises from behind. They froze until they heard a familiar voice \"So, I see your teaching Mela your tricks of balancing?\" Odette asked and smiled at Félicie. Félicie looked relieved to see her, thinking it was a policeman telling them that they are trespassing. And going to jail for that matters. Shaking off her thoughts she smiled back at her mom and nodded, gesturing her head towards Mela who turned her back to them and stared at the barrel. \"Yep, I'm showing Mela how to balance, but I think she can because she's a fighter and stuff like that.\" Félicie said, putting some taunting in her voice. Odette felt the teasing in Félicie's voice and she felt it on her lips that she trying not to giggle. It seems like both of them were not fond of her, after her unemotional greeting to them. Not even noticing, Mela did have irritation on her face and a bit of anger. Atleast shes keeping her profanity to herself. Taking deep breaths to calm her nerves and anger. Finally regaining her posture and taking deep breaths, ignoring the eyes that were watching her like a hawk, she hopped onto the barrel, not even making a slim move from the barrel. Moving her feet as if she was walking, she steered the barrel to face them, and she couldn't help but snicker at their amazed faces, with their mouths open and eyes dilated to the size of bowling balls. In a split second, Mela made a back flip off the barrel and landing in front of them. She then straightened her posture and met her eyes with theirs, \"I know, you have been taunting me, I'm not stupid.\" She said quietly. Odette and Félicie looked at Mela's eyes and all they could see was a glimmer of hurt. There was an immediate guilt that settled in their stomachs. They should've have not taken her for granted. Why did they even think that? \"I'm-I'm really sorry, but you just seem so disinterested in everything!\" Félicie exclaimed. Not even answering, Félicie exploded into more questions she couldn't contain, \"Why are you so emotional? Why can't you just be happy and cheerful?!\" Mela didn't move nor make a face. She sighed and turned away from them, \"You may be outspoken about your story... But my Story will remain a mystery. I don't care if you don't understand me, no one does. I know who I am... And if you don't like that, then maybe it was a bad idea for me to hang out with you.\" Félicie and Odette looked at each other, having even more guilt weighing in their stomachs. Felicity seemed to be the only one content in this jumble of messes. \"Yes I throw Stilettos, yes I fight, but I have a reason for all of my apathetic ways.\" She said, showing a bit more emotion. She then took out a single stiletto and threw it, using her wrist to Target the object. It hit the tree and made an impact on it, there would indeed, be a mark from it. She then carried on to fighting positions, doing back flips, front flips, and side flips, they're eyes widen with disbelief. She's pretty flexible, just like a ballerina... After the show, she looked at them one more time before brushing besides them, leaving only the 3 alone. They didn't even have a chance to comment on the Preformance she gave. It didn't matter though, everytime their mouths would open, but nothing came out. Moments passed and Félicie just gave up with being quiet, instead she threw up her arms and made a commotion. \"Ahh, why did I have speak my mind? Why couldn't I just kept it to myself and not provoke her?!\" Félicie just kept on ranting on, but Odette tuned her out as she was thinking too. Not only that they judged her, but she proved them wrong. Even with all that mocking, and judgement they gave, she never gave any unnecessary comments to them, but she was pretty sure that Mela was close to hitting her breaking point. Already tired of hearing Félicie's upset manner, she sighed and grabbed her daughter's shoulder and squeezed to calm her down. She stopped fulminating, looking at her mothers beautiful blue eyes with her own Emerald eyes. \"Félicie it's okay to speak your mind.\" Odette said, but even she knew it wasn't right to judge. \"No it isn't! We basically mocked her without letting her tell her story! I always said to other people that we shouldn't judge other people without hearing their side of the story!\" Félicie exploded. Odette remained calm and looked down at Felicity who asleep for awhile until Félicie erupted. She was now aware what was happening and started bawling, upset the tone of Félicie's and now hungry. \"Félicie!\" Odette snapped, \"you just woke up Felicity, and now she's crying.\" Odette tried to rock and cuddling her and humming a song. Minutes later she finally stopped crying. Sighing in relief Odette looked back at Félicie who was looking at the Stiletto that was stuck in the tree still. Something else was going on in her mind, Odette could tell. \"It seems like something is going around in your brain of yours, not just of provoking her. Is there anything that is upsetting you?\" Odette questioned. Félicie stayed still. She stayed inaudible to her mothers question. \"Maybe you are just... Jealous?\", Odette submitted. Félicie groaned, but she knew that her mom was right. \"Ugh, so maybe I am. So what?\" \"Well, it seems like everytime she spoke and did something you would get a hint of jealousy and astonishment in you eyes.\" Odette explained. Félicie looked down. \"Yeah, your probably right, she does so many things that I can't do! And yeah, I am jealous. She's flexible like I am, but I never learned all that stuff.\" She responded. \"Félicie... There is so many things that make you... You. What makes Mela is Mela. Everyone has their own unique hobbies and interests. Like you said, we know nothing about her and why she took on that.\", Odette encouraged. Félicie reconsidered her thoughts about Mela. \"I...I guess your right about Mela, maybe she needs to warm up to us first... I did just grab her arm and dragged her to where I wanted to go.\" Odette inclined towards her reason. \"But wait, why do you not like her?\" Félicie asked. Odette looked around but her daughter's face, hoping that she would avoid this question, but Félicie eyed her down. Knowing that she can't escape, she sighed, \"Well, I just... I know you love making friends, but I'm always worried that you'll become one like them. I already knew the kids at the Opera and they are all kind, but her... She's more different than the rest, taking on a more dangerous hobby. I just didn't want you to take interest in her...\" Odette said, nervous about what she said. The silence lasted for awhile, but Félicie laughed it out. Odette raised her brow in surprise and maybe alittle embarrassment. Did she say something funny that was important? She waited until she stopped, wiping her tears with ber sleeve. \"Mom, mom, why do you think I'll change? Yes I'm jealous sometimes, but I would never change anything inside me. I'm me, like you said.\" Odette rolled her eyes but smiled. \"I know, I know you wouldn't change but I'm a mother... I can't help but worry.\" Félicie giggled but retained her stance, \"Mom, everyone does it, even I do, when I first met you I thought you were going to smack me with your cane.\" Odette looked at her as if she was crazy, making Félicie laugh again it's making her stomach hurt. \"You have a wild imagination.\" Odette chuckled and shaking her head. \"What can I say, I like taking a step over the comfort zone.\" She answered back with a grin. \"We should probably go before we get caught entering someone's property.\" Odette said looking around. \"Why is that? No one lives here?\" Félicie said, with a questionable face. \"Even though we used to live here, didn't mean we have the right to still be here. This is Régine's house still, even if she is in jail, but I will not explain to a policeman why a 12 year old girl, a mother and a baby is here training.\" Odette said firmly, but alittle bit of sarcasm. Félicie bit her lip from making a giggle that grew in her throat, but then nodded professionally. \"Plus, we need to find Mela... Just in case if she didn't go back to go back to the Opera.\" She continued. Félicie nodded and both of them headed back towards the Opera. Hopefully she knows where the Opera is, Odette hoped. Only a few blocks ahead of them, was Mela, her head down, her arms crossed and walking slowly but surely to the Opera. Occasionally she would bump into someone, mumble a sorry and kept on walking. She couldn't blame them for being so curious, everyone thinks the same thing when she is introduced to someone. Even people on the street gave been strange looks by looking at this long black haired girl who has two inverted eye colors and a pretty tall, slim figure. Really she is just a few inches taller than Félicie, and 3 years older than her. She looked up and sighed, tucked the hair that was in her face, and continued strolling to find the Opera. Looking around her surroundings, she saw parents with their children playing around them while they smiled down at their fun antics. Even with everyone knowing that she has a gloomy personality, she did love looking at beautiful sceneries, especially happy kids with their parents. She didn't know why, it just stuck. She also had a soft spot for babies. And to be fair, Félicie's sister looked adorable. Thinking back, she thought she was being over dramatic for leaving them in the dirt, but for the first time... Félicie actually wanted to hang out with her, rather than avoid her. She didn't know what to do, instead she accepted it, and to be fair, she was alittle excited. Not showing any emotion if course. Mela shook her head was if trying to soothe and forget the thought that got stuck in mind. Usually she never thought of anything worrying, but this time it was new for her. Somehow, she stopped in front of the Opera. Sighing in relief, she walked in and was met with an immediate warmth and light radiating from above. Trying to remember where the stadium, she took a few steps until she heard footsteps from behind. She turned around quickly and saw Mérante, one of her father's friend, that she recalled of. She then faced him, and examined Mérante expecting her father to be with him, but no one was with him. Curious where her father went she asked, \"Um, I was thinking you guys were in the stadium together... Is my father somewhere else?\" Mérante nodded and took a glance at the door that she walked in a few minutes before. \"Your father had something going on, he asked me if you could spend the night over and he could pick you up tomorrow morning.\" Mela was deadpanned. Spend the night... At his house? With Félicie and her mother who obviously hates her? \"Uh-um... Is there a reason why left so soon?\" \"He said they're was trouble back where they where you and your father was staying, but he wanted to make sure it was safe. So he left on his own.\" He replied. \"Oh...\" Mela was beyond nervous and uncomfortable, staying at a stranger's house she just met. Sure, her father knew him, heck they are been friends, but she doesn't exactly trust anyone, especially when she's in a new environment. \"Don't worry Mela, I'm sure Félicie would be excited as well as Odette.\" Mérante reassured. \"Y-yeah... Right.\" She said, doubting every word he said. \"That reminds me... Where are they? Weren't you with them?\" Mérante asked. \"They... Well, I went ahead to check what my father was doing. I think they were in their way back too.\" She answered, her face emotionless, though extremely distressed. Mérante nodded, \"Well I suppose we shall wait for them. In the mean time, I still have work, but they can guide you to my home and show you around. Is that good?\" Unknowingly, she nodded and watched Mérante watch the door, awaiting for Odette, Felicity and Félicie's arrival to take Mela to their home abode. Mela's hand were clenched, tightening everytime she heard a sound. Her face was still apathetic, but her hands were sweating by the time she heard the door open. Félicie opened the door for her mother and the baby binded to Odette's chest still. Felicity might me small and young, but from the way she is trying to look around, she was tired of this strap. Odette nodded as saying 'thank you for opening the door'. Félicie bobbed her head back and let the door closed. They were both met with Mérante facing them and Mela only a few feet away, standing on the stairs. Mérante smiled warmly and walked towards them, giving a kiss on Odette's cheek, \"Welcome back deary, I was just waiting for you guys to come back. I'm seeing that Mela beat you back here?\" Odette chuckled nervously and nodded, while Mela just rolled her eyes. \"We just wanted to be make sure Mela didn't get lost.\" Odette said. Mérante nodded, \"I see. Well, Mela will staying with us for tonight and her father will pick her up in the early morning.\" Both of their pupils dilated alittle bit wider, and then looked at each other, trying to find an answer. Mela felt like a burden after Mérante just said that. She could tell that she was not welcome. The uncomfortable silence was still ongoing when Mérante decided it was time to wrap it up, besides... He has work still. \"Well, Félicie and Odette, can you please guide Mela to our house? Please be inviting as well to our lovely guest.\" Mérante eye them suspiciously. He could also tell that they were not very excited, but apathetic or not, she was still a child and he agreed for his old friend of his. Odette and Félicie put on a strained smile and nodded, trying to ensure that they weren't thinking at all what Mérante and Mela was thinking of. \"Now then, I still have work to do, I will be home by 7 or 8, depending,\" He then turned his back and towards Mela, \"Please do not hesitate if you need anything, they will gladly help.\" With that he walked away. Trying to force the old past behind them, Félicie put a genuine smile, \"Well, looks like you'll be hanging out with us! It's going to be fun I promise. We can do alot of cool things, you can even meet my friend Victor. He's also an orphan.\" Mela nodded. Noticing she was still on the stairs and her hands still clenching, she walked down the stairs while wiping her sweaty hands on her leggings. Odette was glaring at Mela once again, with a icy touch, and again, she took no interest whatsoever. Getting annoyed at the girl's disinterested face she looked away and took a few deep breaths to calm herself. In and out. In and out she thought. \"Come on I'll show you where we live, and maybe later on we can visit Victor.\" Félicie said as she held the door opened for her and Odette. Mela nodded and walked out and waited outside for them to come out themselves. Félicie smiled again at her and looked at Odette who wobbled to and outside, leaving Félicie the only one inside. She let go of the door and watched it close Swiftly. Mela watched their every step as they walked in front of her, showing where they lived. \"It's not to far away from the Opera.\" Félicie inquired. She nodded and continued following them. Odette who was walking quite faster then she would have, and her daughter now walking besides Mela. Feeling the uncomfortable silence again she tried doing another small talk, but this time, it was more of an apology. \"Look, I'm sorry for blowing you up like and saying stuff I didn't mean too. My mom is too. I know we didn't hear your side of your story and you won't tell and that's okay, I just wanted to say that, because I didn't want to be rude of anything.\" She finished. Odette looked at Félicie and then at her to see what her face looked like and she expected it to be impassive again. Mela took a moment to think, she knows that Félicie was sorry and maybe Odette too. Maybe it's time to explain herself and why she's like this. It's now or never, and with that, surprisingly she put a sly smile on her face, making Odette and Félicie's mouth drop to the ground, but quickly hid the evidence. \"Really, I appreciate your apologies and I do to apologise. I guess I never got used to someone wanting to get to know me. And I'm always used to getting stare downs from people who I'm introduced too. They never asked me to play or anything... I was always the odd one, and I got used to the fact.\" She explained. Félicie looked down and so did Odette. They felt sorry for the girl. No friends. Judgement Everytime and just distant. \"That must've been hard, I didn't know it was that bad...\" Odette said without any thought. \"Well, it was from the beginning... But I got used to it, and ever since then... I guess I've been avoiding alot of people, and when you asked me to hang out and you were an orphan I accepted.\" \"I was actually pretty excited meeting an orphan too who was adopted. That's something we have in common, right?\" Félicie asked. Mela nodded, and sighed, \"I guess every orphan has their personality, but I'm just an impassionate one... I don't know how to make friends or hang around people. I've always been... Silent.\" Félicie got a gleam in her eyes and smiled wide enough for Mela could see. She spoke, \"I bet we can help you. You maybe silent, but on the inside, we a more sweeter and cool Mela!\" Mela even smiled...well more like a crooked smile but she tried, \"Thank you, I'm sure you'll do great teaching.\" Félicie then hugged her unexpectedly, which made Mela freeze. Being alittle taller and not knowing what to do, she patted her head awkwardly and they stood like this, waiting for someone to pull away. Finally what felt like decades they let go of each other. Félicie gestured to the road up ahead and said, \"We're almost here, after that I can show you around.\" Mela nodded and they continued walking ahead of. Félicie tuned around, walking backwards still and gave a thumbs up to Odette. She smiled at the girl's antics nodded, making her daughter turn herself around and proceeded waltzing beside Mela. After Félicie turned around her smile faltered and she gave an exasperated sigh, rubbing her head with her right hand. She whispered and asked Felicity even though she's a baby, \"What am I going to do with them?\" Felicity only cooed at her and babbled non existent words. Odette was pretty astonished how Mela just...spoke out like that, trying to explain. She still didn't exactly trust this girl still. But maybe her father was right, just have some patience and kindness towards her, she'll warm up to you. Her personality will change into a sweet child. Though she thought that her daughter's were more sweeter and humble than anyone else in the world. Taking a moment to reflect all the things that happened that morning, she can now have a breath of fresh calmness in her lungs. She trust her daughter, she trusts that she won't do anything... stupid. Hopefully both can meet the real Mela. With using her cane, and putting her hand under Felicity to help support the weight. She walked home, positive that they have already arrived there, and probably Félicie showing everything to her. Her sweet red headed daughter... A/N (Please Read) Whoo. Finished! This was exceptionally long because I really do enjoy writing these. Also I would like point out that this does take alot of time and effort. Please bare that I'm not an expert on Puncuation, spelling, or even describing stuff. I tried to add different words rather than boring ones. And Yes, You are probably gonna comment and say, \"I've never seen a girl in the 1890's fight before.\" Well... Ahem, I'm not really going for realism. I rather just let my imagination fly whenever I feel like it... I could add a flying unicorn but that's pretty odd. So...PURE IMAGINATION IS HERE AND WHATNOT XD My next chapter will probably be short and it will take time to update, I'm trying really hard to post as soon as possible, Sorry! Please review...even criticism are welcome! ~I tried to Bold, Italic the best of my capabilities, as well as correcting my spelling and punctuation, please bare. I am still new at this writing~[Chapter 4] Just to say right now; So sorry I haven't uploaded in a month. I've been pretty busy this summer (Surprisingly) (╥_╥) So yeah, I haven't had much time doing Fics, but worry not, I will try to upload as soon as possible. But hey... I tried (〃-ー-)ﾉ Before you read this chapter does have: Past Child abuse, PTSD, Injuries, and blood. Just a warning! \"Here we are.\" Félicie said, opening the door for Mela. She was met with some dust stinging her eyes, but other than that she was mesmerized how beautiful and quaint their home was. Mela walked inside, allowing Félicie to close the door. Félicie smiled and looked over at Mela's gleaming eyes. It seemed like Mela had a fancy for old but beautiful homes like these. \"Do you like it?\" Félicie asked. Mela nodded, \"I always been intrigued by old houses like these, considering I've never lived in old houses. My dad and his people built my home right before I was adopted. \"What's your home like?\" Félicie asked once again. Mela looked at Félicie and shrugged, \"Its kinda big, has a lot of artifacts hanging around on our walls, like samurai swords, carved Jade and other stuff.\" She explained. \"And some teacups.\" Félicie's eyes widened. She never left France, all she knew was her own cultural but learning others were fascinating. She didn't even know what Jade was, or even Samurai swords. Mela looked at her and knew, just by her face, Félicie was going to ask a lot of questions. She sighed and mentally prepared herself. Just as she was going to explode Mela with questions, Odette walked in, sighing in relief as she was able to sit down and rest. She saw Mela and her daughter in the middle of the room. She pulled her brows confusedly. She expected Félicie to drag Mela everywhere. She grunted as Felicity squirmed uncomfortably. Sighing, Odette let her cane rest against the wall and pulled her baby daughter out of the sling and gestured Félicie to take her. Her red haired daughter happily obliged and took Felicity into her arms. She cooed happily at her baby sister while Felicity gurgled with excitement as she was not confined against her mother's chest. Mela just stared at this tiny thing, smiling slightly at the sight. She never had any siblings, but she did sometimes had to take care of babies at the orphanage. That was probably one of the best things she did at that horrible place. Odette grabbed at her cane and walked quickly, ignoring the pain in her ankle and sat down. The cushion engulfed her body in comfort. She sighed in relief and let her eyes closed for a moment, putting on a small quirk on her lips, \"You're a handful Felicity.\" Félicie laughed- \"And so is Félicie.\" Odette cracked one of her eyes opened and couldn't help but chuckle at her daughter's facial expression. Félicie made an exasperated huff, but after she smiled in amusement. Mela somehow liked the family's fun and loving conversation. Something herself and her dad couldn't really do, because he was so busy, and she was too. Félicie smiled and turned to Mela, who quickly regained her posture, \" Mela, I can show you to our guest room?\" Mela nodded, noticing how exhausted she was for some reason, despite the time zone change, though it didn't really bother her much. It's like she hasn't slept in ages. Félicie seemed to notice her tired eyes boring into her own eyes, even Odette noticed the tiredness from the girl. Félicie gestured her to the stairs and let Mela go upstairs first. She took Felicity into her other arms and secured her just in case if she fell or tripped. She glanced at her mother and Odette nodded which was an obvious: Let Mela rest for awhile and don't bother her. She nodded and went upstairs swiftly. Odette finally has a little quietness...that is until Félicie asks questions even she can't answer. She let her eyes fall once again, thinking quietly. Mela was already admiring the decoration on the walls and many doors. She didn't know which room was the guest room, and she wasn't going to even try. She could see it now, just accidentally walking into a room she wasn't supposed to go in and being scolded or even- No. Not right now. Mela shook her head and let her mind wander to the object she was looking at. It was a beautiful vase, it looked old, rather dusty too, but it didn't mean she liked old artifacts, With a gentle hand, she touched it, not even making a noise, she simply just swiped some dust off and marveled at the shine it gave. Her sleeves went down a little, revealing some scars . She didn't think Félicie was there but she was ...and she saw . Mela quickly put her hand down, letting the sleeves cover her scars once again. She faced the red haired girl and knew immediately that she did indeed see the scars. Though she didn't let her emotions get the best of her. She kept an impassive face, though she was mentally scolding herself for letting Félicie see her scars, or better yet, her vulnerability. Félicie looked in shock. She didn't even know what to think. Was it just scratches? Or something even worse than that?. The uncomfortable silence was enough for Mela to snap at her and ask her about the room. She pointed at the room on 3rd door on the right. Mela mumbled a thank you and retreated to the room, slightly slamming it, making Felicity and Félicie jump, but remained unfazed. Félicie just stood there thinking, and the more she thought the more the mystery of the girl unraveled. One by one she let the puzzles be placed, making it even more sense. She tried to think of theories on what happened to Mela. But she will never get the exact answers, unless it was from the girl herself. And heck, even she knew Mela was not that outspoken. Either that she would have to be best friends with her for years to tell her story. Felicity gave an angry grunt as her tummy rumbled hungrily. Félicie snapped out of her thoughts and looked at Felicity who was angrily waving her fists around. She sighed and went downstairs carefully, trying to soothe the irritated baby. She would probably have to ask her mom, but even her mom couldn't answer her questions. Only Mela,and how she got those scars. Meanwhile in the bedroom... Mela's head pounded furiously. Félicie knew, she knew. Oh dear Lord. She didn't let anyone see her scars, only her father knew,but she didn't let him touch or even ask about it. Fortunately Mela was a fast learner and when Félicie knew, she asked about the bedroom before she asked many questions on how she got them . Mela sat on the bed, unable to control the dizziness in her head. She let her hands support her head as she was thinking of an excuse or something! She couldn't tell anyone about how she got them. It would only worsen. She never felt this vulnerable...not since the orphanage. But ever since she got adopted, she vowed that she would never show how, why and when she got those scars. Shaking she let her hands fall onto her lap and slowly but surely pulled her sleeves up, revealing horrendous scars. Some were minor, some were severe, some were even made by her , but all them had one thing in common, It left scars. It wasn't just physical scars that left her haunted. She was able to hide them beneath her clothing..but she had scars in her mind, one by one, memories flooded her mind from the orphanage. It was the Mental ones that tormented her the most. She clutched her head, trying to subside the gruesome memories. She didn't even realize her nailed were digging into her head, letting crimson blood stream onto her arms, hand and around her face. For the first time since the orphanage, she let tears stream, unable to surpass the ghastly thoughts that swarmed into her mind. The thoughts consumed her, bit by bit. The voices were back, stronger, with harshness and bitterness, letting Mela breathe heavily and uneven. \"Stop crying you twat!\" \"Your worthless!\" \"You can't do anything right!\" \"You wouldn't be punished if you did anything correctly!\" Mela let out a small cried pain, knowing the people downstairs wouldn't hear and only herself. Unable to beat the tiredness, she let her body collapse on the bed, letting go of her hand and letting the blood seep onto the white sheets. She took one glance at the scars she had on her wrists, thumbing the certain scars that she had done to herself. She was the abuser as well, and it made her want to her hate herself for it. Finally the exhaustion was too great and she closed her eyes, letting her sleeves drape down onto her bloody arm. Félicie was already down the last step when Odette noticed the uneasiness in her daughters eyes. \"Whats wrong Félicie?\" worried that Mela was being what she expected. Her daughter shook her head and looked her dead in the eyes, \"I don't think Mela was treated nicely.\" Odette face soften completely. \"What do you mean?\" Félicie didn't say anything, all she did was walk towards her, gave Felicity to her and sat down next to her. Odette jiggled Felicity up and down and crooned at her, hoping to relax the baby's upset gurgles. \"I saw scars..\" Félicie said eventually. Odette looked at her as if she was crazy, but she knew when Félicie was serious about some topics. Hesitantly she asked, \"Like scratches? Or...?\" \"I don't think they're scratches mom, they look... all the scars I saw were always horizontal. Not even random.\" Odette looked down, her face morphed into a sad expression. She had a feeling Mela was pushed in her orphanage, making her emotional distant, but this? This was serious. \"Maybe it's best we keep low... for Mela's sake. She might not be comfortable talking about her... Ahem, past.\" Félicie looked at her mother, her eyes glistening with tears threatened to drop, \"I know, but the thought scares me... I couldn't imagine her growing through such...trauma...\" She took a deep breathe, \"No wonder she's so reserved...She might feel ashamed of her past, and why she's quiet.\" She concluded. Odette nodded. She suddenly saw tears drop onto her daughter's cheeks. \"Oh Félicie...\" Odette said sadly. Félicie let Odette wipe her tears with her gentle hands and then her face was facing her mothers face, she saw the turmoil in her mentors eyes and even guilt. \"Félicie, the past we cannot go back too...believe me I wish I could too,\" Suddenly remembering her other baby... Esmae , ignoring the lump in her throat, she continued, \"But all we can do...is help her, even if she denies it, just...support her. That's all we can do.\" Her daughter nodded and sniffed and then snugged beside her mother, sniffing in the reassuring scent. Félicie thought about if she was brought into that orphanage. She was lucky that she didn't go through that. But the thought terrified her. She didn't realize she lucky enough to be in an orphanage that at least tried to think about their safety and health. Odette just sighed. Having motherly instincts, she thought what would happen if Félicie went through that? She shivered silently, enough for her daughters not to worry. Being the mother she is, she kissed the top of her red haired daughter and also snuggling with her. On the other side was Felicity, babbling quietly, unfazed by the situation. She felt Félicie breaths come shallow and even, knowing she couldn't move now that she was asleep, she might as well settle. She closed her eyes, allowing her hand to subconsciously curl around Felicity, making sure she wouldn't fall. She fell asleep. 'Another long day' Mérante thought to himself as he unlocked the door to his house. \"I'm home love.\" Mérante said as walked in. He took off his hat, and put his cane resting it on the wall. He saw Odette, Félicie and Felicity sleeping next to each other. He smiled and walked towards the group, giving each a kiss. It wasn't normal to show affection, but...If they were asleep, he would give them kisses on the head, including Félicie. Knowing Mela was probably asleep or in the guest room doing whatever, he decided to make dinner, considering Odette was probably worn out from walking everywhere. He walked into the kitchen and started dinner, not even knowing that his lover was smiling secretly in the other room. Mela awoke with a sound downstairs. 'Probably father's friend making dinner' She thought. She lifted half her body and then suddenly she felt something sticky and gooey on her head and arms. Suddenly she remembered. She groaned and dared to look at the white sheets she knew were covered in her blood. She sighed and got up. There was a whooshing in her head. Headache. She was sore from grasping at her head and making it bleed. Now she has to think of an excuse on why there's dried up blood on the sheets. And also why her head covered in encrusted, dried blood. She decided to just leave it be. She silently tip-toed towards the door. Not making a peep, she opened the door with precision that she knew they couldn't hear from downstairs. She peeked out her head, looking around hoping there was a bathroom. Luckily there was and opened the heavy door, shutting it quietly and swiftly running to the bathroom. Opening the door inaudibly and then closing the same way she opened. Knowing that Félicie, Mérante or Odette would hear the water running, she turned on the faucet and put her hand under the luke warm water. She saw swirls of blood drain into the sink. She cupped the water and splashed it onto her face, reveling on how nice it felt. She did it a few more times before shutting it off and looking herself in the mirror. She had five punctured wounds on each side of her head she couldn't conceal. It was red, but the swollen died down fortunately. She just hoped that they didn't notice, but she has to admit, they were very observant. She just had to put on a different scenario. Finally allowing herself to calm and find an excuse, also aspiring for them to be that stupid. That was her wish. She opened the door without making a noise, despite the heaviness. She crept down the stairs and surprisingly Odette, Félicie and Felicity were asleep. How long were they asleep? How long was she asleep? She assumed they got home around 4pm, fell asleep and now its 7pm. So she's been asleep for about 3 hours... 'Wow, world record.' She thought to herself. She figured that Mérante was making dinner. So she quietly walked past the group and into the kitchen. Mérante knew she was up but he didn't know that she would jump scare him by walking next to him. It took him time to actually see Mela beside him, watching him intently on what he was making. \"Oh Mela...I didn't see you there, are you hungry?\" He asked as he stirred the stew. Mela merely nodded, letting him continue on stirring and also grabbing a baguette from the cupboard. He stirred more, feeling slightly perturbed on how the girl was just watching the whole thing. Is this is what dancers feel like when he's watching them? Well...he was a dancer, but also retired from it. It was a long time when he danced. Minutes later, he took the spoon and dipped it into the stew, blowing it and letting the liquid go down his throat. He pursed his lips in disgust. Truth be told, he sucked at cooking and would usually eat out, but now, he has a family he has to support and by that; meaning cooking. Mela seemed to notice and quietly went to the cupboards, grabbing seasonings, and other ingredients out. Mérante looked at her, perplexed. But he didn't question it until she took the pot that contained the stew, opened the window door and drained it. After that she put the pot in the sink and put water in it, washing it well; while Mérante had his mouth gaped slightly. He just stared and watch Mela's every move as she grabbed a cookbook and opened it and started cooking. Mela looked at Mérante and then back at the cookbook. \"I will cook for you, seeing as you got home and your probably thoroughly exhausted, I will help.\" She said simply, grabbing the chicken stock and pouring into the pot. \"Miss, you don't have to do tha-\" Mérante tried to object but was cut off by Mela who spoke softly, \"Sir, you agreed for me to stay for tonight of an unexpected turn of events from my father. The least I could do is cook something as a thank you.\" Mérante sighed in defeat. Mela knew she had won. It was either him failing at cooking again, or her cooking. And he seemed to be out of choices. \"Alright Mela, you win... what are you even making?\" He asked, rubbing the bridge of his nose. Mela stopped with chopping some onions he didn't notice he had some, nor did he realize Mela was cutting it. She pointed to the cookbook, gesturing him to flipped book to a page of recipe called Onion Soup . \"Ah, I see.\" Mérante said quietly. It was quite simple. Just onions, bay leaves,thyme, seasonings and broth. \"You know sir, Its probably easier to use a cookbook instead of just jumping into making the food. Its a recipe for disaster, unless you know it by heart.\" She said, trying to conceal her smirk as she saw Mérante's face flush pink. \"W-well you see, I didn't know...I had a...cookbook, also I don't cook often.\" He said sheepishly, while looking at her head, which he just saw 5 punctured wounds. ' Weird...She didn't have that before when went home...' Mérante thought, but was cut off by her. Mela just shrugged, \"Makes sense.\" She looked up at him. He looked offended or somewhat hurt. She could tell. She looked down again and chopped more onions. \"I am not offending you sir, I am just saying you work in the morning until later in the night. And after the hard work, its exhausting.\" She explained, looking up once again and staring at him with her different eye colors. He was relaxed now that she explained. \"Am I not right?\" She asked Mérante shook his head, \"No your right...\" She was right. He would work until the cows came home, he never had time to cook, or sometimes even relax. Only go to a bar and order some food. Mela smiled, \"You see? But at least you think of your family, and takes guts to make food you have never done.\" Mérante smiled and nodded. Let her finish chopping onions and put the thyme, bay leaves in, stirring it with the broth, and then eventually putting the rest of the onions in. She grabbed the unused baguette and cut it crisply. He stared in amazement on how she worked well in the kitchen. So swift on her feet, and how accurate she was. Mela then grabbed a spoon and dipped it in the soup, blowing on it and sipped it. She smiled and grabbed another spoon, holding it our for Mérante to taste. He took the spoon and did the exact same thing Mela did. It smelled delightful. He let let the soup soothe his raw throat. It tasted excellent, and felt soothing. \"Your soup is absolutely incredible...Thank you so much for helping with dinner.\" He was being sincere. \"Would you like me to say that you made the soup?\" She asked smirking. Mérante laughed aloud and shook his head, \"No, you deserve the compliments, I will merely admit that I have failed cooking.\" Mela nodded and smiled back. She turned around and Mérante saw 5 more punctured wounds to the head, but on the other side. His brain concluded 2 reasons. 1. Her fingers dug into her head for unknown reason 2. Gunshots? Mérante scolded himself for the last conclusion. Why on earth would he think that? Shaking the feeling, he grabbed bowls and the cut bread and put it on the table. Something smelled good? Félicie couldn't tell. but it smelled more than good... amazing? Maybe. She cracked her eyes one by one, seeing the light on in the diners room. She sat up quickly but stopped midway as she felt an arm wrapped around her shoulder. Oh. Félicie smiled at the sight. Her mom, and sister sleeping soundly. She didn't want disturb them but food was ready and she knew her mom wasn't usually hungry most of the time, but she also knew that her mom didn't want to miss something good. She shook her moms shoulder gently, making Odette mumble and open her eyes. She quickly opened her eyes, more aware and sat up, holding a still sleeping Felicity in her arms. Odette yawned and looked her daughter, \"Who's cooking?\" Félicie shrugged unknowingly. \"Maybe Mérante made some food.\" She suggested. Odette nodded and stood up. \"Félicie, do you think you put Felicity to bed for me?\" She nodded and took the sleeping baby into her arms and went towards their bedroom. Smiling she walked into the dining room, seeing Mela and Mérante eating across from each other, silently eating their soup and bread. Mérante noticed his lover and smiled lovingly, making a motion for her to sit next to him. Odette did what he wanted to and sat down. but saw some wounds on Mela's head. She was about to ask but, Mérante then got up and went into the kitchen, not a moment later he had two bowls filled soup, which she now noticed it smelled really good. He put it in front of Odette and smiled once again, \"Mela made it for us. Isn't that nice?\" Odette looked at the girl, who seemed unfazed by the conversation with Mérante. She nodded skeptically, \"Yes...um, Thank you Mela.\" Unsure if maybe the black haired girl poisoned the food or not. She took the spoon and dipped it in the creamy soup and eventually sipped it. Her eyes widened. It didn't just smell good, it tasted absolutely stunning. In a good way. She couldn't help but compliment her. \"Its amazing Mela, really.\" Mela nodded, \"Thanks.\" Félicie had the same reaction just like Odette. She was on her 3rd bowl and after that she finished. Mela was glad to have helped. She was also surprised that no one asked about her head injury...yet. But for now, it will stay unknown and she was okay with that. She has her life and they have their life. After dinner and finishing the dishes while Mela watched. Mérante put wood in the fire place. The fire sprung into life and blazed coolly. The heat was reassuring. Instead of joining the 3 on the couch, she sat down next to it, crossing her legs in a Chinese manner. All of them looked at her puzzled. They didn't know how to cross like that, of course it could be easy to teach Félicie, considering she's flexible just like Mela. They stayed silent, listening to the crackles in the fire, letting it shine in the room. But the 3 was concerned for Mela's head injury and they really wanted to ask, but no one seemed to have the courage until- \"So...What happened to your head? I didn't see it before you went into the bedroom.\" She asked. The older couple and Félicie looked at Mela who had a blank expression. Mela sighed. She looked up at the 3 and mentally prepared herself for the excuse. Oops...Cliffhanger again (・｀ω´・) Again I wanted to upload as soon as possible.

WARNINGS: Mentions of dead bodies and abuse of children Mela didn't seem to notice the stare-downs as she explained her so-called accident. To be fair, she wasn't good at lying. Her dad taught her to be honest and that's what made her so deep down honest, not really caring if it hurt. Mérante raised his brow incredulously. \"Are you sure?\" Mela sighed and shook her head. \"Nope. I lied. And in all honesty, its not your fault, yet its none of your business.\" She said defensively. Mérante backed away, putting his hands up in surrender. Félicie and Odette looked at her with worry. They knew it wasn't their business, but something inside their souls was urging them to help or something. \"Are you sure your okay?\" Félicie asked. Mela rolled her eyes. \"I am sure. Now if you'll excuse me,\" She uncrossed her legs and stood up. \"I must rest, my father would be here in the early mornings to pick me up. I shall see you tomorrow.\" She bowed her head and went upstairs, ignoring the eyes as she went. \"Something is not right. Its obvious that she did that to herself.\" Félicie pondered. \"Nightmare?\" Odette asked. \"You could be right my dear. Though we do not know that. She might've...harmed herself with ill intentions.\" Mérante shuddered as he though about it. Who knew children could think such a thing. It was absolutely disastrous. Young lives, ending just because. \"There's nothing we really can do. If Mela won't confess, then her father will have to pry it out of her.\" Odette said, rocking the baby. \"But what if we can?\" Félicie asked. \"She's a friend...apparently a very broken friend. There has to be a way.\" Odette shook her head. \"Not without aggravating her to the point where she might want to throw knives at us.\" Odette explained. Félicie sighed and sat down again. \"Maybe you right...\" \"Well...mothers do know best.\" Odette smirked. Félicie rolled her eyes. \"Yes...\" She admitted. \"Alright. We have things we need to do tomorrow. Lets rest, shall we? Including miss Félicie, who needs to be up by when I get up.\" He narrowed his eyes down to Félicie who groaned in advance. \"Yes sir...\" She grumbled. chuckled and kissed Odette on the cheek, and then rubbing a thumb over the baby's cheek. \"Goodnight you two. Sleep well.\" Odette smiled and nodded. \"Goodnight my dear.\" With that, they dispersed into their own bedrooms. Félicie laid the slumbering baby in the crib, while Odette plopped herself on the bed. She sighed in content and mumbled, \"So this is what its like having children.\" the girl laughed quietly, making sure she won't wake up Felicity. \"Oh trust me. Good luck on the toddler days.\" Odette shot her a look and smiled. \"Something I am looking forward.\" Once the girl was making sure the baby was asleep, she walked to her own bed and laid down. Odette turned the lamp off and sighed comfortably as she moved around in her bed. \"Hey mom...\" Félicie whispered. \"Hmm?\" \"Do you think we'll see Mela again?\" She asked. Odette thought for a moment and then gave a defeated sigh. \"I don't know...her father works with Mérante, so it might be a possibility that she'll come back next year. But who knows...\" Félicie sighed. Her mother was probably right, unless she moved, but that was unlikely. It was unfair for her to meet a cool person and then never seeing them again. The world was huge for Félicie. And no where in the world has she ever been out of France. \"I'll miss her...\" Félicie mumbled into her pillow. She could tell that Odette had a look of surprise on her face, despite the darkness looming over them. \"Will you now?\" She asked incredulously. \"Yeah...other than Victor, she's only person I know that had a tough beginning and still is learning. She has an odd hobby...I will admit,\" Odette chuckled. \"But she seems to be passionate about it. Just like I am with Ballet.\" Odette gave a inhale and exhale. \"You right. She is different, but I see no difference about how passionate she is with her own hobby. Though, she is mysterious.\" Félicie giggled. \"You were mysterious too, when I met you that night.\" Odette scoffed. \"Well your the one who asked me if I needed help. Don't put me into your situation.\" Félicie giggled again and gave a tired yawn. \"Goodnight, sunshines.\" Odette whispered. The girl was already asleep by then. It was funny how that red haired girl can sleep through. Odette chuckled and found herself sleepy. Eventually, she fell asleep. Mela couldn't sleep that night. She knew it was late and that everyone was asleep. Now was the perfect time to get out and enjoy some peacefulness. Mela checked her gnash and felt no pain in. She smiled to herself and sighed. Fortunately, the black haired girl found a way to hide away the punctures. Her way was a bit different, but not enough for them or her father to notice. She gently turned the knob to the door, opening it slightly, trying to not make a sound. She succeeded and moved her body to be out of the bedroom and then closing the door behind her. Mela turned her head to each halls and saw nobody. She breathed in relief. Even in the dark she could see pretty well. Her senses were very good and it was made her stealthy. Mela spotted a small string at the end of the hall. Being curious, she moved her agile feet and quickly found herself in touching the string and pulling as swiftly as possible. Then, some stairs appeared. She shuddered when she felt a cold feeling coursing through her veins. Ignoring the cold feeling, she walked upstairs,ever slightly making a small creak each time. When she made it upstairs, she saw a small window that had been previously used before. Perfect. Gently, she pushed the window open and smiled when she was able to fit her body through the window. Using both her hands, she hauled herself up out and instantly she saw the moon ans stars in the dark sky. Her eyes widened and breathed in awe. She found herself a perfect seat to stare out. Mela always admired the darkness. She learned to appreciate the darkness, and what lit up in the dark. She smiled when she spotted a shooting star. Secretly, she made wishes whenever it happened. It was a comforting time to be alone and hear nothing but the wind blowing. She then heard a familiar voice, startling her. \"M-Mela?\" Mela turned around to see Félicie standing and looking at her with a surprise look. Mela then turned her head to the skies. \"Félicie.\" Mela said formerly. \"What are you doing here?\" The red haired asked. \"Watching.\" \"Watching what?\" \"The moon and stars.\" She replied, a hint of annoyance in her voice. \"So you like them too.\" Félicie asked, looking up as well. Mela nodded, not bothering to look at the girl and even take her eyes off the sky. \"I'm guessing this is what you do when you can't sleep?\" Mela questioned. \"Yeah, I come here every time my mom is asleep.\" Félicie answered truthfully. \"...I can see why. Everything is beautiful when something shines in the dark.\" Mela quipped, her eyes gleaming when she saw a twinkle in a star. Félicie nodded and walked to where Mela was sitting. Félicie gestured her hand to the empty spot next to Mela. \"May I?\" Mela shrugged. \"Be my guest.\" Félicie sat down with her and watched the sky, their eyes shifting to every star. Then, Mela pointed a finger to a bunch of clustered stars. \"The seven sisters.\" Félicie looked at her curiously, obviously confused. Mela seemed to understand the girl's expression and sighed, \"The seven sisters is a constellation. See those clustered stars that shines brighter than the rest?\" A nod. \"Well, those are the constellations. They have stories behind them.\" \"What kind?\" Félicie's eyes widened in awe. \"The seven sisters are thought to be the daughters of Atlas, who held the sky and his daughters, shining bright in the sky. There are many other constellations, I presume you know some?\" Félicie nodded and looked back at the sky. \"I do, I would tell my sister them.\" \"You have a good relationship with your sister and mother.\" Mela pointed out. Félicie nodded, \"Yeah, we do get along. But before then, we weren't so close.\" Mela chuckled. \"Same.\" \"Glad we have some things in common.\" Félicie giggled. Mela just roller her eyes, but there was a small smile creeping onto her face. They continued watching the sky and kept some silence between them. \"Are you okay?\" Félicie asked suddenly. Mela glared at her and then turned back. \"Why say it so suddenly?\" She asked. Félicie shrugged. \"Your my friend and you have scars. I saw them when you were taking a nap.\" Mela sighed in defeat. \"You figured me out, congratulations.\" She said sarcastically. Félicie looked at her again, eyes full of theories. \"So you were abused?\" Mela didn't answer and knew what the answer by then. \"Is that why you are so...?\" \"If you must know,\" Mela spat, making Félicie flinch. \"I was, and I do not care, nor should you. The past is past. It doesn't matter, so why bother?\" Félicie didn't know what to say after that. But something in her heart said something. \"But even some scars haven't healed.\" \"Yeah..I know. I let my scars bleed. but I don't feel it anymore.\" Mela crossed her arms and sighed. \"You can't change the past...no matter how much you dislike it. I am who I am, and there's nothing we can do about it. I've been permanently scarred.\" Félicie shook her head. \"But if you give up on yourself, what good are you? Someone can help.\" Mela turned harshly back to Félicie. \"You think I have already tried? I did, but nobody came. Its obvious that you and I are different far from it.\" She hissed. \"...but we were orphans...\" Félicie whispered. Mela's face soften and then turned away, arms tightening. \"Yeah...I suppose so.\" \"And orphans...\" Félicie put a hand on the black haired girls shoulder and gave a small encouraging smile. \"Stick together.\" Mela looked at her. The way Félicie was trying to get Mela to open up what astonishing. After what she was doing, she still wanted to be friends. Mela looked down. \"I was...trained...to become a warrior. There were children my age who went to war and never came back. Some were strong...some were weak...which meant that...there was no room...\" She said carefully. Félicie's eyes were double in size. Oh... \"But the...after years of training...someone found children dead. And the people who worked there;arrested. The orphanage was left untouched. The children's bodies buried and never to be seen.\" She continued. \"I was one to be found alive.\" Félicie had her mouth gaped open. \"That's horrible...\" She whispered. Mela nodded and somehow, with courage, she shoved one of her hands as if searching for something. Soon, Mela took out a crumpled piece of paper out and held it out. Félicie took it gently and looked at it intently. It was blurry and a bit worn out but she could see children, kneeling down, their stoic faces on and behind them were the teachers and owners of the orphanage. None of them smiled and there she saw it. Mela was in the far corner. Her face showed devoid of emotion. \"They wouldn't let us smile, nor show any sympathy. They taught us that it showed weakness.\" \"How did...\" Félicie was cut off. \"My adoptive father was the one who found out about my orphanage. Once the orphanage was closed down. He adopted me.\" She explained. \"I'm so sorry...\" Félicie was all she could say. Mela shook her head, her face hurt. \"Wasn't your fault. I knew I was always different. Having different passions than other girls.\" Félicie gave the picture back and Mela shoved it back into her pocket. \"Thank you...\" \"For what?\" Mela asked. \"For telling me this.\" Félicie said simply. Mela was bemused. \"Why?\" \"Because I understand you now. I will never know what you've been through, but I now know that you had a tough past, hence why you have a hard time expressing yourself.\" Mela quirked her lips up. \"Thank you for listening.\" Félicie smiled, \"No problem. I think we should sleep though. Your leaving tomorrow, right?\" Mela nodded. \"Yep. Kind of sucks that we became friends the night before I'm leaving.\" Félicie laughed. \"Yeah, but you'll visit soon?\" Mela sighed and shook her head. \"Unfortunately, no...\" \"What?\" Félicie asked incredulously. \"Well...not soon, soon, but maybe in a few years.\" She explained. \"Close enough.\" Félicie shrugged but grinned. Mela got up and held out her hand, giving a small smile. \"Hopefully.\" Félicie grabbed her hand. Odette groaned when Felicity started crying in her bassinet. \"Félicie, can you please get Felicity and give her to me?\" She expected for her daughter to get up, but there was nothing but silence. \"Félicie?\" Odette sat up and looked over to the empty bed. She instantly saw that it was daylight. Much to Odette's surprise, Félicie woke up before her. Odette grabbed her cane quickly and went to Felicity who was whining. \"Oh, I know, my dear.\" Odette ushered, wrapping her arms around the baby girl. She picked the baby up with one arm and used her good foot to creak the door open. There she saw, at the doorway. Félicie and Mela hugging each other. She stayed silent watched the whole endeavor. The girls let go and saw that Mela had her mouth move up and down and then a smile. Félicie hugged her again, but more quickly. She then saw Mérante behind Félicie and then shook Mela's hand firmly, smiling professionally. The girl smiled back and took out a small white hanker chief that contained something inside, and gave it to Félicie, who accepted it. Once more, the girl had her mouth open. With that, the girl gave a quick smile, and before Odette could register, the girl disappeared. \"You know, you should have said goodbye.\" Félicie spoke up, startling Odette. The woman came out of hiding. \"I didn't want to disturb that moment.\" Odette said sheepishly. \"She's a fine young lady.\" Mérante commented. It was true. The girl was intelligent and helped when needed, even if she didn't express her emotions very well, she did smile at the end. \"Here.\" Félicie said, giving the familiar hanker chief to Odette. The woman was curious. What could that girl given her. Félicie took Felicity out of Odette's arms and bounced her up and down, making her gurgle. Félicie and Mérante waited for Odette to open it, very intrigued on what Odette received. Being careful, she unwrapped the object and gasped slightly. Slowly, she took out a small knife and engraved on it was a small word. Thank you. -Mela Everyone stared at in awe. It was a beautiful design. How was she able to make this in under a night. It was impressive to say the least. It was a silver knife and could easily get hurt from it. Every so slightly, Odette settled it on top of the fire place and smiled. It stood there proudly, gleaming in the sunlight. The family gathered around and gave each other comforting hugs. Mela was definitely different, but they realized, everyone is different in their own unique ways. And finally, all of them can admit; Mela was family. No matter what and eventually, they would see each other soon. Yep...next one is the last chapter (An epilogue). I appreciate who stuck around and being patient, but I have found myself, no longer interested in writing these fics. With a heavy heart, I might abandon writing fics for quite some time until I am able to find inspiration. BUT! I have been helping my very good friend, MercyMae (Fanfiction and A03) I've been helping her write a Sherlock fic. So if you enjoy those kinds of Fics, go check them out!

Took one hell of a time but I love it! Please let me k"},{"Movie":"Cursed","Title":"Coeur de loup garou","Author":"Alounet","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5015690","Passage":"[Chapter 1] La première fois que j'ai vu ce film, j'ai était tellement surpris que Bo et Jimmy ne finissent pas ensemble que j'en ai crié au scandae ! Jimmy est clairement le gay de service, Bo lui déclare sa flamme, ensuite ils se sauvent mutuellement la vie, prennent soin l'un de l'autre... Et non, on nous laisse sur un plan avec Jimmy, Bo et Brooke, en nous laissant croire que Jimmy choisira Brooke... Et bien voilà la suite de \"Cursed\" ou comment le coeur de loup garou va se réveiller... Aucun des personnages ne m'appartient, tout est à Wes Craven ! Ceci sera un one shot... Sauf si des reviews me poussent à en faire une suite, on verra ^^ Cœur de Loup Garou Bo et Brooke venaient de ramener Zipper jusque chez Jimmy. Ce dernier, avec sa sœur, venaient tout juste d'affronter Jake, avec qui la malédiction du loup garou avait commencé. Bo ne raconta rien de sa folle nuit en compagnie du jeune homme – qui était loin de le laisser indifférent – à son ex petite-amie. Il lui annonça juste qu'il était préférable pour eux de rester de bons amis et que de plus, Jimmy était sans doute le genre de garçon qui lui conviendrait d'avantage. Les deux jeunes gens avaient eu cette discussion au centre-ville, là même ou ils retrouvèrent Zipper errant dans les rues. La jeune fille le rattrapa assez rapidement, puis demanda à Bo de le ramener jusque chez Jimmy. Le jeune playboy du lycée accepta et lui donna l'adresse, puis proposa de l'y accompagner avec sa belle voiture rouge. Et voilà, Jimmy retrouvait ses deux amis… Les retrouvailles avec Bo étaient… intenses. Après cette étrange nuit, les deux garçons étaient devenus étrangement proche. Parce que Bo lui avait annoncé qu'il était gay – et intéressé par lui – mais aussi qu'ils furent poursuivis par un loup garou qui faillit les mener droit au paradis… Mal à l'aise, les deux garçons finirent par s'enlacer. Cette étreinte signifiait beaucoup pour Bo… Mais pour Jimmy aussi. Durant ces quelques secondes, il savait que cette étreinte était plus qu'amicale. Mais parce qu'il voulait pas se l'avouer, il se retourna sur Brooke. A peine avait-il regardé la jeune fille qu'il l'embrassa fougueusement, comme pour se prouver quelque chose. Le jeune homme regarda sa sœur qui l'autorisa à partir – pour faire le ménage. Jimmy commença à s'éloigner avec Brooke, mais se retourna de suite. - Tu viens ? Bo était resté debout, sans bouger, gêné par la situation. Parce que ça le tiraillait de l'intérieur de voir Brooke – son ex – embrasser Jimmy – le gars dont il était love-dingue. Mais il accepta l'invitation de son ami. Jimmy, lui, le lui proposa naturellement. Parce qu'il avait besoin de Bo. Sans Bo… Il ne préférait pas penser à ce qu'il serait sans le beau-gosse de service. Les trois amis passèrent la soirée dans le centre-ville. La fête foraine était toujours installé, Bo proposa de les y emmener avec sa voiture. - Qu'est-ce qui est arrivé à ta carrosserie ? demanda la jeune fille. - Oh… Un vilain animal, répondit le jeune homme avec un regard complice envers Jimmy. A la fête foraine, Brooke resta plutôt la spectatrice de la nouvelle amitié qui liait les deux garçons. Que ce soit du pour le sport, la musique ou le cinéma, ils semblaient s'entendre sur chaque sujet qu'ils abordaient. Au grand dam de la jeune fille qu'ils délaissaient un peu. Au bout d'une bonne heure, la jeune fille croisa sa sœur aînée près du marchand de glaces. - Excusez-moi les garçons, ma sœur est là, je reviens. Bo et Jimmy la regardèrent s'éloigner, sans plus, puis reprirent leurs discussions sur leur précédent match de lutte dans la salle de gymnastique. - N'empêche que si tu n'avais pas eu cette force de loup-garou, jamais tu ne m'aurais battu, se vantait Bo. - Peut-être, mais on ne le saura jamais, le taquina d'avantage son ami. - Inscris toi dans l'équipe, et on mesure nos forces, d'accord ? Jimmy sourit à cette proposition que Bo ne lui aurait sans doute pas fait quelques jours auparavant. - Mes gênes de loups-garous ont disparus tu sais… Et face à tes copains, je ferais pas le poids bien longtemps. A moins que tu veuilles me rendre visite à l'hôpital ? - Je t'apporterais des fleurs, rassura Bo. - Alors n'oublie pas les chocolats… Les deux garçons furent interrompus par le retour de Brooke. Non loin derrière elle se trouvait sa sœur et quelques unes de ses amies. - Dites les gars… Je suis un peu fatigué, je vais rentrer avec ma sœur, on se voit lundi au lycée ? - D'accord, répondirent-ils en cœur. - Bonne nuit. - A lundi. La jeune fille leur fit un signe de la main et les laissa en tête à tête. Ils la regardèrent partir, puis Bo se retourna vers Jimmy. La question lui brûlait les lèvres et il se devait de savoir. - Tu… Enfin, vous allez vous mettre ensemble alors ? Jimmy baissa les yeux, gêné. Le garçon ne s'attendait pas à se retrouver face à cette situation aussi vite. Mais il le devait. - Je sais pas trop… - Tu l'as embrassé tout à l'heure… - C'était l'émotion, mon cœur de loup garou guéri… - Les loups garous ont un cœur aussi ? Avec cette réflexion, Bo posa sa main sur le torse de Jimmy pour vérifier. Ce dernier le laissa faire. Mais son sang ne fit qu'un tour. Ce contact si direct le bouleversa. - J'ai bien découvert que les brutes dans ton genre en avaient un… répondit-il en souriant, sentant la victoire être sienne. Jimmy s'éloigna souriant jusqu'à un tir à la carabine. Il regarda des personnes essayaient vainement de gagner une peluche. Bo le rejoignit aussi vite et regarda tout comme lui les tentatives désespérées des autres lycéens. - Je chassais avec mon père quand j'étais plus jeune, annonça Bo. Je suis sûr de m'en sortir comme un chef… - Si tu joignais le geste à la parole ? Relevant fièrement le défi, Bo s'approcha du vendeur et lui donna les deux dollars contre un fusil. Il le chargea puis commença à tirer sur les ballons qui flottaient dans les filets. Il n'en loupa pas un seul. Si bien que rapidement, il remporta le plus gros lot, sous le regard amusé et médusé de Jimmy. Le vendeur lui remit sa peluche : un énorme chien noir, à l'air terrifiant. Bo l'afficha fièrement devant son ami. - Regarde… J'ai mon propre loup-garou personnel maintenant. - Tu vas l'appeler Jimmy peut-être ? - C'est une bonne idée ! Les deux garçons allèrent ensuite s'acheter une glace chacun puis se posèrent sur un banc pour profiter tout simplement de l'ambiance. - Ca va sembler bizarre maintenant au lycée qu'on soit potes tous les deux, remarqua Jimmy. - Ca le serait plus si tout le monde découvrait que je suis gay… - Je vis bien avec cette étiquette depuis le collège ! - Je pensais que tu t'en fichais parce qu'en réalité tu étais hétéro ? Jimmy ne sut que répondre à cette question. Lorsque Bo avait déboulé devant sa porte en début de soirée, il était encore chamboulé par sa métamorphose. Les révélations de Bo n'étaient pas venues au bon moment… Si bien qu'il avait préféré s'en débarrasser que de répondre honnêtement à ses questions. Mais maintenant, devait-il vraiment encore lui mentir ? Sachant que plus les minutes défilaient, plus cela lui devenait clair à ses yeux. - Ecoute Bo… Tout à l'heure quand tu es venu et que… Enfin, c'était pas le moment le plus propice à ce genre de situations. Et… Bo ne pouvait s'empêcher de sourire devant le malaise de Jimmy. Le beau gosse savait très bien ou son nouvel ami voulait en venir, et il était préférable de le couper avant qu'il ne s'enfonce dans ses paroles d'avantage. - Tu n'es pas si hétéro que ça en fait… - Ouais… Les deux garçons échangèrent au même moment un regard qui en disait long. Aussi bien sur l'étrangeté de la situation que sur les sentiments qu'ils pouvaient éprouver l'un envers l'autre. Mais le monde autour d'eux les empêchaient de faire quoi que ce soit. - Il se fait tard, remarqua Jimmy. - Je te raccompagne, proposa Bo plus comme un ordre que comme une question. Les deux garçons se dirigèrent jusqu'à la voiture du jeune homme. Avec sa vitesse performante, ils arrivèrent rapidement jusqu'à chez Jimmy. Le long de la route fut plutôt calme. L'un et l'autre ne savaient pas comment réagir en face à face alors ils préféraient tous deux regardaient la route. Jimmy sortit de la voiture, tout comme Bo, qui tenait visiblement à le raccompagner jusqu'à sa porte. - Tu sais personne ne viendra m'attaquer entre ta voiture et ma porte… dit-il amusé. - J'essaye d'être gentil, tu devrais me féliciter, fit remarquer Bo. Jimmy sortit ses clés de maison une fois devant sa porte. Bo était à côté de lui, les mains dans les poches, ne sachant pas s'il devait ou non franchir le pas une nouvelle fois. Lorsqu'il l'avait fait plusieurs heures plus tôt, il s'était pris… un râteau. Jimmy passa sa clé dans la porte et fit face à son ami. - Merci pour… Pour la soirée, pour… Enfin tu comprends… Jimmy se mit à rire quelques peu gêné par la situation lui aussi. Bo afficha son plus beau sourire puis lui fit un petit signe de la main – des plus ridicules – pour lui dire au revoir. Il commença à s'éloigner mais Jimmy l'arrêta… - Bo ! Attends ! Bo se retourna vers son ami. Ce dernier descendait les deux marches du perron et s'approchait doucement du jeune beau gosse. Celui-ci ne put s'empêcher de réprimer son envie. Il avança son visage si près de celui de Jimmy que leurs lèvres se lancèrent dans un ballet fougueux. Un baiser magnifique pour Bo, un premier baiser pour Jimmy. Les deux garçons auraient bien voulu faire durer cet instant éternellement, mais Bo se retira au bout de deux minutes. - On se voit lundi beau gosse ? - Ouais… Jimmy restait là, la bouche ouverte, quelque peu hébété par la situation. Il lui faudrait longtemps avant qu'il ne reprenne ses esprits convenablement. Bo s'éloigna et regagna sa voiture. Après un dernier petit signe de la main, il était repartit sur les routes pour rentrer chez lui. Jimmy reprit ses esprits et rentra chez lui. Son cœur de loup garou était touché. Il était définitivement amoureux. Et en plus, il faisait des rumeurs les plus stupides du lycée… une vérité.[Chapter 2] A mes reviewers, Key, son frère, Sean et Marilou ! Un énorme merci ! Ce couple et cette fiction me porte énormément à cœur, et comme je vous l'avez dit, j'avais bien l'intention d'apporter une suite à \"Cœur de loup garou\" un jour ou l'autre... Il semblerait que ce jour soit arriver et que vous pouvez découvrir Bo et Jimmy une nouvelle fois encore. Les personnages appartiennent à Wes Craven, mais bonne lecture et surtout, un commentaire me fera toujours énormément plaisir ! Je vous embrasse chers lecteurs ! Lundi Matin, c'était le reprise des cours pour Bo. Le jeune homme avait passé la veille enfermer chez lui, dans sa chambre, à dormir et à réfléchir. Les évènements qui venaient de se dérouler, en plus d'être étrange et complètement dingues, avaient de quoi le faire se remettre en question. Pour la première fois de sa vie, il s'était confessé à quelqu'un et avait avoué être attiré par les mecs. Plus que ça, il avait même osé embrasser le garçon en question, à savoir Jimmy, celui qu'il martyrisait depuis des semaines. Si les deux garçons étaient devenus amis, et s'étaient même embrassés, Jimmy songea tout au long du dimanche qu'il serait dur de reprendre le cours de sa vie, au lycée. Comment allait-il se comporter avec Jimmy face à leurs camarades de classe ? Il ne pouvait pas marcher dans le lycée en lui tenant la main. Même lui parler semblerait suspect aux yeux des autres, et surtout, aux yeux de ses amis. En arrivant au lycée à bord de sa belle voiture rouge, Bo n'avait toujours pas trouvé de réponses à ses questions. La seule chose qu'il savait était qu'il était dans la merde. Il avait plus que tout envie de revoir Jimmy. Le voir sourire. Parler avec lui comme ils l'avaient fait à la fête foraine. Être en intimité avec lui. Mais il craignait plus que tout que quelqu'un puisse remarquer quoi que ce soit. -Tu m'écoutes mec ? -Quoi ? Bo venait de refermer son casier, après avoir récupérer ses livres de cours, et il faisait maintenant face à trois de ses copains. Celui qui venait de lui parler, Bryan, était la brute épaisse qui suivait toujours Bo dans ses coups fourrés d'ordinaire. Et surtout, un véritable homophobe. -On va se prendre quelques bières ce soir, tu viens avec nous ? -Je sais pas trop, répondit-il vaguement. Bryan regarda un peu plus loin dans le couloir et il vit Brooke en train de discuter avec l'une de ses copines. Bryan se mit à rire, suivit de ses deux copains, et chambra Bo : -Okay, tu préfères emmener la petite Brooke dans ta chambre et t'occuper d'elle à ta manière ? Les deux autres mecs se mirent à rire bêtement, ce qui pour la première fois, agaça Bo. -Arrête tes conneries Bryan. Bo poussa légèrement son camarade et avança dans le couloir, sous l'œil médusé de son pote. Il rejoignit Brooke, tandis qu'elle prenait congé de sa copine. -Brooke, comment tu vas ? -Bien et toi ? Votre soirée s'est bien terminée ? demanda la jeune fille, une once de jalousie dans la voix. -Ouais, c'était cool. T'as pas vu Jimmy par hasard ? -Pas encore, répondit-elle en avançant avec lui vers leur salle de classe. Mais c'est chouette que vous soyez amis maintenant. -Ouais. Enfin, en dehors, pourquoi pas. Jimmy est un mec cool. Mais ici, mes potes n'arriveraient pas trop à comprendre que je sois ami avec lui. Tu comprends ? Brooke s'arrêta devant la classe. -Non. Je ne comprends pas. Tu peux être ami avec lui en dehors mais pas au lycée ? Qu'est-ce que tu t'en fiches de ce que tes amis pensent ? Tu fais ce que tu veux non ? -Brooke, comme si tu ne savais pas comment ça marche ici. On est au lycée. Les deux jeunes gens furent interrompus par l'arrivée de Jimmy. Le jeune homme venait de courir pour ne pas être en retard et en arrivant devant la salle, trébucha et laissa tomber un de ses livres de cours. Brooke se baissa pour l'aider à le ramasser tandis que Bryan et ses deux copains, qui venaient d'arriver, se moquer complètement du jeune brun. -Alors tarlouze, on a du mal à marcher ? Pourtant tu ne porte pas tes hauts talons aujourd'hui ? Bryan tapota l'épaule de Bo pour l'encourager à rire avec lui. Gêné, Bo essaya de sourire pour faire bonne impression et jeta un rapide coup d'œil à Jimmy qui se relevait sans rien dire. Les garçons entrèrent dans la classe, laissant Brooke et Jimmy devant la salle. Le jeune garçon avait du mal à comprendre l'attitude de Bo. Il lui semblait qu'il était redevenu pareil à la semaine précédente. Devant son air incrédule, Brooke s'empressa de lui raconter la conversation qu'elle venait d'avoir avec lui. -Dire que je pensais qu'il valait mieux que ça. En fait, il est comme tous les autres, ajouta la jeune fille en entrant dans la classe. -Dis pas ça. Je peux le comprendre, il a mis toute une vie à bâtir la réputation qu'il a. Et ce sont ses potes depuis toujours. Les deux adolescents venaient de s'asseoir dans la classe tandis que le professeur entrait à son tour. -Ca alors, tu arrive encore à le défendre malgré tout ? -Brooke, lança Bryan à l'attention de la jeune fille, méfie toi du petit pédé, il pourrait te refiler une maladie ou un truc dans le genre. Plusieurs personnes ricanèrent. Jimmy en profita pour croiser le regard de Bo. Ce dernier ne riait pas, il baissa les yeux gênés, incapable de dire quoi que ce soit. -Et toi Bryan, quelle maladie tu pourrais refiler à tes potes vu ta débilité profonde ? -Hey mec, dit-il à l'attention de Bo, tu devrais calmer ta copine si tu ne veux pas que je m'énerve un peu trop... Bo, au dépourvu, tenta de répliquer quelque chose mais il fut fort heureusement sauvé par le professeur qui demandait le silence dans la classe afin de commencer son cours. A l'heure du déjeuner, Brooke rejoignit quelques unes de ses copines tandis que Jimmy se rendait aux toilettes avant de passer à la cafétéria. Bo qui le suivait du regard, décida de le rejoindre, après avoir vérifié qu'il n'y aurait personne dans les toilettes des garçons. Jimmy sortit de la cabine pour se laver les mains au lavabo lorsqu'il se retrouva face à face avec le beau brun du lycée. Le plus timide des deux ne dit rien et alluma le robinet pour se laver les mains. Mal à l'aise, Bo tenta une approche : -Qu'est-ce qu'il est lourd ce prof tu ne trouve pas ? Il nous prend parfois pour des illettrés. Jimmy n'eut aucune réaction. Il referma le robinet, passa devant Bo et se frotta les mains. Le beau gosse l'attrapa par le bras pour l'obliger à le regarder: -Jimmy, tu ne vas pas me faire la gueule non ? -Bien sûr que non. J'essaye juste de respecter tes souhaits. On est au lycée, et au lycée, quelqu'un pourrait nous voir en train de discuter non ? -Brooke t'a parlé... -On s'en fiche de ce qu'elle m'a dit. Ecoute Bo, je peux comprendre que tu sois mal à l'aise à l'idée qu'on puisse te voir me parler et... -Je suis désolé pour Bryan, vraiment. Bo tenait maintenant la main de Jimmy et le regardait avec des yeux qui n'exprimaient qu'une chose : sa sincérité. -Je suis désolé mais je ne peux pas me mettre à te défendre tout à coup. -Je m'en fiche que des mecs comme Bryan se foutent de ma gueule ou tentent de me pourrir la vie. Ce qui me fait chier c'est qu'un mec comme toi puisse cautionner ce genre de choses. -Bryan est mon pote. -Et je ne suis que le pauvre looser que tout le monde traite de taffiole, je sais. Jimmy ramassa son sac, le mit sur ses épaules, dégagea son bras de la main de Bo et s'avança vers la porte pour sortir. -On peut se voir ce soir ? Avant de sortir, Jimmy se retourna pour répondre: -Je sais pas. L'adolescent quitta les toilettes laissant le garçon le plus populaire du lycée, seul, avec ses pensées. Jimmy passa le déjeuner seul dans l'herbe de la cour en train de bouquiner une bande dessinée tandis que Bo resta avec ses amis, à rire de blagues débiles et à embêter les plus faibles du lycée. L'après midi, tout le monde se retrouva dans le gymnase pour le cours de sport, puis chacun retourna à ses activités. Jimmy se dépêcha de se rendre dans les locaux du journal du lycée, dans lequel il travaillait en s'occupant de quelques rubriques. Il fut surpris d'y retrouver Bo, en train de discuter avec la rédactrice en chef du journal. La jeune fille, Quinn, interpella Jimmy. -Jimmy tu tombe bien, j'aurais besoin de ton article sur le septième art assez rapidement. -Bien sur, je te le donne d'ici une heure. -Parfait. Au fait, Bo va s'occuper de la rubrique Sport. Jason ne souhaite plus s'en occuper, il a rejoint un nouveau club donc le poste étant vacant, j'ai décidé de le proposer aux sportifs du lycée et Bo a gentiment accepté de nous aider. -Génial, répondit faussement enthousiaste Jimmy. -Tu pourrais me rendre un service et lui expliquer un peu ce que chacun fait ici et lui montrer le logiciel de mise en page et l'emploi du temps de la publication ? Gêné et mal à l'aise, Jimmy balbutia et la jeune blonde prit cela pour un oui. Elle s'éclipsa rapidement en sautillant, laissant les deux adolescents face à face. -T'as demandé l'accord à tes potes avant d'accepter de travailler avec les loosers ? -Je lui ai dit que ça me permettrait de remonter mes notes de littérature, et que j'en avais besoin pour décrocher une bourse. -Il t'a cru ? Jimmy se mit à sourire. Non seulement les parents de Bo étaient riches, donc, il n'avait aucunement besoin d'une bourse et de plus, ce n'est pas avec la rubrique sport qu'il remonterait ses notes de littérature. -Bryan est intimidant mais plutôt stupide. Les deux garçons avancèrent jusqu'à l'ordinateur qui se trouvait au fond de la salle, loin de regards. -J'aime bien te voir sourire. Jimmy arrêta de sourire aussitôt et prit place sur la chaise à côté du beau brun. -En fait, avoua Bo, je m'en fiche un peu de la rubrique sport. Si j'ai accepté c'était parce que... j'avais envie de passer du temps avec toi... -Pourtant on est pas ensemble ? fit remarquer Jimmy. On n'est même pas amis... -Tu as vraiment besoin que tout le monde sache qui sont tes amis ? Moi non, répondit aussitôt le brun. -Bo, murmura Jimmy pour éviter que qui que ce soit ne les écoute, tout ce qui s'est passé dernièrement, c'était de la folie. Les loups garous, toi, la fête foraine, notre... baiser. Je pense qu'il est temps qu'on revienne à la réalité, à notre vie. Tu ne crois pas ? Bo regarda son ami les yeux écarquillés, la bouche entre ouverte. Il cherchait quelque chose à lui répondre. Il posa sa main sur la poitrine de Jimmy. Il essaya d'écouter les battements du cœur du jeune garçon. -J'ai lu sur internet que les loups garous n'avaient pas de cœurs, mais c'est faux. Toi tu en as un. -Je ne suis plus un loup garou, répondit Jimmy en souriant. -Pourquoi c'est si compliqué ? Bo posa sa main sur la jambe de Jimmy. Il se mordait les lèvres afin de réprimer l'envie qu'il avait d'embrasser son \"ami\" juste à côté. -Parce qu'il y aura toujours un Bryan pour nous rappeler qu'on est pas du même monde. Tu es un mec populaire, moi, je ne suis qu'un looser. Jimmy enleva la main de Bo de sa jambe et positionna son attention sur l'écran de l'ordinateur. -C'est moi le looser, répondit Bo les larmes aux yeux. Je n'ai même pas le courage de faire face à la réalité. Je ne suis qu'un lâche. Bo se leva précipitamment, laissant sa chaise tomber à la renverse et s'empressa de quitter la salle. Agacé par ce qu'il venait d'entendre, Jimmy se leva à son tour pour partir à sa suite. L'ancien loup-garou rattrapa le brun dans l'un des couloirs. Il attrapa la main de Bo et l'obligea à entrer dans une salle de classe vide. -Tu sais que par moment t'es vraiment stupide ? Comment tu peux dire que t'es un lâche après ce que tu as fait ce week end ? Tu as mis ta vie en danger pour essayer de me sauver. Tu étais prêt à te battre avec un monstre pour moi. C'est ça être un lâche ? -Je... -Tu as vu ce qu'est ma vie dans ce bahut parce que tout le monde pense que je suis gay ? L'enfer que je vis ? Je tiens trop à toi pour te laisser vivre ce que j'ai vécu, d'accord ? Alors peu importe ce que je pense de toi ou ce que je crois ressentir, on doit l'oublier... -Jimmy, ce n'est pas juste... -C'est pour toi que je fais ça, pas pour moi. Si quelqu'un vient à découvrir qu'on est amis, ça sera l'enfer pour toi. -T'as tord. L'enfer ça le sera si on découvre que t'es mon mec. Bo posa ses lèvres délicatement sur celles de Jimmy. Ce dernier ne se recula pas. Il ne s'opposa absolument pas à ce deuxième baiser échangé avec le beau gosse au cœur tendre. Les deux adolescents firent danser leurs langues ensemble quelques instants avant que Bo ne s'éloigne et ne murmure : -Si j'ai su affronter un loup garou, c'est pas des petits cons qui vont me faire peur. -Personne n'a besoin d'être au courant, répondit Jimmy. A nous de faire attention. -Okay mon petit loup. Bo embrassa furtivement son petit-ami avant de le prendre dans ses bras. -C'est toi qui fait la loi dans ce lycée après tout. -T'as raison, répondit Bo en se dégageant de l'étreinte avec Jimmy. Les deux garçons regagnèrent la salle du journal de l'école. Et alors qu'ils marchaient côte à côté dans le couloir, certains regards s'attardaient sur eux, tout en s'étonnant que le beau gosse populaire du lycée puisse discuter et rire des plaisanteries du looser par excellence.[Chapter 3] Merci Key pour cette nouvelle review rapide et chaleureuse ! Petit plaisir pour toi, un troisième chapitre ! A priori concernant cette fiction, ça sera le dernier... Mais qui sait ! Bonne lecture (attention, il y a une petite scène assez violente...) Bo était en train de ranger ses affaires dans son casier. Il était heureux que la semaine se termine, elle avait été éprouvante mine de rien. Le brun ouvrit l'un de ses livres et regarda la série de quatre photos prises dans le photomaton de la foire l'avant veille, avec Jimmy. Il souriait bêtement en regardant les grimaces faites par les deux garçons sur les photos. Il remit les clichés dans son livre lorsque Bryan arriva à ses côtés, accompagnés des deux mêmes camarades, et qu'il referma violemment le casier de Bo. -Dis moi Bo, je peux savoir à quoi tu joues ? Bo mit son sac à dos sur les épaules et essaya de regarder Bryan d'un air innocent. -Je ne vois pas de quoi tu parles... -Joue pas au plus con avec moi, l'arrêta Bryan par le bras. Depuis une semaine tu t'affiches avec l'autre pédale de service et tu ne vois pas de quoi je parle ? -Jimmy ? Je travaille avec lui pour le journal du lycée. Cherche pas plus loin. -Pourtant t'as l'air de bien te marrer avec lui, non ? Me dis pas qu'il t'a contaminé et que toi aussi t'es devenu une petite folle comme lui ? Bo se mit à rire nerveusement et ajouta: -Ou tu vas chercher des conneries pareilles ? Je suis pas pédé, okay ? -Alors t'es avec nous pour la petite blague de demain soir ? -Quelle blague ? demanda Bo légèrement inquiet. Un autre des gars prit à son tour la parole, fièrement: -C'est Bryan qui en a eu l'idée. Demain soir, au centre commercial, tu vas lui faire croire que tu craques pour cet idiot, tu le fais se déshabiller, tu lui pique ces fringues et hop, le petit pédé se retrouve nu devant tout le monde. Bo souffla tout en avançant et répondit : -Sérieusement les mecs, il est hors de question que je joue les pédales, okay ? Bryan s'interposa une nouvelle fois face à Bo. -C'est de jouer les pédales qui te pose problème ou c'est qu'on touche à ton petit protégé chéri ? -C'est rien du tout, je dois aller en cours. Bo s'en alla, laissant les trois garçons seuls avec leurs idées débiles. Le brun s'empressa de retrouver Jimmy, alors qu'il discutait avec Brooke. -Je te l'emprunte une seconde, un truc à voir pour le journal. Bo tira sur les lanières du sac de Jimmy et l'entraîna à sa suite dans les toilettes des garçons. Jimmy se mit à rire : -Petit rendez-vous secret ? -Non, répondit inquiet Bo. Ce dernier regarda bien autour de lui pour vérifier que personne ne se trouvait dans les toilettes et annonça à Jimmy ce que Bryan venait de lui dire. Jimmy demanda : -Qu'est-ce que ça peut nous foutre ? On ira pas au centre commercial demain, voilà tout. -Tu me le promets ? s'inquiéta Bo. -Est-ce moi ou le grand Bo Andersen serait en train de s'inquiéter pour moi ? Bo se mit à sourire timidement avant d'embrasser furtivement son petit-ami. -Je t'appelle plus tard. Fais attention à toi. -C'est promis. La journée se terminait par le cours de sport. Tandis que Jimmy était dans les douches, Bryan et ses comparses, dans les vestiaires, s'affairaient déjà à une nouvelle blague stupide. Lorsque Jimmy sortit des douches, il ne trouva nulle trace de ses vêtements. Il regarda Bryan et ses copains qui étaient en train de se marrer comme des abrutis. Bo entra à son tour dans les vestiaires après avoir aidé le professeur à ranger ses affaires et assista à la scène : -C'est toi qui a prit mes vêtements ? demanda Jimmy à Bryan. Ce dernier se leva d'un air menaçant. -Je rêve ou la pédale vient de me parler ? -La pédale elle t'emmerde Bryan ! -Qu'est-ce que tu viens de me dire ? Bryan venait de repousser violemment Jimmy, qui ne portait qu'une simple serviette, contre le mur. Le sang de Bo ne fit qu'un tour et il s'interposa entre les deux garçons : -Putain Bryan, tu fais chier, rend lui ses affaires okay ? -Qu'est-ce que tu me cherche aussi toi petite frappe ? Tu te mets à défendre les pédales maintenant ? Bo était en train de soutenir le regard de la grosse brute du lycée. Jimmy regarda la scène, tétanisé, ne sachant pas ce qui allait se passer : -Qu'est-ce que ça peut te faire qu'il soit gay ou pas ? Bryan regarda Bo avec dégoût et fureur. Le brun récupéra les fringues de Jimmy et les lui rendit. Bryan attrapa Bo par le bras pour lui faire face : -Tu sais quoi, ce n'est pas parce qu'on a été potes et que ton père est pleins aux as que je vais te laisser faire n'importe quoi ici, d'accord ? -Laisse tomber Bryan. Bo attrapa sa serviette et se dirigea dans les douches tandis que Jimmy s'habillait avec les vêtements qu'il venait de récupérer. Bryan cracha par terre et intima l'ordre à ses comparses de sortir des vestiaires. Les autres garçons reprirent leurs activités. Le vestiaire était maintenant vide. Bo sortit des douches, sa serviette autour de la taille, et retrouva Jimmy, habillé, qui semblait l'attendre. -Ils ne vont pas te laisser tranquille. -Je sais, répondit vaguement Bo en ouvrant son sac pour sortir ses vêtements. -Merci. -Y'a pas à me remercier. T'es mon mec, c'est normal que je prenne ta défense. Jimmy sourit et se leva du banc. Il passa près de Bo et lui caressa le dos. Le brun se retourna et arrêta Jimmy. -Pas ici. Je peux venir chez toi ce soir ? -Bien sûr, tu n'as même pas à demander. -Okay, je te rejoindrais alors. -A tout à l'heure. Jimmy prit son sac pour partir mais Bo, après avoir vérifié que personne ne se trouvait dans les vestiaires, attrapa Jimmy pour l'embrasser. Il le délivra et le laissa partir. Plus tard dans l'après midi, Bo se dirigeait sur le parking pour récupérer sa voiture. Alors qu'il sortait ses clefs de sa poche, Bryan et ses potes arrivèrent derrière lui et l'attrapèrent. Bryan le bouscula violemment. -T'es malade ? Tu veux que je te défonce ? menaça Bo. -Je vois pas comment une tapette arriverait à me faire quoi que ce soit, rétorqua Bryan énervé. -Arrête de me traiter de tapette ou bien... Bryan afficha alors la série de photos prise au photomaton deux jours auparavant sous les yeux de Bo. Le visage de ce dernier se décomposa. Il lui fallut quelques secondes avant de crier : -Putain de merde, t'es allé fouiller dans mon casier ? Bo tenta de récupérer les photos, mais Bryan recula tout en se foutant de la gueule du brun. -Tu vas pas nier que tu te tapes l'autre pédale maintenant ? -Rends moi ces photos, menaça Bo. -Attrapez le les gars, je pense que notre ami a besoin d'une petite correction pour rentrer dans le droit chemin. Les deux amis de Bryan attrapèrent le beau gosse par un bras de chaque côté. Bo essaya de se défendre et de se dégager du mieux qu'il le pouvait, mais les deux autres le maintenaient forts. Bryan s'approcha alors et commença à rouer le brun de coups. Des coups de poings dans le ventre, puis lorsque Bo se retrouva au sol, quelques coups de pieds dans les côtes et un autre en pleine face. Bryan lui cracha dessus avant de balancer les photos du photomaton et de partir en courant et en riant avec ses potes. Allongé sur le sol, Bo se mit à pleurer comme un simple enfant. Il évacuait toute la colère qu'il avait et l'impuissance face à cette situation. Il rampa jusqu'à l'endroit ou la photo était retombé et, en la regardant, il se mit à sourire. Jimmy était dans sa cuisine en train de préparer un repas pour Bo lorsqu'il arriverait. Sa sœur était partie passer la soirée dehors avec des amis. Il devait être 19 heures lorsqu'on sonna à la porte. Le jeune adolescent s'empressa d'aller ouvrir la porte, sachant qu'il ferait face à son petit-ami, mais ce qu'il vit lui fit perdre tout sourire. Bo, le visage ensanglanté, les vêtements salis, se tenait contre la porte, difficilement. Son visage indiquait clairement qu'il souffrait. -Bo ! Qu'est-ce qui t'es arrivé ? Jimmy se précipita de le faire entrer et de l'aider à marcher. Il conduisit son copain jusqu'au salon et le laissa s'asseoir dans le fauteuil. Bo émit une grimace éprouvant ainsi toute la douleur physique qu'il ressentait. -Blessures de guerres... murmura le brun. Jimmy se leva, énervé, prêt à frapper n'importe qui viendrait se poser devant lui pour le contrarier : -C'est Bryan et ses copains, j'en suis sûr. Bo, il faut que tu ailles à l'hôpital et que tu portes plainte. -Non ! protesta Bo. -Mais... -Si je porte plainte je devrais expliquer la raison à mes parents et... Je n'ai pas envie de les mettre au courant pour le moment. -Mais, tu ne vas pas les laisser s'en tirer comme ça... Jimmy venait de s'asseoir à côté de lui dans le fauteuil, les larmes aux yeux. Bo avait lui aussi envie de pleurer, mais pour une toute autre raison. -Tu sais, quand... Quand je me suis retrouvé au sol après qu'ils m'aient frappé... J'ai repensé aux nombres de fois ou je me moquais de toi parce que tu étais gay et que... Bo pleurait maintenant, les larmes coulant le long de son visage. -Bo... -Non, tais toi. Je suis tellement désolé Jimmy. Comment tu peux avoir envie d'être avec moi après les semaines que j'ai passé à me moquer de toi et à t'emmerder ? -Parce que je sais pourquoi tu faisais ça. Parce que... -Je me sens tellement con... Bo frottait ses yeux avec ses mains ensanglantés et Jimmy lui dit : -Chut, ne pleure pas. Jimmy le serra contre lui et lui embrassa le front. -Je vais chercher la trousse à pharmacie et je vais te soigner d'accord ? Jimmy prit le visage de Bo dans ses mains et le regarda les yeux dans les yeux. A cet instant précis, il voyait l'amour que pouvait ressentir le brun à son égard, et ça lui remplissait tellement son petit cœur de loup garou. -Avant, j'avais l'impression de ne pas être normal parce que... Parce que des gars comme Bryan me faisaient penser ça mais... -Tu es tout aussi normal que n'importe qui, d'accord ? Bo essaya de sourire à son petit-ami et soudain, son odorat fut titiller par la bonne odeur qui venait de la cuisine. -Tu... Tu as préparé à manger ? -Pas grand chose, je voulais juste... Te faire plaisir... Bouge pas, je reviens. Jimmy s'éclipsa du salon quelques minutes pour revenir presque aussitôt, la trousse à pharmacie en main. Il en sorti les pansements et le désinfectant et s'exécuta rapidement à prendre soin de son \"patient\". -Attention ça va piquer. Bo émit une légère grimace mais se laissa soigner. Une dizaine de minutes plus tard, Jimmy rangeait la trousse à pharmacie et s'allongeait dans le fauteuil à côté de Bo. Les deux garçons fermèrent les yeux et restèrent ainsi, l'un contre l'autre, profitant de la chaleur de leurs corps respectifs. -Malgré tout, j'ai passé la plus belle semaine de ma vie avec toi... Quand je suis avec toi, je me sens... Moi même... Libre... Prêt à faire n'importe quoi...Je me sens... -Amoureux ? -C'est ça... -Moi aussi, je me sens amoureux... -Je me mets à parler comme une fille... Je déteste les effusions de sentiments... -Alors ne disons rien et profitons juste d'être ensemble. -Okay. Bo passa son bras sur le torse de Jimmy et posa sa tête contre son épaule.

She looks up, not at the sea of faces but searches for one face, one pair of eyes, soft brown that never failed to light with humor and freckled gold when they saw her or the sun – The chair is empty. The music does not wait. Her body moves on cue and now she is Clara, waiting for the Christmas party to begin and for the gifts to be given. She accepts the Nutcracker with awe and love, her emotions beaming through her movements. This time, the heartbreak she echoes when the toy is broken is easier to portray. This is not her first opening night. This is not her first time as Clara. This is not the first time he does not come. This is not the first time he promised, either. The children go to sleep and Clara is left alone on the stage, tending to the broken toy. The clock strikes twelve, and – \"Fire!\" a woman runs in, screaming, \"Fire!\" Clara frowns. Fire? No, the mice are about to enter – \"Fire! Get to the exit doors, quickly!\" shouts a man, a dark shape against the flutter of fancy dresses and pales faces. \"Odette! Leave the stage, now!\" Auguste? But – The smell suddenly hits her – smoke and charred wood that bite her throat – she is choking – \"Odette!\" The tapestry behind her bursts into flames that flare and consume the ropes behind the scenes. She covers her face and tries desperately to breathe. Be the mistress of your dizziness, her mind whispers, focus on one spot. But the world is spinning and the grandfather clock, the one that struck midnight, collapses on her leg. Her left leg. Her leap leg. How will she dance? \"Help me…\" she whispers, trying – frantically, digging till her fingers bleed – to tear the heavy piece of burning wood from her body. The pain and panic beat rhythmically in her ears. Help me. The fire roars around her and the smoke – her vision blurs and her heart beats so loudly – can they not hear her? Will no one come to help? Help me, Lou, help me. Help me! She can't breathe. Her lungs are on fire but she cannot breathe. And the clock won't move not an inch not even less and she is trapped. She is trapped and she wasn't given a chance to see him, one last time. She is trapped. \"Odette!\" \"Odette!\" Odette woke up, shivering. Pain spasmed from her leg, tearing into her stomach and her spine. Her skin was wet and clammy, but her voice was steady when she replied, \"Yes, Madame Le Haut?\" The woman knocking on her front door was not appeased by the polite reply. \"The cook has decided she's sick, again. Go to the kitchen, now!\" A pause. The shadow on the wall was thinking. \"After you had cooked breakfast and tended to your usual duties, do find the time to sack the lazy pig and find a… less damaged cook, if you will.\" She scoffed to herself. \"One might think I am running a charity, employing a limping housemaid and a sickly cook!\" \"Yes, Madame,\" Odette responded, voice quiet and dutiful. That was what she had become, a quiet and dutiful cleaner. She worked her leg slowly, patiently, trying to massage the pain from the ankle that never fully healed. \"Yes, madame,\" she whispered to the empty room. She slowly curled on herself, stretching and touching her forehead to the broken bone. Her lips. \"Yes.\" Her lips formed the words with ease. Almost an instinct, after ten years. \"Madame.\" Cleaning Le Haut's mansion, despite what the Madame might have thought, was a mental challenge rather than physical. Cleaning the Opera, on the other hand, was both. Odette braced herself against the cold autumn wind and entered the grand building. A few ballerinas still graced the entrance, but the older ones ignored her, and the younger moved away, sometimes while suppressing a giggle. Not out of respect, obviously. A cleaner works with dirty items, thereby becoming dirty herself. One could not remove stains without becoming a stain herself. The poor children were tolerable, but they were rare. The rest were wealthy, and if they cared to dignify her with a glance, it was usually a haughty one. I hate kids. \"Odette! Yo-hoo! How wonderful to see you!\" A singing, booming voice and a coat that could not be ignored. Perfect. \"Director,\" she muttered. \"Good evening. How are the rehearsals?\" Auguste's smile did not waver. He wrapped his hand around her shoulder and stirred her, while still humming and smiling, toward his office. \"Fantastic! Lovely! Couldn't be better! Rosita is a sight to behold!\" he sang as he closed the door and gestured toward a grand chair. \"Do sit, my dear!\" Odette clutched her cane and stood taller. \"I have work to do, Monsieur, and little time to spare. What is it?\" Auguste's eyes flickered. The expression resembled pity. Odette looked away. \"You can still call me Auguste, Odette.\" He smiled. For such a large man, his smile was uncommonly kind. \"I know. You told me before.\" Her voice was flat. Her eyes focused on the floor. If she closed them and stood very still, perhaps she could hear the music coming from the stage. If she closed her eyes strongly enough, perhaps she could wish this entire life away. He released a huff of air that could have been mistaken for a laugh. \"I know you know. I asked you one hundred times already, and I will ask you one hundred times more. I am not giving up on you, Odette.\" Her fingers tightened their hold of the cane. \"Are we still talking about manners, or about the teaching position? Because my answer isn't going to change to either.\" Her voice was too sharp. Unkind. Auguste, despite his massive form, was a sensitive soul. He flinched. \"Eh, well, both. Louis complained to me again about the workload – \" \"I find that hard to believe.\" \" – and about lost opportunities – \" \"Unlikely.\" \" – like a chance to go to America – \" \"He hates travel.\" Auguste sighed, then smiled. \"You know him better than I do. But he did have to turn down a collaboration with the Russian ballet, recently. His career as a ballet dancer might have ended, but that's not the end of the road, as you well know,\" he hinted, adding an unecessary wink. Her knuckles turned white. \"Auguste, I don't want to have this conversation. We've had it before. The board won't have a sweeper's daughter teaching their genteel spawns.\" Her voice was still flat. Lifeless. \"And they won't have me now, in either case. I spent the last ten years cleaning, not dancing.\" \"Pah!\" Auguste responded eloquently. \"The board will hire a donkey if I dress it in enough velvet. Money does not produce talent, nor nurture it. Only talent nurtures talent, and only talent produces money. You, my dear, are the best money can buy, and a thousand years of sweeping won't change that.\" Odette looked down. It was easier, these days, to look down. Her back was hunched. \"Is that all?\" The man sighed. He gestured, but she did not look at him to see what the movement meant. \"He has been watching you since he was a teen, but I have been watching you from the moment you stepped into these halls.\" He paused. \"That came out wrong. But my point still stands! The ballet is an art of passion – above all else, a dancer is measured by the passion of her heart. I know you still have the heart of a dancer, Odette,\" he reached out to her, touching her shoulder, \"you still come here.\" \"Exactly. The girls already know my face,\" she snapped, her voice like whiplash, \"as a cleaner. Tell Mérante I don't want his help.\" She exited, her movements sharp but graceful. Her pain sucked in – brushed aside – ignored. Forgotten. Gone. Damn Mérante and his meddling. She scrubbed the floors, anger seeping and flaming with every movement. Damn him. Damn him and the opera and Auguste with his silly ideas – Damn everything. She packed her clothes and her scarf and limped down the stairs. Her mind, tired and vacant, suddenly snapped alive when she saw the janitor dragging a child – a young girl, poor and dirty – from the Opera. \"I wasn't stealing!\" the girl begged, \"I was looking at the dancer!\" Her voice was desperate. She was small and skinny and unremarkable, if not for her flaming orange hair. \"Liar! Empty your pockets!\" the Janitor yelled. When the girl struggled, he raised his hand – the threat of violence evident – \"Leave her alone,\" Odette commanded. She hit the stair with her cane for emphasis. The janitor grumbled, but the girl beamed up at her – why? Why bother? Odette sent her away. The Opera was not a place for poor, broken souls. She remembered being young. She remembered how hard her mother worked to afford the yearly tuition. She remembered her promise to her, to earn every penny back and double it. A promise of a life of comfort. Ha, how the gods of fate must be laughing. She left the Opera and walked back to Le Haut's mansion. The night was cold, and the streets were empty, yet one persistent sound did not fade. Footsteps. She was being followed. She turned, far quicker than the thief might have expected a woman with a limp to move, and pressed her cane against a throat. A child's throat. Not exactly what she expected. \"I have nothing to steal,\" she told the girl, the scrawny redhead from before. The child had kind, wide eyes, large and trusting. The light did not fade, even when Odette pushed her cane deeper for emphasis. \"I-I can't sp… I can't speak!\" She struggled and breathed in relief when Odette relented and dropped the cane. \"I just wanted to say thank you for saving me.\" \"You've said it. Have a nice life.\" She limped away from the girl, wishing she could walk faster. Did it matter? The girl was young, after all. She probably could have kept up even if Odette's limp didn't exist. The girl kept talking. Odette kept her answers short. Go away, her body whispered. Leave me. Go home. The girl, apparently, was deaf. \"Are you a dancer?\" \"I'm a cleaner, and you are an irritation. Go away.\" Go away. Go away. Go away. But the girl did not give up. She pouted, \"But you're the first person to show me any kindness in this city. I've been separated from my best friend. I have nowhere to go, and I'm an orphan.\" She looked up from underneath her lashes and curled her lips into a pitiful pout. Odette's lip curled. Another burden. Hadn't she had enough? \"Nice try, but I hate kids, especially orphans. Go find another idiot.\" The girl gasped but followed. She followed even after the Madame showed up with another form of torment. She followed even after Odette told her to go away. Disappear. Leave. And I am so tired. I am so, so tired. \"You need me. I can clean. In fact, 'Squeaky Clean' is my middle name. I'm young. My legs work. Yours don't.\" She paused, realizing she was rude. \"Uh, it's gonna feel so much easier with me helping,\" she added, then gave her what she probably thought to be a winning smile. Odette sank to her knees because standing up hurt. The girl had broken eyes and skinny legs, and under the cheerful demeanor, she hid a trembling lip and a hungry gleam. Dear lord, the girl was hungry. Odette couldn't turn her away. \"Are you coming?\" she asked. The girl smiled – no, beamed, again – and rushed to join her. Despite the cold house and the cold floors and the frozen cold water with which she cleaned, Odette felt – or perhaps imagined – a tinge of warmth. He waited, his hand tightening around his pocket watch. He flicked it open with an irritated frown to find that – yes, she was late. Which was unlikely, so she must have changed her route. Again. So, she probably refused the job offer. Again. And she knew he was waiting for her. And she did not want to see him. That also was nothing new. Louis sighed. He slipped the watch back to his pocket. Should he find her later or leave her be? The woman clearly did not want to be found. At least not by him. His hand tightened its hold of his cane. Perhaps – His eyes caught a flash of red and a white dress as a girl – probably one of his new students – crashed in front of him. As elegant as a drunk dog. Dear lord. \"How's the view from down there?\" he asked, a slight note of taunting in his voice. And yet he crouched to offer her his hand and help her up. \"You're not a dancer, are you?\" he asked. Her hand felt odd – rough skin and dusty texture – but the girl pulled away before he could understand what was so unusual about it. \"Yes, I am,\" she protested, eyes ready for battle. \"Who would've thought? Return to your class,\" he commanded, then rubbed his fingers together as the girl dashed away. Were the cuts and blisters the result of her clumsiness? Or – A loud stomp and boisterous singing announced more trouble was heading his way. \"Oh, greatest ballet master of all time! Oh, most talented choreographer in the universe and beyond! He is handsome! He is elegant! He is strong! He is powerful! He is the man!\" Auguste sang at the top of his lungs. Louis suppressed the desire to sigh. \"You want something from me?\" Tell me it's about Odette. Tell me something good. Tell me what I want to hear. \"How did you know?\" Beamed the singing giant. \"Yes! I have enrolled Camille Le Haut in your class.\" Louis closed his eyes for a brief second, locking his disappointment and anger and frustration deep inside his chest. Great. Another spoiled brat. No doubt the clumsy airhead from before. Once, one had to work hard to enter the academy. Once, owning a restaurant that employed a good cook was not enough. \"Why, thank you,\" he said flatly. He remembered Odette, working night shifts so she could afford – \"You're welcome!\" Auguste glowed right back. \"Oh, and another thing. You remember the ball we are holding? You are showing up, yes?\" He waved his finger too close to Louis' face. \"It's mandatory!\" \"Yes, I will be there,\" he promised, edging away from unwanted digits. \"Fantastic! A lot of lovely ladies will be there, too.\" He winked, then sighed. \"Perhaps it's better you focused your attention on them? Or go to Russia and find a danseuse etoile – \" \"That's enough of you,\" he commanded and hit the cane against the floor. Funny how he could silence a group of eleven-year-old girls and a grown, giant man using the same tool. \"I have class,\" he snarled and turned away. Auguste, wisely, kept his silence. The girls in his class, however, did not. They muttered quickly and quietly, graceful and poised. All but the rich girl, who stood awkwardly with her legs spread apart and spoke loudly, like a baboon at a zoo. She also danced like one – moving and gesturing wildly with no grace or poise or rhythm whatsoever. Her landing was hideous and loud and her legs all but spasmed as she leaped toward the ceiling – as if her limbs were on fire. She spun like a dizzy drunkard and could not balance on her toes. She was a disaster, and her only saving grace – if one could call it grace – was her wild, unadulterated enthusiasm. If only she wouldn't squeal whenever her feet left the ground. Her second class wasn't much better. Louis remembered the first time he saw Odette. He left the boys' classroom, legs aching and toes burning, to see her pirouette. Her grace and poise made the move look effortless, and the swanlike lifting of her hand, rising above her head… she looked like a doll, perfect and preserved in a movement permanently programmed into her form. She was mesmerizing. Then she opened her eyes – the color of the sky on a cloudy day – and stopped. He fled. Miss Le Haut, however, was a violent, clumsy disaster. The Opera endured one fire that demanded too heavy a price. It shouldn't entertain yet another one. Odette's stomach burned when the memory flashed through her eyes – Felicie, dressed in a Ballerina attire, walking around the academy as if she were one of its students. She must have stolen the letter for Camille Le Haut, the Madame's daughter. Stolen the letter and enrolled in her place. And the Madame was not a kind woman. How dare Felicie lie to her, after all she'd given to her? A place to sleep and food and a warm blanket… He also lied, didn't he? He promised he'd be there. He promised they'd go to that new restaurant to celebrate. He promised her flowers. He wasn't there to watch her perform. He wasn't there to watch her burn. To save her. Would he have saved her? I don't need your pity. Go to Russia. Go to America. I don't care. It's been ten years. She stopped chopping the carrot, then continued. The same color as Felicie's hair. That girl… Odette's hold of the knife tightened. Seeing her in that tutu and those shoes… Odette did not relish the memory of the color draining from the child's face and the light fading from her eyes. She looked like she withered under her glance. Odette pushed the guilt away. The child's own shame was the source, not she. How dare she. How dare she lie. How dare she go to the academy and dance, despite the fact she clearly wasn't enrolled. It was hard to push away the memories of herself as a child, wearing the worn cloth of the tutu with pride unaffected by the complaints of the richer girls. It was the best dress she had ever worn, and the smooth, formfitting fabric felt like a luxury. She hated to take it off and return to her own, weathered clothes. Hiding in the training rooms, she waited until they left to change back. And while she waited, she trained. When the girls returned the morning after, she was already a step ahead. Two steps. Three. Until she was alone at her level. Until there was no one else as good as she was. No one else, but Lou. It wasn't long before she wore a costume tailored specifically for her, with jewels and ribbons and fresh flowers. Mother said she looked like a queen. When I needed you, you weren't there. Go away and leave me be. Leave me the Opera and the memories. Don't pity me. The door opened meekly, and her hand faltered. The motion, once smooth, had to be started again. \"I'm sorry. Triple sorry. If there was a bigger word for 'sorry', I'd say it.\" You weren't sorry when you wore the tutu. You weren't sorry when you danced. You weren't sorry when you lied. You are only sorry now because you were found out. She cut the carrot with more force than necessary. For whom was she cutting all these carrots? \"I let you into my life, and you lied to me. I don't like lies.\" Did she use me? The girl looked too innocent for such a complicated plan. But girls grow up. \"I could lose my job because of you,\" she added, trying to quiet the emotional turmoil and make her anger rational. She was just a girl, and she lived with her for two days. She did not matter – how could she? She wasn't different from the rest of the girls at the academy. Except that she wasn't a girl at the academy, was she? Felicie's voice faltered, but she braved through it. \"I get it. I messed up. But you don't understand. Since I can remember, I've wanted to dance. And when I saw Rosita Mauri and she did those amazing moves, I knew that's what I wanted to be. I knew my dream could come true! I know it's hard to understand. You hate dancing.\" The words prickled, delved under her skin. \"But I just want you to know I'm truly sorry.\" The girl closed the door behind her. Odette put the knife down. She looked up, up at the shoe box she did not dare to throw away or open. But suddenly, the urge to look at the shoes – her pointe shoes – the debut shoes that she received as a gift from her mother – she limped toward the box and grabbed it, then breathed in relief and memories and pain when she saw them. The shoes were still there, as red as she remembered. This was not a dream, a part of her whispered. You really were a ballerina. And you don't hate dancing. Holding them in her hands, feeling the familiar weight, she could almost hear Auguste urging her, \"You, my dear, are the best money can buy, and a thousand years of sweeping won't change that.\" And Lou, young and shivering with adrenaline and ecstasy, holding her hands seconds before the curtain rose and opened his mouth to say something that might have been important… The familiar clicking sound that haunted her nightmares knocked her out of her daydreaming. She put the shoes away and rushed to the door. \"Any mail?\" The devil couldn't have sounded more sinister. Odette placed her hand in front of Felicie, urging her to hide the incriminating letter. \"There is no mail,\" she lied. Luckily, Regine Le Haut did not deign it necessary to look upon her servants or the lie would have failed. Very reliable, this plan. Pretending to be the Madam's daughter… how long will it last? A day? A week? This would result in the loss of both her jobs and her home for the past ten years. This was a disaster. This – \"As soon as there is, fetch it,\" the Madame snarled, then entered the house. This, perhaps, was not the worst idea after all. But it could certainly be improved. \"Can you dance?\" she whispered to the child, who appeared ready to bounce up and down in excitement. An instinct she, wisely, chose not to act upon. \"Yes,\" she declared, then faltered. \"At least, I think I can.\" She had large, starry eyes and dreams more grandiose than her scrawny frame. She thought that if she'd jump far enough, she'd reach for the stars. She was a child, and Odette remembered that once, she was one too. She remembered feeling too poor and dirty to enter the Opera. Avoiding looks and dainty dresses, she snuck to the changing rooms, trying to hide her clothes with her thin limbs. She had to be taught to be proud. And the person to teach that her then still believed in her now. He thought she should be a teacher. Perhaps she should. \"Training starts at five am tomorrow,\" she ordered, feeling new life – no, purpose – flowing through her. This was a stupid plan, but maybe, just maybe, it was brazened enough to work. The girl, unaware of her warlike musings, frowned at her. \"Are you a teacher?\" \"Do you have another option?\" she shot back, then returned to her lodging. No, Felicie. I am not a teacher; I am your teacher. If you listen, I will teach you everything I know. Outside, Felicie groaned. \"Five am? Can't we push it to after lunch?\" Author's notes: Hey everyone! So I saw 'Leap' recently and I fell in love with Merandette, so here's my take on it! Hope you like it! It's going to start slow and follow the plot up to chapter 3... and then there's gonna be a twist. That's all I can say! Anyways, hope you liked it! Tell me what'd you think![Chapter 2] Talk to her. Say something. Say anything. Ask her how she feels – maybe about the limp? No, no – bad idea. Don't mention the limp. Talk to her about the new students. About ballet. About your new choreography – no! Another bad idea. What if she hated ballet or the Nutcracker or him? This, Louis agreed with himself, was a new low. He watched Odette from the shadows, struggling with a heavy water bucket she had to lift to the upper floor. He could not take his eyes off of her, waiting for a look, a hint, a trace of a smile, that would allow him to cross the distance to her. Her figure, ever graceful, changed little over the years. A few rebellious strands escaped her bun and framed her face, floating like she used to, all those years ago. She was so beautiful, her sight struck him speechless every single time he saw her; ever since he was a boy. It was only her eyes that had died. Offer her help. Take the bucket – no, no. She does not want your help, remember? You can't help. It's too late to help. Forgive me, Odette. Please forgive me. Ten years had passed. Ten years of love from the shadows and across the seas. Perhaps Auguste was right; perhaps she would never take him back. Perhaps… but still, he should tell her. He should tell her the truth. He should – The bell rang, and Odette disappeared down a hallway. Was it his imagination, or did she stand taller? Louis frowned, tapped his cane, and walked to class. At the very least, he would sack Le Haut, which, all things considered, signaled today was not entirely a waste of time. He entered the class, pleased to see all the girls waiting in the fifth position; less pleased to note that the redhaired nightmare was also positioned in fifth, and her stance was not that different from that of her peers. He scowled. Did she bother with a tutor yesterday? It mattered not. Ballet is an art, and not one that could be mastered in a week. \"Today,\" he declared, \"we jump.\" A pause for dramatics and scrutiny. No girl budged, not even the redhead. Huh. A tutor for ballet and for manners, apparently. \"Start with sauté, then land in fifth, and finish with soubresaut. Positions!\" The ginger chose, of course, the middle. He hit the floor with his cane and the girls, in unison, jumped. All the girls. Jumped and landed in perfect harmony. Luck, he dismissed it. He hit the floor again, and the girls jumped again. And again. And again. And Mademoiselle Le Haut among them, not missing a beat. Her legs were perfectly poised and her hands – not an inch too low or too high. In fact, the only thing that moved unlike the rest of her classmates was her hair, which was unfortunate, but passable. This was impossible. Not a day ago, she clobbered and floundered around his classroom, jumping up and down with the grace of a troll and the discipline of a monkey. But today… He hit the floor again and again and again. Any mediocre student would have shown her fatigue just about now. Maintaining form and grace in a jump was a tiring task that took years to master, and yet… and yet, the infuriating ginger demon smiled, looking ridiculously happy and inexplicably unaware of the impossibility of her actions and the inconvenience she posed. When she landed, her hands were positioned with the slightest of curves – an added touch to a routine technique that changed it from a jump to a dance. He saw that flare before – a swanlike elegance that separated the student from the master, but – no. Impossible. A master refines his technique; this girl simply learned an already improved upon gesture, and nothing more. But how? How could – Finally , his mind flashed. A tremor. One of the girls, a mousy creature with dark brown hair, began to tremble. Not the fiery brat, but close enough. Let's see how much you can progress during the weekend, Le Haut , he thought as he sacked the girl and dismissed the class. His eyes followed her exit, narrowed in suspicion. Who is your tutor, little girl? Well, whoever the tutor was, he had an eye for detail, for the girl passed another day with nearly flawless technique. Her poise improved, her gestures had purpose, and thank god the giggling and random shouting had stopped. She gained confidence, which was odd for a rich child to lack to begin with, and absorbed information like a sponge. Though she still, when she thought he wasn't looking, twisting her lips in a peculiar attempt to parrot terms she should have been raised with. Her French vocabulary was also in a rather lamentable shape. Did the child not receive proper schooling? He caught Nora and Dora, her friends and rather talented dancers, if uninspiring, teaching her more than once about fashion and etiquette, literary heroes and historical figures. Was the girl raised in the country? With each passing day, her resemblance to the street urchins he played with in his youth seemed more and more uncanny. Yet, inexplicably, her landings and her poses had the touch and grace of a danseuse etoile. While the rest of the girls completed a sequence of movements, Camille Le Haut danced. Who, on God's green earth, is your teacher?! He marched to Auguste's office and opened the book of student records, skimming through and trying to find a name – any name – that could be the answer to – \"Louis! How wonderful!\" Louis' fingers twisted in disgruntled irritation. Fantastic. Auguste's booming voice matched his positively barbaric attire which was an assault of purple and gold and emeralds. He licked his pinky and fixed his eyebrow in a move he no doubt thought dashing. \"Are you to be my plus one?\" he winked. \"Plus? Oh – no. Is it today?\" The dread sank in his stomach much like that new naked iron tower sank its claws into the bowels of Paris. \"I… forgot my fancy clothes,\" he offered an excuse. Auguste smiled, undeterred. \"Nonsense! We'll stop at your house to change your coat, your cufflinks, and neck-tie and you'll be ready!\" His enthusiasm, thankfully, was not of the contagious types. \"A lot of lovely ladies cannot wait to meet you, I'm certain.\" He winked again. \"You and Rosita are to be the stars of the ball! Hmm. You must seize your chance before Rudolph is old enough to attend. He is already a ladies' man, though he seemed to have set his eyes on one of your students!\" Auguste clapped. \"Wonderful, isn't it?\" \"Charming,\" Louis bit. \"Which one?\" \"Why, Mademoiselle Camille, of course!\" Auguste laughed and clapped Louis' shoulder, then used the momentum to grab the limb and drag him from the office. \"How is she doing? I thought you'd have sacked her by now.\" \"So did I,\" he muttered, irritated. The tone was, apparently, too subtle for Auguste, who thought the whole fiasco to be terribly funny. They entered Auguste's carriage, colored in similarly bombastic shades of gold and purple, and thus were isolated enough for him to ask, \"Do you know who tutors her?\" The notion, of course, that a student from their academy needed extra help and turned to an independent source was insulting. \"No!\" declared the director, unappreciative of the delicacy of the question. \"Why, is he causing trouble? You are her teacher now,\" he added, looking pleased with himself. \"Ah, I love balls. Don't you? Drinking and dancing… that is life!\" \"Hmm, too round for my taste,\" Louis replied, glaring at the mansions towering over the cobbled street. Perhaps he could pay Le Haut a visit. Parents do love hearing praise about their offspring and could be enticed to share information regarding their schooling. Though it might include an encounter with said child, which was an unfortunate, yet likely, possibility. They stopped in front of his house and had to wait merely a moment before the coachman opened the carriage door while another servant opened the front door and waited for them, bearing drinks. Louis waved the cognac aside and climbed the stairs while Auguste stopped to exchange a few flirtatious remarks with one of the maids. The man had neither shame nor manners, but was quick to down his drink and climb upstairs when he noticed Louis abandoned him. He entered the room with a dramatic gait and immediately began to scavenger his wardrobe. \"Will Madame Le Haut be attending?\" Louis asked as he donned his diamond cufflinks and glowered at Auguste for trying to make him wear his funeral neck-tie. \"Not wealthy enough,\" Auguste dismissed, fixing his mustache. \"And thank the lord for that. The woman is dreadful. Looks like a… ah. A green bat. Or a snake with large, black ears.\" \"Lovely,\" Louis replied, then rolled his eyes at his friend's attempt at pleading, puppy eyes and wore his funeral neck-tie. He wondered if he should buy another for such occasions, but resolved that funerals and balls rarely occur within the same month, and that a black neck-tie was unlikely to draw enough attention for anyone to notice his collection of neck-ties was lacking. He grabbed a hat for his planned escape from the ball. Just in case. \"You should buy more clothes,\" Auguste pointed out. \"A gentleman is only as desirable as his wallet. We must be like a peacock! Advertise our… biological prowess through shiny clothes and a dash of good taste.\" He flexed in front of the mirror. \"Just a dash. We don't want to overdo it.\" Louis allowed himself a smile. \"Don't expect me to stay after the reception.\" \"Don't be such an old man,\" Auguste chastised, once again dragging him into his disaster of a carriage. \"It will be great! There will be food, drinks, women! –\" \"Not my cup of tea.\" \"Well, the last time I invited your cup of tea, she tore the invitation and threw it in my face, so you should find yourself a different cup,\" Auguste grumbled, still offended. \"Or a different tea. How does that expression work?\" Auguste was saved from Louis' growing irritation by their prominent arrival at their destination, upon which he found himself dragged aside by a fabulously dressed woman. It took him two seconds to recognize her as Rosita. \"You could have at least allowed me a glass of champagne,\" he complained, then intertwined his hand through hers. \"To what do I owe the pleasure?\" \"Oh, how can you already be in a foul mood?\" The young woman frowned at him, then plucked a glass of the bubbling, golden liquid from a passing servant. \"You are late.\" \"Auguste forced me to change my clothes.\" \"To your funeral neck-tie?\" Louis grimaced. \"Thought it would go unnoticed.\" To the woman's giggle, he replied, \"I don't remember we have attended a funeral together.\" \"I wasn't yet a danseuse etoile. You, however, were the guest of honor.\" She led him around the ball, avoiding the clucking circles of rich women and the smaller circles of the richer still. \"One would assume the dead is the guest of honor.\" Rosita hummed. \"Do you think they have to RSVP?\" Louis managed a smile. \"Indeed. Most unfortunate if they are late.\" Rosita was not to be distracted. \"Like you were,\" she pointed out. \"I had to greet the guests.\" \"You would've had to do so regardless of my presence,\" he countered. Rosita sent a graceful reproach his way. \"Not by myself.\" Louis finished his glass. \"Were you the victim of unwanted attention?\" \"Must you ask?\" she replied, then gracefully replaced his empty glass with a new one. \"You are not the only one to prefer the stage to the crowd.\" \"We don't belong in a crowd,\" he murmured, then stopped. \"Especially that of predators.\" Rosita distanced herself from him. \"The director described them as an opportunity.\" Her eyes swept over the mess of fabulous dresses and black coats. \"Doesn't that make us alike?\" \"They are vultures,\" Louis scoffed. \"They believe value stems from wealth and wealth results in power, and power must be worshipped. They bow before the most common of commodities if they find enough of it, which they hoard or trade for empty gestures or temples of vanity. Talent is far rarer. Talent should be worshipped. A person of talent should not be scrubbing the floors for the pleasure of vultures and their peacocked shoes,\" he spat. His hands tightened their hold on his cane, muscles tensing as if in preparation of an attack. Rosita took a step back. \"Louis?\" she hesitated. \"Are you…?\" Louis closed his eyes. He lost control of his temper. Only fools ramble in time of rage. Only fools… and aren't we all fools in love? He felt cold. \"Forgive me,\" he muttered, then turned his back and crossed through the crowd. He could feel their eyes on him, measuring the cut of the diamonds and the wealth of the fabric and the shine upon his shoes. Measuring to see if he was wealthy enough to be worthy of their time. Auguste waved him over, \"Louis! Come over, meet – \" \"I need a drink,\" he snapped, \"You are holding a glass of champagne,\" Auguste pointed out. Louis, with the flamboyance of a dancer, abandoned the glass on a nearby table and marched over to Auguste's carriage. He closed the door behind him. \"Drive to the nearest bar.\" \"Any preference?\" asked the coachman. Louis rubbed his temples. \"Anywhere with music.\" Odette looked at the child dance and felt her heart brimming with warmth. That was Felicie's magic. Not technique or skill, but love. She loved to dance, and one could not help but fall in love with the art and the fiery child as she dominated the stage. Or, in this case, the backyard. \"That was... better!\" she encouraged her. When did I last feel so alive? When did I feel so happy, so at peace? She felt no jealousy. Not this time. Watching Felicie dance felt like the only thing worth living for. \"Thanks!\" The girl smiled. \"I'm ready to do that crazy, jumpy thing.\" Odette laughed. \"And I'm the Empress Josephine.\" You sweet thing. Sweet, bird of joy. How aptly named. Don't fly too close to the sun, child. \"I am!\" the girl declared. Her eyes lit with stars again, as if she remembered the first time she saw the move performed. The only time. \"Of course, you are. But there's a difference between being ready and being ready to do it well.\" Move slowly, child. Don't rush. Those who rush ahead are burnt by the flame. \"That's why we train every day,\" she reminded her. \"That's all we've been doing!\" Felicie complained. \"And then you'll be ready when you can answer the question, \"Why do you dance?\" She said it with such ease, now, as if the question hadn't tormented her for months. Days and nights she tried to come up with an answer and each time, the director wasn't satisfied. Time and time again he sent her away, telling her to return only when she had an answer worthy of his time. It's my life , she finally told him. It's not why I live or what makes me happy. It's… the only times I am alive, is when I dance. And after she found the answer and she danced and she burned, she died. Then she had to answer the question, \"what should I live for, if I cannot dance?\" That question was harder to answer. It had been ten years, and she had yet to find one. Though Perhaps… Felicie's eyes looked ahead, toward the sun and the future. \"I've answered it! It's my dream!\" She rose and she jumped. For a moment she soared – weightless like a cloud – and then she fell, crushing her small frame into the cobbled yard, crying in pain. Odette rushed, as fast as her limp would allow her, but when she got to the child, Felicie no longer looked in pain. No injury, then. Good. She smiled, hiding her relief and her fear in a twitch of her lips. \"By the way, that crazy jumpy thing is called le grand jeté, and you're not ready.\" She offered her a hand, but the voice of a stranger startled her. Her hand curled, no longer poised to help, and Felicie had to rise on her own. \"Are you doing dance or kung-fu?\" Laughed a boy, no older than Felicie. He was short for his age and as scrawny looking as a street urchin. If the Madame knew a dirty looking boy entered the premises… Felicie scowled at him. \"You are SO funny. This is Victor. We escaped from the orphanage together.\" She pouted at her friend, but the boy did not look a bit ashamed for his rudeness. He focused on Odette and decided to be rude to her instead. \"Hello! I am loving your apron.\" He grabbed her hand and smooched it, spit and all. He must have thought himself to be quite the charmer. Odette withdrew her hand and wiped it on the back of her vest. \"It seems that you are going out tonight,\" she said, a note of reproach in her voice. Her mother never allowed her to go out with boys, especially not at this age. But she was not Felicie's mother. The thought stung. \"Yep!\" declared the boy, still sure of his charm. \"Bring her back late, and you will be six inches smaller.\" The threat rolled from her tongue with ease she did not believe was possible. Dear God, she sounded like her mother. The boy gulped. \"Of course, of course, of course! It's a quiet, sober, quiet, sober thing.\" And then they bolted, running to a place that was probably neither quiet nor sober. I should tell her something. I should tell her about propriety and the dangers drunk men pose. I should stop her. But Felicie looked so happy. If she told her no now, would she listen? Would she listen the next time? It didn't matter. The child was already gone, running away with a boy who clearly adored her. She remembered the first time Lou knocked on her door, looking nervous and hesitant, dressed in his best clothes – if memory serves, he even wore a neck-tie – to have her mother dismiss him as 'one of your ballet friends.' The threat affected him much like it affected that Victor boy. She chuckled, then stopped. Her leg decided to rise from the dead with a spasm of pain. She almost forgot about her limp. When Felicie was around, it was bearable; sometimes even gone. But Felicie ran with her friend and Lou… Lou was gone too, wasn't he? He grew up, her Lou. He didn't exist anymore. He arrived and ordered a beer. Perhaps later he'd opt for something gentlemanly such as whiskey or cognac, but for now, a sip from the time he was younger and poorer would – \"Sorry, mister!\" A child – no, two children bumped into him, spilling his drink on his clothes. Fantastic. As if having to be around children during the day wasn't enough, now he had to endure them during the night. He looked up, ready to chastise or maybe remove them from the bar, when – No. Dear God. Why. What had he done that he had to endure that Le Haut offspring during and after school hours? Why – but the girl began to dance, immediately drawing the eyes of all the men in the bar, and Louis paused. Something just didn't make sense. The daughter of a wealthy woman, dressed in rags, dancing in bars with a street urchin? Who even let her in? But that was beyond the point. Her movements were graceful and joyful – her performance was joyful – she filled the bar with happiness, lifted the spirits of its members with a well-placed jump and a charming smile. Even his spirit was lifted, he noted as he watched her performance. Ballet and childish improvisation were a cocktail he did not approve of, but the young child balancing on the tip of her boots to the hoots of her audience made him reconsider. Passion. That's what she had. Passion. She used the dance to communicate emotions. She was happy and wanted others to share her joy. She jumped – a failed imitation of le grand jete, and even managed to land. She spun and improvised, using gestures reserved for grace in a swift and merry choreography. She lit the room better than the chandeliers. Almost cocky – or just full of childish confidence, she spun on the railing, keeping her gaze focused on a ceiling, when a rose thrown in the air caught her attention. She forgot to focus as she tried to grab it and the rose – a moving object – caused her to lose her balance and crash into a table next to him, breaking its two front legs. She fell. Louis jumped from his seat and removed his hat, eyes skimming quickly in search of injury. If her legs were broken… But the child simply looked up at him, terrified, shrinking into the shattered table. The sight was – oddly enough – reassuring; fear was proof enough that she was not in pain. He cocked his brow at her and assumed the demeanor of the cold, haughty teacher she knew him as. \"I hope that tomorrow you act with a little more dignity,\" he reprimanded and turned to leave, hiding his relief in the cockiness of his gait. He stopped. It felt wrong, scolding the hurt child; or rather, just scolding her. He turned around and added, \"Anyway, tonight was,\" he paused for the dramatics and donned his hat with flair, then added a nod of acknowledgment, \"a good performance.\" He walked home, the beer and whiskey forgotten , as were the vultures and the ball. He felt happy. He was happy . He… found it. He found a girl worth training. The next danseuse etoile. He was blinded by his anger, by his hate, but her tutor, whoever he was, saw the dancer in her. She was the one, wasn't she? She was Clara. He found his Clara. Author's notes: So yeah, hope you liked it! Tell me what'd you think![Chapter 3] \"Louis, we have a problem.\" Auguste wasn't singing, this time. His tone was grave. Which meant that they really did have a problem. Louis straightened, hoping Odette's name would not be mentioned. \"What is it?\" Auguste's face resembled granite. \"Madame Le Haut and her daughter are in my office. They want to see us.\" Louis scowled, his expression wary. \"How can it be? Mademoiselle Camille had just left my class.\" Auguste shook his head. \"Her real daughter. Come!\" He walked hunched, his hands folded behind his back. \"Janitor! Please find Mademoiselle Le Haut and send her to my office. Then, bring Odette.\" \"Odette?\" Louis picked up his pace. \"What has she got to do with this? What's going on?\" Auguste kept marching forward. The giant man looked frightening without his usual, jolly demeanor. \"Please tell me you did not truly think the young miss was Le Haut's daughter,\" he grumbled. If anything, Louis felt more lost than before. \"I've noticed her behavior was odd, but – \" Then he understood. The child's rags, her ridiculous ignorance, her sudden, implausible improvement, the grace… all this time, he was looking for a dancer. An old danseuse etoile for hire or a graying ballet master, down on his luck. All this time, he ignored the danseuse etoile underneath his nose, the one who spent her days scrubbing stairs and swiping floors. He followed Auguste into his office and was greeted by a woman and child, both bearing identical facial expressions and painful looking hairstyles. They wrinkled their noses and pursed their lips and did their absolute best to emit displeasure. Auguste announced, voice low and heavy, \"Monsieur Mérante, allow me to introduce you to Madame Regine Le Haut and her charming daughter, Camille Le Haut.\" The child curtsied. She looked exactly as he had imagined: perfect manners, perfect dress, cold eyes and the placid facial expression of a spoiled brat. Her mother, he noted, did bear a passing resemblance to a green bat. \"Charmed,\" he muttered The girl looked up at her mother, saw her facial expression and did her best to mimic it. The red-haired child chose to stumble in at this very moment, and her crestfallen expression was a confession purer than words. She knew she had lost. He saw it – her hopes and dreams fading from her eyes. \"Wrench! I want her put in prison!\" shrieked the green bat. \"She stole my life, my honor and my name! I want it back!\" wailed her daughter. The screams and dramatic acts of the ladies beside him were unnecessary and undignified. The child had no intention to lie any further. The child… she was just a child. Had they no pity? \"What is your name, mademoiselle?\" he said, leaning on his cane. His voice was soft. The child stopped to gather her courage. When she found it, she surrendered, her voice quiet and lifeless. \"My name is Felicie Lebras. I come from an orphanage in Brittany. I didn't mean to hurt Camille. I just wanted to be at the Opera and,\" she had nothing more to say. Actors ever blubber, but honest men run out of words. \"I'm sorry,\" she whispered. He felt the joy of the woman behind him. The glee. She reveled in her victory over an orphaned child. The door opened and Odette entered. She took one look and immediately joined the child. Felicie. Her student. She was his student as well, wasn't she? But it was Odette who smiled at her and placed her hand on her shoulder in support. Odette was her teacher; she entered the room to help her student. And she did not glance at him. The child leaned into the touch. She looked terrified. Madame Le Haut lost all composure. \"You traitor! You knew this! You stabbed me in the back! You are sacked!\" \"Silence!\" he commanded and hit the floor with his cane, glaring at the woman. This was out of the question. Odette was not to be threatened, especially not by a green bat and her hollow doll of a daughter. But now he had to fix this. He had to do something. Why did you not come to me, Odette? Why didn't you tell me? Why do you insist on placing yourself at the mercy of those vultures? Then, he knew what to do. \"All right. Like it or not, here is my deal. Mademoiselle Le Haut, you may enter the coryphée class starting tomorrow. And you will also be in the auditions for the part in 'The Nutcracker'.\" This was what they wanted, didn't they? The child and the mother who served the best prime rib in Paris. He poured iron into his voice, \"But I want to be clear, if you sack Madame Odette, I will sack Camille.\" She was not to be touched. He walked toward the child. The liar. Felicie. The act frightened her, he could see that, but it also allowed him to stand as a barrier between her and Madame Le Haut. It allowed him to stand closer to Odette, to hide meaning within looks and words, a conversation kept in secret. If only she would listen . Then he thundered, \" You !\" and glared at the child, who flinched. \"You made a terrible start to the classes, and you have lied and cheated to be here.\" Odette inched closer to her, and her hold of the child tightened. A message to him – a plea – leave the girl alone. If you still care for me, leave my charge unharmed. I won't hurt her, Odette. I would never hurt her. How cruel do you imagine me to be? He ignored the barks of the woman behind him and softened his voice, \"But you have also shown great promise, and you've worked hard and shown your dedication. You must have a good teacher.\" Only then did he dare to look up at Odette, and only then did she look back at him. Her eyes, pale blue like soft days of spring when the sun is still shy, did not turn away. Look at me. Look back at me. Do you understand? I know. I know everything. For a moment, his heart stopped. The eyes that always looked away stared back, as beautiful and ethereal and beyond his reach as they were on the day she looked at him for the first time. He should – Then his courage failed him, and he looked away. Torn from the dream of what could have been back to reality, where a pair of green, childish eyes awaited his verdict. He was ready to make yet another promise. \"So you may also stay in the auditions,\" he declared, ignoring – once again – the woman behind him. He spoke only to Felicie, for this was his promise to her. \"If you get the part in 'The Nutcracker' fair and square, you may become a coryphée too. If you fail to get the part, then you must leave the Opera. Is that clear?\" \"Yes,\" Felicie sighed, face glowing with gratitude. \"Is that also clear to you, Madame?\" he added, turning to face the green bat behind him. \"Clear,\" the woman hissed, displeased. His plan was set. \"Then, Felicie Lebras from Brittany, the orphan, your future at the Opera is in your hands.\" He gathered his courage one more time and looked at Odette, almost startled to find her looking back at him. Her eyes were not glassy, but bright and full of questions, and her back was not hunched but tall and proud. Her lips parted, and her face softened as an epiphany cleared the blue of her eyes. She understood, did she not? The plan looked harsh to please Madame Le Haut, but in truth, all it proved was how much faith he had in Felicie. That he had already chosen her for the part. And that it had to be kept secret from the serpents behind him – that he had to stand closer not to threaten, but as protection. He glanced away and left, his heart hammering in his chest. Standing so close to Odette, after – no, despite all this time… he felt like a boy again, working his courage to find an excuse to hold her hand. Maybe now, she wouldn't turn him away. Odette placed her hand on Felicie's back and stirred her away from the threats of the woman behind her and the schemes of the man in front of her. Her mind racing, she knew she had to focus on the immediate problem, which was Felicie's future, not Mérante and his soft, gentle eyes. She walked straight, the cane simply an accessory at her side. She had to plan. Realizing Felicie depended on her for success rattled her ribcage and shimmered within her, like the flickering of a flame. \"Go and change your clothes. When I finish here, we'll start training,\" she promised Felicie. Felicie looked up and smiled at her. \"I'll work hard! Harder than ever! Promise!\" and ran to the changing rooms. Odette failed to fight the chuckle that escaped her lips, as unruly as the child to invoke it. She grabbed a room and began to sweep. The smooth motion allowed her mind to wander, escape the dreary reality of cleaning and enter the world of ballet. Felicie's strength was her passion and her weakness – her technique. She'd have to work hard to strengthen her muscles and focus her movements until she could float with precision and grace; until she could dance next to Rosita Mauri and not feel ashamed. She did not lean on the broom, this time. Mérante's gaze burned in the back of her throat. Her body felt young again. Her legs felt like dancing. Her body began to mimic the movements she would have to teach the child. How to focus her turns and hold her limbs – without curving or caving to muscle fatigue – afloat, like a swan before flight. Mérante's eyes softened when he glanced at her, she was sure of it. He looked at her longer than he should have – or would have – if his actions were born of pity. She did not think he'd even glance at her direction, but he did. Twice. And on her, with no words spoken, his eyes lingered. Tell me it means something. Tell me I mean something to you. Tell me my Lou is still in there. Louis walked to his office, then turned and walked back. He had to talk to Odette. He had to see her. He had to know… the way she looked at him. It meant something. It must have meant something. He rushed to the stage, then paused, hidden by the curtains. Odette was dancing. It was a twirl, barely a dance, but still, one could almost imagine her floating with each turn. She was neither leaning nor limping – she was dancing. And the broom was an accessory, not a crutch. If he wanted proof, he had just received it. Odette was dancing. There was something, embers that could be sparked into a flame. Something. She had not danced for ten years, after all. The injury had stolen her love and her life and yet… yet still, she danced. He felt, rather than heard, Felicie joining his side. The child looked up at him, no longer terrified or distant, but rather… she, too, had warmth in her eyes. \"She even makes sweeping look graceful,\" he said to her, his voice warm and laden with all the emotions he no longer knew how to contain. Felicie edged a tad closer. \"She was a good dancer, wasn't she?\" she whispered back, her voice full of admiration. He smiled despite the pain throbbing in his chest. \"Not just a good dancer. The best of her generation.\" He paused, trying to contain the memory of the flames. \"And then there was a fire onstage.\" She did not know he was there when the clock struck midnight. He never told her. \"You have given her strength again,\" he added, for today he saw a glimpse of Odette's fighting spirit that he once thought was consumed by the fire. Odette turned and paused, for she saw him. Her eyes lingered, locked on his. The shy blue, waiting for him. Was she waiting? He clenched his jaw, and just like the first time he saw her, he retreated into the shadows and left. The words that bled through his heart evaporated into silence. He turned away as the child rushed forward to hug the woman, and when he glanced back, he saw her standing tall – no broom in hand, hugging the child the way… yes. The way a mother might embrace her daughter. Even if you weren't dancing because of me, I will protect the reason why you dance. Even if you wouldn't have me back, I will do everything in my power to help you… behind the curtains. She trained her. Had to train her. This was our chance, she wanted to tell Felicie, our chance to stay together. We could be a family, of sorts, she wanted to say. I could be your mother. She practiced the thought in her mind as she trained Felicie, grilling her on everything she must do to win, and that she could win. I believe in you. We believe in you. And at night, when Felicie was sleeping soundly the way only a child could, Odette remained awake, watching. She brushed her hair – so fiery red – and started to plan. She had enough money saved to rent a home. The place she had in mind was small, but she still had income from the Opera, so she could afford it for the time period that would require her to find a new source of income. A second job. She still could not afford the attendance fees, but that was something she could settle with Auguste. Probably. Could she claim family? Technically, she had not adopted the child, and only members of the teaching faculty may enroll their children for free, but… Perhaps I could become a teacher, after all. I never had the courage to try again, but… she looked at Felicie. The girl never gave up, no matter the odds. She escaped the orphanage, jumped on a train, and arrived at Paris with no clear plan, and still managed to get herself enrolled in the most prestigious school for ballet in the continent. If she could become a ballerina, I could become a teacher. Then she looked up, out through the window at the waning moon. She remembered the first time she met him. The Ballet Master back then, Lucien Pepita, walked into her class, followed by a young, handsome boy from the level above. All the girls, as taught, rushed to hold position against the rail and waited with bated breath for the new announcement. \"Is there a girl in this class named Odette?\" She turned around slowly to face the old man. \"Yes, Monsieur,\" she replied with a curtsey. \"Hmm. A grand name, you were given. Let us see if you can live up to it, shall we?\" he gestured to the piano player. \"Dance for me.\" \"Dance?\" Odette felt the world spinning. Dancing before the ballet master – this was the audition of her dreams, but – \"I haven't anything prepared, I….\" \"Oh, don't start with the excuses,\" the master waved his hand, exasperated. \"If you have the heart of a dancer, let it dance for you.\" He sighed, then added, \"This boy is quite sure you are worth my time. If you are, dance.\" And that was the first time she met Louis Mérante. The piano player began to play Swan Lake. And – was she auditioning for the role of Odette? She could never audition for that part! It was beyond her expertise, and preference was always given to the senior students – 'Dance,' the boy mouthed. 'just dance'. So that's what she did. She just danced. Her body surrendered to the music and danced on its own. She knew the story and the music – she was Odette, both by name and in character. Her movements translated the fear and desperation of a woman trapped as a swan, the frustration of endless nights and days and months passing – lost, locked – in the body of the animal they all try to mimic. She danced with grace and passion, without structure or planning, like a woman freed from her cage. Perhaps she was. With arms stretched and poised, she soared and tried to touch the sky – gravity had no hold of her – only despair and desolation pulled her down, back to the lake on which she floated, toes barely touching, legs arched in search of freedom. She awoke from her trance when the music ended and opened her eyes, almost frightened, to meet the calculating eyes of the master. \"Hmm.\" He said. Then paused. She could hear the blood racing through her and feel her heart beating frantically, painfully, without rhythm, as she awaited his judgment. The only thing that held her up, she felt, were his eyes, that boy's eyes, that gazed at her with pure unadulterated admiration. \"I did not think I would produce 'The Swan Lake' ever again,\" he said. \"Then I saw this boy dance. All I had to do was find Odette.\" He shook his head. \"Your dance lacks discipline, restraint, and refinement. But your passion,\" he removed his glasses to clean them, \"your passion is inspiring. You made me feel emotion… I haven't felt for a long time.\" He returned his glasses and turned to exit. \"You live up to your name.\" \"Wait, Monsieur Pepita!\" cried one of the girls, \"What about us? Why aren't we given the chance to audition? This isn't fair – \" \"Oh, quiet you,\" ordered the old man. \"I know you. Or at least, I know your mother. You have the energy of a bullet, but the lightness of a depressed elephant. You are not Odette.\" The girls muttered. Someone clapped. But all Odette could do was lose herself in the eyes of the handsome boy whose smile, first hesitant, then proud, curved her own lips in a similar gesture. \"See you in rehearsals!\" he declared with a cocked brow, then bowed and exited as well. That was so long ago, but when Felicie's identity was discovered, she looked into his eyes and saw the same hesitant warmth reflected at her, and her heart raced in the same manner it did on that day. \"I suppose I will see you in rehearsals,\" she whispered as she brushed Felicie's hair. \"Will you see me?\" On the day before the audition, however, Felicie fled from her. You are not my mother, she said. Her eyes widened when she realized what she said, and she fled. Odette sat, holding the two red shoes. Her red shoes. She thought it would make Felicie happy. She has so little she could call her own, and these shoes – her red shoes – were so precious to her. The shoes, like Felicie's music box, were her last gift from her mother. You are not my mother. And she left. Odette waited. The hour was late, yet still, she waited. Don't you want to be a ballerina? She thought, her heart aching with desperation. Surely, she knows my door is always open to her. Surely, she knows she can ask for help, and I'll do everything I can to help her? Surely – I sound like Mérante , she chuckled. The sound was bitter and tired and pained. Do you realize what he offered you, child? He offered you one of the most desirable debuts for a girl your age. Be Clara in a production of the best Ballet school in the continent, directed by a world-famous choreographer. Perform with the best dancers in the world. The nights were growing colder and colder. Odette wrapped a blanket around her shoulders, shivered, and waited. A glance out the window revealed nothing had changed except for the moon, who no longer ruled over the sky from his seat far above but sank, lower and lower, into the trees' welcoming embrace. Where are you, Felicie? Where did you go? The world, child. She sighed, holding the red en pointe shoes in her hands, remains from a dream long gone. When he offered me an audition, I jumped head in. I grabbed it with everything I had. Why are you running away? Is that boy really worth more than your future? The night ended. The moon surrendered to the temptation of slumber – or perhaps fled the day's oppressing light, and the sun rose to rule in its place. Odette, once again trapped in her role, wore her scarf and limped to work. With any luck, Felicie would once again defy all expectations and win. You are not my mother. He did not watch Camille perform at her audition. Could not. All he could do was watch the world tick away on his pocket watch and still his growing irritation. His worry. Where was Felicie? He exchanged a short look with Rosita, seated next to him, but her elegant frown revealed she had no knowledge nor help to offer. He could feel Odette's eyes on him from her hiding spot in the booth above the seats. The theater was not large enough to conceal the concern emitted by the silent, blue stars. Where was the child? Camille finished her dance to the raucous sound of her mother's applause. He sneered at her actions, disgusted by her blatant attempt to influence his decision. Not that it mattered – if Felicie did not show up, Camille would automatically become the winner. Rosita stepped on his foot, then said, \"Thank you, mademoiselle,\" with a voice soft and gracious. I am sorry, child. He rose and cleared his throat, \"Well, as mademoiselle Felicie did not deign to show up for the audition, it is Camille who will dance with Rosi-\" \"Wait! Wait! I'm here!\" When Felice ran onto the stage, he felt his heart sink. \"Please, please let me dance,\" she begged. \"You lost, orphan!\" cried the Madame, jumping from her set. \"It's over, don't you understand?\" \"Sit. Down!\" he commanded. The woman might be wealthy, but this was his production. His theater. His decision. \"I apologize,\" the orphan mumbled. She looked terrible. Her eyes were red and she stood hunched, as if her muscles were aching or her body was too weak to support her. Her body, frayed, sank toward the stage floor as if her very soul gave up. If the girl could not stand, how could she dance? And if the girl couldn't dance… \"Did you sleep?\" he asked. \"Not much,\" she whispered. Her fingers toyed with her dress, as if the fabric was too tight for her thin body. Where was she – the girl that was brazen enough to enter his class and dance – with no form nor skill – but still danced, because the music was playing? \"Did you train yesterday?\" he asked again. His voice was too worried – Madame Le Haut might suspect that the competition was a sham – but he could not pour ice into his voice, not when the girl looked down, eyes burning with shame. Perhaps it was no longer a sham. The child before him had not an ounce of the fire she did the day before. \"No,\" she mumbled. \"Why?\" he asked, voice almost a plea, a demand for an answer she could not give him. The child flinched and did not answer. But this was too late. He could not save her now. This was your chance, Felicie. He opened his eyes, and his anger choked and faded, leaving behind the rankling bitterness of disappointment. Why, child? What happened? He sat down. There was nothing he could do to help her now. \"All right. Music!\" And the music began and the girl danced and for a moment, Louis found he could relax into his chair. Her technique was lacking, but the passion was still there and the movements had the trademark grace that now he knew to be Odette's. She could still win. She could – And then she fell. Her leg tremored and instead of stepping directly to full point, she trembled unto the floor. \"Start again,\" he ordered, his hand in a fist. Don't fail me again, Felicie. Rise and dance. Now! \"She fell, she's eliminated!\" protested Madame Le Haut. \"Start. Again,\" he repeated, rankled. The girl rose and the piano player repeated the notes. Once again she started, but her movements were already defeated. They held neither passion nor grace, only habit and memory. Her expression – already on the verge of shattering – told him she gave up. He could not give her any more chances; and even if he could, she would not have used them. And once again, she fell. No tremor this time. She crushed directly onto the stage floor. \"This is hilarious,\" crowed the Madame, pleasure dripping from every syllable. Louis closed his eyes. He could feel Felicie's pain in her broken form. The rich girl simply won an audition, but Felicie… Felicie just lost her chance – perhaps her only chance – to change her life. To dance; not because she could, but because her heart beat for it. And there he sat, the executioner of her dreams. His promise was no longer salvation, but a guillotine. He rose, his heart a weight burdening his lungs, and said, \"You remember our deal?\" The orphan looked at him, eyes pleading yet her form resigned. She knew he could not do anything, surely? Hope, he thought, was an irrational creature with no understanding of facts or probabilities. She still hoped he could help her. Why, Felicie? What happened to you? He turned to face the other girl. \"Mademoiselle Camille, you will have the honor of dancing Clara in 'The Nutcracker.'\" And walked away. He took no pleasure in their victory nor their joy. How can they rejoice in such a shameful achievement? Behind him, he heard Felicie sob. He clenched his cane and walked faster. He did not want to look up and see Odette's disappointment. Her pain. Once again he made a promise, and once again he had failed. \"Did you think it would end here, little rat?\" Odette wiped her tears and pulled herself up, because – no – not even Regine would be so evil as to hurt a child – \"Your consolation prize is waiting for you outside,\" she drawled as she dragged the orphan from the stage. \"No! Let me go!\" Felicie begged, trying to free herself, \"No!\" No. no, don't you dare! Odette rushed to the front door, as quickly as her limp allowed her. She wouldn't do this, she cannot do this – \"It's a one-way ticket back home,\" the Madame snarled, \"where you belong.\" \"Oh, no,\" Odette whispered as stumbled down the stairs, ignoring the pain burning through her left leg, then to the front gate, where Felicie was already pushed into a carriage. \"Please, please!\" Odette begged, breathless, but the carriage had already left and her pleas fell on the deaf ears of the Madame, who smiled when she heard her. \"Felicie!\" she cried, attempting to stop the carriage with her arm outstretched. A foolish attempt, as the carriage already left and the child, banging on the back window and calling her name, could no longer hear her. She called my name. She asked for my help. The thought was caught in her throat and burned through her lungs. I failed her. \"You will never see her again,\" taunted Regine, her voice soft and velvety. \"And, of course, you're sacked.\" Odette watched the carriage until it disappeared, trying in vain to ease the tightening of her throat. Defeated. Again, she was defeated. You can try with all your might, but all they need to do is snap their fingers and your entire world falls apart. Now, they did the same to Felicie. Was I not enough for her? She had to ruin Felicie's life as well? She is just a child! Just a child. She is alone, and she had no help, only a dream and – Even a dream is a privilege wasted on the poor. Odette surrendered to the silence. Even tears were a luxury she could not afford. She limped to Le Haut's mansion and packed her clothes. She had so little to pack, it took her mere minutes to undress the place that served as her home for the past ten years. She left no mark. And she had nowhere to go. Her legs dragged her back to the Opera. She climbed up the stairs – slowly, so slowly – and limped toward the supply room. She stood in the dim room, eyes glassy and vacant, then crumbled against the wall. She told herself she wouldn't cry. She promised herself, when they told her she'd never dance again, that this was the last time. The last tears. When the treatment they offered her was too expensive, she broke her promise. When Lou left her to dance in America, she broke it for the final time. Today, she broke her promise again. Twice. Tears, large and fat and silent rolled down her cheeks. Her shoulders shook and her leg spasmed, shooting arrows of fire up her thigh, but all she could think about was Felicie, banging on the back window of the carriage, begging, begging… Begging never helped. She did not cry for so many years, spent in silence. She had accepted her fate – surrendered to it. Shriveled in her cage of deformity and poverty and waited, long and in vain, for freedom. Unlike Odette from the stories, however, no prince came to rescue her and break the curse. Lou left her for Odile. And Felicie… Felicie was an escape – a reprieve during moonlit nights – temporary and now, stolen. Perhaps the only freedom she could hope for waited for her beyond the stage. She already heard the final call. They clapped and clapped and clapped… and now the theater is empty, and she was left alone on the stage. No one is clapping for her, anymore. No one's waiting. Now she just has to wait for the curtains to close…. Felicie. The name shattered, like a ray of light lost underneath the waves, yet managed to break through the darkest of her clouds. The child, oh, the poor child, chained to a fate not dissimilar to her own; a Life of cleaning, snuffed by poverty and bigotry. She was destined for the stage, designed to dance among the stars… she deserved to be happy. And you could not provide her that. You failed to break the curse. You failed her. Where did you go, Felicie? Why did you leave? Why didn't you return? I waited for you. I waited. Odette sank lower and deeper into herself. She buried her face between her legs and curled unto herself as tightly as she could, and cried. Author's Notes: I'm sorry I left you with such a cliffhanger... but, on the plus side, this chapter is longer than the previous ones! Please share your thoughts and tell me what you think![Chapter 4] Gentle sun rays and chirping birds woke her up. One might think, Odette mused as she stared at the window and looked down at the girls, practicing their moves, that the world was a beautiful place. The supply room's window faced west, not east, and the flood of light signaled it was late in the afternoon. She overslept. Still, glancing at the broom and bucket, she found no reason to rise. What would be the worse that could happen? Auguste would also sack her? A brittle smile shattered her chapped lips. It may even be a relief. And yet, she rose. Her body was frozen and stiff, and her joints protested loudly against her poor choice of sleeping position. Her ankle flared flames of pain that throbbed through her lower leg. She leaned against the wall, her body heavy and weak, the back of her mind throbbing. Her eyes were blinded by dancing spots of light, flashing and blackening. She closed them and hissed when the throbbing intensified, flooding her body with waves of pain. She forced herself to breathe. Breathe and wait. Wait and breathe again, until the pain subsided, until she could open her eyes. The world slowly steadied, as did her breaths. You must climb out of this mess on your own , she thought. Find your way out. No one can help you now . Then she paused and lifted her head. Had she really had no help? Odette wiped her tears and dried her cheeks. She left the supply room and climbed the stairs with vigor she had not felt in years. He told her, didn't he? He told her that if she'd ever need anything, he'd be there. Pity, she thought, and rejected his offer. He pitied her, for he reached his dream and she did not. Both of them, young and poor and burning with talent dreamed of fame and wealth, of conquering the stage and dancing and dancing until their feet could support them no longer and their hearts were too frail for the passion of music. Until the final curtain call. Until all the lights go out. Do not go gentle into that good night. But she'd endure that, his pity, if she could save Felicie. If she could see her again. She knocked on his door, heart racing at the thought, but she did not pause to think or hesitate. A shiver ran up her spine when she heard his voice, permitting her entry. She opened the door and entered. Mérante looked tired. He leaned on his cane and fixed his gaze on the floor. He, too, looked defeated. When she said nothing, he looked up. His eyes widened when he saw her and his jaw clenched, but she could see the turmoil – the emotions he tried so hard to hide. \"Odette,\" he breathed, then rushed toward her. \"Please, take a seat, don't – \" He moved a chair for her and offered her a hand, but she held on to her cane and whispered, \"They sent her away.\" Mérante's frown shattered her willpower. She looked down. She could not meet his eyes. She did not move from her spot, did not approach him. From the corner of her eyes, she could see his hand slowly dropping to rest at his side. \"Felicie? Who – what are you talking about?\" he said, his voice low and deep and gentle. Too gentle. She opened her mouth but her throat – treacherous thing – tightened yet again and allowed no words to pass. She looked away, trying to blink away her misery and her own emotional mess. She should not break. Not now; not in front of him. She had not spoken to him for years, and now, now that she had to, she couldn't. Mérante very gently placed his hand on hers. His hand was so warm – he was so warm – and his touch felt solid and unreal at the same time. He slowly pried her hand from her cane and, fingers caressing hers, led her to the chair. He held her for just a moment longer, his hand squeezing hers in reassurance, and released her. He let her go. Like all those years ago – after the accident, he let her go. It was pity after all, then. He loved her when she danced and pitied her when she couldn't. Her hand dropped, slow and heavy, into her lap. Useless. Then her hand was lifted again as Mérante offered her a glass of wine. He guided her fingers, slow and unresponsive at first, with gentleness and care, then looked into her eyes. \"Don't cry,\" he whispered. Odette's hand held the glass in a fist. She looked down again and quickly removed all unwanted moisture from her face. She opened her eyes to see his hand, offering her a handkerchief, but instead sipped from the wine and steeled herself. She came to ask for help for the girl, not for herself. When she was ready, she started again, \"Le Haut sent her back to Brittany.\" \"To the orphanage,\" he probed. She nodded. Her voice failed her again, so she sipped again. Perhaps she shouldn't have – it has been so long since she had a drink or something to eat, that the effects were almost immediate. \"I had a plan,\" she whispered, \"to rent a small place and teach her, maybe even –\" she bit her lip. What was she doing? Telling him – talking to him – after ten years of silence, surely he no longer cared? He-he stopped caring the moment she fell. Left her to see the world and dance on all its stages. Became rich and famous and – \"Le Haut fired you?\" his voice was gentle, but she could see his anger in his fist. \"It doesn't matter,\" she muttered, voice barely heard. \"Of course, it does! I told her, if she fired you, Camille – \" \"It's not the child's fault,\" she intervened, her voice flat and lifeless. It's never the child's fault, neither Camille nor Felicie… Felicie. I need to see her again. I have to see her again. \"I need to find her,\" she whispered, her body trembling as she attempted to stand, \"I need to….\" \"You need to rest.\" Strong hands cradled her shoulder and gently but firmly seated her on the chair. She looked up – a mistake, for his eyes held her gaze – the gentle brown never wavering as he tried to delve into her. \"There is a small place in the attic, do you remember? Stay there. I'll ask Auguste to arrange it for you. Stay, Odette, and wait for me.\" His hand cupped her cheek for the briefest of moments, but her body burned at his touch. \"I'll be back as soon as I can,\" he reassured her, then released her. \"What?\" she mumbled, her mind still numb. Everything happened so fast – for a moment he held her, and then – \"Where-where are you going?\" Mérante donned his coat. \"To find that orphanage.\" Louis strode to Auguste's office and tried to think of a plan – any plan – to find that girl. Odette came to him. Finally, she came to him. She spoke to him. She asked him for help. Not for herself, but for the child. He could not fail her again. Either of them. He entered without knocking, \"I must leave, Auguste.\" \"Leave,\" the director repeated, frowning. He looked up from the pile of paperwork he was working on. \"Please tell me you aren't quitting over that Le Haut debacle.\" \"Of course not,\" he answered, prickled by the very thought. \"I need to go to Brittany for a few days. I'll return as soon as I can.\" Auguste's usual smile was gone. \"I'm not sure I can approve of this plan. You have a month to get that show ready, and Mademoiselle Camille had so little training….\" Louis glowered. \"It won't take me more than a day or two,\" he tried to reassure him. Auguste glowered back. \"Really? Do you know where that girl's orphanage is? Or how exhausting are the legal procedures for adopting a child?\" He shook his head. \"Once, all you had to do was pay them some, but now you need to sign paperwork and show a proof of prosperity and… and what not.\" Louis' glower deepened. \"Why on earth would you know anything about adoption procedures?\" he demanded. And no, he did not know. He thought he could buy her freedom and give her back to Odette. No one had to know. But if it were a legal process… \"I an no fool, Louis,\" Auguste grumbled. \"You'd do anything for Odette. Odette loves that child, but she cannot afford to adopt her. One way or another, you'd have stepped in. Since the child failed her audition, she was probably sent away, which left Odette heartbroken, and you…\" he waved in his general direction, \"with a chance to save the day.\" \"You make it sound as if I rejoice in her sorrow,\" he snarled, eyes flashing and fingers tightening their hold of his cane. \"Hmm. Did I? Never fully grasped that whole subtext thing,\" Auguste affected an air of innocence, then dropped the act and sighed. He threw his hands in the air in surrender. \"But I suppose I can't really stop you. Look for an orphanage close to a train station or a market. She had to get here somewhere, after all, and not entirely legally.\" He paused. \"You have until Tuesday.\" Louis signed, almost in relief, then added, \"Odette needs a place to stay. I suggested the attic.\" \"Oh?\" Auguste tilted his head. \"Don't you have… ah, three guest bedrooms?\" he winked. How quickly he donned his mask of joy. Auguste was not an unkind man, so his disapproval was… almost baffling. He secured his agreement, however begrudged, so perhaps pressing him for answers wouldn't be a good idea. Louis cocked his brow instead. \"What respectable woman would house with a man to whom she isn't married or otherwise related?\" Auguste laughed. \"Oh, I know that one! A governess!\" He laughed again, pleased with his own joke. \"Fine, I'll arrange her a place in the… attic, you said. But You will need one. A governess, that is. Not an Attic.\" Louis expelled his irritation from his lungs, then nodded. \"Thank you. I'll see you again… as soon as I'm able.\" He rushed toward the exit, ignoring the students that moved out of his way and the worried eyes of Nora and Dora, and entered his carriage. \"Home, Monsieur?\" \"No. Go to Brittany, as fast as you can,\" he ordered. His coachman, Phillippe, turned to look at him, confused. \"Er, Brittany, Monsieur? That would take… five, six hours, at least!\" Louis leveled a glare at him. \"Then we had better started, yes?\" \"Eh, ye-yes, Monsieur.\" Phillippe closed the door and climbed up to his seat, then whipped the horses into a gallop. I'm coming, Felicie . Luckily, Brittany had only one orphanage – an ancient castle that Phillippe spotted from afar. However, the sun sank behind the tired walls long before they reached them, so he had to find lodging for the night. The delay gave him time, time to plan and time to think. Adopting a child – any child – was a dreadful responsibility. He wasn't a father, and though he taught girls of Felicie's age, he suspected that raising one would be slightly more difficult. Especially Felicie. Am I to be like a father to her? Would she want me as a father? The notion was disquieting. Being a father… and not of her choice, but his. She might not have chosen him, had she the opportunity. How should he approach the subject? What should he say? What if she would have preferred to stay? She could be my charge. A protégé, he thought. She already has a mother-like connection to Odette; no need to trouble her with another family figure so soon. Or at all. The solution offered some relief. He was already her teacher at the academy, so living together might prove an inconvenience, while a familial relationship – a burden. All she should require of him was structure, and perhaps a tutor or a governess, while Odette could teach her the rest. In a safe, yet challenging environment, the child would flourish. Yes , he thought, that was the most agreeable solution . He awoke the day after, dined and went to the orphanage. The old castle looked cold and foreboding, a giant structure still clad in the early morning fog. The clumsy beast of stone couldn't possibly retain warmth, he mused, then banged on the iron gate. A child spotted him – a young boy with soot on his face and a beaten expression – and rushed into the castle. It was not long before a nun emerged, accompanied by a gargoyle of a man. He had flaming red hair, but that was not, oddly enough, his most unusual feature; his face had bizarre proportions – his nose and jaw were huge, while his bulging eyes pointed in opposite directions. The hunched man and the cold nun did not look like ideal caretakers for orphans. No wonder Felicie fled. \"How may we help you, Monsieur?\" asked the Nun. \"I have come to inquire about the adoption of a child, Madame,\" he replied. \"Hmm,\" she muttered, then took a long moment to scrutinize him, his clothes, and his carriage. She signaled the man to open the gate, which he did with a displeased growl. \"Right this way, Monsieur…?\" \"Mérante,\" he said. \"I've come from Paris.\" \"Is that so?\" She led him into the building. \"A long drive. Are there no orphanages in your area?\" She was yet to be impressed, he noted. This might prove more difficult than he thought. \"Perhaps, but I am looking for someone in particular.\" Behind him, the hunched man elicited another quiet, yet unmistakable growl. Louis turned to cock a brow at him, and the man reddened and looked away. \"Let us talk in my office, then, before we see the children,\" the Nun said. Her office was humble in design and bare of decorations except for a huge cross. She gestured in a manner she no doubt thought to be gracious toward a small chair that was docked next to as small a desk. The chair faced her own chair and desk, so large in comparison that, to a child's eye, they might have appeared grand. Louis rolled his eyes at her power play, yet decided to obey. He sat at the chair but remained a hand's length from the desk. He used the space to lean on his cane and the desk as a resting place for his hat. Let her see and remember and know that he was not an orphan she could frighten with oversized furniture. The Nun's lips thinned but chose not to comment. \"Are you married, Monsieur Mérante?\" \"I am not,\" he replied. \"Have you the intention of marrying?\" \"That shouldn't be any concern of yours,\" he snarled, his voice hard. The Nun scowled. \"I ask you this because you appear young, Monsieur, and surely you are capable –\" \"I am not here to satisfy any parental instinct,\" Louis interjected, \"but my conscience. One of the orphans under your care had shown exceptional talent and promise, and I fear her path was cut short too soon. I want to help her fulfill her potential as a ballerina, something that is unlikely to happen without proper guidance and teaching. That, Madame, is why I am here.\" The Nun scoffed, but the hunched man's eyes widened. \"Was she any good? Felicie – you are speaking of Felicie, yes? Was she?\" Louis focused on him. Perhaps he misjudged. The terrifying looking man appeared to have a soft spot for the child. \"Indeed, I am. She was not merely good, Monsieur. I would not have come this far for a good dancer. She is a natural born ballerina, both in body and in spirit. I believe she could, with proper guidance and structure, become the next danseuse etoile of the academy.\" He wanted to say more, but a sound made him pause. If he were not mistaken, the desk just gasped . \"Very high praise indeed,\" said the Nun dryly. \"And who are you to make such proclamations?\" \"I was her teacher in the academy,\" he answered, trying not to frown in the desk's direction. \"So you… dance?\" The Nun looked a tad mortified. Her nose flared in judgment. It was far easier to cock a brow at her than it was at an inanimate object. \"Danced.\" \"Were you any good?\" the hunched man asked. He offered a hesitant smile. Louis returned the gesture, \"I suppose.\" He cocked his brow. The man continued, \"And… and Felicie has a future, there? In the… in the city? They won't be mean to her, would they?\" \"That I cannot promise, but more doors would open before my protégé than before an orphan,\" he answered. \"I can promise I will do everything in my power to ensure she reached her full potential.\" \"As… as dance a toil, you said?\" the man's eyes shifted between hesitance and joy. A frown of confusion and a tug of an uncertain smile made his expression comic, yet Louis found it endearing. \"Danseuse etoile,\" he corrected, \"and yes.\" Then he added, hitting his cane against the floor to draw the desk's attention, \"Of course, she would have to work hard and train nearly every day for years to reach that level, and she would have to retain her passion and her spirit and her dream of dancing. Nothing less would do.\" \"And should she fail?\" demanded the Nun. \"She is a child with big dreams and no discipline or structure of any sort. She never listens, does not attend her lessons, and her over-confidence had her injure herself more than once. What then, Monsieur?\" Louis's forehead tightened as his jaw clenched, \"You think lightly of me, Madame, and yet judge me harshly. My offer does not have conditions. I'd support whichever path she chose, injury notwithstanding.\" \"Tut-tut-tut,\" the Nun replied. \"Temper, young man. I will hold you to your word, then, should your word be proven true.\" She turned around and withdrew a pack of papers from her desk. \"Surely, if you stand by what you said, you wouldn't mind signing your words' legal representation?\" she inquired, her words and smile sharp, yet not unkind. She did not offer him the paperwork for protégé, neither ward nor charge. No, the papers she provided him would make Felicie his legal daughter and heir. Clever woman , he thought disdainfully, with such a miserable personality . The desk's stomach growled. \"Ahm,\" he clarified his throat. \"Forgive my poor manners. I was in a rush,\" he said, his face straight and free of the shame or remorse that usually accompanied such a social blunder. The Nun looked embarrassed on his behalf. \"Oh, heaven, Luteau, if you don't mind….\" The hunched man, whose eyes were suspicious again, nodded. \"Ah, right. Yes. Just a moment, yes.\" He left in a hurry. Louis placed the package of papers on his desk and, with a discreet jab of his elbow, pushed his hat to the floor. \"Dear me,\" he commented, then bent down and peeked underneath the desk. Felicie looked back, eyes wide and startled and brimming with tears. She bit the front of her shirt, yet her shaking shoulders gave her away. The child hugged her legs as tightly as she could and curled into herself, tears sliding down her cheeks as she sobbed in silence. Louis offered her his handkerchief and briefly held her trembling hand when she accepted it. He straightened in his chair to find the Nun glaring at him. \"My back is not what it used to be,\" he offered, then began to read. Or attempted to. How can one read when seated so close to a crying child? Why was she crying? Was it something he said? He could not tell from her face – wide eyes and lips trembling, tears silently staining her pale cheeks – if she was happy to see him. And what if she wasn't? The man – Luteau – entered carrying a plate with a slice of bread, cheese, and assorted fruits. \"There you go, Monsieur… sorry for the wait –\" He blinked at him. \"Have you lost your pocket square?\" \"What pocket square?\" he replied innocently. Luteau looked confused. \"Your… handkerchief. Didn't you have one?\" \"I do not recall, perhaps I did.\" Louis shoved a peach into his sleeve with the grace of a dancer and the speed of a thief, then, as he bowed to glance at the floor, rolled the fruit back into his hand and gave it to the child. Felicie accepted the fruit with a shaking hand and offered a broken smile in return, though not the handkerchief, which she held in a tight, white-knuckled fist. Her eyes were still red, but she no longer cried. Overall, Louis thought it was an improvement. \"Doesn't seem to be the case, Monsieur, though I appreciate your concern,\" he replied smoothly. Indeed, both caretakers stared at him as if they found him odd, but Louis focused on the legal papers instead. Whenever he finished a paper, he lifted it up, picked another fruit, and smuggled to the child below. This , he thought, was quite ridiculous. However, with each passing moment, each instance of fruit being accepted by a small, cold hand, the words and demands presented on the adoption papers seemed less and less absurd to him. Adopting a daughter… suddenly, the notion felt more natural, more proper than adopting a protégé or a ward. The girl tugged on his pants. He looked up, but the Nun glowered at him from above her eagle's nose, and both of Luteau's eyes appeared to be focused in his direction, so risking yet another dive was not an option. Instead, he lowered his hand so his palm rested within her reach. Perhaps she had a piece of paper to write on, or perhaps she wanted to return his handkerchief… Louis froze. His eyes focused on the paper, yet saw nothing. Then slowly, ever so slowly, he released the air locked in his lungs. Felicie held his hand. Almost too tightly, almost too desperately, but she did. She held his hand. Very well, then. \"All seemed to be in order,\" he declared, \"but I would like to speak to Felicie first, before signing.\" He paused, thinking of the girl hiding underneath the desk. \"I want to… ask her permission.\" Were those the right words? He wasn't certain. Felicie's grasp tightened, crushing his fingers together, so he gave her a gentle, reassuring squeeze. \"Ah, certainly,\" the Nun said, surprised. \"Luteau, fetch the girl, would you?\" Felicie withdrew her hand. \"I'd rather go to her,\" he objected, then rose. \"Delicate matters shouldn't be discussed in such a formal environment, where she might feel uncomfortable to speak her mind.\" The Nun shook her head. \"My office is the more appropriate setting, and therefore –\" \"I said,\" he commanded, hands tightening their hold of his cane. \"I'd rather go to her.\" Both caretakers stared at him, eyes shocked at his impertinence. Luteau surrendered first. \"Rig-right this way, Monsieur. She's been upset, lately. I think she might… hmm. Might be in the bedroom. I think.\" They left the office with the Nun and Luteau in the lead. Louis hoped that the walk to the bedroom would provide enough time for Felicie to escape and reach their supposed point of rendezvous. \"Always had a love for dancing, that one,\" Luteau said, filling the silence. \"Been dancing since she could walk, I think. Her parents left her here young. She was one year old, a wee baby, left in a basket. She got this notion,\" he laughed, waving his hand, \"that her mother was a dancer and that she wanted to be a dancer just like her.\" \"Was she given any lessons?\" Louis inquired, watching the children running in the courtyard below. \"We teach our orphans valuable lessons that could serve them in the real world and provide them with a career,\" scoffed the Nun. \"Dancing isn't often a lucrative or… honorable profession. We must protect our reputation, you understand.\" \"Of course, Madame. One could not worship God through the arts, only by sweeping floors and cooking dinner,\" he drawled. The Nun's cheeks blotched red. \"We want what that is best for them. Dreams are wonderful, but dreams are not reality. Dreams are buried because life is hard, brutal and without pity.\" Her words sounded recited. \"There we are. This is where the orphans sleep.\" She opened the door and led them into a large, cold room, filled with rows of metal beds, covered in straw mattresses and thin wool blankets. How the children did not freeze to death each night was beyond him. \"And this is her bed,\" the Nun led him to a deserted bed that didn't appear any different from the other beds in the room. No personal items in sight, except for a small shoebox with golden ballet shoes taken from the academy. She had nothing to call her own but the clothes on her back, did she? Luteau voiced his worry, \"Maybe she's in the courtyard – \" The door opened with a bang. All three turned around to face Felicie who stood, out of breath and bright-eyed, at the entrance to the room. \"M-Monsieur,\" she stuttered, the froze, apparently at a loss. Now that he looked at her, he could see the girl was a terrible liar. How on earth did she manage to deceive him for nearly two weeks? \"Oh!\" She jumped, looking sheepish again. \"About the – the shoes. And the dress. The – I meant, I mean, I didn't mean to take them. Honest! They didn't give me time to change –\" \"Felicie,\" he interrupted her as gently as he could. \"I am not here for the shoes. Or the dress, for that matter.\" \"O-oh. Right,\" she muttered. She toyed with the hem of her dress. \"May we speak?\" he asked her. The child nodded, yet neither of the caretakers moved. \"In private?\" he added, cocking a brow. Luteau grumbled something, then walked toward the exit and placed his hand on Felicie's shoulder, who looked startled by the touch. \"Meet me later in my office,\" commanded the Nun, then joined Luteau. She smiled at Felicie, but the girl flinched and moved to make room for the woman to pass. It seemed the girl was unaware that the odd two cared for her. Perhaps , he thought uncharitably, they did not . Crushing a child's dream for the sake of reality was not a good way to win her heart. He sat on the bed opposite Felicie's and gestured for her to join him. The girl was quick. She closed the door and sat on her bed, then looked up at him with an uneasy expression and uncertain eyes. She sat rigidly, joints locked and muscles frozen. It was as if she did not hold his hand with all her might, mere minutes ago. \"What were you doing under the desk?\" he inquired. The child grimaced, but when she noted his voice lacked the usual reprimand, she shifted uncomfortably and answered, \"I saw you. From the window. I was curious.\" She looked down, then up, then down again until she gathered her courage. \"You really want to adopt me?\" her voice broke on the last word. She sniffled and once again hugged her legs in front of her and wiped her tears on her apron. \"Really really?\" His handkerchief, he noted, was still held crushed in her white-knuckled fist. She did not use it to wipe her tears. For – no. This was not something he could do for someone else; not even for Odette. Looking into the child's broken eyes, wishing and hoping and yet so afraid to trust, he knew. He knew, deep in heart and his very being, that he could never let anything hurt the girl again. This vow, forged into the fibers of his soul, was made to never be broken. \"Yes, really really,\" he promised. \"If this is something you want, I would sign the papers and take you back to Paris.\" \"And… and the academy?\" She wanted to make sure. \"Even though you said…?\" \"Yes,\" he reassured her. \"My terms were too harsh. I was unfair to you.\" \"Why?\" she choked. Her eyes focused on him, hurt and too bright and innocent. He sighed, then confessed, \"I was certain of your victory. By the time Le Haut exposed you, I had already decided to give you the role of Clara.\" When Felicie's lower lip began to tremble again, he added, hurried, \"There are other roles, this audition doesn't have to be the end of your dancing career.\" Felicie nodded. Once again she wiped her eyes with a harsh, almost angry movement of her hand. She looked down, then up once more. She sniffled and wiped her cheeks again. \"You really think I could be a danseuse etoile? Like Rosita?\" Her voice held a budding of hope. That was slightly better than the broken notes from before. He huffed. \"You were not supposed to hear that. You are too young and undisciplined. However,\" he added when she pouted, \"you do show such potential. So yes, I think you can, but only hard work and dedication would make that possibility a reality.\" \"I can work hard!\" she declared, a hint of a flame in her eyes. \"You can ask Odette! I trained a lot. Odette has odd teaching techniques.\" She thought for a moment. \"But do you want me? Not… not who I could be, I mean, I mean now me. Do you want me?\" She placed her hand on her chest, then dropped it. But this time, she did not drop her gaze. Her question, so innocent, moved him. He remembered her hand, holding his. How should, or rather, how could he explain to her something so fleeting, yet with a mark so permanent? \"Yes,\" he said simply. \"We have not known each other long. Your true teacher, mentor, and caretaker was Odette, not me. However, Odette cannot afford the legal procedures of adoption –\" \"Did she ask you? To adopt me? For her?\" the girl fired. From her expression, he could not tell what answer she would like to receive. He decided to be honest with her, as honest as he could. He shook his head. \"She did not. I came… when I heard about your situation. When she told me.\" He paused, choosing his words with the utmost care. \"I know it is too soon, and I won't press you for an answer, but I intend to adopt you as my legal daughter. The road you will face will be challenging and difficult, but not dangerous or unrewarding. My demands from you include hard work and dedication, and in return, I would do my best to provide you with everything you may need. And be… be there for you in whichever manner you should choose.\" \"Like a d….\" She didn't finish the sentence. Instead, she looked down. \"Uncle? Like Clara's uncle?\" Louis blinked, baffled. \"The… godfather?\" He shook his head. \"You think me eccentric?\" Felicie frowned, confused. \"Odette said he was an uncle… or, like an uncle. What's eccentric?\" \"Odd, strange.\" He waved his hand. \"'Uncle' is a great suggestion.\" He rose. \"Very well. Think hard about what I said, and tomorrow –\" \"No – I mean, I mean 'yes,\" the girl interrupted him and rose as well. \"Yes.\" Louis frowned. He was not certain if this was a good or a bad idea. \"Felicie, this is an important decision, are you certain that you do not want to sleep on it? Think this through?\" The girl wiped her face one, final time. She took a deep breath, and when she looked up at him, all he could see was determination shining through the green. \"Yes. Yes. I never thought anyone would want to adopt me,\" she said, then explained, \"I talk a lot and I have red hair and Odette said I complain too much and I like you. Do you really not dance anymore?\" Louis stared, shook his head, and smiled. It was a small smile, yet the gesture elicited a giggle from the child. That fiery spirit should never be broken or tamed, he mused. \"Not professionally. Pack your items and meet me at that Nun's office,\" he instructed her. \"We have a long day's ride ahead of us.\" \"Okay!\" Felicie smiled. She ran, grabbed the ballet shoes and dress and ran back to him. \"I'm ready!\" Louis frowned, the sighed. \"Well, at least the horses won't be slowed down by extra weight.\" Once they've reached Paris, he'd have to take the girl shopping. Oh dear. Notes: Sorry for the wait! But at least the chapters are getting longer, so... worth it? Tell me what you think! It just seemed so odd to me that all Louis did was give Odette a room in the attic and that's it. So... there! Fixed it! Poor Felicie had quite a shock =) Also, I know the poem 'Do not go gentle into that good night' was only published in 1951, so Odette couldn't have referenced it, but I hope you can forgive me (I mean, the Statue of Liberty is green! Why?!) Please share your thoughts![Chapter 5] Louis opened his book and began to read, ignoring the child in front of him, who sat with her face plastered against the window. Or tried to. Every once in a while, Felicie would elicit a giggle or a gasp, and he could not ignore the temptation to look up and try to see the world through her eyes. Her childish awe and delight at anything from farm animals to windmills were, he had to admit, quite entertaining. However, after the first hour had passed, the view ceased to entertain the girl, who sat restlessly and aimed short, cautious glances in his direction. All he had to do, he knew, was wait. \"What are you reading?\" she asked, then cringed, discomfited by her own voice. \"Les Misérables,\" he replied. \"It looks long,\" she commented. Louis lowered the book slightly and cocked a brow. \"Correct observation.\" The girl evidently resisted the impulse to stick her tongue out in response. \"What it's about?\" A heavy question. He paused, trying to think which topics would be appropriate. \"The poor and the oppressed, lighting the match of revolution while forging love and kindness despite the many sorrows they experience.\" \"Oh.\" Felicie frowned at the book, her eyes suspicious. \"Do they win?\" \"I haven't got to that part yet,\" he replied, amused. He breathed deeply and observed her, noting her discomfort at his presence and her boredom. No, not boredom. The girl's eyes looked not dull, but curious. \"Tell me about yourself,\" he asked. Felicie seemed surprised. \"Me? Well. Uh.\" \"Eloquent.\" She scowled and folded her hands. \"I was getting there! I was born, my mom died. I think I was one, well, Mother Superior thinks I was one, and she said she's a great judge of kids' ages. She said I looked nine three times in a row. I'm eleven, by the way.\" She stopped and peered at him. \"Go on,\" he encouraged her, doing his best to keep a respectable expression. \"Well….\" The girl did not appear encouraged. \"Life at the orphanage is pretty boring. We did the same stuff every day – cleaning and bible stuff and cleaning and some history or math, I think. I didn't go to the lessons. And… and cleaning.\" She counted on her fingers. \"We cleaned a lot. Luteau took us to see a performance once – Mother Superior yelled at him for AGES – and… and yeah, I tried to dance like them.\" She glanced up at him. \"All of those ridiculous gestures on your second day at the academy… were those inspired by that dance?\" Louis inquired. Felicie grimaced. \"Well. I also improvised.\" When he snickered, she added, \"I got better!\" a scowl settled on her young features in response. \"Indeed, you have,\" he said. The compliment had an immediate effect – the girl stopped scowling and looked up at him wearing an expression that could best be described as starstruck. \"How did you get to Paris?\" \"Oh! It was a daring adventure,\" she declared. \"Victor and me – he's my friend since forever – we've been trying to escape… I don't know. A lot ,\" she emphasized. \"But then he had a plan.\" She paused to think. \"It was a stupid plan. He didn't look even a bit like Mother Superior, not even with a chicken for boobs, and –\" \"Pardon me?\" He must have misheard. There's no way that – \"He held the chicken under his robe. To look like… y'know. A woman.\" \"Right,\" he muttered. Felicie became more animated, her discomfort forgotten. \"But it was a stupid plan because the chicken woke up Luteau and he chased us to the roof and then Victor used his chicken wings – he built them based on chickens –\" Louis did his best to maintain his composure. \"Chickens, if I am not mistaken, don't fly.\" \"That's what I told him!\" The girl jumped in her seat. \"But we had to try because Luteau nearly caught us, so we ran on the roof and we flew! We did. For a bit. Then we landed on a cart and we had to run away from Luteau. I nearly lost my music box twice! But Victor saved it. And –\" \"Wait,\" Louis stopped her. \"What music box?\" Felicie sighed as the wind deserted her sails. \"When they found me, I had a music box with a ballerina in it. My mother was a dancer too, I'm sure of it.\" She looked out at the world passing through. \"It's broken now. Victor said he'd fix it, even though it was broken real bad and he's mad at me.\" There was a moment of silence during which Louis tried and failed to come up with anything that would cheer the girl up. \"Anyways, then we got on the train to Paris and we hid inside a box of apples but then Victor farted so we got out and he fell into the river so I had to find the Opera alone. Then I met Odette and she hated me at first but she let me sleep with her so I don't think she really hated me. Only a little bit.\" She shrugged. \"We cleaned the stairs together.\" \"The… stairs.\" Louis wondered why that detail was relevant. \"Yes! There were a LOT of stairs. We cleaned all night and in the morning the Madame made me clean again. I nearly broke a vase.\" She looked upset again. \"And then Camille broke my music box.\" Louis exhaled, feeling the child's pain, then frowned. The child still held his handkerchief wrinkled into a ball. Well, it seemed like he wasn't going to get it back. He discovered he could live in peace with that loss. \"How did you learn to dance?\" The girl swallowed. \"Odette made me do weird stuff, like jumping to ring a bell without splashing and cleaning the mirrors with my feet and hanging laundry while doing the toe thing on a barrel….\" \"The toe… thing,\" he repeated. \"You mean en pointe?\" he emphasized the correct term. Felicie shrank a little. \"Eh. Sure.\" \"So you did not actually see Odette dance?\" he persisted. His frowned deepened when the girl shook her head. \"How did you manage to mimic her movements and her… flair so accurately?\" \"She showed me parts of the movements, or she fixed them using her cane,\" Felicie said, confused. \"Why?\" Louis leaned back against the carriage. \"She was… ethereal. She could leap with grace the likes of which none could mimic, rise like a feather and descend like a snowflake, and float whereas others would have walked. Watching her perform was… the greatest of honors.\" He remembered watching her perform, how she could silence an entire room with a lift of her arm and captivate an audience show after show. And sometimes, after practice, she'd dance only for him… channel her soul through her body, grace and passion and love refined into art – fleeting and fading and uncaptured – for him. Only for him. To observe and never own and god, he never tired of watching. Felicie regarded him with awe. \"Could I ever be like that?\" she whispered. Louis cleared his throat, trying to also clear his mind from memories too pure and painful to be relived. \"Hard to tell. You have the passion of a demon, but to be like Odette, you must also have the grace of an angel and the refinement of the swan. You must learn how to be reticent, yet not restrained; expressive, yet not emotional; evocative, yet not provocative.\" Felicie blinked. \"I… do not know what these words mean…? I got the first part. I think.\" Louis sighed. \"I will hire you a tutor, as soon as possible.\" \"But why? All I wanna do is dance,\" she protested, lips curled into a pout. \"Ignorance is the mark of poverty; to advance, even in the world of ballet, you cannot rely on skill alone.\" For they would judge you, and revel in your ignorance, and tear you down if they even had the chance. But that he did not say. \"You probably know everything,\" she said with a sigh. \"And why is that?\" he cocked a brow at her. Did she try to insinuate he did not earn his position? He did not, however, think her to be capable of such level of subtext. \"You're really rich! You have a carriage and – and a top hat. And stuff.\" Well, it's good to know the girl knew how to recognize wealthy people; they owned carriages and hats. \"I was not born rich,\" he said. \"My situation wasn't far worse than yours when you first reached the academy.\" Felicie sat ramrod straight. \"You were an orphan?\" she asked, eyes wide. Louis exhaled, offering her a gentle look. \"No; I was a thief.\" \"A thief?!\" she exclaimed, disbelief poured into every word. She then shrank into her seat, ashamed of her reaction, but relaxed when he did not punish her. \"What'd you steal?\" she asked, voice hesitant. \"Food.\" Felicie stared, disbelief widening her eyes, then she swallowed and looked down. \"Oh,\" she whispered. The girl did not ask him any more questions. Instead, she stared out the window and played with his handkerchief. If he had thought the revelation would remove some of the walls between them, it did the opposite. He returned to his book and read until the sun began to set and the light was too fickle and weak to be reliable. He looked at the window, then at the child… who fell asleep. Felicie curled on herself and napped on the bench, unbothered by traveling rays of the sun or the occasional bump in the road. She was… sweet, he decided. So innocent and sheltered from cruel realities and taciturn word games. She only wanted to dance. Louis shrugged out of his coat and, after a short moment of hesitation, covered her small frame with the heavy fabric. \"Sleep well, Felicie,\" he whispered. He remembered poverty; and hunger. By mere chance, thievery – the mark of desperation – led to his salvation. He stole from the wrong merchant, snatched an apple and dropped three, then, a bitter chase – and which chase wasn't, when your stomach threatened to digest itself and your head spun and your legs burned with each tired step? – straight into Lucien. The ballet master of the Academy. The man who saw who he could become, if he were only given a chance. And he did. He gave him a chance. \"Come with me, boy, and leave this life behind.\" Louis did not hesitate; between him and the police, the choice was easy. He gave him his hand and his fate and did not look back, not even when his mother called him a burden and his father closed the door in his face. Some doors remain forever closed. Some doors, even money cannot open. Odette waited. Another day passed – another day during which the dancers whispered and Auguste marched the halls, his usual cheery smile gone. Another day without Felicie. But Lou said he'd bring her back. He looked at her like the old Lou – her Lou – did. And he promised. He promised, and though he promised her the world before, never was she so desperate for him to keep his word. And thus, she waited. While waiting, she cleaned the place he had arranged for her – a small spot in the attic with an old mattress and a window, offering the most beautiful view in all of Paris. This was the storage room for old props and sets, and this was where they practiced in secret, when they were young and unafraid. This was where he first kissed her, where he first vowed to give her the world on a silver platter. This was where they learned how to love. This was where their dreams were still innocent and pure. She scoffed at the dust and the memories. This was before he left to dance with other groups, on other stages, and make a name for himself. Before the fire. She dragged a second mattress next to hers and placed an old curtain over it, repurposed as a blanket. She dusted the old props and found a doll – one of Clara's old Nutcracker, no longer in use – and placed it near an old cushion she transformed into a pillow. Maybe, hopefully, Felicie would like it. It was not enough; the girl wanted to dance, not to dream of dancing, but all Odette could offer her was this – a place surrounded by objects that also, once, used to dance. Like herself, she thought . I suppose I am also an old prop, no longer useful. She cleaned and she sat and she waited by the window for the sight of fiery red hair running, because of course she would be running, back into her arms. When they reached Paris, gas lamps ruling over empty streets and twinkling stars lording over the vast, black sky greeted them. The hour was late – far too late, in his opinion, to go to the Opera, where Odette was waiting. And Felicie was already fast asleep… An excuse , his consciousness whipped his chest. You don't want to see her. You don't know what to say. How to explain yet another broken promise. Louis sighed and glanced at Felicie. He did not have the heart to wake her. Instead, he cradled her in his coat and carried her in his arms into his house. \"Eh, monsieur,\" muttered the coachman as he rushed to open the front door. \"Thank you, Philippe. See to the horses.\" \"Yes, monsieur,\" the young man replied as he hurried outside. Inside, Joséphine, the housekeeper, was visibly fuming. Her red cheeks and disgruntled eyes followed him as he climbed up the stairs into the guest room with the largest window. She would cause trouble later, he knew, but the shadow of worry failed to rear its head as he pulled the blanket aside and gently placed the child upon the bed. He covered her in the blanket, yet when he tried to retrieve the coat, the child clutched the fabric with her fist and refused to let go. Louis sighed. If he would not be careful, the child would end up hoarding his entire wardrobe. He closed the door gently behind him and went downstairs, ready to face the volcano waiting to erupt. \"Monsieur!\" He did his best not to lose his composure. \"Yes, Joséphine?\" He sank into his armchair, feeling thoroughly exhausted. What would he say to Odette tomorrow? What would she think? The ample woman fumed all the way to the kitchen and returned – still fuming – with a tray carrying wine, bread, and onion soup. \"What was that… thing?\" she demanded as she sat the table. \"That… rat! You did not run over her, did you? Pah! The police should do a better job clearing them off the streets and putting them into good, proper use –\" \"Silence.\" He rubbed his throbbing temples, trying, and failing, and trying again, to control his temper. His blood boiled and roared within his limbs, declaring war on eloquent words and rational thinking. \"That… thing, as you called her, is my adopted daughter,\" he said slowly, coldly, weighing his words with precision and care. \"You are to treat her as such.\" He was also called that. A rat. A burden. \"This is not a good idea,\" she protested. \"I told you before, I am telling you again, you can still marry – \" He hit the floor with his cane. \"Must I constantly remind you of your duties? You are to take care of the house and the household staff. That is all. My personal life is beyond your reproach.\" Josephine opened and closed her mouth three times before managing a coherent response. \"But that child – \" \"Your former master did the same when he left me this house.\" \"You were his successor!\" \"I was a poor boy with no future,\" Louis corrected her. \"This child is no different.\" With iron poured into his voice, he added, \"I expect you and every member of the household to treat her as my family. Is that clear?\" The woman's arms twitched in dismay. \"Monsieur!\" \"Is that clear, Joséphine?\" he repeated slowly, emphasizing every word. Joséphine shook her head, her white curls no longer bouncing yet still immaculate. \"But what about marriage, monsieur?\" She had a coarse voice and coarser manners. In her way, the woman tried to care for him. \"Impertinence,\" he muttered. \"You are dismissed.\" The old woman curtsied and left, still muttering. She left Louis with his wine and his soup and his thoughts. I asked her. Twice. She refused. Morning found him in a slightly better mood. A servant woke him with tea and a review of the day's weather, during which Louis mostly dozed off. He drank the tea, dressed, and walked downstairs, then sat at the head of the table where a cup of coffee and the day's paper waited for him. This time, the spot across from his was also arrayed. It was… an odd sight. The sound of feet rushing downstairs in an ungainly, loud manner made him roll his eyes and snap the paper open and read. Well, after a fashion. Felicie stumbled into the room with the finesse of a street urchin, which wasn't likely to win her any points with the staff. \"Oh,\" she managed. Louis turned a page. \"I think 'good morning,' is the proper phrase.\" \"Yes, ehm. Good morning… monsieur,\" she mumbled. Louis lowered the newspaper and looked at her. The girl stood, one leg hiding behind the other, eyes wide and nervous, hands clutching his coat the way one might a beloved toy. \"Sit,\" he ordered and gestured toward the chair across from his. \"How'd you sleep?\" Felicie sat, eyes dancing around the room in a frantic, bewildered manner. \"Oh. Erm. Fine. The bed was really soft. I thought it was made of clouds,\" she confessed, then blushed. He smiled. \"Goose feathers, but I can see the similarities. Was the room to your liking?\" \"It was too big. Um.\" She turned redder and shrank into the chair. \"I mean… sorry.\" He forced his forehead to relax. \"'Too small' is an issue; 'too big' is a matter of habit. You will get used to it.\" \"Right, sorry,\" she muttered, then squeaked when the maids entered, carrying trays. Dear me , he sighed. The maids placed identical plates in front of them in a lovely ceremony during which Felicie tried her best to hide in her chair. It would take her time, he knew. Hell, it took him nearly a month to learn to sit still, but he also had to face Pepita, who was far grumpier and less tolerant of mistakes. Joséphine entered with fresh fruit from the market and placed it at the center of the table. \"No coats near the dinner table,\" she chastised, tearing the fabric from the girl's hands. \"And no running!\" \"Joséphine,\" he said, his voice hard. The woman looked at him in defiance, then focused her glare on the child. \"You are a member of the Mérante house, now. Behave like it.\" \"Leave,\" he ordered, voice harder still. The old woman grumbled yet obeyed, leaving Felicie even more frightened than before. Louis pinched the bridge of his nose. He would have to arrange yet another talk with her. \"Eat whatever you like, and as much as you like,\" he said in an attempt to calm the child when Felicie just stared, eyes bewildered still. \"Pay her no mind.\" Felicie remained suspiciously quiet. When he looked up again, he saw she lifted – with the elegance of a newly christened thief – a slice of baguette and attempted, with her tongue sticking out, to spread strawberry jam on it, as thickly as she could. When the pink, sugary mess was thick enough to her satisfaction, she tried – a herculean effort, really – to bite into the baguette, which then slipped from her hands and fell onto the plate with a distinct splotching sound. \"Maybe put less jam next time,\" he advised. Felicie looked up and blushed, yet her mortified expression melted when she noticed his amused smile. She humphed, then lifted the baguette and shoved it into her mouth, then, after a valiant attempt at chewing with her mouth closed, swallowed with difficulty and continued to lick her fingers. She stopped when she saw his expression. \"What?\" she asked defensively, \"It was tasty!\" \"Was it? I thought you swallowed it whole,\" he reprimanded. \"Small bites, lips closed, and for heaven's sake don't lick your fingers.\" She pouted. \"But they taste good!\" \"If you ate slower, you could've enjoyed the taste baguette with the jam,\" he pointed out. \"Let us pretend that manners are like ballet. When in doubt, observe me to learn the right technique.\" He then picked a slice of the baguette and spread jam on it with two precise movements of his knife. Then, he sliced the bread in half and took a small bite. After he swallowed, he took the second slice and offered it to the child, his own slice left unfinished. \"Try.\" The girl accepted the slice with a suspicious frown. \"Can I add more –\" \"No. This is precisely the right amount.\" Felicie frowned, then took a bite – \"smaller\" – a small bite and chewed. \"Better,\" he offered. \"Don't forget to eat your vegetables.\" \"Vegetables?! But you said –\" a look from him silenced her. \"Fine,\" she muttered, then bit into a carrot with a pirate-like attitude. He had a lot of work to do. Odette scrubbed the stage with tired, aching motions. They rehearsed daily now, the month before the opening night, and the stage had to be perfectly clean before each rehearsal, lest a dancer slipped on a grain of sand and broke a leg. Lest they become like me. \"Odette!\" Odette looked up – was she imagining things? Was – after waiting for days and nights– was she – Felicie landed in front of her and hugged her, a bright smile lighting her face. \"Odette! I missed you, I really really missed you! A lot! I am so sorry really I really am!\" She stopped to breathe. \"I missed you.\" Odette, heart hammering, felt relief melting her frozen limbs. She exhaled weakly, then her hands – all on their own – released the brush and cradled the child to her, hugging her thin shoulders and wild, fiery hair. \"I missed you too, Felicie.\" She sighed. \"I am so happy you are here, and that you are safe.\" She should ask her to stay. Cleaning a stage was not the same as performing on it, but if it meant the child would stay close to her… \"You won't believe what happened!\" the child cried. \"Monsieur Mérante adopted me! Really fully legally and stuff! He even signed papers!\" \"Adopted… you?\" The ice crept back into her bones. The child, still dressed in her old rags, was fading from her arms; her world. Because Lou – no, not Lou, Mérante – would give her everything she could have ever wanted. She would dance and learn and wear pretty dresses… she'd have no use for a limping cleaner and a wooden nutcracker. She would not want to sleep on an old straw mattress and cover her body with a curtain or use an old cushion for a pillow. Lou promised he'd bring her back. Bring her back to me. He did bring her back. He brought her back and placed her just beyond my reach. \"Yes! I was so scared at first. I fell asleep on the carriage and when I woke up, I was in a huge bed in the biggest room ever!\" She tried to demonstrate with her hands. \"Then the maid said I need to go and eat breakfast and they served baguettes and jam! Can you believe it? Baguettes and jam! That's my favorite! And the baguettes were fresh and the jam had pieces of stuff in it, too!\" She smiled, then wrinkled her nose. \"But then Monsieur Mérante made me eat vegetables.\" She jumped and performed an excited pirouette. \"Monsieur Mérante said he was going to re-enroll me into the advanced class, with Nora and Dora! He told me not to tell the other girls. He said they'd be mean if they knew he adopted me. But Nora and Dora are fine, right? When I asked him, he just did the brow thing. Y'know, the brow thing? That thing.\" She demonstrated, trying to cock one brow and ended up lifting both of them. \"What do you think? You're very quiet.\" Felicie once again landed on her knees next to her. Her eyes, so bright a moment ago, darkened with concern. Odette plastered a smile on her face. \"Oh, what wonderful news. That's… that's perfect for you, Felicie.\" The girl tilted her head. \"Yeah. I don't know, though. He's really strict. He said I need to learn math and history and stuff, and that he's going to get me a tutor and a governess. And the housekeeper is super scary. I think she hates me.\" She looked away, then down, and her eyes focused on Odette's cleaning brush. \"I know! You should be my governess! You already teach me stuff! And Monsieur Mérante really likes you. I think. I'll ask him!\" \"You will do no such thing,\" Odette snapped. She closed her eyes and regretted her harshness. The child stared at her, her lips parted and her expression hurt. \"Why?\" she asked in a small voice. \"No… no reason. That's great news. It truly is.\" She tried to pour warmth into her words. She did not know if she was successful. Mérante was quick. He already taught the child to pity. Odette hugged the child close to her chest, cradling her head against her shoulder, and hoped – prayed – that it would be enough. I love you, Felicie. Please, do not forget that. She froze when she heard the familiar sound of dress shoes walking upon the wooden stage, then looked up. Mérante stood there, looking down at her, and his eyes…- Felicie turned as well and looked up, hesitant. Her confusion was evident, as if she did not know how to approach her new father. Mérante turned to look at Felicie, and his expression changed slightly; more distant, yet tinged with pride. \"I enrolled you. Go and change, now. Class starts in five minutes.\" \"Oh! Oh! Thank you! Really! You won't regret it!\" She jumped up until she landed next to him, but then the hands that rose to offer a hug hesitated and turned into fists. The child's smile of pure joy tempered into a grateful grimace, and she bolted out of the stage. \"I'll see you at lunch!\" she cried, waving Odette goodbye. Goodbye, Felicie, Odette thought, following her fiery red braid. Goodbye . So there she lingered, left alone with Mérante. She would have to crane her neck to look at him, like a dutiful servant, so instead she returned to her scrubbing, eyes looking down. A hand appeared in front of her with an offer of help. Would that offer also be a lie? \"Odette, please. Look at me,\" he whispered. His voice was gentle and warm and tinged with yearning, burning the final notes and curling within her stomach. The smooth baritone echoed as did the promise of touch, skin to skin, offered by his hand. \"I know this is not what you wanted, but please, hear me out,\" he said, low and deep and soft. \"I am not trying to separate you or keep you out of her life.\" Odette twisted her lips, then shook her head. \"Better than anything I could have given her. Be kind to her. She needs a father more than a teacher.\" Her voice was vacant. \"Odette, please –\" \"I have tired of your pity, Mérante.\" She ignored his hand and instead relied on her cane to help her stand. She sat for too long, however, and rose too quickly. Her leg chose that moment to betray her. A spasm of pain, so sharp it made the world spin and darken, shot through her ankle all the way up to her skull. She hissed – or cried out, she wasn't sure – and lost her balance. \"Odette!\" It took her a moment to regain her breath, and a longer moment still to calm her racing heart and shaking lungs. The ripples of the spasm still ricocheted within her body; her legs did not support her. But she was warm, so warm, and still standing. How could she be standing? Her hands twitched against a solid chest while her body was enveloped by muscular arms, supporting her, holding her. One hand cradled her head against his chest while the other held her at the waist. Her feet on the stage were an illusion – he was holding her up. She fell into Lou's arms. Lou… She breathed in the scent of nutmeg and clove and coffee and remembered times – forgotten moments, lost in paths not taken – that his scent was not so unfamiliar to her. She remembered times his arms were a home and his chest, her sanctuary. He would whisper poetry in her ears and hold her close, promising he'd never leave her side. The pain subsided. It reached a level that could be endured. \"Release me, Mérante.\" His fingers twitched in response, but he did not resist when she pushed him with her hands. His hands settled on her waist, still supporting her, but now her weight rested on her feet and the pain flared through the clenched muscle once more. She looked down and sucked in her breath. \"Odette, let me help you. Please, let me help you. Let me pay for the medicine –\" \"No,\" she muttered through clenched teeth. She closed her eyes and bit her lip and tried, with all her might, to breathe. \"Odette, please,\" he pleaded with her. \"I ask for nothing in return. You should rest and let your body heal. Please.\" \"I told you before,\" she whispered, voice barely heard. \"I do not want your pity.\" The hands that pushed him away now held on to his shoulders. Broad shoulders that, once, she would place her hands on as he lifted her to the sky… \"I do not offer you pity. I have never pitied you. I –\" \"You are never around, always making promises you cannot keep, and you expect me to trust you?\" she demanded and met his eyes. Finally, she found the courage to look up and – oh, damned be the soft brown, warm like the afternoon sun, glowing with flakes of gold and light and… yearning. Why the yearning? \"I know,\" he whispered. \"I know I have failed you. On too many occasions. I know. But please believe me when I say I only ever tried to be worthy of you. I never –\" \"Liar,\" she pushed him away and managed, somehow, to stand on her own. Her leg pulsed with pain and flames. \"Liar! You weren't there when I needed you. You signed some deals on the other side of town, then left to travel the world and dance and… and make a name for yourself while –\" She looked away, trying and failing to blink away her tears. \"You left me the moment the doctors said I could no longer dance.\" \"I didn't! I – Odette, please, don't tell me you think that!\" He grabbed her shoulders and held her, almost, but not quite, saving her from falling. His eyes never left hers. \"I only left to get the money for your medicine. We could not afford it, so I had to travel and –\" \"And it took you eight years to return? I don't believe you,\" she whispered, her voice flat and dead. \"I sent you checks with the money. I wrote you letters!\" His eyes searched hers, desperation bleeding through the brown. \"Odette….\" She remembered those letters; the letters she did not open. \"I did not want the money. I never asked for any.\" She could not stop. The words stumbled out of her lips, hurried and untamed. \"I wanted you by my side, I needed you to be there, and you weren't there, like you weren't there the night of the fire – \" \"I was there!\" he thundered. \"Accuse me of anything, but not this! I was there! I was the one to run into the fire and get you out!\" Odette froze, then looked up. No way, there was no way that… but his eyes held truth. Truth and pain and that longing that ensured she could not look away. \"You…\" she whispered, but her voice failed her. All she could do was look into his eyes and search, hoping and fearing and hoping despite the fear to find the answer buried within them. But he never looked away. His eyes never left hers, open and vulnerable and desperate. \"I never pitied you. I loved you from the day I first saw you dance, and I have never stopped loving you.\" His words pierced her chest, bleeding red within her veins and echoing in the chambers of her heart. \"I still love you. Do not…\" he whispered, then closed his eyes and clenched his jaw. \"Accuse me of pity.\" He opened his eyes and waited for her to say something; anything. He bared his heart before her, rekindling all of the promises she thought he had long broken. But all she could do was stare, dumbfounded and lost, at the man holding her up. The man she thought had left her, ten years ago, on the day her life ended. \"Lou….\" The nickname escaped her, broke through her lips and shattered against her tongue. His name. she had to say his name. The man exhaled in surrender. His lips parted, and his eyes, oh, his eyes, looking at her the way he did when – \"Monsieur Mérante! Monsieur – oh.\" And the magic broke. Lou turned around to look at Felicie. The child looked distinctively uncomfortable. She blushed and shuffled her feet. \"Um. You have class.\" The man grumbled a curse and turned to look at her. She did not know what he saw, but the fire died; his eyes, not a moment ago ardent, were now mere ashes. \"Of course.\" He released her shoulders and bent down to pick up her cane, which he offered to her. When she accepted, he offered her a small bow of his head and turned away. \"Forgive me. I lost track of time.\" \"It's… it's fine… uh….\" Felicie's eyes flickered between them with such urgency her hair escaped her ballerina bun. \"Come,\" Lou said, and placed his hand gently on her shoulder. His guiding touch led the child – who turned one more time to glance at her direction – away from her. Into the shadows. Notes: Sorry it took me so long to update! I was really sick the past two weeks... but now I'm better, so here's a chapter =) Please share your thoughts! I'd love to know what you think![Chapter 6] She did not love him. \"Again, mademoiselles.\" She did not love him. \"Again.\" Perhaps she never did. \"Again!\" Riding home with Felicie was a slight improvement over riding alone; when prompted, the girl would tell tales long enough to cover for his silence and mute his bitter thoughts. He hoped and hated himself for hoping that Felicie would speak about Odette. But the girl was sensitive – ever since she saw them together, and saw how they parted, she kept her stories focused on her adventures with her friends. She no longer mentioned Odette. He knew they still trained together, ate together, watched the rehearsals. He knew Odette was still a prominent figure in her life, and yet – Perhaps he had given the child too much credit; perhaps it was Odette who asked her to leave her name unmentioned. The thought stung. \"… And then Victor showed me the Statue of Puberty! It's a gift to America. How do you think they'll transport it?\" The question charged through his cloud of pessimism. He stirred in his seat. \"By ship, I'd imagine.\" \"It's very big,\" she pointed out. \"Not if they disassemble it,\" he replied. When the child frowned, he added, \"take it apart.\" \"Oh.\" \"Was this word not a part of your vocabulary list?\" he asked, cocking his brow. Felicie shifted in her seat. \"Eh. Maybe?\" \"Not a very good answer,\" he pointed out, brow cocked further. The girl pouted. \"I know – I'm trying! But I'm dancing all day and then….\" She stopped and worried her lip. \"I know you don't like excuses. I'm sorry.\" He did not like the wounded expression on her young face, and liked even less the thought he was the cause. \"You could bring your homework to the academy.\" \"But then I couldn't watch the rehearsals!\" \"You know the choreography by heart,\" he countered. \"What about the multiplication table?\" \"But….\" She tried to think of an argument, failed, and wrinkled her nose. \"Fine.\" \"Would you rather I asked the tutor to decrease your workload?\" he tried. Felicie looked down. \"He said I'm really behind.\" \"Is there any subject you require help with?'' he offered again. Perhaps he could sit with her during the weekends… For a moment, her eyes lit, before a grimace chased the light away. \"You're busy… It's fine.\" He pursed his lips. \"As you wish.\" He quelled his irritation and disappointment. Perhaps she was not yet ready to trust him. Instead of pushing the subject, he tried to offer her an incentive, \"Try to finish all your work before the weekend, if you want a proper wardrobe.\" That did the trick. The child no longer looked as if she couldn't wait for the ride to end. \"We're going shopping?\" she exclaimed, excited yet again. He stifled a cough. \"Josephine will take you. I have no knowledge… is that a problem?\" Felicie paled. \"N-n-no.\" He leaned forward, frowning. \"Does she frighten you?\" \"Eh. Maybe?\" Her lips twisted into a painful version of a smile. \"I just don't know… lots of stuff.\" The carriage slowed down until it stopped in front of his front door. Her shoulders slumped. \"I'll go and read, now,\" she muttered and dashed out the moment Philippe opened the door. \"Energetic little mademoiselle, isn't she?\" offered the surprised coachman. He wanted to reply when a shout caught his attention. \"…No running! How many times – \" Dear lord. He'd have to arrange a third talk with Josephine. And cancel the shopping trip. He marched inside to find Felicie plastered against the wall and Josephine towering over her. \"Proper ladies walk straight – and never, I repeat, never run! You –\" \"Felicie, upstairs. Josephine, silence .\" His order and the thunder of his cane echoed within the hallway. He focused his glare on the old housekeeper, daring her to challenge him. Felicie shot him a grateful look before dashing – that is, running – upstairs. \"Why you ungra-\" \"I said, silence!\" he commanded. Josephine flared her nostrils as she all but charged ahead. \"She is running!\" \"She is a child!\" He took a deep breath. Never before did he have to raise his voice on his servants. He stepped forward, glaring at the housekeeper. \"I won't have her feel uncomfortable in her own home .\" To Josephine's scoff, he added, his voice deep and laced with rage, \"I promised Lucien I will take care of the house and its servants. Don't force me to break that promise.\" He left the silent threat hanging between them. Josephine was a general, more than a housekeeper. She kept the house in order for forty years. In a way, this house was more hers than his or Felicie's. But to Felicie, he also made a promise. No, a vow. He vowed to give her a home. A home meant sanctuary, warmth, protection. Fear was not an emotion he wanted her to experience. When Felice returned to her, her glum expression faded and she offered her the brightest smile. \"Euh! I'm tired! You won't believe how many times we had to jump before Monsieur Mérante was satisfied! I'll tell you. It was….\" She tried to count on her fingers. \"A lot. Is a lot a number? The tutor said it isn't. Math is hard, don't you think?\" Odette smiled, then sank into the soft cushion of the theater seat. A week had passed since Lou confessed, yet she still had no answer to give him. After the lessons, she and Felicie hid in the theater to watch the rehearsals. Felicie, Odette was pleased to note, already knew Camille's part perfectly. And while she watched and learned, Odette waited for Lou… to do something. Anything. She knew she had to speak to him, to say everything she needed to… but how? Her mind was a hurricane of thoughts and emotions, but when she looked at Lou, she forgot everything she wanted to say. If the man knew she was watching him, he did not show it. But he knew Felicie was watching, since she had to wait for him to finish and had nowhere else to go, yet – \"No, no! Stop! From the beginning.\" The sound of his cane hitting the stage floor echoed in the theater. \"Once again, Camille, you are scared. The mice have come. You are terrified. Please, try to convince me of your fear.\" Felicie giggled. They watched as she finished the routine, somehow eliciting a grunt of defeated frustration from Lou before they moved on to the next scene. His voice was like… what did they call it? Electricity, running through her veins, rumbling within her muscles and dancing to the wild beating of her heart. His voice numbed her thoughts and the silent throbbing of her ankle. The velvety baritone made her close her eyes and dream of eyes, sparkling like smoky quartz, as deep and smooth as chocolate and as intoxicating as – \"By the way, look!\" Felicie showed her the music box, once shattered to pieces. Odette smiled at the simple music box, purer than her thoughts not a moment ago dared to be. She noted the miniature ballerina wore a dress with a similar sash to the one chosen by Felicie. \"Victor has worked a miracle! Who'd have thought? He just has the look of a total nitwit,\" she said, twisting her nose at the thought of the boy and his utter lack of manners. Felicie's smile faded as she gazed at the music box. \"He doesn't wanna speak to me ever again.\" Odette thought of Lou and smiled as her heart clenched in raw misery. \"He will,\" she promised. Will Lou? Felicie, perhaps guessing the subject of her musings, turned to glance at Lou, but before she managed to say a word, the man stirred from his spot within the shadows and marched onto the stage. \"No, no, no!\" he declared, stopping the music. Rosita did not move a muscle, but Camille looked defeated. Her shoulders slumped toward the floor. \"Here we go,\" Odette muttered. A part of her was pleased to see the rude, cruel child failing again and again and again, but she also pitied the girl, who was destined for disappointment; she was not the Clara Lou wanted, and therefore, her dancing could never please him. \"Stop! It's not that hard,\" he commanded, venting his frustration with every vowel. \"You are as cold as a stone statue. Mademoiselle Le Haut, you perform in three weeks, and so far, we have no emotion.\" \"But I'm doing exactly the steps you told me,\" the girl replied, breathing hard. Lou pinched the bridge of his nose. \"It's not enough to do the steps,\" he dismissed her. \"Find some anger or some pain or some love, but find something!\" His voice was almost pleading as he acted each of these words, trying to trigger something inside Camille's heart. The girl, Odette thought, was not so different from the plastic ballerina inside Felicie's music box. Perfect poise, perfect technique, yet no emotion of any sort. \"She lacks this,\" she said, pointing to Felicie's heart. \"Her dancing makes it clear.\" The music started and the ballerinas danced and Lou's expression turned darker and darker with each passing moment. The hour was late when he dismissed them. Rosita took Camille, placing a gentle hand on her shoulder as she guided her to the dressing rooms. It took Odette a moment to realize the child was weeping. It was not the child's fault, she wanted to say when Lou walked toward them. It's never the child's fault. \"Good night, Madame,\" Lou muttered with a small bow of his head. \"Come.\" Her heart skipped a beat when he spoke, lips muttering the invitation she longed to hear – But the invitation was not directed at her. Felicie gave her a parting hug and ran to join Lou, an uneasy smile on her lips. She even lifted her hand, as if hoping to hold his, yet Lou turned away before he saw the gesture. He did not reciprocate it. He did not hold the child's hand. Felicie's hand fell as did her smile. She locked her hands behind her back and tried to smile at him – offering the toothiest of grins she could possibly conjure – but Lou did not look down at her, and he did not see her smile, either. She should do something, shouldn't she? Anything. She did nothing. \"Come. You and moi are going for a drink.\" Louis rolled his eyes, then turned to stare at his boss. \"I'm busy.\" Auguste rolled his eyes. \"You are a walking nightmare, is what you are. You should not be allowed near children!\" He laughed, enjoying his own joke, yet the laughter did not quite reach his eyes. \"Right now, the production is a disaster,\" Louis dismissed him. \"I cannot drink during rehearsals.\" \"Hmm, lucky I canceled it, didn't I?\" Auguste said offhandedly. \"You what ?\" \"Rosita complained about you,\" the man said simply. \"Come now, they all need a break. Even the pianist is tired. So you, me, drinks!\" he sang, grabbing his shoulder. \"I know a great place! It has music, alcohol, ladies….\" Louis tried to ignore his already throbbing headache. Damn the man. \"I am not in the mood,\" he objected. \"If you did cancel the rehearsal, then I need to take Felicie home. Her tutor said her math skills are appalling.\" \"Pah! The poor girl.\" Auguste shook his head. \"One would've thought she was adopted by an entire school, not just one teacher.\" Yet the director did not give up as he dragged him toward their carriages. \"Let her enjoy her youth! I know! Tell your coachman to take her home, and you'll come with me!\" \"Auguste, this is hardly appropriate – \" \"It's the perfect plan! I must be a genius!\" He waved the coachman over. \"Take Felicie home, would you? Tell her we have gone away on important business.\" He clapped Louis' already aching shoulder. \"This old boy and I are going to relive the golden days.\" Louis pinched the bridge of his nose. \"What. Golden. Days,\" he growled, aggravated. \"Let's go and find out! Come, the city of light awaits!\" Auguste was a man hard to resist, but it was due to sheer strength rather than contagious enthusiasm. For his part, Louis did not feel affected. He resigned to climb into the ridiculously painted carriage and let Auguste lead. He was, indeed, tired. Auguste kept singing different opera verses, switching keys at will though remaining focused on the theme of unrequited love. Fantastic. As if his mind was not focused on Odette from the moment he woke up till the moment he fell under sleep's spell. Every sound, every whisper, every hint of brown in the corner of his eye made him think of her. Her steps; her voice; her hair. Her eyes, as bright as starlight, as she stared at him, bewildered and lost. It was her turn to pity him, then. Her turn, for her eyes held no love. Not for him. He gazed at the window, too exhausted to protest or try to act upon his irritation and murder the infuriating man. He stared at the shops, each decorated with red and green for the holiday to come, each looking like a perfect painting or a child's toy. Especially the toy shop. Felicie. He hit the top of the carriage with his cane twice. The coachman obeyed immediately and stopped the carriage \"Louis? What on earth are you – Louis!\" Louis opened the carriage door and exited, ignoring his bewildered friend. If he were honest, he himself was not entirely certain what he was doing, but he knew that he had to enter the toy shop, Auguste's plan be damned. \"Wait for us here, will you? Good lad – Louis!\" August exited the carriage and ran to catch up with him. \"What on earth are you doing?\" Louis let his actions speak for himself as he entered the toy shop, Auguste trailing after him in dismay. A young woman with a broom in her hands welcomed them, \"Sorry, monsieurs, we are closed – \" \"But we can make an exception for you. How can we help you?\" interfered an older lady. She observed their clothes and came to the correct conclusion that they might be worth her extra time. Louis stared at the mountains of toys and wooden horses and terrifying dolls in fabulous dresses, dumbfounded. It was all so… purposeless. What would a child like? What would Felicie like? The girl had one music box which she played nonstop. That's… all he knew about her. \"Ah, Madame, you are too kind,\" Auguste spoke instead. \"My friend here had recently adopted a twelve-year-old girl – \" \"Eleven.\" \" – and this charming, strong, handsome, rich man –\" Louis rolled his eyes. \" – is quite clueless. Can you help us find something a girl her age would like?\" The Madame blinked, then cleared her throat. \"Certainly. Follow me, if you please.\" She led them to the doll collection first. White faces with unblinking eyes gazed back, flaunting their tiny attires and offering a placid smile. \"This is our doll collection. We have modern dolls, dressed in the most fashionable cuts and fabrics,\" she paused and glanced at their direction, \"and we also have our historical collection of women throughout the centuries, from all over Europe. Our most popular is, of course, Marie Antoinette. Her dress is an exact replica of the dress depicted by Jean-Baptiste André Gautier-Dagoty.\" Auguste leaned forward. \"She looks positively haunted,\" he whispered, staring at the doll's vacant eyes. The woman gasped, affronted. Louis cleared his throat. \"Something of… use, perhaps?\" The Madame kept her expression pleasant. \"We have a selection of schooling material. Our chalkboards are of the highest quality. Our slates are writable on both sides, as you can see, and contain an abacus, to help one master the art of arithmetic.\" Auguste puffed. \"No, we are looking for –\" \"Perfect,\" Louis cut in. \"I'll take that and a box of chalk.\" \"You cannot be serious!\" Auguste protested. \"She is a child!\" \"She needs to learn,\" he replied. \"Her education is lacking.\" Auguste shook his head. \"You stopped the carriage to go to a toy shop, not a bookstore. Tell her, silvery moon, that you are embracing her!\" he sang. \"I refuse to sing love songs to a child,\" he commented dryly, rolling his eyes at Auguste's improper behavior. While he did so, his eyes caught the sight of an object slightly less terrifying than the rest of the toys in the store. \"You are like a man, possessed! First, you decide to adopt – spontaneously! A bad decision in my opinion, and now… where'd you go?\" Louis walked toward the toy and held it up. An… elephant, but soft to the touch and sweet to look upon. It had beady eyes and an impressive trunk. The green felt and the decorative saddle, as well as the long ears and the short, thick legs, made the toy look chubby and comforting. \"Ah, we just recently received this from Germany,\" the Madame said. \"They call it a plush toy.\" He remembered Felicie hugging his coat, as if it would – or could – offer comfort. The room was too big for her, she said. After sharing a room with dozens of orphans, she must feel alone. He gave it to the Madame with a nod. \"Would that be all?\" she asked. \"Yes, thank you,\" he muttered, distracted by the elephant's beady eyes. The toy looked oddly friendly. \"Well, guess there's no need for cognac to make you smile, eh?\" Auguste commented, thereby eradicating the expression from his face. Still, he hoped Felicie would like it. He returned from the pub, slightly inebriated, holding a stuffed animal and a slate, and stopped in front of the door. His door. The tall, heavy wood must look menacing to young eyes and weak hands. Do these doors fill her with dread or a sense of protection? A servant opened the door and snapped him from his reverie. Louis entered and, with a sigh, allowed the servant to help relieve him from his cane, coat, and hat. Edgar tried to take the gifts as well, but Louis refused. He did not want another to touch them. \"Is the child asleep?\" \"I believe she said she had some reading to do, monsieur.\" \"Hmm.\" Louis looked down at the gifts. The elephant stared back, a smile on its face. \"Thank you.\" \"Monsieur,\" Edgar muttered with a bow. He walked upstairs and sure enough, light beamed from the threshold. He knocked. No answer. He knocked again. \"Felicie?\" he tried. Still no answer. A small debate whether he, a man, can enter a girl's room ensued before the thought fire burned through his mind and his hand locked on the handle and opened the door with a thrust – No fire. The light was emitted by an oil lamp sat on a vanity, on which – instead of flowers or other feminine items – rested a pile of books, a mountain of crumbled pieces of paper, and a head with hair fierier than any flame. He shook his head and placed the slate next to the sleeping child. Her expression was triumphant, and her fingers were stained. The paper she used as a pillow was marked with at least ten multiplication tables. \"You worked hard,\" he whispered, \"I am proud of you.\" He moved the blanket and placed the elephant next to the pillow. Then, with hands slow and gentle, he took the sleeping child in his arms and carried her to the bed. \"Sleep well,\" he whispered, then covered her with the duvet. He brushed the hair from her face and no longer tried to fight the smile her sleeping features invoked in him. Perhaps Odette could no longer love him; perhaps his failures were too much for her to ever forgive. Perhaps it was too late for them, but perhaps – if he tried hard enough – Felicie could, one day, see him as a father. Not because of duty, but because of love. I cannot fail her , he vowed. Never. Author's notes A bit of a lighter chapter. Expect drama next week! Still, what'd you think? Let me know in the comments! ","Summary":" The curtain rises, and her world is filled with light. She looks up, not at the sea of faces but se"},{"Movie":"Cursed","Title":"Ties that Bind","Author":"Lady Grail","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11185075","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Elle stood over the body of the werewolf on the floor and the armed cops and animal control officers made crud jokes and comments to one another. The monster's brains were on the floor and Elle knew that she and her brother were free, free of this curse. Elle could still feel her heart pounding in her chest and the aura of adrenaline left her shaky and in shock. \"It's over right?\" Jimmy asked. Elle looked at him and saw the same signs of worry and fatigue. She took a deep breath and composed herself; she had to be strong, for him. \"Joanie's dead, so we're OK now…\" Elle trailed off. \"Well, that's subjective, we still have to go back to our pathetic pre-cursed lives.\" \"I'm personally ok with that.\" Giving him the big sister look. His ability to make jokes after all the death and destruction was so, so, Jimmy. \"Well you're not in high school,\" Jimmy teased. Elle had to smile. They walked out the side exit trying to avoid the police as much as possible. At some point, Elle knew someone would track them down; ask a million questions, but not tonight. Not with the body of a skinny blonde naked woman lying on the floor of the ruined club with god only knows how many police bullets in her. All Elle wanted to do was to get home, shower and crawl into bed and forget this night, as if that was even possible. Elle and Jimmy returned home to find the door wide open, claw marks everywhere and dog food scattered across the kitchen floor. Elle looked about expecting Jake to be there, could he have done all this? \"What happened?\" Elle asked. She has worked so hard to keep the house like their parents had left it before they died. It almost broke her heart but she let that sadness turn to anger and annoyance to give her strength to keep on going. \"Zipper,\" Jimmy said. He still could not believe that a dog bit a werewolf and turn into a worse monster. He looked around and based on how Elle was standing he knew she was pissed which made Jimmy feel even more guilty. This mess, at least, was his fault. \"Are you OK?\" Jimmy asked looking at the mess. \"I will be.\" Elle said and began to pick up pots and pans to put on the counter to wash. Elle was in battle mode as she attacked the mess with her cleaning, but even with this distraction she could not help but think about Jake. He had tried to explain things to Elle before Joanie attacked and she never gave him the chance. All Elle could think about was how Jake had put himself in front of Elle to fend off Joanie before she attacked and while she…changed. Joanie had been merciless. Elle could still see the blood where she had torn into Jake. Supposedly werewolves were supposed to heal, but he did not get up, and even as she played back the moment in her head, Elle could swear she saw his inside leaking out. Was he dead? With too many people in the club, Elle had not taken the time to look for Jake, and now, despite everything, she felt guilty that she had not checked for him. \"What's wrong? Are you worried about Jake?\" Jimmy asked. \"His secret is out, he had to disappear.\" Elle cringed and cleaned faster. \"I don 't want to talk about it Ok?\" Elle said. Cleaning had always been her great coping skill. \"I know you think that he's a good guy, Ellie,\" Jimmy said, trying to convince himself as much as her, Damn it he had liked Jake! Bastard! \"But don't forget, all of this…everything we've been through, is because of him. When it comes down to it, a monster is still a monster.\" \"Jimmy that's enough,\" Elle snapped. \"I guess some things never change.\" Jimmy pouted. Elle let Jimmy's words sink in. He was right. How close had they come to being monsters themselves? Elle didn't even want to think about what that life would be like. \"Do you think you can get us some light?\" Elle asked. \"Yeah, yeah. I'll check the circuit breaker.\" Elle started to clean and heard a noise. \"How are you doing with those lights?\" Elle called. \"Yeah, one second.\" Jimmy yelled and fiddled with the electrical panel shocking himself on the circuit breaker. \"Shit!\" \"Is everything ok down there?\" Elle called. \"Yeah it's fine, I just….\" The lights flicked on. \"Thank you.\" Elle called. She finished sweeping in her little corner of the kitchen and turned towards the fridge. Brushing the broom across the floor, something shiny caught the light. Elle leaned down and picked up the silver-serving knife that had been from her parent's wedding. As she held the handle, something changed as smoke and burning started. Elle tried to hold on but the pain was too much. Elle's heart was racing and she looked at the clock, it was close to midnight. Something was wrong! Heart racing Elle backed away from the knife as if that would change anything. They were supposed to be free! Joanie was dead, right? Elle wanted to yell for Jimmy but a wave of pain dropped her to her knees. Meanwhile in the basement, Jimmy was going through his own changes. Looking at the burn on his fingertip, Jimmy watched as the flesh went from burnt red to healthy pink in seconds under the swinging basement light, but then his watched in horror as claws began to form. Heart racing, Jimmy watched as claws popped out of his sneakers as he heard his sister scream. Faster than he thought possible Jimmy was up the stairs and back in the kitchen where he found Elle on the ground in pain. \"What is happening?\" Elle asked as her gold eyes flashed pain and desperation. \"This shouldn't be happening!\" Jimmy said. \"The curse should be broken!\" \"It's not,\" Elle growled, getting to her knees. Now it was jimmy's turn to be bent over double by the pain of the change. It was all Elle and Jimmy could do to fight the change and keep on breathing. Then the door opened. Bo stood in the door way, holding a something tightly in his hand, with such a puppy dog look on his face that Jimmy was startled enough to forget his own pain. But then the wind hit and all that changed as both Jimmy and Elle caught the scent of blood. Clenched in Bo's hand was a dog collar that was soaked in dried and sticky blood. \"They shot your dog…\"Bo said choking out the words, and then he saw Jimmy's eyes and froze. \"Zipper,\" Jimmy managed to say, but it was Elle who took action. \"We need to get out of here before we hurt someone,\" Elle said grabbing Jimmy's arm and pulling him past Bo. All Elle knew was that Jimmy smelled like food. The dog blood on the collar made it worse, like an appetizer for the main course. All Elle knew was that she was going to do everything in her power that if she and Jimmy were going to turn into monsters at least they would not be murders. Bo grabbed Jimmy's arm. \"Let me drive you.\" \"Are you nuts,\" Elle growled.\" \"Think about it, you are in the middle of the city, if you are going to change, then you need to get the hills,\" Bo said. \"Elle, he's right,\" Jimmy, said, being over double again as fangs formed in his mouth. Elle felt the same wave but managed to hide it as her hands grew claws and dug into Jimmy's arm. \"Ow!\" Jimmy snarled but some how the pain pushed back the change, and he looked more, human. Elle and Jimmy exchanged a look. \"Hit me,\" Elle ordered. \"What?\" Jimmy stammered. \"Hit, me!\" Elle snarled, \"It is slowly the change.\" Without another word, Jimmy lashed out and popped Elle in the nose. Red and stars flashed before her eyes but the pain of the change retreated. \"Get in the car.\" Bo said and slid into the front seat. \"We don't want to hurt you,\" Jimmy said. \"Then get in,\" Bo shouted as the engine roared to life. Elle pulled Jimmy into the back as the car screamed out of the driveway fully speed. Elle and Jimmy hunkered low in the back seat, hands on each other's arms, fighting the change. Every time something flared up and forced claws, fangs, or fur to surface, Elle and Jimmy dug their claws into one another's forearms. Blood was all over the back of Bo's leather seats as their feet tore through their shoes into the soft leather and foam. Bo, despite all the growls, snarls, rips, tears, and whimpers kept driving full speed in the mountains of Mulholland. Granted there were multimillion-dollar houses up here but also the wild life reserves that had less people. Somehow he managed to get to the trailhead, and slid into the dirt. Elle and Jimmy leapt out of the back of the car. Elle took off full run into the hills. Jimmy paused to look back at Bo. \"Go!\" Bo yelled. Jimmy nodded his shaggy head and took off into the night. \"Take care of each other,\" Bo said and turned to survey the damage done to his beautiful car.[Chapter 2] Ties that Bind Ch. 2 Elle and Jimmy tore through the underbrush of the southern California canyons. There were moments when the breaking and reforming of bones, tissues, fur… stopped them in their tracks, but the supernatural drive to run pushed them on. For the moment the only thing either of them could focus on was the need to hunt …and to feed. The smell of the late night wilds of the southern California brush land that filled the valley was overwhelming to the senses. Each tree, plant, bug and critter had its unique smell and even in the dead of night they were not alone. Digging into the soft earth they ran. The scent of human hikers, bikers, and other wanders were vague but still present. The wind changed and a new, fresh smell filled the air. Jimmy turned and drew the eye line of Elle towards a small light in the distance. Without a sound, they turned in unison and began to run towards the light. Nestled in the canyon was a small tent that looked almost like a glowing little pimple against the dark under brush and the shade of an old oak tree. The hot and sweaty smells filled the air that stirred the blood of both the wolves. The instinct of hunt grew stronger. Elle froze. Her human memories flooded in against the new desire to kill. Each part of the wolf in her called to give into her desire to attack and she could remember back to when she tasted blood back at the studio and how hard it had been to not attack her co-workers. Something about that memory snapped her back to her human senses and she tackled Jimmy so as to stop him from attacking. There was a scream from the girl when the couple heard the wolves growling, snarling and fighting but Elle was able to push Jimmy back and they slid further down the canyon and in the dirt. Elle dug her claws into her brother as his teeth dug into her arm. Somehow as the pushed and rolled and fell into the cactus that seemed to wake them both up as the brambles and thrones tore into their fur. It hurt but at the same time it was enough to help them stop and stand facing one another panting for breath. Elle tried to talk. Joanie had been able to speak somehow when in her werewolf form but the words refused to come and came out as whimpers and grunts and high pitched whines. And yet Jimmy seemed to understand. He backed down, ears back and whimpered. His stomach growled and he looked back the direction they came from. Not far from their spot a branch broke and both the wolves froze, ear up, and took in a deep breath. The scent of a deer caught their attention. As if there was a cue, they crept back down the canyon away from the campers and other humans. The deer stood down wind, even then the two knew they would have to take care to surprise the doe. With the new instincts and hunger so strong they fell upon the deer. The poor creature did not have a chance. Elle grabbed the head and a sound of the crack startled her as she twisted the neck with her claws. The blood that poured through her fingers and the hunger took over. Jimmy was already face first into the belly of the deer digging into the vital organs. Elle could not hold back any longer and she turned and joined her brother in feeding and let the darkness of the wolf over take her.[Chapter 3] Ties that Bind Chapter 3 Instinct is a funny thing; despite all that she had been through Elle could not help but be protective of her brother. This was her fault because she had been the one who had failed to keep him safe. Even in the darkness with the scents and smell of the California wilderness pressing in around them, she kept her body between their opening of the burrow and Jimmy's sleeping form. Still, this also had several disadvantages since neither one of them had a scrap of clothing left after the shift that had occurred under the full moon. Jimmy had one arm over her stomach and was spooning her. Elle had been awake for some time and was very aware of the attributes that made her brother a normal red bodied male. Still she did not move. The leaves under her skin itched and the dirt had absorbed the warmth of their bodies. Elle was surprised at how warm Jimmy's skin was and remember that Jake always seemed to run hot when she touched. Just thinking of Jake made a clenched knot in her stomach. Why hadn't it worked? Elle's thoughts once again returning to the image of Joanie's corpse on the floor with her brains blown out. The legend had said that if you kill the werewolf who bit you that you would become human again. Elle suppressed a shudder. She wasn't human any more, and the legend had been just that, only a legend. Elle hated to admit it, but the only one she could turn to for answers was Jake. Elle remember the night when he had stopped her, when she had seen the Mark of the Beast on his hand as be broke the window to her car and stolen her keys. She had been so afraid of him, afraid of what he was and what that meant. But more importantly, she remembered the look in Jake's eyes as he tried to explain to her what was going on. Memories flashed to the pain hidden there and the need to explain but to something else as well, something that was more of a predator as he tried to have her see past her fear. A branch broke nearby and Elle went ridge. She used every part of her new werewolf senses to try and make out if the noise came from an animal or something else. It took her a few moments to realize she was not the only one frozen and listening. Jimmy had gone ridge behind her, his hand pressed now firmly into her waist. Elle turned to look back at her brother as he flushed crimson at his own n***. She shook her head and lifted one finger to her lips to remain silent and mimed with her fingers that she would move forward and check things out. It was written all over Jimmy's face that he did NOT think this was a good idea but she gave him her best big sister look that said 'Deal with it'. Elle pushed herself onto her hands and knees as Jimmy silently moved back. The sudden loss of his warmth was almost unnerving but Elle pressed on. With slow steady progression she lifted one foot up and then her hand, moving slowly so as to not make any noise as she moved. Her body responded in ways she could not believe as she moved out of the burrow and into the brush. Looking out into the sunlight, Elle realized they had found a spot under an old oak tree that provided her with ample covering and numerous wet damp leaves to hide the sound of her movement. Still it was not enough. \"I know you are there,\" a familiar voice said. Elle froze. Jake was there. Peering through the leaves, Elle could see him with a bag and backpack in hand, dressed in torn jeans, grey t-shirt and simple canvas shoes. A small growl escaped her lips on its own and Jake's gaze immediately shifted in her direction. \"I came to help,\" he said, and tossed the bag and backpack at her. The bags barreled through the brush and Elle caught them. She looked back at Jake who nodded and stepped away. Elle watched as Jake moved away to give her space. When he was a good distance off, she opened the bag. At first glance it held baby wipes, tooth pastes, water, and shoes. Elle tossed the backpack over her shoulder and headed backwards towards the burrow. Jimmy was there doing the best to cover himself with his hands. Elle tossed him the backpack. \"Can we trust him?\" were the first words out of Jimmy's mouth. Elle shrugged. \"I don't know but I want to get all this blood and mud off.\" With that Elle dug out the baby wipes and began to furiously rub her skin as she turned her back on Jimmy. She could hear the zipper open as he tossed over her head something clothing. Already, by scent, Elle knew that these were her clothes. Jake had grabbed her a sports bra, underwear, sweat pants, and a t-shirt. The simple canvas shoes that were in her bag looked cheap and brand new. \"Can you get my back?\" Elle asked handing the wipes to Jimmy. \"Sure if you will do mine,\" he said wiping down between her shoulder blades in a smooth even stroke. Elle nodded and allowed Jimmy to clean her while she finished with her stomach, legs and chest. They were rapidly going through the wipes but being clean made her feel almost human. It was short work to wiggle into her clothing and turned to help Jimmy. He already had on pants and shoes. Elle made short work of cleaning his back. They used up the tooth paste and drank the water before cleaning up and stuffing all the used wipes, bottles, and toiletries back into the bag and the bag stuffed into the backpack. Without a word Jimmy slipped on the backpack and stood up. \"We need answers,\" he said. Elle knew he was right but she still was nervous about facing Jake. All this time Jake had been a werewolf and hid his true nature from her and now more than ever she was questioning whether or not her feelings for him had been real or merely part of the power a werewolf seemed to have. Jimmy had called it an aura that made werewolves irresistible to the opposite sex, but now things were different. Elle lead the way back towards where Jake was sitting. He looked almost peaceful in the grass as he over looked the canyon. Elle stood there a moment watching him, a jumble of emotions, needs, and twisting thoughts. \"What happened?\" Jimmy asked, and with that one sentence, it covered so much and so little. Jake turned towards them. \"Can we talk?\" \"No, you can explain,\" Elle said suddenly angry. \"Why did the cure not work?\" The moment the words left her mouth another realization hit her and she choked out the next words. \"Joanie's not dead.\" \"Oh, she's dead alright,\" Jake said. \"Then why did we change?\" Jimmy demanded. Jake let out a sigh, \"Because of me.\" Elle's eyes went big,\" But you didn't bite us.\" Jake shook his head. \"It doesn't matter. Joanie became a werewolf because of me. I was born a werewolf, so the source of the curse comes from me.\" \"So, you bit Joanie,\" Jimmy said. Jake's eyes narrowed. \"No, she bit me. Until then I thought only a bite from a werewolf could change a person, but now I know different. The curse is in our blood.\" \"Great, so because Joanie was a sadomasochistic psycho b*** were are stuck like this,\" Jimmy said. Jake just nodded. \"That's one way to put it.\" Elle had an enough, the dread, fear, and terror suddenly poured over her and she started to hyper ventilate. Both Jake and Jimmy were at her side as she knelt in the dirt. \"Elle, breathe,\" Jake said, showing her how. \"Elle, its ok,\" Jimmy said and Elle just shook her head. \"It's not ok, I can't live like this, you can't live like this, Ohgodohgodohgod!\" Elle panted. \"You can and we will,\" Jimmy said, \"Just breathe.\" Elle curled into a ball and screamed, letting out all the tension and fear. Something about that primordial sound cued something deep in Jimmy and Jake. For a moment their eyes changes from human to the golden fire of the werewolves they were and each reached down and held Elle as she wailed and wept in their arms. For a time they just stayed there holding one another. Jake continued to whisper words that neither Jimmy nor Elle could recognize but something about them made both their hearts slow and a calm filled them. Jake was stroking Elle's hair and Jimmy rubbed her back after slipping his hand under her shirt. Skin to skin contact seemed to help Elle get a grip on herself. \"Thank you,\" she whispered and pulled away from the boys. They let her go a few feet off and compose herself. \"What happens next?\" Jimmy asked Jake. Jake had to admit that he was impressed with how Elle and Jimmy had handled their first full moon. That after tracking them from the camp where the campers had been it still surprised Jake that they had not killed the human couple upon finding them. Jake could remember how it was to watch new werewolves react on instinct and kill whatever prey happened across their path after the first full moon. Jake was certain that Joanie had killed and he had blamed himself for not paying more attention to the news and reports of animal kills in his area. Jake looked at the two of them. Each one radiated anxiety, fear, and a desperate need for a pack and someone to lead them. Jake silently cursed himself. This was why he left back east; why he was so careful not to bite anyone, and why he played the field. He hated responsibilities, hated having people need him. Why then did he come out here? When things got complicated, he ran, it was what he did. Elle looked up at him with those big brown eyes, and there was something raw there, a hurt that he wanted to fill. Before it was what had drawn him to her, what tempted him in for what he thought would have been a one night stand, but once he had her, knew her, things had changed. There was a strength in her, something beyond the vulnerable face. Even now, when he had found them, he had seen it in the way she protected her brother. \"First, we need to get back to civilization, people will have questions and personally I don't want a search party coming after any of us.\" Jake offered Elle his hand. \"Look, I know this is going to be hard and I will answer all your questions best I can, but things are going to be much harder.\" \"Is there a cure?\" Elle asked. Jake winced. \"Yes, and no.\" \"What does that mean?\" Jimmy asked, clenching his fists. \"Look, this is not the time or place to talk about this,\" Jake said trying not have his own hackles rise in response to the younger wolf. \"When is the right GOD DAMN TIME?\" Jimmy snarled. Faster than she could blink Jake had Jimmy on the ground, pressed into the dirt, with Jake's knee in his chest. Both had sprouted claws, fangs, and eyes, but it was Elle reaction that caught all of them by surprise. She was small but fast, her own claws were embedding in Jake's neck a fraction of an inch from his artery and windpipe. \"Let. Him. Go.\" Elle said in a low steady voice, still human. \"Steady, let us step back.\" Jake slowly reverted to his human form. Elle's claws retracted and even Jimmy shifted back. Elle kept her fingers on Jake's neck until Jimmy could wiggle out of range. Jake started again. \"We cannot keep fighting one another. You are young and new to this,\" Jake shot Jimmy a hard look. \"One day, when you know more, and have more control, we can do this dance again, but I do not want to kill you,\" Jake looked at Elle. \"Either of you, but if you force me to, I will.\" \"Why did I do that?\" Jimmy asked, looking down at his human hands. \"For wolves, especially who are new to a pack, the battle for dominance is a constant struggle until that is determined. You don't see me as your alpha yet. However I was hoping your human side might be stronger and allow you to accept me as your alpha.\" \"Why would we do that?\" Elle asked. \"Werewolves are strong, stronger in packs. But we are also human, and our people side is the one that can make or break us.\" Jake took a step away from the siblings. There was more to packs that the simple explanation he was offering. A pack could be so many things, a family, a cult, an enclave, or a prison. \"I know I cannot answer all your questions here. I do not want to fight you either.\" \"How can we trust you?\" Elle asked. \"Right now, you can't, and I understand that. I will have to fight to earn back your trust, Elle. But for the moment, I am all that you got.\"[Chapter 4] Ties that Bind ch 4 The journey back to human civilization to less time than Elle had hoped. The three of them moved incredibly fast and made it to the car that Jimmy and Elle had abandoned in their rush to get away. Jimmy stopped dead as they approached the car. Elle kept her eyes on the old Jeep that was parked next to the sports car, it was easier to wait a moment before she forced herself to look at the damage done. Elle turned to look at the car, half wondering why it was still there. Bo was thankfully nowhere nearby and his scent was faint mostly coming for the car itself. It was quick to see the reason for the abandonment of the car. Both front tired were full of what appeared to be thorns, and slash marks. How had that happened? Elle wondered as they approached but it was the carnage in the back seat of the car that made her give a small gasp. Jimmy just was dead quiet looking at the wrecked leather, torn carpet, and claw marks that decorated the interior. Thankfully there were no signs of blood. The fragments of their clothing were strewn across the floor and in front of the car. Thankfully Elle could see the foot prints in the dirt leading back to the road, or what could have been a dirt road and back towards town. Hopefully Bo had managed to catch a ride back into LA. \"I can't believe we did this,\" Jimmy said. Elle nodded. Jake shrugged and walked over to the jeep unlocking the door. \"I'm more impressed that neither one of you tried to eat the driver,\" Jake said as Elle and Jimmy both shot Jake a pained look. Jake held open the door, \"Actually, you two have kind blow away the curve when it comes to being a bitten werewolf. Most times, they act more like Joanie, and have to be put down, once they are discovered.\" \"Is that what you were planning to do if you found her?\" Jimmy asked. Jake shrugged again. \"If she crossed my path, especially on a full moon, probably, but I wasn't hunting her.\" Jake, turned to the back door and held it open for Elle. \"Hop in.\" Elle looked at the open door. In the back of her mind the wolf silently whined about getting into an enclosed space, but Jimmy seemed to have no issues as he walked around and climbed in on the other side. Elle, let out the breath she had been holding and looked at Jake. \"I want you to tell us what you can. I want to know why you didn't stop her when she was killing people.\" Elle held Jake's eyes with a stare that bordered on calling out her wolf. He held her gaze, before giving her a curt nod. \"Fine, get in.\" Elle ignored his out stretched hand and climbed into the car next to Jimmy. Despite being buckled in, she still pressed her body in front of his, giving him her back. Jimmy was wise enough not too comment or maybe it just felt safe to him as well. Jake started the Jeep and the engine roar made Elle jump a little, and Jake pulled back into the dirt and on to what was a road of sorts. The crunch of the gravel and tires, along the new myriad of sounds that flooded the car, kept both Elle and Jimmy quiet overwhelmed until Jake made it back onto the pavement. After a few minutes to acclimate Elle, found her voice. \"Why were you not hunting Joanie the moment bodies started to show up?\" Elle demanded. \"Didn't you care? Or heck even worry about being found out?\" Jake ground his teeth and took a breath counting slowly to ten in his head before responding to Elle. Granted she was new, she was scared, and needed to exert some control, but he hated to questioned like that, as if this was all his fault and that he had almost planned for these terrible things to happen. \"I was worried about being discovered,\" Jake said slowly. \"That is why I tried to stay out of it. I figured there might be another werewolf in my territory and in all honesty I just didn't want to get into a fight over it. Most time, lone wolves just pass through, and if something like Joanie happens, well they take care of it.\" \"But you made Joanie,\" Jimmy said. \" \"Yet I did not know that,\" Jake shot back. \"I knew, knew for certain I had not attacked or bitten anyone in over a decade. I knew it was not my doing.\" There was silence for a moment. \"But it was,\" Elle whispered. Jake slammed on the break and pulled off the road, he turned in the seat leaning over at Elle and Jimmy. She went into a protective posture immediately putting her small form in between the big bad wolf and her pup of a brother. \"I know,\" Jake said through clenched teeth, his fangs digging into his gums. Elle never backed down, never dropped her gaze and held up her chin, perhaps not realizing the perfect line of her neck bared before Jake, was as much of a challenge as actual words. Both sat there staring and fighting to not surrender. Jake broke first, he pulled back, blinking furiously bringing his human side back into control. \"I know that it is my fault now, I did not know it that the time,\" Jake looked away. \"I regret it, I regret I could not help her, and that she didn't tell me.\" Elle held her tongue. Joanie had been a real bitch even as a human. She loved the power struggle and to belittle others. Being a werewolf had only made her deadly and even more power hungry. Jake looked back at her. Elle had remembered when Joanie had confronted them in the night club before all hell had broken loose, Jake had offered to help, to teach her control and that bitch had mocked him before digging her claws into his stomach and trying to kill him. \"Sorry,\" Elle said. Jake shook his head. \"It is hard for all of us. We keep reacting to one another.\" \"Yeah what is up with that?\" Jimmy asked. \"You too are just too new,\" Jake smiled. \"You don't fully understand all the non-verbal body language you keep transmitting that just, well raises my hackles. I should know better.\" \"Does it get any easier?\" Elle asked. Jake for once did not give a quick answer. \"That is up to you, but from what I have seen thus far, yeah, it gets easier.\" He turned back to the car, checked the road and pulled back onto the asphalt. Elle sat back thinking for a moment. Jimmy, she realized had been absentmindedly rubbing her back. The physical contact made her feel better and seemed to give him the same reassurance. \"I am taking you home,\" Jake announced. \"I am sure people will turn up with questions, we better get your story straight.\" \"Well we can always tell them that we're just a bunch of were wolves out for a late night howl,\" Jimmy said. \"Jimmy!\" Elle said, but it was Jake who laughed. \"I doubt that will be good enough. How about your dog went crazy and you ran because you were afraid for your life.\" \"It's a start,\" Elle said and the three of them began to discuss their options, as the sun rose higher in the sky. Elle had to admit things felt surreal and yet almost comfortable. She caught herself wondering, Am I comfortable being a monster? t ","Summary":" Elle stood over the body of the werewolf on the floor and the armed cops and animal control officer"},{"Movie":"Cursed","Title":"Territorial","Author":"Totally-Out-Of-It","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6704776","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I am so indescribably happy about this story. I've read practically every story (in English) for this fandom involving Bo and Jimmy and now I'm finally contributing to it. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I enjoyed writing it! Territorial Bo's dealt with werewolves, but now there's a new monster with its sights set on him. All Bo wants is Jimmy, but the new kid in school wants Bo while Jimmy wants…. Slash JimmyBo JimBo ... ... Bo's breath was coming in pants. He could feel the adrenaline still pumping through his veins and felt his hands shaking with it. He couldn't believe how close he'd come to dying just now….how close he'd come to losing everything. And then there was Jimmy…. His eyes snapped from the empty end of the alleyway to the wall to his left. Crouched near the ground was Jimmy, holding his head and making pitiful moaning noises of pain, pretty much stark naked. His jacket from earlier was lying near the mouth of the alley and the shredded remains of his jeans were barely clinging to his hips. The sound of the city finally came back to him and Bo gasped, taking the few steps between him and Jimmy and kneeling down next to him. \"Jimmy?\" he asked worriedly. \"Jimmy are you alright?\" He placed a hand on Jimmy's shoulder and Jimmy let out a whimper. Suddenly, Bo was staring at blank wall. He heard a step to his right and turned. Jimmy was six feet away and facing away from him, still crouching down and holding his head. \"Jimmy?\" \"I'm sorry,\" Jimmy breathed out just loud enough for Bo to hear. Then he ran off, his skin darkening and hair overtaking his body, his face and body shifting into something more canine a moment before he vanished into the night. Bo was left standing alone in the alley trying to figure out how it had all gone wrong. … … Three Weeks Ago \"So I hear we've got a new classmate transferring in all the way from London, England,\" Brooke stage whispered the gossip into the air between Jimmy and Bo at the lunch table. \"And Sarah said he's the hottest guy she's ever seen.\" \"So?\" Bo asked. He could see this was making Jimmy uncomfortable. Ever since he'd lost his werewolf powers, Jimmy was worried Brooke would find someone better. Her talking about the new hot guy was not exactly helpful. Bo didn't understand either of them. Jimmy was still hot. He hadn't lost any of his good looks. He shouldn't worry and Brooke shouldn't be checking the market every other week and making him worry. Brooke rolled her eyes. \"So,\" she emphasized like the answer should be obvious. \"Maybe you can finally find yourself a man,\" she suggested slyly. Bo's eyes widened and then narrowed a bit as he pushed himself up from where he'd been leaning forward to listen. \"What?\" he gasped. \"Brooke. No.\" He shook his head. She grinned furtively and he shook his head again. \"No. No. No way.\" Brooke sighed heavily, rolling her eyes again. \"Well why the hell not?\" she asked, annoyance in her tone. \"It's been almost a year since we broke up and you told me you were gay. Why don't you want a boyfriend? The whole school already knows, Bo,\" she stated plainly. Bo stared blankly at her. \"Thank you, Brooke, for pointing that out. I thought I had at least a bit of cover, but it's nice to know I've failed miserably at being normal.\" \"I think being normal is overrated,\" Jimmy chimed in quietly from Brooke's right side. He was eating his fries like the conversation wasn't important. \"And besides,\" he dropped the fry in his fingers and looked up at his tablemates, \"who cares if he's handsome? He might have a terrible personality and then where would we be?\" Brooke nodded sagely. \"Hmm….yes. Where would we be indeed. Now Jimmy, here,\" she began with a smile, \"So gifted at being a stud and a powerhouse at once, but he never once fights or shows off his muscles.\" She squeezed Jimmy's upper left arm as if to clarify and Jimmy let out a shaky smile. \"Eheh. Yea,\" he laughed nervously. \"I just don't see the point in fight….,\" he trailed off, eyes widening. Bo and Brooke turned – Bo had to turn 180 degrees – to see what exactly Jimmy was looking at. Whoa. A guy had just entered the lunch room. He had blonde hair cut in a business style that looked sexy on him and eyes as blue as a crystal clear summer sky. He wore street clothes just like everyone else, but the aura he carried was like that of a prince. Just staring at him, Bo thought perhaps the guy was actually glowing but dismissed the thought almost immediately. Jimmy sniffed the air and Bo couldn't blame him. The guy had barely entered the room a hundred feet away and Bo already had some alluring, unnameable scent wafting around him. \"Whoa,\" Brooke breathed out. \"I guess that's Scott Edwards.\" Bo turned his head to look at her, or perhaps to comment on her lovesick tone of voice, and he caught sight of her face. Oh shit. She had the look she got back when Jimmy owned the wrestling tryouts times about ten on her face. She was severely attracted to him and Bo couldn't really blame her. He was having trouble not falling for the guy on first sight himself. But Jimmy was sitting two feet in front of him and he might not smell like pheromones on steroids, but Bo was pretty attracted either way. … … Scott Edwards. He was, in a word, the perfect man. He showed off his brains in every class; even going so far as to show up a teacher when she got a math problem wrong in physics class. He showed off his athleticism in P.E. by single handedly winning the dodgeball game they'd played that day. Bo and Jimmy had been on his team and compared to Scott, they might as well have been twiddling their thumbs and drooling the entire game. Scott Edwards had a cult following by the end of the day that consisted of every girl in school, and Bo was certain at least half the guys were either in love with him or at least falling over themselves to please him. It was strange because some of those guys Bo had known for years and they had only ever cared about bettering themselves and now they were mooning over the new guy from London with the cute British accent and the hot body. Jimmy barely had a hold of Brooke as they walked by Scott on their way out of school. Scott was standing just inside the hallway with a gaggle of guys and girls around him, all trying to talk to him at once. … … Bo wasn't surprised when Brooke showed up at their morning meeting spot looking sheepish and asked to speak to Jimmy alone. He knew what this meant. Barely a minute after they'd walked away, Jimmy came back and leaned against the wall next to him. Bo didn't say a word. He just waited. \"She dumped me,\" Jimmy managed at length. Bo let out a quiet breath. Yep. \"She wants to go out with Scott Edwards and she said she couldn't flirt with him if she was already in a relationship with me,\" he choked out. Bo turned his head to watch Jimmy's actions. His face showed how crushed he was, his eyes practically screaming it. He'd worked so hard to be the man Brooke deserved, the man she wanted, after the curse wore off. He'd worked so hard and she'd dropped him at the first sign of a more alpha male. Bo let out another breath and scooted closer, wrapping his arms around Jimmy's shoulders. Jimmy grabbed a hold of Bo's right arm and held on tight as he tried not to cry. \"Come on,\" Bo breathed out. \"Let's blow off school and go hang out somewhere – Take your mind off all this.\" Jimmy nodded into Bo's chest and Bo took a step back. He gently held Jimmy's hand in his own, reveling in the feel of it, and pulled him along towards the parking lot and his new red masarati. They spent the day at the arcade, Bo's treat, and blew probably fifty dollars on every racing, gun, or other silly game they could find. Bo was surprised to find they'd won a lot of tickets by the end of the day and they spent ten minutes looking at all the prizes before Bo picked a dog whistle – \"As sort of a gag joke for what happened to you last year\" – and Jimmy got a remote controlled helicopter. Bo drove Jimmy home after that and walked him to the door. He fiddled with the whistle on the string around his neck as they walked, quiet as the grave. He needed to say something meaningful; something that would top off the day and make everything better. \"Hey, Jimmy,\" he started quietly. Jimmy stopped and turned to him, a content smile on his face and the box with his new toy under his arm. \"Yea?\" \"I just wanna let you know….,\" Bo tried. He took a deep breath to calm his nerves. \"Don't worry about Brooke.\" Jimmy's smile faltered. It was like he'd forgotten all about what happened and suddenly Bo brought it all back. Bo flinched. \"Ever since I met her in middle school, she's always been after the most popular guy she can get her hands on. She's all about status; being popular. She can't see when she's got a real gem on her hands; a guy with personality and class.\" He took a step closer, now almost in Jimmy's breathing space, and lowered his voice to a mere whisper. \"She made the wrong decision….letting you go…..\" His eyes searched Jimmy's face for a moment before speaking again, his voice even quieter than before. \"You're the best thing that she could've wished for…..I just wanted you to know.\" For what felt like an eternity, Jimmy just stood there. Then a hesitant smile appeared on his face. \"Thanks, Bo,\" he breathed out, not wanting to break the mood that had descended upon them. His eyes flicked down from Bo's eyes to his lips and Bo suddenly realized how far he'd leaned in. Clearing his throat, Bo took a step back and drew in a deep breath. \"Well, I'd better get going….School tomorrow and all,\" he excused himself. Jimmy nodded like he'd just remembered that. \"Yea. Yea. School. Right,\" he agreed. \"Thanks for the fun day. See you tomorrow.\" And he vanished inside his house before Bo had taken even one step towards his own car. Damn Jimmy was fast when he wanted to be. Werewolf or not. … … The next day at school, Bo walked beside Jimmy into school in full defense mode. Brooke wouldn't dare come near them if he had anything to say about it. They saw Scott Edwards standing just outside of his first class surrounded, as was becoming normal, by any student with a class in this hallway first period. They were all crowded around near the lockers while Scott stood in the middle of the hall. Bo scoffed. Scott had them all bunched together while he regaled them with some no doubt brilliant story about how he did something awesomely wonderful at some point in his life. Bo scanned the crowd and felt his frown deepen. There was Brooke, standing almost directly in front of Scott with her hands up over her heart and a dopey in love look on her face. Bo glanced at Jimmy as they neared the group. Jimmy was looking at the HomeComing banner on the opposite wall but Bo was almost certain that Jimmy knew Brooke was standing in that crowd. Bo stepped left, away from Jimmy, and ran into Scott, hard, as he passed by him. Scott actually stumbled a step before shooting Bo a nasty glare. \"Oh, sorry,\" Bo apologized sarcastically. \"I totally didn't see you there. Guess you're not too noticeable, huh?\" he ask derisively, taking a step closer to Scott in an obvious hostile manner. \"Bo,\" Jimmy let out in a half-sigh. Bo's eyes shot to Jimmy's face so he didn't see how Scott's expression fell into utter shock. Jimmy shook his head. \"Remember what happened the last time you picked on someone?\" Jimmy? Yea. Bo remembered getting hoisted up in the air and creamed in the only thing he had any talent for. Bo remembered losing face and coming out as gay and having his heart crushed. Bo remembered werewolves and the full moon and a maze of mirrors and darkness. Yes. Bo remembered the last time he picked on a guy. Though Jimmy probably just meant the fact that last time he picked on someone he got his ass kicked. Royally. \"Yea,\" Bo admitted in a rough, quiet voice, looking away from Jimmy's penetrating eyes. \"I remember. Sorry.\" Jimmy gave him a little smile. \"Let's just get to class, alright? He's not worth it and the bell's about to ring anyway.\" Bo grinned back at him and they continued down the hall like the whole event had never happened. Scott Edwards watched them until they'd turned the corner before facing his adoring fans once more. They hadn't budged an inch, almost like they were statues or puppets just awaiting his command. He liked L.A. His eyes flickered back down the hall before he laid a gentle smile on his face and said, \"So, who do I have the pleasure of walking to class with?\" Everyone shouted at once. \"Me!\" … ... The next time Bo saw Scott was in the locker room. Bo had just finished taking a shower after a hard practice. Jimmy had stayed to watch practice today. Bo snickered as he pulled his pants on. Jimmy was so funny when he came to practice. Everyone kept asking him to join the team and they all wanted to practice with him because he's the best they've ever seen and Jimmy kept getting nervous and stuttering out excuses. It had been really amusing to watch, but Bo had taken pity on him and called his team to attention. He was still the captain after all. Bo pulled a blue t-shirt over his head. When his head popped out through the hole he gasped, jumping backwards and knocking into the bench behind him. Strong arms grabbed hold of him, keeping him upright and steady. \"Are you alright, Robert?\" Scott asked, his voice sounding like silk, gentle and pleasant. \"What?\" Bo asked, taking a step back from Scott and out of his grip. Scott was enchanting when you passed him in the hall, being alone in the locker room was almost heart stopping. Bo forced himself not to look at Scott as he sat down on the bench and began pulling his shoes on. Scott lowered his arms but otherwise did not move. \"They call you 'Bo', right?\" he asked. Without waiting for a response he continued with, \"Short for Robert.\" Bo shrugged and finished tying his first shoe. \"So?\" he asked the floor. \"No one's called me that since I turned six.\" Scott leaned against the lockers, crossing his arms easily over his chest. \"Robert from Scandinavia. It means bright fame,\" he informed Bo gently. \"You're parents had high hopes for you, and they were right.\" His voice turned wistful as he said, \"You stand out. Your brightness…It could eclipse even the sun.\" Bo finished tying his second shoe. \"What are you on abo-\" Bo trailed off when he looked up and caught sight of Scott's face. His eyes locked with Bo's and Bo forgot how to speak. Bo stood from the bench, all the while keeping his eyes locked with Scott's. Scott's eyes seemed to glimmer in the false lighting of the room. \"Bo,\" he murmured huskily. Bo blinked, hard, and shook his head. \"Look,\" he stated simply, once again looking directly into Scott's eyes. He was the captain of the wrestling team. He could stare this guy down; assert his dominance. \"I don't know what Brooke told you about me,\" he started, \"but I am not interested in you. Yea. You've got looks and you smell really good…\" Bo paused to shake his head again. \"But I don't want to go out with you.\" \"Why not?\" Scott asked, sounding put out. He pouted and even that was alluring. \"Hey, Bo.\" Bo and Scott both shot their heads to the side to see Jimmy standing by the lockers on the other side of the bench from them. When did he get there? \"J-jimmy,\" Bo gasped out. \"How long have you been standing there?\" Jimmy shrugged noncommittally. \"About ten seconds.\" His eyes wavered to the side for a moment, away from the other men in the room, and then snapped back to Bo as quick as a bullet. \"You ready to go? Ellie's making spaghetti tonight. Extra meaty sauce.\" He gave a toothy grin. Bo blinked. \"Oh. Right. Yea.\" He bent down, grabbing his duffle bag. When he stood up, Bo saw Scott's expression. He looked completely out of his element; like he'd never been snuck up on before and he didn't know how to respond. \"Well,\" Bo said haltingly, calling Scott's attention back to him. Bo nodded. \"Glad we had this chat. Sorry I'm not interested. See you tomorrow.\" He pat Scott's left shoulder as he stepped over the bench to Jimmy's side. Then he and Jimmy left Scott there in the locker room. They were almost to Jimmy's house before they brought it up. \"So Scott propositioned you in the locker room?\" Jimmy asked incredulously. Bo shrugged, staring at the road ahead. \"Sort of, I guess. I mean, he didn't say it, but I got the feeling that's what he was implying.\" Jimmy scoffed, shaking his head in disbelief before turning to stare out the window. \"Unbelievable,\" he murmured under his breath. The close quarters of the car allowed Bo to catch it though. \"Hey,\" he said loudly. Jimmy jumped in his seat and looked at him. Bo glanced sideways at the younger male before looking back at the road. \"Listen. I'm not gonna ditch you to become one of those robot, brainless Scott fans, alright?\" He glanced at Jimmy and back to the road again. \"I'm sticking with you until the very end.\" Bo actually took one hand off the steering wheel and ruffled Jimmy's hair playfully to top off his promise. Jimmy yelped in surprise and Bo laughed. That just made Jimmy scowl and Bo thought perhaps Jimmy's scowl was just as alluring and lovable as Scott's pout. When Jimmy's scowl turned into a grateful smile, Bo knew Jimmy would always be better than Scott. No matter what. ... ... tbc...[Chapter 2] I was going to post on Friday, but my computer decided to die. I have 2 computers, my old slow, dying one and my new one. I use my old one when my new one has problems, and that's what I did this time. But all my documents were on the new one and I could only use my old one. So today, my sister's boyfriend has lent me his power cord and I can finally update! Chapter 2 For two weeks after that, Bo was caught between elation and frustration. On the elation side: He'd never had so much alone time with Jimmy. With Brooke all hung up over creepy Scott Edwards, Bo was the one that Jimmy took to the comic store, the arcade, down the strip, on dog walks, to the movies. Bo was the one that Jimmy invited over for the night and the weekend. Ellie spent most of her time at work, so Bo and Jimmy were pretty much left to their own devices on the weekends and afternoons. On the frustration side: creepy Scott Edwards kept staring at him. He and Jimmy would walk by his gaggle of goons and Bo would feel Scott's eyes following him, trying to lure him into the pack. If they had a class together, Scott kept his eyes on Bo the entire time. At first it just pissed Bo off, but now it was really starting to freak Bo out! \"Look,\" Bo began, shutting his locker. He turned on his heel to face Scott, who was standing not even a foot behind him. \"This has got to stop. I don't like you. And no matter how much you stare at me, that's not going to change.\" \"Why?\" Scott asked, sounding perplexed. \"Why don't you like me?\" Bo blinked at him owlishly a few times. \"Dude. I don't know. You're not my type I guess? What does it matter? You're freaking me out with the staring thing. Stop it.\" Bo's type was more hairy and fed under the full moon. Ahem. \"My eyes,\" Scott breathed out. It was like subliminal suggestion. Commenting on his eyes made Bo look at them. All at once, Bo began to fell light headed. He wasn't at school between periods anymore. He wasn't anywhere. All that existed was him and those eyes. Those bright blue eyes. The bell rang and Bo snapped out of whatever that was. He blinked and shook his head slightly. \"What?\" he asked. \"Did you just say something?\" Scott was frowning. \"The bell rang,\" he grumbled. \"Oh. I should get to class then. You should too.\" Bo turned to leave but Scott grabbed him by the right wrist, halting his progress. \"Dude, what the hell?\" Bo demanded. \"That hurts. Let go.\" Scott locked eyes with him again. \"I'll get you, Robert. Soon. You'll be mine.\" Bo blinked and Scott wasn't there. He looked down at his wrist and winced. It was all red from the tight grip. But how did Scott vanish so fast? ... ... Jimmy and Bo went to Jimmy's house that Friday afternoon to eat leftover spaghetti (Ellie had made it yet again , this time with huge meatballs on the side)and watch reruns of Heroes on NBC. Jimmy put a lot of sauce and two of the giant meatballs on his plate before sticking it in the microwave. He leaned back against the counter with a sigh and glanced up at the ceiling. Bo followed his gaze even as he reached for the fork in the spaghetti. He grinned. \"Hey.\" Jimmy looked down at him. \"Weren't you the one to put the holes in the ceiling?\" The holes weren't there anymore, but Bo remembered coming to Jimmy's house only a week after the attack and seeing a trail of claw mark holes from the porch to the kitchen and back to the porch. Jimmy grinned, embarrassed. \"Yea,\" he laughed. He looked up at the pristine ceiling again. \"You know there's almost no hint that anything ever happened here anymore?\" The microwave beeped and Jimmy pulled out his plate while Bo slipped his in. \"No one could ever guess anything strange happened.\" Bo scoffed. \"Except when they notice you've got a silver cake cutter framed on your wall,\" he commented wryly. Jimmy laughed a few times. \"True.\" He swirled a large forkful of spaghetti, the largest Bo had ever seen on a fork, and then popped the whole thing in his mouth at once. Bo's gag reflex nearly kicked in in sympathy for Jimmy's dead reflex. He laughed nervously. \"Man….I don't understand how you can fit all that food in your mouth at one time.\" A nonchalant shrug was his only answer since Jimmy was still chewing. A few moments later and the microwave beeped at Bo too. He reached up to open the microwave door and suddenly Jimmy's hand was around his wrist. Bo jumped in shock. Had he mentioned Jimmy was fast? \"J-jimbo?\" he stumbled out. Jimmy's eyes were focused intensely on Bo's right hand. He ran his fingers over Bo's palm and the back of his hand slowly and Bo had to repress the shiver that tried to race up his spine. \"Jimmy?\" he breathed out. Jimmy's fingers slipped toward Bo's shirt sleeve, easing the fabric back from Bo's hand. The red mark from earlier had turned into a sickly purple bruise. \"Bo, what happened?\" Jimmy asked, dark voice full of concern. \"Oh,\" Bo let out, disappointed. He'd thought- He shook his head, tugging his arm away but Jimmy wouldn't let go. \"It's nothing, Jimmy.\" \"Bo,\" Jimmy stressed. Bo sighed and Jimmy released his hand. It instantly felt cold and Bo took to rubbing it lightly as he spoke, trying to warm it back up. \"Scott grabbed me earlier today.\" Jimmy frowned and Bo scowled at him. \"We weren't fighting , Jimmy. I told him to stop staring and when I tried to walk away he grabbed my wrist.\" \"He just grabbed you and he left that bruise?\" Jimmy asked incredulously. Bo nodded. \"That doesn't make any sense.\" \"You're telling me,\" Bo huffed, letting his hands drop away from each other. He finally opened the microwave and pulled out his spaghetti. \"I've never met someone with that sort of grip before in my entire life.\" Jimmy made a contemplative noise and Bo laughed as they walked toward the living room with their foraging. \"I get the feeling you're going to start researching random vague monsters again.\" Jimmy had researched dozens of mythological creatures since being bitten last year. He'd told Bo \"If werewolves exist, then why can't these?\" Bo was actually inclined to agree, but he told Jimmy he thought it was all nonsense anyway. Jimmy sat on the couch with his spaghetti in his lap and grabbed the remote. He didn't turn on the T.V. though, just rolled the remote around in his right hand. \"Jimbo?\" \"Bo,\" Jimmy tried, but stopped. He let out a huff of air. \"Bo has anything….I don't know…. weird happened to you since last year?\" Bo frowned. \"Since the wolf?\" He did a fast scan of the past year and then shook his head. \"Not really. No. I'm not shifting into a werewolf every month,\" he tried to joke, but Jimmy didn't seem any happier so he dropped his smile. \"Jimmy what's wrong?\" \"Nothing,\" Jimmy said with a shake of his head. \"I'm just curious.\" He turned to face Bo and it was an almost graceful motion. \"That night, after Tinsel…Did anything happen to you?\" Bo's frown deepened in confusion and Jimmy shook his head. \"We didn't end the line until almost midnight, and whether or not w-I want to admit it…you were attacked by a werewolf. So-\" \"You want to know if I started to change,\" Bo said for him. Jimmy gave a pathetic look with a shrug and an uneasy smile. Bo stuck a bite of spaghetti in his mouth and faced the blank T.V. screen. After swallowing he said, \"Well….after the paramedics let me go, I drove home. My parents weren't home at the time, some anniversary trip or something….\" His eyes roamed over the family photos on the walls near the T.V. \"I did start having this really terrible headache at about eleven,\" he admitted with a shrug. \"And my arm hurt around the cut. And I mean a lot , but I figured that was normal. Do you think…,\" he trailed off momentarily and focused back on Jimmy, \"If you and Ellie hadn't killed the other werewolf….do you think I would've become one too?\" Jimmy shrugged uncertainly. \"It's always a possibility. Then again, you'd only been scratched for an hour, whereas Ellie and I were infected for almost three days.\" The T.V. came on and Jimmy tossed the remote onto the arm of the couch. \"You're not a werewolf now, so it doesn't really matter anyway.\" If Bo didn't know better, he'd say that Jimmy was disappointed that Bo wasn't a werewolf. He grinned. That was one of the things he loved about Jimmy: how he was almost obsessed with anything out of the ordinary. Jimmy had said it himself only a short while ago, he thought being normal was overrated. Bo watched as Jimmy speared a meatball, his gaze focused on the T.V. as the commercial announced that Heroes was coming on next. Jimmy tried sticking the whole meatball in his mouth at once like he did the spaghetti, but it was too big. He used his fork to slice the meat in half and then wrapped one half in spaghetti noodles before stuffing that in his mouth instead. One of the noodles was longer than the rest and it slapped Jimmy in the chin on its way into his mouth, leaving a smudge of spaghetti sauce in its wake. Bo laughed at Jimmy's half-startled expression. His grin faded almost immediately though when Jimmy swallowed the food. Bo watched his Adam's apple bob with the action. Jimmy's tongue flicked out to lick the sauce off his chin and Bo felt his mouth go dry. He quickly turned to face the T.V. just as a 'what happened last time' began playing to open the show. He heard more than saw as Jimmy sat his plate on the side table and glanced down at his own food. Bo stuffed a large amount of spaghetti, though nothing like Jimmy's mouthfuls, into his mouth and focused on chewing it. He set his plate on the side table on his side of the couch and leaned back as he swallowed. The Heroes symbol flashed on screen and that was the last thing Bo saw of the show. Jimmy was leaning over him, blocking out all view of the T.V. \"Wh-Jimbo?\" Bo gasped. \"What? What is it?\" Jimmy shook his head, his eyes searching Bo's face though Bo had no idea what he was searching for. Bo felt himself blush and Jimmy's lips twitched up into an imperceptible smirk. The younger male shook his head again before leaning down and capturing Bo's lips in a kiss. Bo let out a shocked sound, his eyes flying wide. Jimmy was-! His eyes slid shut and Bo's hand came up to hold Jimmy face as he kissed back. They pulled away long enough to take in a quick gasp of air before crushing their lips together again, and again, and again. Finally Jimmy pulled away and sat back against the couch, his right shoulder pressed up against Bo's, both of them panting. \"Whoa,\" was all Bo could say, his voice breathless. Jimmy giggled next to him. Bo turned where he sat and locked eyes with Jimmy. \"Why-\" He stopped, shaking his head. \"What brought that on?\" Jimmy shrugged, looking self-conscious. \"Well, you wanted to…right?\" he asked almost nervously, looking away. Bo nodded. \"But how could you tell?\" Jimmy snorted and lifted his eyes again. \"Bo, I've known for awhile.\" He grinned. \"You're giving off so many pheromones that normal humans could practically smell it,\" he explained. \"Normal?\" Bo asked curiously and Jimmy's eyes widened. \"Well- I-,\" he stuttered. \"I can…My senses are a bit better than yours probably are,\" Jimmy said evasively, shrugging and facing forward. Well, Jimmy had spent three days as a werewolf before the curse was lifted. It would make sense that he had some lingering traits. Bo grinned. \"Normal is overrated,\" he stated lowly. He saw Jimmy smile shyly as he turned his head to face Bo again. Bo shook his head lightly. \"So…you're gay?\" he teased. Jimmy let out a breath of air that was almost a laugh and tilted his head toward Bo a bit. \"I'm at least Bo-sexual, if nothing else,\" he joked in return. \"That actually sounds like a real term,\" Bo said with a smile. \"Bo-sexual.\" He laughed. Jimmy leaned over and planted a tiny kiss on Bo's left cheek, ending Bo's laughter. \"Wait,\" Bo began. \"What about Brooke?\" At that, Jimmy blushed. \"I liked her,\" he assured Bo. \"I really thought I would be with her…at least until graduation….But it's like you said, she only wanted me because she wants an alpha male. When she found someone who better fit that description…she moved on. I'm the beta male to her now. No she-wolf willingly mates with the beta, Bo.\" \"If you're beta then I'm omega,\" Bo stated blandly. \"And yet you just kissed me. This isn't about stations, Jimmy,\" he said with a shake of his head. Jimmy shook his head as if to clear it. \"I know that. Sorry. Sometimes I can't help but use wolf references.\" He squinted his eyes at the back of the couch. \"It's almost like I'm wired that way now or something.\" He shook his head again and locked eyes with Bo. \"The point is, in freshmen year I saw you and Brooke dating each other and I thought you two made a great looking couple,\" he admitted. \"It took me until Junior year to even work up the courage to talk to her, and it wasn't until I was cursed by the mark of the beast that I had the balls to flirt with her.\" Bo let out a laugh and Jimmy shrugged with a shy smile before continuing. \"Did you know she was on her period during that lunar cycle?\" Jimmy asked as if he were asking Bo if he'd noticed it was cloudy today. Bo's eyes shot wide. \"I had always thought she was hot, but I think the wolf part of me was attracted to her blood.\" Jimmy's cheeks were pink. \"And then…after we started dating…I realized she was a bit obsessed with status.\" He frowned. \"We had to be at every party, every game. She didn't want to read comics or…watch Heroes with me.\" He waved a hand at the T.V., where Nathan Petrelli was looking at a painting of an exploding man and talking with an elderly businessman. \"Still, she seemed to really like me and I liked her and so I thought it would work out….but I guess it didn't.\" He shook his head a bit again, his frown deepening. There was a long pause of silence from the two boys after that. The only sound in the room was of Nathan being told he'd be president someday soon. Finally, Bo took a deep breath. \"And me?\" he asked quietly, still staring into the depths of Jimmy's eyes. A blush lit Jimmy's cheeks, darker than when talking about Brooke's blood, and he looked away. \"I really didn't consider you until after Brooke broke up with me and we spent the day together…,\" he admitted and Bo frowned. So he was a fallback? \"But I think…\" Jimmy took a deep breath and let it out. \"I think maybe you were my crush all along.\" \"What?\" Bo asked. Jimmy's blush darkened even more. \"I told you. In Freshmen year I saw you and Brooke dating and I thought you made a great looking couple,\" he repeated, his voice pitched a bit higher. \"Every time I saw Brooke, I also saw you…except when we were in class, but then all I really saw was the back of Brooke's head.\" He shook his head, getting back on subject. \"And then whenever I talked to Brooke, you would show up and bully me.\" It was Bo's turn to frown. Jimmy gave him a small smile in return. \"The wolf liked that.\" Bo blinked a few times and then his own cheeks exploded with red. \"Wh-what?\" he gasped out. Jimmy grinned, showing off his canines. \"The hostility. The fight. The unknown. The challenge. We were both trying to be alphas.\" He shivered at the memory. \"It was a rush.\" Jimmy cleared his throat, glancing away for a moment to let the air clear a bit before he said anything more. \"The point is,\" he tried again, \"that after Brooke became a Scott fangirl….I've felt more at ease and more happy than I have in the past ever of my life.\" He looked at Bo again. \"And maybe the pheromones are part of it, but I just know that whenever we're alone my heart,\" he made a vague motion towards his own chest, \"beats a mile a minute. I keep having to stop myself from hugging you, or touching you. When I'm in class I just keep thinking about the next time I'll see you and….and…..,\" he struggled. His eyes ran over Bo's face again and he sighed, sounding a bit aggravated. \"And can I kiss you again, please? You're driving me insane sitting so close.\" \"Wha-,\" Bo blinked. \"Sure. Yea,\" he said distractedly, a smile growing on his face. At all once, Jimmy's lips were on his again. Several long minutes later, Jimmy pulled back just far enough so they could breathe. \"You know I hate it how Scott keeps watching you,\" he murmured against Bo's lips. \"Jealous?\" Bo asked with a smirk. Jimmy grinned and his eyes sparkled. \"Absolutely,\" he said before leaning back in and sticking his tongue in Bo's mouth. Bo sounded pleased. The T.V. and spaghetti lay forgotten for the rest of the afternoon. ... ... tbc.[Chapter 3] I'm so happy that everyone seems to be liking this story so much! Sadly, there is only one more chapter after this. I've noticed it takes about a day for me to get reviews for this story (though that might change since more people seem to be reading it now). Important fact #2 is that reviews absolutely positively make my day. Thus, in an effort to make Friday amazing (it's my birthday!), I'm posting this today. Please Enjoy! Chapter Three The sunlight woke Bo the next morning. Upon opening his eyes, he was met with the sight of Jimmy's sleeping face. He looked around without moving anything but his eyes. They were lying on the living room floor with a light quilt over top of them. The spaghetti plates were gone and the T.V. was off. He focused on Jimmy again. Jimmy's eyes were lightly shut, his lips slightly parted. His hair was tousled in an endearing way. Bo smiled serenely, remembering yesterday. A soft thud from the kitchen snapped Bo out of his memories. Carefully removing the quilt and standing up so as not to wake Jimmy, Bo padded in his socks to the kitchen. Ellie stood on the other side of the room, wearing a nice dress suit and messing with the coffee pot. \"Morning, Ellie,\" Bo greeted with a yawn. Ellie jumped, flipping around. She calmed down when she saw Bo though. \"Oh, Bo. Good morning.\" She smiled slyly. \"Sleep well?\" Bo felt his cheeks heat up. \"So I'm guessing you're the one who put the blanket over us?\" \"And picked up after you,\" she added, still grinning. Ellie shook her head, turning back to the coffee machine and pressing a button. \"I never would have figured Jimmy to like boys,\" she admitted softly, \"but I've never seen him looking so happy as when I walked in last night.\" She cast Bo a suggestive look and Bo's blush deepened. \"We just kissed….a lot,\" he added in a mumble. Ellie laughed lightly. \"Don't worry, I think I would've been able to smell if you'd done anything else,\" she teased. Bo's blush vanished. \"Oh.\" He took a step further into the kitchen. \"Hey, Ellie…How are your senses since…the event?\" He knew Ellie hated talking about being a werewolf. She liked to pretend nothing strange had ever happened. Bo watched her face fall. \"I can smell things,\" she revealed haltingly. Ellie turned her back on him and took her coffee from the machine. \"I'll probably see you when I get home from work. I'm running late, so I'll see you later, ok?\" She grabbed her purse from the kitchen table and headed for the front door. Bo watched the door open and shut silently. He'd upset her. \"Good Morning.\" Bo would've turned around in shock at the voice in his ear, but Jimmy's arms were already around his waist. Jimmy set his chin comfortably on Bo's shoulder and let out a content hum. \"You're warm.\" Bo felt a blush coloring his cheeks. \"Hey, Jimbo. Sleep well?\" Jimmy shrugged and Bo felt it through his entire back. \"I did,\" Jimmy said lightly, shutting his eyes. \"Until you left.\" He sniffed the air, pulling away a tiny bit and glancing around the kitchen. \"Coffee?\" \"Uh, yea. Your sister had some,\" Bo explained, turning around in Jimmy's now lax hold. \"She just left.\" For the briefest moment, Jimmy looked pained, and then it was gone. \"I hate the smell of coffee. I don't know how Ellie drinks it,\" he complained, wrinkling his nose. \"Maybe because it blocks out all the other smells.\" Jimmy considered this for a few moments, nodded, and pulled further away. \"Hungry? Cause I'm starving.\" His eyes seemed to sparkle and then grow dark. Jimmy cleared his throat and headed for the fridge. \"What do you want for breakfast?\" he asked, his typical half-nervous tone returning. Bo blinked. \"Cereal's fine,\" he said. \"I'll get it.\" Bo opened a cabinet and pulled out a box of Froot Loops and a bowl and spoon before sitting down at the table. Jimmy rummaged around in the fridge for a moment and then pulled out with the milk in one hand and a container of ham in the other. He set those down on the table and before opening the container. Bo stared at the ham and let out a laugh. \"You're gonna eat ham for breakfast?\" he asked. A piece of ham stopped about an inch from Jimmy's mouth. It only stayed there a moment before it was shoved in Jimmy's mouth. \"What's wrong with that?\" Jimmy asked around the meat. \"I do it all the time.\" Bo shrugged. \"Nothing.\" He opened the cereal. \"So….what are the plans for today?\" Jimmy swallowed and smiled. \"I'm sure we'll come up with something. We always do.\" ... ... Most of the morning was spent playing video games up in Jimmy's room, trying to best each other in fighting games. Bo could still proudly boast that he could beat Jimmy in a fight both in a game and in real life…now that he didn't have super wolf powers that is. After awhile, Bo got Jimmy to go for a jog with him. They ran around the complete neighborhood near Jimmy's house. By the time they got back, they were both tired, though Bo was a bit more out of breath than Jimmy. \"How on Earth are you more in shape than me?\" Bo gasped out against the inside of Jimmy's front door. Jimmy just shrugged half-heartedly, taking deep breaths from his place next to Bo. Most of the afternoon was spent testing, tempting, kissing, teasing, touching. Several times Bo pulled away because things were getting too steamy and he couldn't get Ellie's comment out of his head. \" Don't worry, I think I would've been able to smell if you'd done anything else.\" Creepy. Bo had to force himself to stay off Jimmy totally because every time they started up again, the thought of Ellie knowing was becoming less and less of a factor in his mind. Besides that, Jimmy was still new to this and he'd voiced his concerns about going too far. So Bo made a different suggestion. \"How about a movie tonight?\" Jimmy glanced at the clock. \"When?\" Bo glanced too and shrugged. \"Now? It's almost seven.\" \"Uh…Sure. Yea. A movie sounds great.\" Bo felt really special. Jimmy actually put on one of his nicer t-shirts with the jacket that Bo liked best hanging loosely over top. He was dressed nice for Bo like this was a date. Was this a date? Was Bo under dressed? Perhaps he should've gone home and gotten nicer clothes. Was there something he wore that Jimmy liked best? Jimmy's hand on his is all that stopped him from ripping his hair out from pure nerves. Bo's eyes snapped down to where their hands were touching, looked slowly back up to Jimmy's content and yet blushing face, and smiled. He glanced up at the sky as they walked and let out a breath. \"Wow,\" he said. \"It's a full moon tonight. Did you know that?\" \"I might have known,\" Jimmy answered evasively, though his grip on Bo's hand didn't change at all. Bo was still staring at the sky. \"That's awesome,\" he huffed before squeezing Jimmy's hand and lowering his head. \"You don't like talking about the moon, do you?\" Jimmy shook his head. \"No. That's not it. Not at all. You can talk about the full moon if you want to.\" They stopped outside the theater and only then did Jimmy squeeze Bo's hand tighter. \"Bo, I forgot to tell you,\" he began, and then fell silent, his mouth hanging open. \"Hm?\" His mouth hung partially open uselessly for several seconds longer and it wasn't until they were next in line that he spoke up. \"I have to be home by eleven,\" he half rushed out. \"Ellie needs me to fix the…circuit breaker.\" Bo raised an eyebrow and Jimmy shrugged. \"That's what she said. I don't know what she actually means. You know Ellie, always illiterate with technology.\" Bo grinned. \"Yea. I think she was fighting with the coffee maker this morning.\" Jimmy snickered. ... ... The movie was an action/adventure flick, but Bo and Jimmy held hands the whole way through. At one point, Jimmy even laid his head on Bo's shoulder for a few minutes. It was really romantic, if Bo did say so himself. Jimmy bolted to the bathroom as soon as they were out of the theater and Bo chuckled after him. He leaned against the wall next to a movie poster for some chick flick and stuffed his hands in his jacket pockets. Today was a good day. He could only imagine life getting better from here on out. \"Evening, Robert.\" Bo jumped away from the wall, turning to his right. \"Scott!\" he gasped. \"What are you doing here?\" Scott's crystal blue eyes shimmered seductively. \"Looking for you, obviously.\" He stepped closer, getting up in Bo's personal space. \"We never get any time to ourselves, you and I, and I just wanted to….talk.\" The last word was said in a deeper voice. Bo felt his mind growing hazy, like in the hallway yesterday. \"Talk?\" he asked airily, only half in the conversation any more. \"About…about what?\" A low hum escaped from Scott's throat. \"Let's go somewhere more private, shall we? How about outside? There's a lovely full moon out tonight. Very…romantic.\" He began walking toward the exit and Bo felt his feet move, following. He tried to say something like \"Not very romantic when you think about all the werewolf attacks,\" but nothing came out of his mouth. Actually, Bo wasn't even aware he was moving until Scott stopped and turned to face him again and Bo stopped with him. They were in an alley somewhere, but Bo couldn't remember the walk over here so he had no idea where he was. How far were they from the theater? Jimmy could smell better than most people, but how far away would be too far for Jimmy to find him if he was lost? Bo felt his mind coming back to him and shook his head. Scott frowned and backed Bo up into the wall of the alley, standing not a breath's distance away. \"Robert,\" he murmured silkily. Bo's mind was leaving again. \"You're resistance and resentment toward me are quite fascinating. Usually I'm so….,\" he breathed a line of not-quite-hot air down Bo's neck to the point where his neck and shoulder met, \"irresistible,\" he whispered against Bo's skin. Bo shivered but found he couldn't move at all. \"I don't know why you're different, but it's made the chase all that much more exciting. I bet you're delicious.\" Bo felt Scott's lips against his neck and then his teeth. His very pointed teeth. Bo's mind went into shock. A vampire ? But this was L.A.! How was Scott alive in sunny L.A.? The teeth pressed down, creating dips in Bo's skin and his breath caught. Was he going to die here? He'd faced down a werewolf and lived, and now he was going to die by vampire? Jimmy! A low growl, like a great large dog, echoed through the alley and Scott shot back from Bo's neck in shock. \"What?\" He turned his head and saw Jimmy standing at the entrance to the alley to Bo's left. Scott instantly calmed again. \"Back off,\" Jimmy said darkly. \"Oh. You.\" Scott smirked seductively. \"Jealous? Don't worry. I'll get to you soon.\" Jimmy's lips pulled back in a snarl and Scott took a half-step toward Bo's right. \"Back off!\" he shouted. A cat jumped from a trash can down the alley and ran out of sight. Bo felt sensation returning to his limbs and began to shiver, the fear finally hitting him at being anywhere near Scott. Jimmy glanced skyward. \"You're moving in on the wrong territory, rat.\" Scott laughed derisively. \"Territory?\" he asked incredulously. \"What are you, a we-\" He cut off abruptly when Jimmy lowered his head and both Bo and Scott saw his glowing golden eyes. Jimmy growled, ripping off his jacket and dropping onto all fours for a brief moment before lunging at Scott standing fifteen feet away. In midair, Bo saw his skin ripple and shred, revealing shaggy dark brown fur that covered Jimmy's whole body. His face morphed into something more wolf-like. Scott darted away from Bo and Jimmy's clawed paw missed Scott's face by a hair. Scott vanished and appeared four feet down the alley against the far wall. \"Oh my god!\" he half-shouted, sounding terrified but trying to put up a brave front. \"I didn't know you were a mut! I thought you were just too shy to admit you liked me like all the others at school. And you ,\" his eyes shot to Bo and Jimmy growled deep in his throat. Scott saw Bo's widened eyes and his comment died in his throat. Scott's crystal blue eyes landed warily on Jimmy again, crouched down two feet to Bo's right. \"I knew L.A. was the city of the night and that all the freaks lived here,\" he spat. Both Bo and Jimmy glared at that comment. \"Guess I should've figured a werewolf would've taken up residence.\" Jimmy snarled and rushed forward. His claws met the stone of the building across from Bo, creating a moderately large hole in the wall where Scott used to be. Scott stood at the end of the alley now. His eyes shivered where his body did not as he watched Jimmy rip his hand from the wall. There was a cut on his cheek. \"Forget you, human. You're not worth it. No one's worth this ,\" Scott hissed out, talking to Bo but watching Jimmy unerringly. Jimmy sent him a golden glare and Scott vanished from the alley. For several long moments, both Bo and Jimmy just stood there, then Jimmy let out a miserable little whine and Bo watched in mute fascination as he began to slowly shift back into the Jimmy Bo was used to seeing. The younger boy leaned against the wall with his eyes shut tight and Bo searched the alley for any sight of Scott. With the vampire and all the danger gone, it seemed like all the adrenaline that should have been coursing through Bo before shot through him all at once. He clutched the wall behind him, his breath becoming nothing short of uneven pants of fear that he no longer felt. His eyes darted back and forth, along the rooftops, like he was just waiting for Scott to show up again and kill them both without a second thought. He couldn't believe how close he'd come to dying just now; how close he'd come to losing everything. Why had he followed Scott out here? Did Scott hypnotize him? He'd nearly drank Bo's blood! Bo could've died and no one would've been any the wiser. And then there was Jimmy…. His eyes snapped from the empty end of the alleyway to the wall across from him. Jimmy had crouched down near the ground now, holding his head and making pitiful moaning noises of pain, in nothing but rags. His jacket from earlier was lying near the mouth of the alley and the shredded remains of his jeans were barely clinging to his hips. Jimmy seemed to be in pain. Bo wanted to help him, but he couldn't move… The sound of the city finally came back to him and Bo gasped in relief, taking the few steps between him and Jimmy and kneeling down next to him. \"Jimmy?\" he asked worriedly. \"Jimmy, are you alright?\" He placed a hand on Jimmy's shoulder and Jimmy let out a whimper. Suddenly, Bo was staring at blank wall. He heard a step to his right and turned. Jimmy was six feet away and facing away from him, still crouching down and holding his head. \"Jimmy?\" \"I'm sorry,\" Jimmy breathed out just loud enough for Bo to hear. Then he ran off, his skin darkening and hair overtaking his body, his face and body shifting into something more canine a moment before he vanished into the night. Standing alone in the alley, everything suddenly made sense. Everything was starkly clear and Bo understood. Jimmy was fast and had super senses and could sneak up on people because he was still a werewolf. He didn't fight or join the wrestling team because he was hiding the awesome strength he had because he was still a werewolf. Jimmy was still a werewolf. He was a werewolf. \"Holy shit.\" ... ... tbc...[Chapter 4] Because it's Valentine's Day. This is the final chapter. That's all there is. There isn't anymore. Chapter Four Bo ran to Jimmy's house that night, as soon as he had gathered himself. He didn't bother knocking. He banged on the door. After about six seconds and over a dozen heavy landings of his fist later, Ellie ripped the door open. Her eyes widened a bit. \"Bo? Why are you banging?\" she asked. Bo took in a gulp of air, still out of breath from the jog over here. \"Where's Jimmy? I need to talk to him.\" \"Jimmy?\" she repeated in confusion. \"He….He was out with you, I thought.\" Nodding, Bo took a step back. \"Yea. Yea he was. We split up. You sure he's not here?\" he asked. Ellie nodded, now looking concerned. \"Bo, what's wrong?\" she asked worriedly. Had something happened? For a moment, Bo considered telling Ellie about Scott and Jimmy and the alley and the whole werewolf vs vampire deal, but then he remembered how Ellie reacted to the supernatural. And something told Bo that Ellie didn't know about Jimmy. He shook his head. \"We uh….We had a fight.\" \"So soon in the relationship? You may not last very long,\" she teased him, seeming at ease with the explanation. Bo nodded jerkily, taking a step back. \"Maybe not,\" he agreed quietly. \"Look. I'm gonna go….I'll just come back tomorrow and see if he's-\" He jerked his arm back, pointing away towards his car parked on the side of the road. \"Bye.\" With that, Bo left the house. Ellie shut the door. Just before getting in his car, Bo glanced for a long moment at Jimmy's dark bedroom window. Where'd he go? When would he be back? What did this mean for them? ... ... It took ages to fall asleep that night. Every bark of a neighbor's dog had him running to the window. The sound of the wind in the trees made him jump. His mind couldn't shut off and kept racing in circles with no end. It wasn't until early morning that he finally drifted to sleep. The next morning, Bo felt overly lethargic. He made it downstairs for breakfast at about eleven in the morning and had just finished making himself some scrambled eggs when the doorbell rang. Turning off the stove, Bo padded to the front door. His house was larger than Jimmy's, his family had more money than most in the area. Bo glanced through the peep hole and gasped, ripping the door open. \"Jimmy!\" he gasp-shouted. Jimmy stood on his front porch wearing the jacket from last night, an old pair of jeans, and a wolfman t-shirt. He himself looked a bit worse for wear, though Bo couldn't put his finger exactly on why. His hair was ruffled and there were slight bags under his eyes, but that wasn't quite it. He pulled his right hand from his jacket pocket and gave a nervous little wave. \"Hey….Bo,\" he greeted quietly, his gaze not meeting Bo's. \"Can….can I come in?\" His eyes darted beyond Bo, into the house. Bo stepped aside. \"Sure. Of course.\" Jimmy passed him, making sure not to let any part of himself touch Bo, and Bo noticed how he sniffed the air inconspicuously. \"There's no one else here,\" he said. \"My dad had a business trip and took my mom with him.\" \"Oh,\" Jimmy flicked his eyes around the entrance room and back to Bo. In all their time as friends, Jimmy had never been to Bo's house. \"Good….\" He dropped his eyes to the rug in the entry way and scuffed his shoe absently. Awkward . Bo cleared his throat and Jimmy looked up at him. \"Look, uh, I just made some eggs…if you want any,\" he offered with a vague shrug of his shoulders and a motion toward the kitchen. Jimmy nodded silently and Bo began leading the way into the kitchen. He picked the pan up by the handle and deposited the eggs he'd meant for only him onto two plates. Bo had barely set the pan in the sink when Jimmy spoke up. \"I'm sorry I didn't tell you.\" Bo turned around to face Jimmy, who shifted from foot to foot uneasily. He wasn't looking at Bo. \"It's…It's been a year since the attack and I've gotten pretty good at hiding it, so I thought maybe I wouldn't have to tell you…because I wanted us to work and I was afraid if you knew then you wouldn't want to be around me,\" he rushed out. \"Ellie doesn't want to acknowledge the attack ever happened, so I couldn't even tell her about the changes. She's….She's normal. She's human like you.\" His eyes finally met Bo's and caught there. Bo held his gaze for a long while before sighing, his shoulders drooping. \"What makes you think I wouldn't want to be around you, Jimbo?\" The nickname seemed to make Jimmy relax a bit. He took a deep breath, held it for four seconds, and let it out again. \"I'm a monster, Bo. I'm cursed.\" He looked pained. \"Last time you met a werewolf…you nearly died. Ellie nearly died. I nearly died. A lot of people got hurt and a lot more ended up dead. Werewolves are bad news.\" \"And vampires are better,\" Bo said with barely concealed sarcasm and a shrug. Jimmy frowned. He held Bo's gaze for what felt like forever but was only about ten seconds. \"I didn't know,\" he said like an apology, catching Bo off guard. \"With everything I've learned about this curse over the past year, with all I can do…I mean, I knew he smelled off and there was just something about him, but I couldn't tell he wasn't human and it nearly got you killed!\" \"Whoa whoa whoa!\" Bo practically shouted, cutting Jimmy off. \"What are you talking about? A vampire's a vampire, Jim. There's nothing you could've done.\" Jimmy opened his mouth to protest and Bo sent him a glare, stopping him. \"You saved me from him, Jimmy. He nearly drank me dry, but you stopped him. Isn't that good enough?\" \"No one,\" Jimmy began sorrowfully, \"should have to know what exists in the dark. People shouldn't be afraid to go for a walk or see a movie at night because of the monsters that live in it.\" \"I'm not,\" Bo stated plainly. He took a step closer to Jimmy. \"I can handle myself in most situations, and when I can't…\" He shrugged with a smile, stepping again closer to Jimmy, now only two feet away from him. \"I've got you, Jimbo.\" Jimmy regarded him curiously. \"Y-You're not…afraid of me?\" Bo snorted. \"You haven't eaten me yet, Jimmy.\" The relief that spread across Jimmy's face was indescribable. A smile grew and overtook his entire expression. It faded into a cute frown a moment later. \"Oh, and just so you know…I don't kill people. I never have and I never will….I typically run around the woods eating wild animals during the full moon. Though one time I did eat our neighbor's house cast,\" he admitted with an embarrassed flush. \"If I eat a lot of red meat, the bloodlust is easier to control,\" he explained. \"So I don't randomly attack people at school around the ful-\" Bo cut off Jimmy's rant with a firm kiss. Jimmy's arms snapped up around his neck and Bo smirked into the kiss, wrapping his arms around Jimmy's waist. Bo pulled back just far enough to lay his forehead against Jimmy's and smiled. \"I was worried you wouldn't talk to me anymore,\" he admitted quietly. For a moment, Jimmy looked confused, and then understanding crossed through his eyes. He leaned forward, capturing Bo's lips this time. They kissed three or four times in instant succession, though who was keeping track? Jimmy pulled away a bit to stop it. \"I'll be here as long as you want me, Bo. I promise,\" he breathed out into the space between their lips. In Jimmy's eyes, Bo saw he was telling the complete and utter truth. He smiled. \"Then you'll be here for a long time. I've finally caught you. I'm not letting you go any time soon.\" ... ... The next day at school was perhaps the funniest day of Bo's life. Scott avoided Bo and Jimmy like the plague. If they were walking down the same hallway, he pressed himself into the lockers to get as far away from them as possible. Of course his little hypnotized worshipers barely noticed a thing, but Bo understood how not-working their minds were. Scott glared at them as they walked by in the cafeteria and Bo sent him an amiable smile, patronizing him. He plopped down at the usual table with Jimmy across from him, as usual, and sighed in content. \"Ah. The sweet smell of victory.\" Jimmy raised an eyebrow. \"You smell victory?\" he asked incredulously. \"What do you smell?\" Bo asked rhetorically. He got an answer though. \"Week old gym socks and barbecue sauce,\" Jimmy answered honestly with a grin. Bo grimaced. \"Yea. Great combination, isn't it?\" he joked. Bo shook his head, shivering. \"Hey,\" he said suddenly, an idea popping in his head. \"Jimbo.\" Jimmy didn't look up from his fake school barbecue 'ribs'. \"Why am I not a werewolf?\" That got Jimmy to look up. \"We ended the line, Bo. The werewolf that started the line that infected you was killed off,\" he explained like it was simple and obvious. \"With Jake gone, the curse ended.\" \"Yea, but,\" Bo rubbed his hands together, his elbows propped on the table top. \" You're still a werewolf, and you were infected by the same line as me, right?\" Jimmy nodded. \"So why you and not Ellie or me?\" Jimmy looked down at his food for a long time, suddenly not hungry. After a long while, he glanced up at Bo through his bangs. \"During the battle at the house….I sort of drank Jake's blood.\" \"You what?\" Jimmy's cheeks tinted. \"He was attacking Ellie and I didn't know what else to do, so I jumped on his back and bit him as hard as I could.\" He shrugged minutely, lowering his eyes to his tray again. \"I think I mixed blood with him….starting my own line.\" Jimmy shook his head, leaning away from his food and locking eyes with Bo. \"I'm not continuing it, though. I won't force someone else to deal with this,\" he said seriously. Bo smiled. \"You're amazing, did you know that?\" Jimmy gave a humble smile, lifting his shoulders a bit. Bo caught Scott glaring over at them from across the room and stuck out his tongue. Jimmy laughed under his breath and Bo grinned in triumph. ... ... Scott Edwards transferred to a different school by the end of the month. Brooke tried to get back with Jimmy once he was gone, but Jimmy kissed Bo in greeting before she could fully ask and she ran away in shock and shame. She started dating the vice captain of the wrestling team, Harley Walker. Bo got weekly comments from girls all across school about how hot him and Jimmy were together. Jimmy just smiled secretively when Bo told him about it. All in all, things went back to normal after Scott left. There was still one question Bo needed answered though. \"How come he could walk around in the sun?\" \"Hm?\" Jimmy looked up from where he was leaning on the side of his bed reading a comic book, to Bo spread out on the bed above him. \"I don't know,\" he answered mildly with a shrug. Bo groaned. \"That is so unhelpful,\" he complained, pushing himself up into a sitting position. Jimmy stood, sliding himself onto the bed with grace he had never possessed before being a werewolf. \"The experts on werewolves don't have all the answers. No one really knows all there is to know about werewolves…except werewolves.\" He shrugged noncommittally again. \"Vampires are probably the same way. Maybe they've adapted over the centuries to be able to walk in the sunlight. Maybe they never burned in the first place. There's…really no way of knowing.\" Bo grinned with a breath of a laugh. \"And I doubt we could ask Scott even if he was still here. He'd probably piss his pants at the sight of you,\" he chuckled. Jimmy was grinning too. \"He just might.\" His expression turned contemplative. \"I should do some research on vampires versus werewolves. If there's like, some sort of war or feud between us, I should probably know about it.\" Bo shook his head before leaning into Jimmy's personal space. \"You are such a dork, you know that?\" he asked with a toothy grin. Jimmy blinked at him silently with large, open eyes. Bo's grin turned devious. \"I like that,\" he said like it was a dare. Jimmy smirked and practically crushed their lips together.

Note 2: I don't mind the character of Brooke, she's sweet in a bland sort of way. I just like Bo more. He has depth…and is much cuter. Curse or Blessing Chapter 1 \"Zipper?\" Jimmy turned as he heard the familiar bark and found himself facing a smiling Brooke, who released Zip's collar as he bounded forward. Brooke pushed a strand of hair off her brow shyly, \"He was wandering the neighborhood.\" \"How did you know where I lived?\" \"I told her,\" Bo stepped into the dim glow of the streetlamp, unconsciously combing his hand through his hair. \"Thanks,\" Jimmy smiled at Brooke, then clasped hands with Bo. \"Are you all right?\" \"Yeah, are you?\" Bo gave Jimmy a calculating look, brow creased in concern. \"I'm fine.\" Jimmy draped his arm over Bo's shoulder in an awkward hug. Before giving himself time to think, Jimmy nuzzled his nose against Bo's neck in a very wolfish gesture, trying to pick up his scent. He pulled away from his former tormentor with a jerk. It appeared that the curse would wear off slowly, a bit at a time, instead of immediately as all the books he'd studied over the past few days had stated. \"Stop thinking so much,\" Jimmy felt a nudge in the ribs and saw Bo's smirk as his eyes began to refocus. He felt a sudden urge to wipe the playful look from Bo's face. Jimmy hesitated for a moment: his sister and a very nice girl from school were watching curiously. He shrugged it off and ran his hand through Bo's hair, pulling the other boy closer until their faces were mere inches apart. A genuine smile lighted on Bo's slightly bruised face, and he whispered -Jimmy feeling the heat of Bo's breath on his lips- \"I knew it.\" Jimmy smiled against Bo's lips, and everything around them became just background noise -he didn't care what happened or who saw- he was lost in the sensation of lips pressed roughly against his own, bruising the tender flesh. When Jimmy pulled away for air, he tried to keep the blush from creeping into his cheeks, but failed miserably. Bo laughed lightly and laced his fingers through Jimmy's. \"You can't fool me Jimbo, so don't even try.\" Jimmy snorted and was about to make a retort (having regained his composure) when he realized that they were standing alone, in the middle of the street. \"Hey- where are Brooke and Ellie?\" Bo shrugged, \"I don't know, I was a little…preoccupied. Maybe they went inside.\" Bo followed Jimmy through the house into the kitchen, where Ellie was sweeping up werewolf-ashes and the remnants of Zipper's rampage. \"Ellie, is Brooke here?\" Jimmy reluctantly released Bo's hand only to find a comfortable arm draped over his shoulders. Ellie pretended not to notice Bo's newfound affection for her younger brother. \"Uhm, you didn't hear her? Oh, you were- never mind. She had to go home: her parents didn't know that she had left, she said.\" Jimmy stifled a snicker at his sister's embarrassment and deviously snaked an arm around Bo's waist. \"Is there anything we can do to help? That is, unless you need to get home too, Bo?\" Jimmy dropped his arm and faced the taller boy. \"I wouldn't dream of leaving, Jimbo.\" Bo smirked and raised his eyebrows suggestively. Jimmy pushed him away with a laugh. \"Horny jackass.\" An awkward silence fell as the two young men realized that a shocked Ellie was listening to their banter. Jimmy cleared his throat as the blush flared back to life in his cheeks and down his neck. He sneaked a glance at Bo, who was watching Ellie apprehensively, as if she could attack at any moment, and rubbing the back of his neck. Ellie looked from one serious face to another, and somehow fought down a smile. Bo looked extremely uncomfortable, and Jimmy looked terrified. After all that's happened tonight, it looks like this scares Jimmy the most. Ellie schooled her face into a small smile, \"You're both idiots.\" She leaned against the handle of the broom and assessed the damage. \"Would you mind cleaning up the living room? I'll work in here as well as I can without getting supplies. We'll need fuses, light bulbs, a new door, and to entirely restock the kitchen in the morning, but we'll have to wait for the stores to open.\" Jimmy and Bo let out a joint sigh of relief, and Bo headed to the living room. Jimmy lingered, studied his sister for a second, then gave her a brief hug. \"Thanks,\" he said, the sound muffled by Ellie's hair. She just smiled and shooed Jimmy through the broken door into the living room. -------------------------------------------------- TBC… A/N: I have more written currently, but I can't decide if it should get a chapter of its own or not…Love it?

Wes Craven owns it… Summary: -Wes Craven's Cursed- How the movie should have ended. Jimmy-Bo SLASH Note: After 4 months on hiatus I have chapter 2… Maybe the next update won't take so long. Chapter 2 The night passed rather quickly, and a fog drifted over the neighborhood with the dusky predawn light. Ellie was resting, lying down with eyes wide open. She didn't think she would ever be able to sleep again after the week she'd had. Downstairs was a different story… Bo was sprawled out across the couch (one of few things untouched by Zipper), a leg thrown over the armrest and Jimmy dozing in the crook of his arm. Jimmy yawned and felt Bo's breathing change, the shallow breaths of sleep became deeper and more controlled. \"Jimmy?\" Bo whispered. \"Yeah?\" Jimmy opened an eye with a smile. Bo sighed and swallowed the lump in his throat. \"I'm sorry about all the shit-\" Jimmy silenced him with a gentle kiss. \"I know.\" Bo glanced through the open curtains at the lightening sky. He forced himself to look back at Jimmy, to meet his eyes. \"Jimmy, I just- I need to say this.\" Jimmy propped up on an elbow and looked into Bo's sincere face, dappled by the first rays of the sun flowing through the open window. He nodded, not sure what to say. Bo sat up, bringing Jimmy with him. He put a hand on each side of Jimmy's neck, gently rubbing his thumbs along his jaw. He took a deep breath and plunged into his apology. \"I'm sorry I was such a jerk and an idiot around you. I just- I didn't know what to say and I didn't want anyone to think I was, y'know, gay so I acted like a total jackass. I'm sorry.\" Jimmy felt the words barrage him, then a deep sigh as Bo finished. Jimmy fought back a smile at Bo's sigh and apprehensive look. He had know all that Bo had just said since shortly before his dog had transformed into a vicious slavering beast the night before. \"You forgot to mention one thing, Bo\" Jimmy shook his head. \"What?\" Bo bit his lip, eyes squinted with guilt, an expression that Jimmy had never expected to see from the boy across from him. Then again, Jimmy had never expected to kiss or wake up beside Bo until last night and this morning. \"I beat you.\" \"What're you talking about?\" the guilt faded to confusion. \"At wrestling. I beat you.\" \"You cheated!\" \"How did I cheat?\" \"You were a werewolf at the time; you had an unfair advantage. I could so beat you now.\" Bo seemed to have forgotten his shame and guilt. Jimmy, his intent accomplished, stared the other guy down in mock-anger. \" That would be cheating. You know I'm not at my strongest now.\" Bo sighed in exasperation and kissed Jimmy solidly. \"What was that for?\" Jimmy raised a brow. Bo smirked, \"To shut you up.\" Jimmy feigned a thoughtful expression, \"I may start talking a lot more…\" \"School is going to be fun Monday. You talk a lot there, don't you?\" Bo mused. \"You're going to tell your friends?\" \"Does that bother you?\" \"No, not at all. I just thought you would want to, you know, keep quiet about this… But I'm glad you're gonna tell them.\" \"I think I've been lying to people long enough. If they can't accept me for who I am, to hell with them.\" Jimmy grinned, \"I like this change of heart.\" \"Damn straight. No pun intended... Yeah, this sexy young werewolf caused the change of heart. Oh, and you helped me too, Jimmy.\" Jimmy made a face as Bo chuckled and wrapped him in a tight hug. Ellie cleared her throat. I should really start knocking. To go in the living room? When Bo's around it probably wouldn't hurt… she thought with a shake of her head. At least her brother seemed to have made a good friend. Friend? Ellie leaned against the door as her brother and Bo disentangled themselves. \"You guys ready to go shopping?\" TBC… Note: Thanks to all of you that reviewed the first chapter :)[Chapter 3] Title: Curse or Blessing Fandom: Wes Craven's Cursed Rating: T Warning: Slash Disclaimer: I do not own Wes Craven's Cursed.

Just thrown in the background because of real-life drama and my bad memory. Chapter 3 After a relatively uneventful trip to Lowe's and then a grocery store, Bo had to stop to get gas. He looked mournfully over his poor car as Jimmy gets out, walks around the car, and swats him on the shoulder. \"Ow, what'd you do that for?\" Jimmy snorted. \"There's no way that hurt.\" He nodded towards a car on the other side of the parking lot, where Brooke had just got out of her car and started in the store. Bo waved at her. She hesitated, then headed over, purpose in every step and anger in her eyes. \"Hey, Brooke, how—\" She ignored Jimmy, crossed her arms, and stared Bo down. \"You swore to me that if you ever started seeing someone you would tell me first.\" Even though he knew that Brooke was seriously pissed off, and that smiling was the last thing he should do, Bo had to fight the reflex when he saw Jimmy's jaw drop. \"You mean, you actually knew Bo was—\" Brooke glanced at Jimmy, none too happy with him at the moment either, it was clear. \"Of course I knew. I know. But I thought he was a better friend than to lie to me.\" Bo tried to explain to Brooke that he hadn't expected anything to happen with Jimmy, apologized, and abased himself to her kindhearted nature. She was a good friend, and he felt like an asshole that had stolen her almost-boyfriend. After his profuse apology, an awkward silence stretched in which Jimmy hunched his shoulders and looked out at the highway, feeling uncomfortable, while Brooke took a deep breath. When she spoke again, she seemed, to Bo anyway, to have cooled down from 'pissed off' to 'angry and slightly aggrieved,' which was a marked improvement, though she still wasn't a happy camper. \"Why Jimmy, though? I thought he liked me. Jimmy's so sweet.\" \"Yeah, I know.\" Bo looked over at Jimmy as he turned to face them again, hesitating and blushing when he met Brooke's eyes. He walked back over and just started talking. \"Look, I'm sorry for being so rude last night, but I wasn't thinking straight-\" \"No joke.\" \"Shh, Bo. I really do like you, Brooke, you're a sweet, caring person and I shouldn't have-\" \"Used me? Just like Bo's been doing for the past year. At least he told me the truth, Jimmy. I understood what he was going through. You've just been acting these past couple of weeks, no thought of my emotions, haven't you?\" \"Brooke, that's not-\" Bo stammered. Jimmy cut in before he could get any further. \"No, I wouldn't do that to you. To anyone! I really did- do want to be your friend, but it looks like I've screwed that up just like everything else.\" The loud honk of a car horn shook the three out of their argument, and Brooke took a few steps back. \"I'll- I need to think about this,\" she said quietly, getting her emotions back under control before walking back to her car. She opened the door, then slammed it closed with a deep sigh and headed back to the store to make her purchase. \"Not a word.\" she muttered, cheeks blazing, as she walked past Bo and Jimmy. As she disappeared into the store Bo turned to Jimmy, an angry expression on is face. \"What the hell did you do to her? Pretend to be interested in her so you wouldn't look like a fag? Is that it Jimmy?\" \"No! I really like Brooke. I was interested in her, really. I didn't lie to you when I said I wasn't gay. I'm not- I wasn't. I don't know what to think anymore, Bo. You've confused the hell out of me.\" Bo's expression softened, though he still looked a little angry. \"It was still a jerk thing to do.\" Jimmy sighed. \"I know. We're both jerks, aren't we?\" Bo snorted, \"Yeah, we were just made for each other, I guess.\" \"How romantic. Hey, what's that—?\" Jimmy heard a trickle of liquid splattering on the pavement. \"Oh, shit!\" Bo grabbed the nozzle before any more money could be wasted on the stinky puddle in the parking lot. Jimmy laughed. He couldn't help it. Bo slugged him on the arm and told him to make himself useful and pay for the gas. He did so with good grace, massaging his arm as he headed back in the store. He even got a small wave from Brooke right before she started her car and backed away. He watched her pull out of the parking lot, then looked over at Bo, who was motioning for him to hurry up. Oh, that's right, he remembered, my home is almost as much of a disaster as my social life. It may take a while to get everything cleaned up.[Chapter 4] Title: Curse or Blessing Fandom: Wes Craven's Cursed Rating: T Disclaimer: I do not own Wes Craven's Cursed.

I'll see you at school tomorrow?\" Bo hesitated, biting his lip. \"Why don't I pick you up in the morning?\" From Bo's expression, Jimmy picked up that the casual question had a deeper meaning. \"What, are we gonna walk into school holding hands and announce our love over the intercom?\" Bo shrugged. \"Something like that...Would it bother you?\" Jimmy shook his head, \"Half the people at school think I'm gay already, thanks to you.\" \"I'm sor—\" \"We've already been through that, Bo. You realize that people may take that you're coming out kinda badly, right?\" \"I know.\" Bo was staring at the steering wheel, then he looked back up at Jimmy, a stubborn jut to his jaw. \"But I don't really give a damn. I'm tired of lying to people.\" Jimmy tried not to smile, worried that Bo might take it the wrong way, but couldn't help it. He wanted to say something meaningful and deep, but his mind was blank. \"I'll...see you tomorrow, Bo.\" He trotted up to his front door, arms loaded down with a little bit of a lot of stuff. He opened the door and hesitated. This is going to take a while. 0000000 Jimmy rubbed his eyes. He'd been up too late the night before, putting the finishing touches on his now-pristine, if a little patchwork, house. He stretched out as well as he could in Bo's car, then fought off a yawn. \"Am I that boring,\" Bo asked. The fact that he stifled a yawn of his own a few seconds later belied his offended tone. Jimmy snickered, \"After all the crap we've been through, I'm starting to appreciate boring.\" \"Good point.\" Bo parked the car and they started across the parking lot. They walked across campus shoulder-to-shoulder, but at the last moment, Bo veered away and joined his normal group of friends. Bo glanced back at him once, then ignored him completely. Jimmy felt his face flush, then clenched his jaw. So much for boring. He adjusted his backpack more comfortably over his shoulder and headed to his homeroom. He couldn't focus all through first period. He was too busy stewing in his anger. He should have known better. Bo was still the same jerk, the same ass that he'd always been. If Bo was going to be a jerk, then Jimmy would make him squirm a bit. He'd tell Bo exactly what he thought of him at lunch. And let Bo's buddies think what they would... 0000000000 \"Well, that was a disaster,\" Jimmy muttered, hunched over the cracked sink in the restroom. He looked up at his reflection in the mirror. His hair was disheveled, his brow furrowed, and his lip was busted, dribbling a like of blood to his chin. He shook his head and wet a paper towel to dab at the blood. Why hadn't he just kept his mouth shut? He'd spotted Bo at his usual table in the cafeteria and stalked over. Arms crossed, he'd stared Bo down until one of his buddies got Bo's attention by nudging him in the side and hooking a thumb at Jimmy. Bo's eyes went wide and he stared at Jimmy like he could explode at any minute. \"We need to talk,\" Jimmy said. Bo hunched in on himself, as if he were trying to hide from the prying eyes of his friends. \"Can it wait?\" he whispered, not meeting Jimmy's eyes. \"No.\" \"Fine!\" Bo said, showing Jimmy the angry, ruthless side that he knew all too well. Bo stood and turned to leave. \"But I'm not doing it in front of everybody.\" \"What is it, Bo? Don't want your boyfriend to make a scene?\" Jimmy winced. He couldn't tell who had spoken, but knew it came from Bo's table by the way Bo whirled around and glared in that direction. Disgusted at himself and already regretting his decision to instigate a fight with Bo, Jimmy walked away without a backwards glance, secretly hoping that Bo would follow him out of the cafeteria. He hadn't, but someone did. Jimmy recognized the guy, short blond hair, always wore t-shirts and jeans, but didn't know his name. When he spoke, Jimmy recognized the voice as that of Bo's heckler. \"What was that about, girly boy?\" \"None of your business, you...pansy.\" Jimmy cringed as he said the word. Why hadn't he said something at least slightly masculine? Like douchebag or jerkface? Jerkface didn't like being called a pansy. He slammed Jimmy against the was, then Jimmy's instincts took over. Apparently he still had a little residual wolfy-strength that allowed him to push his attacker away and slam him against the opposite row of lockers. He caught a fist in the face and tasted blood, then wrenched Jerkface's arm around and used his own weight to throw him to the ground. He took off as Jerkface scrambled to his feet and took refuge in the bathroom. He really didn't want to hurt the guy too bad. \"Idiot...\" Jimmy muttered to himself, wiping the last remnants of blood from his face. He should have just enough time to get to his locker before his next class. 0000000000 The rest of Jimmy's school day was rather uneventful. Thankfully, he didn't have any classes with Jerkface and managed to avoid him easily. He made it through a tedious day of classes trying not to think about Bo. He did fairly well until a shout broke him out of his haze after the final bell. \"Jimmy! Jimbo! Wait up.\" Jimmy sighed and waited, a little nervous after his mini-tantrum earlier. He started walking when Bo caught up with him. Then he realized that he didn't have a ride home. Unless he rode with Bo. Dammit. \"I'm still mad at you,\" he said. \"I know. I was a coward, I admit—what happened to your lip?\" Bo stepped in front of him and tilted his chin to get a better look. He looked so concerned that Jimmy felt his anger fading. A little. \"I got in a fight with Jerkface.\" \"Jerkface?\" Bo moved his hand from Jimmy's chin to his jaw, checking for other injuries. \"Yeah, the annoying guy with blond hair, terrible dresser.\" \"Oh, Ian. That was you ? He looked pretty bad.\" \"Is he okay?\" Jimmy felt a little guilty even though Ian had started it. \"He's bruised and banged up, but he'll live. He deserved what he got.\" Bo moved his hand away from Jimmy's face, then looked away from him. \"Aaaand, things just got awkward.\" \"Thanks for stating the obvious, Jimbo. I know I was a jerk this morning. And a coward.\" \"You'll hear no arguments from me.\" Bo snorted, started walking again. \"Bo, I'm—\" Jimmy followed him. \"I deserved that,\" he said, glancing over his shoulder to make sure Jimmy was following him. \"Come on, I need to tell you something.\" \"Why am I even talking to you?\" Jimmy asked, leaning against Bo's car. \"Because you loove me,\" Bo said, grinning. \"And why are you so happy? I'm mad at you.\" Jimmy only half-believed it himself. \"Not for long,\" Bo said, leaning against the car next to him. \"Why is that?\" \"I...told my friends. About us.\" Jimmy's lips quirked into a smile. \"Are you kidding?\" Bo slipped his arm around him and squeezed. \"Do I look like I'm kidding?\" \"How did they take it?\" \"They freaked out a little, but that might have been because we were in the locker room when I told them.\" \"That was a stroke of genius.\" Bo shrugged. \"Still mad at me?\" Jimmy sighed. \"No. I know you just got—I thought you were rushing into it in the first place, and I might have overreacted a little.\" \"So you forgive me?\" \"This time.\" Jimmy smirked. \"Are you sure?\" Bo leaned in closer, \"I don't need to convince you?\" Jimmy shrugged, tilting his head, \"It couldn't hurt.\" Bo pressed a tender kiss to his lips. \"Bo?\" \"Yeah?\" \"I'm not a girl.\" Jimmy snickered at Bo's faux-shocked expression. \"I mean, you don't have to go all girly and mushy on me.\" \"Gotcha. Then it won't bother you if I—\" Bo grabbed Jimmy's neck and pulled him into a long, rough kiss. When he finally leaned away, he was breathless but grinning. \"Bo!\" Jimmy spluttered, winced, and touched his lip gingerly to make sure it hadn't started to bleed again. Then he smacked Bo's arm playfully. \"You're such an ass.\" \"You started it.\" Bo looked all too pleased with himself for Jimmy's peace of mind. Especially considering that they were still standing in a parking lot where anyone could happen by. He just stared at Bo for a moment. His former tormentor, the guy who'd antagonized him for years, was smiling at him, eyes bright and lips swollen from hissing him . And Jimmy thought that turning into a werewolf would be the most interesting thing to happen to him this year...

Jamie!\"we heard mark yell making us break part. \"coming!\"Damien yelled grabbing my hand dragging me over there.\"good bye aunt marion.\" Damien said when we past by. \"who told you?\"she asked. \"what?\" \"politeness isn't one of your strong points Damien, we all now\" she said gesturing to me and her \"that you didn't come here on your own.\" \"no one told me, but i was going to.\" \"were you realy?\" \"good bye aunt marion.\"he said running off. \"you old bat, he was trying to be nice.\" i said. \"right.\"she said sarcasticely and started going on about mark.\"i don't know why your not with mark, he so much more polite and you can have more proper children. and don't call me an old bat.\" \"i don't care what you say, old bat, i realy don't care if my children are not proper. i'm 14 so why do i have to plan now.\" \"it's better to plan early.\" \"good bye marion.\"i said passing by mark who was coming in. i slpped into the car next to Damien and mark soon came and sat next to me. \"she's to much, that aunt marion.\"Damien spoke up when we started driving. \"she's awful.\"i said. \"ya, why did they invite her?\"mark said. \"why else? so she can wag her finger and criticize us, generally ruin our weekend.\" \"at least we don't have to eat dinner with her.\" \"thank god.\"i said. \"and that smell? what is that?\" 'it lavender you fool, the old ladies douse themselves with it. why else?\" \"she has a realy bad smell?\"i asked. \"now, guys, just because the ladies getting it on.\" Murry the driver said. \"i bet the room fills with dust.\"i said. \"now come on, murry's right, le's hear it for marion.\" \"hoary.\"we say sarcastically. \"hey murry, give us a cigeret?\" Damien asked. \"now guys you know the answer.\" \"but how are we to know unless we ask?\" \"don't worry guys i got some.\"i said taking some out of my pocket. \"now i see one of the reasons why you love this girl.\"mark said putting one in his pocket.\"she can sneek many things.\" \"ya.\"Damien said doing the same. \"hey boys have you met you batoon leader?\" \"you mean neff?\" \"neff for neffermind. come on, once you've met one you've met them all.\"Damien said.\"attention! eyes front. stomach in, chest out.\" \"you know something?\" mark asked inetween our laughter.\"you crazy.\" \"yes but only because i've practiced.\"he said while we calmed down the rest of the ride.[Chapter 2] \"well this is boring.\"i said to my self watching all the boys march, while i sat on the steps waiting for them to be done. the thorns had great connection and so did my dad so they sent me here to watch over and see if the academy does as their expectation. \"hey Jamie.\"someone said snapping me from concentration on the ground. i looked up to see mark and Damien.\"we're going in side for an interview because the Sargent wants to get to know us. are you coming?\" \"ya.\"i said and they helped me up.\"thanks.\" we walked into the hall in front of the Sargent's office, after a while mark went in and that when teddy started talking. he was making fun of Damien's dad. \"that's Robert thorn right there.\"he said pointing to a small figure in the picture.\"my dad was there too but he was on the line, Robert thorn was quarter back. even then he was calling all the plays.\" \"your next Damien.\"mark said walking in. \"hey teddy,\"Damien said standing up and walking to the door.\"don't ever talk about my father again.\" \"can't you take a joke?\" teddy asked. \"ya.\"Damien said walking inside the office. \"what was that all about?\"mark asked. \"your cousin really thinks he's something huh?\"teddy said.\"my old man said that the thorns make their own hats because the stores don't make them big enough fog their big heads.\" making everyone laugh. mark punched him making him stumble back and everyone stop laughing.\"you ganna regret that thorn.\" they got into a fight but i wasn't really paying attention in till mark was on his back back and teddy was saying.\"whats the matter thorn don't you like it on your back? i heard Jamie does.\" \"asshole!\"i yelled at him. \"teddy!\"Damien yelled coming out of the room. \"another thorn.\"teddy said getting up and standing in front of him. all Damien did was stand there and look at him and all of a suddenly teddy slammed him self against the door and started hitting things that weren't there yelling stop it. it stopped when the general walked out.\"what the hell are we waiting for foster.\"he said and pointed at Damien and mark.\"you two out.\" he looked at teddy.\"what are you doing? polishing the floor.\" i walked out with them.\"what did you do to him?\" \"i don't know.\"Damien said an looked over at us.\"come on once around, i'll give you two a head start.\" and we walked down and started running.[Chapter 3] \"have a good practice.\"i said to Damien while he ran off to football practice. i sat down on the grass watching him. \"excuse me,\"said a women in all red.\"wich one is Damien thorn?\" \"he's the wide reciver over there.\"i said pointing to where he was. he walked over and took off his helmet, i looked over back at the women as i got up, her eyes got wide and ran away. \"who was that?\"Damien asked grabbing my waist. \"dunno.\"i said and gave kiss.\"you know know that uniform looks realy good on you, but i know a place that better.\" \"where?\" \"the floor.\"i said. \"Damien get back here.\"yelled his coach. \"see you later.\" and sat back down while he ran back. -next day- \"thanks ann.\"i said as she gave some hot chocolet. \"no problem jamie,\"she said sitting next to me.\"its a plesure to have you around.\" \"that good because i'm usaly here 24 hours a day.\" \"yes, it's good to have atleast one girl here to talk to.\" \"ya, guess so.\"i said and looked over at the three who were walking in.\"what the hell happened to you guys?\" \"we were having a snow ball fight.\"said richard. \"why don't you three change before the guests arrive.\"ann said as they left. an hour or so later the house was flooded with people crowding around mark waiting for him to blow the candles, after he did we all got a peace of cake and richard annouced that he has a suprise for us. i got up and walked over fallowing the crowed of people but stopped when i noticed Damien didn't get up.\"Damien arn't you coming.\" \"yes, i'll be there in a second.\"he said and turned to the man next to him. i walked away and mark pulled to the window next to him. \"do you like the fire works?\" he asked looking at my surprised face. \"no shit sherlock.\"i said nunged him. \"hey wheres Damien?\" \"talking to some guy in th living room.\" \"i'll be right back.\"he sad walking off to him. he came back a few second later with him. \"what did you guys talk about?\"i asked Damien. \"nothing importent.\"he said and turned back to the fire works. -next day- \"c'mon dr. charles.\"i said pulling him up from the ice.\"it's easy to skate, all you have to do is glide.\"i said and did a round around him.\"see.\" \"hey i'm trying.\"he said falling again. \"i'm going to go watch the hockey game.\"i said helping him up while shaking my head. \"i thought you were teaching me to skate?\" \"your a fail at skating.\"i said and skated off. when i got there i turned to the closest person next to me.\"who winnig?\" \"mark's team.\" \"okay, go mark and damien!\"i yelled to them when they passed by. i felt a little hungrey so i went to get a hot dog. \"don't you know how to skate?\"i heard ann say when i got there. \"i was getting leasons from a little girl intill she got digusted.\" dr. charles said. \"i'm not a little girl.\"i said skating next to him and then turned to ann.\"could i get a hotdog please.\" \"ofcourse jamie.\"she said giving me one.\"so you got disgusted with chailes?\" \"she said i was a fail.\"dr. chailes said. \"who is that?\"ann asked after we heard a yell, we turned to see bill had fallen through the ice. \"thats mr. atherton.\"said dr. charles running off. \"i'll go help.\"i said. \"no it's too dangerous,\"ann said putting a hand my shlder keeping me back. it was scary watching everyone crawl on the ice looking for him, mr. thorn looked crushed watching his friend being draged through the curent. i would have gone to confort him put ann was still to worried about me. it was probley an hour by the time everyone came back with nothing. ann let me go and i skated over to richard who was sitting down on a bench. \"everthing will be alright mr. thorn.\"i said putting a hand on his sholder.\"he going to a better place.\" \"that what everyone says but how do we realy know?\"he asked. \"look i'm not the best with conforting but just believe alright.\" \"alright.\" he said and got up and left fallowing everyone back inside.[Chapter 4] \"Jamie,\"Sargent Neff said jolting me awake from my nap. i rubbed the sleep from my eyes and waited for him to say something. \"what?\" \"tell Damien to meet me in library, i need to talk to him.\"he said walking off. 'kay.\"i said walking into Damien's class room to see him in front of the teacher answering questions.\"Damien Sargent Neff wants to talk to you.\" \"what does he want to talk about?\"he asked as we walked to the library. \"dunno but he sounded kinda a mad.\"i said as he walked into the room. i stood there waiting for him to come out, when he came out he had a bible in hand.\"whats with the bible, planning on moving to Rome and being a pope?\" \"no, i have to look at the book of Revelations.\"he said.\"and you have to escort me.\" \"do i come in with you?\" \"no he said you can't go in, i have to find out something for my self.\" \"kay.\"i said walking with him, all the students were playing some instruments; it sounded kinda crappy but that my opinion. \"see you later i guess.\"Damien said walking in his room. \"ya, later.\" \"hey Jamie,\" mark called from downstairs when they stopped playing.\"come down here.\" ''kay,\"i yelled running down the stairs.\"what do you want?\" \"does this sound right to you?\"he asked playing his instrument. \"sound like crap.\"i said watching his head droop.\"i'm kidding, lighten up it sounds perfect.\" \"it does?\" \"yes perfeco.\"i said with a fake Italian accent. \"haha right.\"he said.\"so whats up with Damien.\" \"he hast to read the bible.\" \"why?\" \"he hast to read the book of Revelation, but i still think he's planning to be a pope or a father of a church.\" \"okay.\"he said while Damien started running down the stairs in a hurry.\"what wrong.\"he asked as he jet passed him. \"i'll be back.'i said running to sargent neff office.\"what the hell did you say to him?\" \"i just told him to read the truth.\"he said looking out his window watching Damien run off. \"what did it say?\" \"it told him what he really is.\" \"what is he then?\" \"the ant-Christ.\" \"he can't be that.\" \"yes he is, he's going to stand against your father some day. haven't you ever noticed that your father and Damien don't get along.\" \"they never got along with each other when we were younger.\" \"yes, i suggest you go now, we have nothing more to talk about.\" \"whatever.\"i said running off to find Damien. when i found him he was curled in a ball against a pole crying. \"what's wrong?\" \"why does it have to be me?\"he asked. \"do you have proof that your actually the...\"i trailed off not knowing if should say it or not. \"the anti-Christ?\"he asked; i just nodded.\"i have the 3 6s on my head.\" \"oh, well everything will be alright.\" i said pulling him close to comfort him.\"it'll be alright.\" \"ya.\"he said pulling me closer to him.[Chapter 5] \"hey mark, damien.\"i said walking into the hostpital room they were in seeing if they were awake, they were in here because somehting exploded in thorn industries. \"hey.\" they both said. \"what happened to you guys?\" i asked sitting next to Damien. \"nothing happened to me.\" Damien said. \"bit of lung damage but not to bad.\" mark said. \"we're just glad that you weren't there.\" Damien said sitting up and kissing my cheek. \"well doctor, i'm glad they're both okay.\" my dad said coming in with ann, the doctor and richard. \"how are you two feeling?\" ann asked sliding a hand over mark's forehead. \"fine.\" \"well you both still have to stay here. we still have to run tests.\" the doctor said. \"why? they both said they were fine.\"i said. \"yes but we need more tests.\" \"how about we take them back to my house and i'll take them back here in a week for more tests.\" ann said. \"well,\" \"come on they did say they were fine.\" \"fine.\" \"c'mon i got your clothes in my bag.\" i said to the guys making my way to the bathroom.[Chapter 6] \"this is kinda sappy.\"i thought while watching this one movie i forgot what it was called but it was about this horseman and a woman he was inlove with. atleast that what i got from only half paying attention. \"projection this!\" Damien yelled at mark when the picture went screwy. \"drop dead\" he yelled back. i laughed and put my head on Damien's shoulder and he rapped his arm around me leaning back. \"aaah, a happy ending for a change.\" Ann said when the movie ended with a shot of the horse. \"bore.\" Damien said. \"total bore.\" i said turning on the lamp. \"you two are too young to be so sinacal.\" she said getting up.\" who wants a corn beef sandwich?\" \"one.\" Richard said. \"two.\"Damien said. \"three.\"i said fallowing her to help. \"so your birthday is coming up.\" Ann said pulling out the ingredience for the sandwiches. \"ya, if your going to get me something it does'nt have to be realy big.\" \"oh darn.\" \"why did you want to get me something big?\" \"well the size isn't big but it's a big thing.\" \"thats cool. too bad i won't be able to see it for another week.\" \"i was thinking about giveing it to you now.\" \"realy?\" \"ya.\" she said pulling out 2 tickets for kiss.\"think of it as a early birthday present.\" \"thanks Ann. it's realy cool of you.\" i said hugging her. -later- i snuck into Mark's as quietly as i could. his lights were on and he was baried in a book, i approached him more and i jumped on him. \"aaaah!\"he screamed while i quickly put my hand mouth. \"shhh! are you trying to get us introuble?\" i said and grabbed the book he was reading.\"book of revalations huh? why do you need this?\" \"i just do.\"he said grabbing the book back.\"shouldn't you be asleep? do have any idea how late it is?\" \"i had to go pee and i won't pee on Damien's bed. why aren't you asleep?\" \"because i need to catch up on homework.\" \"right.\"i rolled my eyes and made my way out.\"good night mark.\" \"night.\" he said back.[Chapter 7] (thanks takara410 and forgetmenotflowers for reveiwing.) \"Jamie, wake up.\" I herd Damien say. I groened and shook my head saying I wanted to go back to sleep.\"c'mon it's a great day to play in the snow, why don't you get dressed and I'll meet you out there.\" \"fine.\" I said sitting up as he left the room. I got changed and walked down stairs, I was about to open the door when i heard yelling, so I walked over tword it and listened from the door way. \"I promise.\" I heard Richard before going quiet. I scrunched my eye brows wondering why he went quiet so I looked out into the room alittle and I saw Damien pass by. he started talking again so I slid back so they couldn't see me.\"now how about you get dressed, we could us some fresh air.\" I walked outside and sat on the porch waiting for Anne and Richard because I didn't feel like finding Damien and Mark by my self. \"Jamie what are you doinf out here by your self?\" Ann asked opening the door. \"I didn't want to look for Damien and Mark by my self.\" \"well we walk together then.\" Richard as we started walking into the woods. I was getting kinda bored from walking so I look down at the snow, it started to get so interesting that I started to wonder why it made a weird scrunching noise intill i herd a scream so we rushed tword it. \"what happened?\" Richard asked when we got there. \"I don't know. we were walking and he fell.\" he answered. Ann looked down at Mark and screamed. knowing what that ment i leaned into Damien's shoulder as he rapped his arms around me. \"get back to the house.\" Richardt said. \"I swear i didn't do anything.\" Damien said to them before walked back to the house. -week later- we were at Mark's funeral, people were crying, the priest was saying a blessing, my dad was rubbing my shoulder hoping that would make me feel better. but it didn't the whole time i was sorta spaced out, i didn't want to listen to anything that was happening, this was the same place my mom was and the place where my best friend mark was going to be. I looked up at Mark's headstone and saw a white dove with a olive branch, i smiled alittle bit looking at it. my dad leaned down to me and said.\"see that dove on the headstone, it's the symbol of peace and the holy spirit. it means Mark is at peace now.\" the bird dropped the branch on top of Mark's coffin and flew away. I watched it till it disappered in the sky.[Chapter 8] (Thanks Voldemort's lover for reviewing and to answer you question yes Damien did like her when they were little and he kissed her her just because he liked her already and he just felt like doing that.) \"How long is this?\" I asked Ann. \"Well, this is a graduaton so most likely an hour or more.\" She said as we took our seets in the front row. During the graduation I kept tugging at the hem of my dress since I'm not very comfortable wearing skirts or anything that isn't pants. \"Stop playing with that.\" Ann said removing my hand. \"But it keeps going up.\" \"It'll stop going up if you stop playing with it.\" \"Whatever.\" I said turning my attention back to the graduation. They soon called for the person with the best spirit and personality of the academy, the person they picked was Damien and i kinda stopped paying attention. I know I should be like a supportive girlfriend and everything but this damned skirt was bugging the hell out of me. I really hate the fact that this was supposed to be a formal thing, so formal I had to wear a damned skirt. \"I'll be right back Jamie.\" Ann said breaking my concentration from my skirt. \"Where are you going?\" \"No where, just stay with Damien.\" \"but..\" I started but she shushed me and left with the man that said she had to leave. I sighed and turned my attention back to the graduation. They gave out a badge for their year to everyone and it was over. Damien and I went over to the limo, he opened the car door for me, I thanked him and we made our way to his graduation party at his house.

Me: HAHAHA I cannot keep up TBH You: lol August 28 Ding! You: Doc left additional readings, I handed a copy to the photox lady at the lower ground Me: Ugh more readings? Thanks! … When you messaged that afternoon, I was on my way to photocopy center at the lower ground, about to grab my copy of the additional readings. But you had your head down and eyes on your phone and I was too shy to say hey, thanks for the update. You continued to be a part of my vision even as you walked passed and turned to me but I was already busy asking the lady for said additional notes. … September 05 Ding! You: Check this out. (sent a link) Me: Wait. Additional readings!? You: lol no, related readings Me: HAHAHA September 06 Ding! Me: More antibiotic resistance! (sent a link) You: ? wtf? Me: :( You: People taking antibiotics like vitamins!? WHY. Me: IDK IDK HUHU … I was running late for class for underestimating the second time I'd wake up from snoozing my alarm for the hundredth time. The line to the elevator reach the curve of the parking lot and I bolted up the stairs to the 7th floor. I quickly scanned the room as I walked past the window of the door. The first half of room was already occupied. Shit. I entered the back door and sat on the nearest vacant seat, accidentally sitting on a bag. I stood abruptly, \"Ah shit sorry sorry.\" \"No problem. Here. Sorry.\" It was you. \"Oh. Hi.\" \"Hi.\" And you gave me a shy smile and I started blushing from being so conscious. I removed my jacket, took out my notes, and started fanning myself with it. Then you brought out your foldable fan and fanned me. Lecture was over and the professor called the subject representatives for a copy of the presentation. Students left the room hurriedly for the next subject. I handed my USB to the professor. \"Would it be alright if you sent it?\" You asked. \"Of course,\" I said. \"Thanks,\" you said and left. It was an odd feeling to be upset over you leaving. The file transferred successfully and I thanked the professor for the lecture. I pocketed the device and turned to get my bag before the next class entered the room. You had my bag slung over your other shoulder. \"OMG. It's heavy. OMG,\" I panicked. You laughed and said it was no big deal and handed me my bag. We walked back to the next room, you found a familiar face and I found mine. Then things started progressing for me. I wanted our conversations to continue for hours, you were the first person I looked for to check if the seats beside you were vacant, I hoped that we'd be eating lunch at the same table, and hoped that when you studied in the library I would get to see you and have enough courage to say hello. But you were never there when I looked, always there when I left. Our messages remained brief and repetitive. I only sat by you by coincidence when I was late, which happened not often. I kept you at my periphery and stayed that way. We'd cross paths along the corridor and it would be just a shy smile, a small wave, and hi. One afternoon, you called for me and informed me that there would be a change in schedule and that you'd update me as soon as you had it. I said, oh okay, thanks, then smiled at you. The following day the subject representatives had a small meeting and you saved a seat for me. The next day, our year level had this huge activity and the professor had us count from 1 to 5 and you and I were in the same group. Saturday prior exam week rolled by and you were in the café where I usually studied. You were engrossed highlighting your notes and I found the courage to tap your shoulder. You looked up and I said hello. You smiled and asked if I wanted to share a table, I said yes. \"You study here too?\" You asked. I said only the weekend before exam week. We had lunch together in that café, we exchanged notes, and borrowed each other's highlighters. We had dinner somewhere else and stayed in a fast food chain until midnight. Then you walked me to my dorm. And the same thing happened on Sunday. After Monday's exam, I was on my way out of the campus when you walked beside me to ask if I would be studying at the café or the library. I said the library and you asked if I wanted a table or a cubicle reserved. I told you that you didn't have to but you did. When I arrived at the library late in the afternoon, you were at the entrance and told me that you saved a spot for me. We sat in the same table and you walked me to my dorm afterwards. Exam week ended and as I exited the room I saw you leaning against the wall of the corridor. You asked if I had plans. I said I didn't then you asked if I wanted to have plans with you. I said okay. You had this restaurant in mind that you wanted to try and I said okay. You booked a car and offered to pay but I insisted that we half the fare and we did. We ate in the restaurant and we were so quiet and awkward. We had cheesecake for dessert and we headed back to our respective dorms. Then school changed. We started asking each other if the other has eaten already then we accompanied one another. You continued to bring me back to my dorm. We saved seats for each other during the lectures we had together. Then we added dinner to our routine followed by adding breakfast. Our brief, repetitive exchanges turned to sending videos of puppies, memes, and science and sending 'try not to laugh'. You introduced me to the music genres you liked and I ranted to you about the novel I finished. Then friends started asking how close you and I were, I said a decent amount and they had smirks across their faces and I couldn't stop blushing. I felt embarrassed. One lunch, I brought with me a cup of fruits and you caught me climbing the stairs with my hands full. You carried my laptop bag and opened the door for me. I shared you my food. Then, you never stopped opening doors for me, you stayed near the side of road when we walked on the sidewalk, you held my umbrella for me when the sun was high up, and you'd ask if I arrived safely whenever I updated you if I would be on the way home that day. Then one day, we were celebrating the end of our second exam week when you reached for my hand as I was about to go inside the building of my dorm. You said, \"I think I'm in love with you.\"[Chapter 2] FOUR YEARS[Chapter 3] MY FAVORITE I remember when my brother asked me to be his plus one during an alumni homecoming event. He and I were seated in one of the tables in front (because that's where they usually ushered the people who had awards to receive, probably to save them from the long walk to and from) and you were ushered with your date at the same table. You shook hands with my brother and told us, the dates, that you've known each since high school. My brother introduced me to you and we shook hands before you introduced your date to us and more shaking of hands. I remember you adding me on social media and me asking my brother if you asked him to for permission before adding me, in which my brother said no and that maybe you wanted to get to know me more. But we didn't. We skipped the introduction and how formal we were supposed to be and went straight to the jokes and banters. We went straight to the teasing as if we've known each other longer than you've known my brother. I remember us transitioning to late night texts and smiling from ear to ear. I remember sleeping to your \"Sweet dreams\" and waking up early morning from our 12am conversation to your message that read, \"Good Morning.\" I remember how our conversations started from college messes and the chaos it brought with it to \"you wish I was there, huh?\" and the feelings that started creeping with it. I remember the feeling of gravity defying its law of motion and I remember being brave. I remember when you called me because I wasn't prepared to speak in front of the class for the research proposal we were about to present and I kept on flooding your messages from the nerves that made want to vomit and run away. You called and I heard your voice for the first time after that alumni homecoming. You told me to think of everybody in their underwear and I asked if you were sending me to my death bed. Then you said, \"C'mon, I'd miss you.\" And my heart was about to explode. Then when I messaged back that it was over you said, \"I should have said I love you.\" I wanted to break glass. I remember sleeping at 1am because you played music as I fell asleep first and woke up to find the call ended. I said sorry for sleeping on you and you said if it made me relax, you didn't mind. We replied back and forth that day. I remember visiting you because classes ended early and you said you didn't have class as well, you met me in the corner of the street and walked me to the mall near your college. The sidewalk was narrow and I let you walk ahead while you were sneaking glances at me. \"I'm still here,\" I said. You said, \"Just checking.\" And gave me a crooked smile, I knew I was done for because it had become my favorite. We ate in a Japanese restaurant that played the most ridiculous love songs and you brought me back to my college afterwards. You held my hand before I entered the building and gave it a squeeze before leaving. We slept at 2am the following day. I remember you visited me and we hung out in my dorm and I order Chinese food and we watched Modern Family. I remember you helping me with the dishes our elbows brushing, our fingers overlapping, I remember leaning against you on my bed as Phil Dunphey was being classic, goofy Phil until it was time for you to leave. I didn't want you to leave but the words didn't form and I walked you out the room. I remember after locking the door you pulled me in for a kiss and there was suddenly a whole zoo in my stomach. You said it was now or never, and you kissed me again as I watched you get in your car and you drove back to your dorm in another town, 12 kilometers away. I remember you dropping by almost always and being with you was the happiest I'd ever been. I couldn't take my eyes off you, I couldn't keep my mind away from you. You called me that night and said, \"Hey, honey\" and I died from how you sounded like you just woke up and we stayed talking until 3am and talked about our what ifs. I remember you brought up where you wanted to get married, and I said I wanted in Rome, you said you wanted a beach wedding. Then you said, \"We could compromise\" like you were sure you'd be marrying me, like you were sure we'd spend the rest of our years together after this crazy conversation. I remember that night where we were like broken records saying \"honey\" over and over before sleeping. I remember how loving you made me stupid. I remember telling my brother about you and I told you about it. I remember you freaking out about it. I remember asking you if it was a stupid move. You said it wasn't. You said it didn't matter. But it did. I remember our 3am mindless conversations turning to 10pm messages of \"Sorry, super busy. Talk to you in the morning\". I remember waiting for your \"Hey, honey\" and \"Good morning\" and \"I missed you\" and getting nothing. I remember staring at my phone for hours until my eyes couldn't take it anymore. I slept crying and woke up tired with heavy, swollen eyes. That entire day I asked myself what went wrong, I tortured myself for mentioning to my brother about us. I blamed myself for such a stupid move. I remembered our conversation ending with you and me wanting it to continue, that I tried too hard to save it. I remember meeting you after 3 months for my brother's birthday party and news spreading that you were in love with someone else, that you have always been since people could remember. I remember them saying that you were always head over heels for that person and you always had been. That same night, you walked to my table as I was replying to a group chat about another presentation, and tapped my shoulder and asked me to dance, like nothing happened. I thought we would forget that we never fell apart, that those past few months had been a dream, until I realized we were dancing to forget that we ever happened. That that would be the last time. You pulled me out the hall and into the garden restaurant and said, \"Hey, you\" like nothing happened. I asked how you were and said you looked great. I asked if you were in love and you said you've always had been. But not with me. I remember seeing you after a month in a mall you were about to exit. I remember my heart ringing in my ears and I cursed myself for the bruise that never left. You saw me and asked if I needed company, I said I didn't and you smiled that crooked smile I loved so much and left. I remember loving you and all the right things I never tried to do. I remember you at the door of my new apartment a year later and you kissing me like nothing happened. I asked what the hell you were doing and why in God's name were you at my door and how in the world did you find out where I was. You messaged my brother. And then you kissed me again and again. You said you thought about me and said sorry countless times for leaving me, for shutting me out, for walking away. You said you were falling too deep with me and you knew I fell in love and left. That you were with someone while you were with me. You said you should have told me there was someone else and I asked if there was still. And in your hesitation I knew. I remember you outside my college after my final exam of my final year with a bouquet of lilies and a stupid board that said, \"It's always been you\". I remember loving you with all the right things we never tried to do. I remember needing you to the point of selfishness then I remember begging you to stay. I remember how still hung up you were on the person you used to be in love with. I remember you leaving again. I remember finally letting you go.[Chapter 4] SAVED AS DRAFT Him: So why do you think you get scared easily? Her: You mean how I was always jumpy? Him: Yeah. Her: Must be from the fireworks? Him: Oh.

How we think our president is stupid, that the school is too demanding. The videos and memes we share and your smile. That one breakfast when you were too engrossed over a game that you hadn't noticed me, how blurry-eyed you look when I finally called your name and the stupid grin you had on your face when you saw me, your wide eyes when you saw me already seated. I wanted to cross the table and kiss you. I wanted so many things done for you. I wanted to be so many things for you. I wanted to see you after every exam, after every lecture, I wanted to be that guy that'd wait for your class to finish so I could walk you to your dorm. I would listen to how pathetic this assignment was and how your groupmates would get on your nerves because you would be the one to begin and end the job, because, well, they're practically useless. I wanted to kiss your forehead and the palm of your hand for no reason other than leaving me breathless. I wanted to be so much more for you but then I saw the look you got whenever you saw him, how you looked at him and the world dissolved around you, how so much in love you were, and as much as I would like to, I couldn't take you away from him. If you found happiness with him, I wouldn't pull you away from it. [saved as draft] Her: Hi! Him: Hey.[Chapter 5] Americano for You, Latte for Me She was seated where that 11am sunshine peaked brightest and gave her the illumination she needed as she was reading another essay from her student. He was seated at the table across her, highlighting another 10-page transcription that he knew he'd be reading for 2 hours. She sighed. He sighed. She stands up to have her water refilled. He stands up to order another coffee. They both would have a long day at the coffee shop. … She was lying down in a public park, open lunch box on her right, and a stack of papers on her left. She had OneRepublic blasting \"Secret\" and he was seated at the bench on the opposite side to where she was. He was eating potato chips and sipping his diet coke and held another transcription. Did he want to continue to become a lawyer? Or did he want to teach pre-law instead? She turned off her music, sat up, dusted the soil off her jeans, and then packed her stuff before heading home. He threw his trash in a nearby bin and walked the opposite direction to where she was heading. … She was dragged by her friend to attend a Christmas party their sorority hosted. He was asked to attend a Christmas party his cousin's sorority was hosting. \"It's for charity. It will be fun,\" the friend who dragged her and the cousin who asked him said. She said, \"Okay.\" He said, \"Sure.\" But she didn't attend. … She was seated where she could smell the chicken pesto wrap the barista was cooking. She had brought her laptop for an essay due the next day, her reading glasses were pushed over her head, and her eyebrows winkled. He was seated on the table beside her, classical music blasting, and a textbook on the table. She glanced at the textbook and thought what type of person would read that, she continued to type her essay. He glanced at her direction and thought that if she kept her eyebrows in a fold, she would end up having wrinkles. He flipped the page of the textbook. … She was in the grocery searching for canned peaches. He was in the grocery searching for canned pineapples. Their baskets bumped. They said sorry. They recognized each other. She was the first to look away the second they made eye contact. He looked familiar to her. She looked familiar to him. They paid in different counters and drove to different directions. … She was asked to attend a charity by the same friend who asked her to attend that Christmas Party. \"You didn't attend the last one,\" the friend said. \"Okay. I will. RSVP for 1 please.\" Her friend smiled. He was asked by the same person to attend the charity. He said yes. … Then they met. He learned that she is an editor and she learned that he is a pre-law student. \"How do you know the host?\" He asked. \"College best friend,\" she sips her water, \"You?\" \"Cousin.\" … They met in the mall where she usually hung around before her 3pm classes would start. He was inside a store looking for a new shirt to wear for tomorrow's family dinner when he spotted her entering the same store. He called her out and she looked for that familiar voice. Their eyes met. He waved at her, she waved back. \"What are you up to?\" \"Picking out what to wear.\" He showed her his line of clothes. \"What occasion?\" \"Family dinner.\" They met after a month in the usual coffee shop, the place was nearly packed and she would have to share a table with someone then she saw him. She asked if it was alright to share a table if he wasn't with anyone. He wasn't, he gave her a seat. She was reviewing an article and he was reading his first transcription for the term. They met in a public library five day later because the coffee shop where they usually stayed had undergone renovation. He was in the Political Science level and she was in the Humanities Level. They crossed paths when they decided it was time to buy a snack at the library's café. She tapped him on the shoulder and he raised his eyebrows then smiled. She asked what he was up to and he said he needed a change of scenery. She asked if he was with anyone, he was with a couple of groupmates at the Political Science Level. They bought their meals and they waved good-bye. They met in another event their mutual contact was hosting. He was parking his car when he saw her walking down the sidewalk. He stopped where she was at, rolled down his window and asked if she needed a lift. She asked if they were heading to the same event, he said yes, and she hopped in his care. She apologized for intruding. The host of the event greeted them at the door, she was pecked on the cheek, and he was given a hug. \"So, you guys are super tight now?\" the host asked. \"We just happen to head to the same event,\" he said. The host told them to make themselves at home and that lunch would be served at the garden in a while, then left. He asked her if she wanted something to drink. She said water and found a place on the couch. He asked how she met the host, she said that they used to be roommates until they had to change buildings thus changing dorms. He pulled her chair for during lunch. He helped her walk down the steps to the boat for their boat ride across the lake. She removed leaves from his hair when the wind blew and the branches shook. She kept him balance as he stood on a stool to reach for fruits. He held her hand as she was stepping out from the boat. He asked if he could bring her home. She said yes. They met the next month in her university. He was attending a lecture and she saw him buying from the cafeteria in their building. She tapped his shoulder. \"Hey!\" He said and gave her a small hug. \"What are you doing here?\" She asked. He said he was attending a lecture. She asked if it was in the same building. He said yes, then she asked if he was busy afterwards, he wasn't. She asked him out for coffee. He said yes. They met after his lecture and he asked for her number. \"Finally,\" she smiled. They met the following week for their first dinner date. They met three days later when she asked if he wanted to see Phantom of the Opera. They met that weekend for their first lunch date. They met on a Monday after her class. He brought with him Chinese takeout for them to share. They ate in her apartment, Rush Hour playing in the background. He talked about lately his groupmates have been letting him do all the work, she wondered if he ever divided the work or if he was just waiting for them to volunteer. He was waiting for them to volunteer. She introduced him to a website called Randomizer which helped her through group works. They finished their Chinese takeout and he left. She wished she could have kissed him. He wished he could have kissed her. They met on a Wednesday in their usual coffee shop, he brought with him no-occasion-flowers. She asked why. He smiled and she kissed him on the cheek. \"You're welcome,\" he smiled again. They met in her apartment when he said he couldn't stop thinking about her. They met in the park on a Friday night when they were too awake to sleep. They met for a fifth date outside his university. He was with his friends and she was waiting by the benches in her Sunday dress. He couldn't stop looking, his friends couldn't stop teasing. He kissed her on the cheek before either of them could say hello. He said she looked beautiful. She was suddenly too full to eat. They met on a Tuesday night in his apartment when she asked him if he wanted to be her date for an upcoming alumni homecoming. \"You want me to be your date?\" He asked. She said yes and asked if it was weird. \"Not at all,\" he said. She wanted to ask him so many things but didn't. They met for her alumni homecoming. They were still in the car when she asked what she should answer if people asked if they were dating. He felt the pulse in his wrist. She said she could say that they were dating if that's what he wanted, she could say otherwise if he felt uncomfortable. He didn't know he wanted her to say. \"Whatever makes you comfortable,\" he smiled. When people asked if they were dating, she said yes. He pulled her into a kiss by the buffet table. \"Finally,\" he said.[Chapter 6] Middle Column, Second Table My friend approached me on a Friday afternoon in the library as I began to read the transcriptions I finally printed. She was flustered from the 12 noon unit test because she couldn't remember the formula on how to compute for electrolytes. Her hair was a mess and wanted to have lunch. I told her I could accompany her for lunch because I just finished eating prior the test. She said it was alright, for she would be eating with you, who was two tables across. She left me to study and approached you. I haven't even gone passed the second page when she approached me to say good-bye, you too said good-bye. The library was full the following day. I spotted that same friend in a table and asked if I could share a table with her. She had a wide smile on her face and proceeded to make room for me to study. You, the one whom she had lunch with days ago, sat on the same table. My friend introduced you and I, I shook your hand. A few hours into studying that Saturday, you mentioned that you were getting hungry and asked if either of us wanted to eat. My friend said she was hungry, while I would be eating later. You and my friend went on to eat ahead and came back after a while with chocolates. We shared those chocolates until the library closed. You walked our friend to her dorm and I walked a different path. I found you sitting in one of the benches outside the room. I asked where our friend was and you said that she was still taking the test. I asked if you'd be studying in the library but you had other plans and I left. You found me cleaning my eyeglasses in front of the girls' bathroom and asked if I had a unit test that day. I said, I did and that I just finished. You complained that you couldn't remember if question 10 was either A or B or neither. I said, I was stuck in that same question too. I saw you in the library afterwards, the answer key had been released and you approached me. \"Did you get it?\" you asked. I said I did, and you did too. We high-fived. I found you eating pizza in the 5th floor cafeteria and asked if I could join your table. You weren't so I sat on the same table, brought out my lunch box, and ate. You asked if I always had a lunch box, I said yes. \"You make those?\" You asked. I said yes. You said that maybe you should try those to save money but that waking up early would be difficult because you always slept through your alarms. Our friend joined us afterwards. She began complaining about her groupmates, that they had no initiative. You tried to calm her down by buying her a donut. Her eyes lit up. You found me exiting the campus with a textbook in hand and asked if I needed help. Before I could answer you got my textbook and my bag. I said that I could manage with the bag but you insisted otherwise and walked me to my apartment. \"You live alone?\" I said I didn't because I had a pet puppy. You wanted to see my puppy. I told him that visitors weren't allowed inside the rooms and that you had to wait at the lobby, you didn't mind. So you waited as I brought down my shih tzu and you played with her. It was passed 7pm when you left. I found you in the Sunday Market with a couple of friends and I was shy to say hi and hoped that you wouldn't see me. But you tapped me on my shoulder and asked if I was alone. I said I was and then you asked if I needed company. I said not really but I wouldn't mind if you joined me in my hunt for a good dinner. You said you'd come back, that you'd just tell your friends that you'd be leaving ahead. I told you to just find me, and you did. After searching the market for an hour and a half for the organic products I needed, you were called by the people whom you've left. \"Introduce us,\" one of them said, and you did. One of them liked the dress I was wearing, the other asked if I had plans that evening so I could get to know them. But you answered for me, and that I had plans with you. Your friends smirked and I pretended I was busy with the succulents on my left, when in fact I was so flustered with what you said. You offered to bring me back to my apartment when I said I was fine with the train, then you said, \"We have plans this evening, remember?\" I never forgot. You found me three days later as I was collecting my notes from my locker and asked if I've eaten lunch. I said I had. \"Alright, next time then,\" you smiled then left. I found you with, who must be, a friend of yours, along the corridor as I was waiting for the room to be vacant for our small group discussion. You approached me to say hi and asked what I was doing. I said I was waiting for my room for discussion and you introduced me to your friend. When your friend left to head to the bathroom, you asked if I was available that evening. I said yes. We had our first dinner date. You found me at McDonald's ordering a sundae and, oh my God, you lined up beside me and ordered a cheeseburger and paid for my sundae. I must have had a funny look on my face for you to pinch my cheek. \"Don't sweat on it,\" you said, but I couldn't understand what you were saying because all of my senses focused on the fingerprints you've left on my face. I found you in front of my apartment asking if you could play with my shih tzu on a Saturday afternoon after my lunch with my family. \"How long did you wait?\" I asked. Not long, you said. But I saw the beads of sweat trickling down your temples. I brought down my shih tzu and a tub of ice cream. You found me in my classroom and you entered the room like we've been classmates for the past semester. You waved at familiar faces before asking me if I wanted to be your plus one on a charity event your family was hosting. I asked why me, you said, \"Isn't it obvious that I like you?\" I felt butterflies in my ears and elephants in my stomach. I found you sitting in your car when you fetched me that day for the charity event. You stepped out and opened the passenger seat for me and I found a bouquet of sunflowers. \"This must be the wrong car,\" I backed away. \"No, pretty sure it's the right one.\" I wanted to tell you that I liked you back but the nightmares from my previous relationships told me that it was a bit too soon to reciprocate the feelings. I squeezed your arm, took the bouquet, and sat in the passenger seat. You asked if you could take a picture of me, I said yes and you did. \"Ugh, you're so beautiful,\" you said and planted a fist on your chest like you were having a heart attack. You introduced me to your family for the first time. You found me with a crease on my forehead from staring at the laptop and asked what was bothering me. \"This protocol we're supposed to present tomorrow has just been sent to us,\" I said massaging my right temple. You asked if you could have a look and I faced my laptop towards you. You pointed out the vital parts of the protocol and that the proctor would usually ask 'why'. \"They're gonna grill you,\" you said. \"Ugh, great.\" I pulled the laptop towards me and began making the powerpoint presentation. You sat beside me and brought out your transcriptions. Our silence was comfortable. I found you outside my last room for the day with a box of muffins. My classmates glanced at us, whistled, and giggled. I asked what you were doing. \"I felt like seeing you.\" I did too. You found me walking outside the campus and called me from your car. \"Wanna go on a date?\" You said. I hopped in your car and we ate in a Thai barbeque restaurant. You paid for dinner, I paid for dessert. You bought a dress for me and I bought you a bowtie because you insisted that it be a bowtie. We were in your car for a while outside my apartment and I wanted to kiss you, I wanted to tell you I liked you so much. I wanted to tell you that my shih tzu adores you more than I, that I think that we looked good together, that we had chemistry. I wanted to tell you that I constantly got lost in your eyes. Instead I thanked you for today and that I'd see you tomorrow. I found you in the corridor so close to one of your closer female friends and felt a deep pull in my heart. I walked the other direction. You found me a few days later eating in the 5th floor cafeteria, engrossed in the transcription I was reading. You sat across me and tapped my notes. I looked at you, who had probably just woken up because of the sleepy eyes you gave me. You smiled sheepishly and I knew I was done for, that I must have fallen in the deep. That I was already lost in your eyes, I couldn't look away. I turned away before I blushed too much. You asked if I had a unit test today, I said I was just advance reading for tomorrow. You asked if I had plans in the evening, I didn't. You picked me up that night and we had a stupid picnic in the park. You made this stupid dinner. And I was so stupidly happy, I felt like I was up in the clouds. I felt like the rest of year would be great, that there was nothing wrong in the world. I wanted to tell you that you've been making me so happy. I found you outside my room with a serious expression on your face. I asked what was wrong. I was scared because maybe you were fed up with me, that you found out that I was unsure of you, of us. That I was taking everything we were doing with a grain of salt, your words and your gestures. My heart was pounding, I suddenly couldn't breathe. Then you asked if I could accompany you tonight for a surprise dinner party your mom planned for your father. You asked if I was okay because I exhaled noisily from holding my breath too long. I said, \"Yeah. Of course. What should I wear?\" You said nothing too fancy, that a dress would be nice. On the ride to the party, you asked what was bothering me, that it was written all over my face. I sighed and said, \"I thought you wanted to stop.\" \"Stop what?\" \"This.\" \"This?\" \"Us.\" Then he swerved and abruptly parked the car. \"OHDEARGOD. Are you okay?\" Was he having a heart attack? I reached out to touch him but pulled back when he faced me. \" WHAT!? \" He exclaimed. \"What?\" \"YOU ASKED IF I WANTED TO STOP US. THEN I FELT MY PERIPHERY BLUR FROM PANIC SO I PARKED THE CAR. Wait, did I hurt you? Are you okay?\" \"I'm okay. OMG. I'm sorry. I should have asked you to park.\" \"Why would you think I wanted to stop us?\" \"I don't know.\" \"You don't know.\" \"I mean, I have a reason but I don't know if that's the main reason.\" \"What is the reason?\" \"Aren't we going to be late?\" \"The party can wait. But this cannot. Why would you think I want to stop whatever we've been doing?\" \"I thought you were unsure of me, of us. Because I didn't say I reciprocated your feelings.\" Silence. \"Do you reciprocate my feelings?\" you asked. I did. \"… Do you?\" you asked again. I nodded. \"Okay,\" you said. \"Aren't you mad that I didn't say it, you know, directly?\" \"Why would I be mad? I didn't want to force it out of you. What if it made you uncomfortable? I didn't want you to be uncomfortable around me.\" \"Okay.\" \"Okay.\" \"I like you,\" I said. You smiled, \"I know.\" You found me sitting on one of the benches on the 3rd floor browsing my Twitter feed. You sat beside me and presented a lily. \"What's happening?\" I locked the screen of my phone and looked at you and to the lily and back at you. \"Thought I might give you something Snape never had,\" you said. \"OhmyGod, I hate everything you just said.\" \"Are you free tonight?\" \"Is this another surprise dinner party?\" \"I'm asking you out on a date.\" \"Okay. I accept but what is with the lily?\" \"A no-occasion flower. Like a, 'I think you're really beautiful' type of flower.\" \"You think I'm a flower?\" \"Is that a sexual question?\" I take the lily from you. I found you walking down the steps from your dorm. When you saw me, you had that ridiculously large grin that I adored. You said good morning. \"Hi. You wanna go out with me?\" \"Okay,\" you had a puzzled expression on your face, but smiled nonetheless. \"Like, I mean, really go out with me.\" My palms began sweating. \"Like officially?\" I nodded and said, \"Yeah. Officially.\" \"Like long-run officially?\" \"Like we'll plan our wedding tomorrow officially.\" \"So, can I kiss you?\" \"Yes.\" \"You won't run away?\" I wanted to run away. I wanted to hide because I might have said something super embarrassing and that you were just being polite to stay. \"I won't,\" I finally say. \"This is going to be some crappy romcom shit but I want to hold your face and kiss you,\" you said. \"Then hold my face because I want all of your crappy romcom shit.\"[Chapter 7] RSVP for 2 I stand clutching at the invitation that my half-sister (or sister, which I already acknowledge her as) sent three days ago. In a beautiful, bold, italic script, it read: You are cordially invited… stop. No. I stopped reading and hid the invitation back in its envelope. It was her wedding. She's getting married. My little sister. And her groom's best man was my fiancé. And he'd be there, with his plus one. So would I. \"RSVP for two,\" I told my sister a week before she sent out the invitation. \"For two?\" \"Yes.\" \"Guy or Girl?\" \"Guy.\" \"HOLY SHIT. I cannot wait to meet him! Mom is going to flip!\" I cannot wait either. To finally meet you that is. Because I've picked you out of yellow pages. Well because I've paid for you. I was browsing through magazines, desperate for a plus one so I could take my revenge on my ex, and you know, make him regret dumping me. Behold, I came across a page full of them, full of people like you. Full of people willing to be paid to be a date. Good-looking, athletic. Charming, funny. Good-looking, charming. Funny, Tall, athletic. All the same three synonymous, repetitive adjectives. So, I dropped a pen and whichever phone number it landed on, that would be my guy. It landed on you. I phoned you 2 hours later and you and I talked about your terms and conditions. Yes, yes, absolutely, was all I said for this business transaction of ours. \"Listen, I want us to be believable as possible.\" I said before ending the line. You laughed at the other end and said, \"Your ex would beg you to come back.\" I would meet you tomorrow morning in the airplane, where I've paid for your seat, your flight, your entire stay in London. Heck, I even paid for you to be my date. I give my secretary a list of things to accomplish for my week away and wish him a good luck. Before I walk the aisle to settle down, I grab my first drink from the flight attendant and tell him, \"I'm not an alcoholic. I'll be meeting my date for the first time so I am nervous as hell. My hands are clammy, I am cold sweating. We're going to attend my sister's wedding. His seat is at 3B and—\" \"And he is here.\" I whip my head to my row and you had just gotten your glass of champagne. I down mine. Oh jeez. I finally meet you. \"Hi.\" And you kiss me lightly on the cheek and say, \"Believable as possible, right?\" Our eyes finally meet. Right . \"Right. Right. Okay. Uhm, enjoy the flight, I guess.\" Not even an hour after we've landed, Mom rushes us to head to the reception hall for early dinner. \"I'm sorry. I'm so nervous.\" I tell you on the cab ride. \"No problem.\" You half smile at me. \"I wasn't expecting your voice to be that deep.\" \"How deep?\" \"Like, bedroom voice deep.\" \"Like I've just woken up?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Is that a good thing?\" \"It is.\" I comb back my hair with my fingers for the hundredth time. \"I'm ruining my hair aren't I?\" I glance you and back at the rear view mirror. \"I've ruined my hair.\" Then you lace my hand with yours and said, \"You look great.\" \"Jesus Christ, I'm getting my money's worth on you so far.\" I glance at myself again in the rear view mirror, \"Jesus Christ my hair is a mess.\" Mom and Dad greet us at the entrance while the hotel staff bring in our luggage. I did the introductions, they instantly love you (well they love everybody). Mom doesn't hesitate to pull you by the arm and usher you inside the hall to meet everybody. I kiss Dad on the cheek and ask how everyone's been. \"Oh you know, same old. Your mother is more flustered than ever due to your sister's wedding. I feel like walking on thin ice.\" Classic mom. \"She's gotten your date for hostage.\" Dad gestures to where Mom corned you with all her friends. \"Okay, so, what do you do?\" I asked you during our last phone call before properly meeting you. \"A hooker.\" \"Okay, now, seriously.\" \"An entrepreneur. Self-employed. And I'm taking my masters in Biology.\" \"Okay, you're selling me nicely here.\" \"I wasn't kidding.\" \"I'm sorry. Okay, I've messed up. Okay, so we need a story.\" \"I'm taking my masters in Biology, I've been seeing you in a nearby coffee shop almost every other week. I've finally had the courage to ask for your number, so here we are.\" \"Wow. I actually believe you.\" I rescue you and you excuse yourself as I pull you to a room where they keep the coats. I shrug off mine and bring out an envelope. \"6k. Count it,\" I hand it to you. \"No, I don't need to,\" you're already pocketing the envelope when I stop you and ask you once more to count it. And you do. \"Listen,\" you say, \"I'm reminding you again that sleeping with me costs extra, okay?\" \"Yeah, bud, that won't be necessary, but thank you.\" \"And that it needs consent and money withdrawn prior or else I'm done with my business with you.\" \"The closest our skin is getting to each other is superficial.\" \"Just letting you know,\" and you give me your right upper lip smile and show me your dimple. We walk out the coat room hand in hand and make us as believable as possible. You ask my Dad if his drink needs a refill, you ask my Mom if she needs water, you congratulate my sister on her wedding and talk to the groom, and when we've been gone apart for a decent amount of time, that's when you come back, kiss me on the cheek and ask if I need anything. So freaking natural. My cousins are envious and want to take you home. \"Could I borrow him from you? I'd pay you both,\" I nearly choke on my water. \"Sorry, ladies, not for rent,\" I managed to say. After the dinner, we take the cab home to our house and Mom already fixed my room for the both of us. I look at my twin sized bed. \"I could get an extra mattress and sleep on the floor if it costs extra to sleep next to you,\" I say. \"Don't be silly. I'm pretty sure you understood me when I said 'sleeping with me',\" you settle our bags on the floor. \"Yeah, intercourse.\" \"Copulation.\" \"Right.\" \"Not gonna cost you anything to sleep next to me.\" \"Okay… Yes. You can shower ahead.\" \"So,\" you say after numerous trials-and-errors into making ourselves comfortable in bed, \"When do I get to meet the famous ex?\" \"Tomorrow. He arrives tomorrow.\" \"I can't wait.\" True enough, the look on my ex's face seeing you was priceless. Shocked. Amused. Unbelievable. His date, wow, is as equally as unbelievable. Like straight from a magazine. We say our little introductions and answer questions like, \"so how did you guys meet?\", \"What do you do?\", \"How have you been?\", \"How's the party so far?\" And reply \"aww\" when the timing was right. You made us so believable, you had your hand around my waist, you brought us drinks at the right time, you asked the right questions, you asked how the event was like you've organized it, and you asked if they need refills or appetizers. My sister pulled me aside as you were talking about your college course and asked, \"Where did you get him?\" I smiled and said, \"Coffee shop.\" \"Shut up. No way.\" I take a sip from the champagne I was holding and looked back at you. Our eyes met and you winked at me. I nearly choked. We were finally seated for dessert and we had each other to ourselves. \"How's the party so far?\" I asked. I was so nervous that what if you were fed up from my drunk mother and quiet father. What if my sister was being too childish and you were puzzled why her groom was mature enough but not sane enough to be part of the family. What if I was trying too hard, what if everyone was? What did you think of my Mom and her friends? About my family? Was it a good thing that I wasn't engaged to be married? \"I love it.\" No way. \"You can be honest to me you know. I don't care if I paid you to be nice, be brutally honest with me.\" \"Seriously. I love your family. Never a dull moment.\" I take a bite from the cheesecake you brought for us to share. \"Really?\" \"Really.\" I take another bite. \"Here,\" I take my last serving and push the plate towards you, \"before I finish it.\" You leaned in and ate the slice off my fork. My sister opened up the dance floor for quite a while but I was too tired from the champagne to dance. You, I, and my Dad were seated on one table and I listened as you asked Dad about his profession and Dad asking about yours. When a slow song began playing and all the couples in the room occupied the center of the floor, Dad ushered you and I to dance. You didn't hesitate in asking me to dance. You had your hands around my waist and my arms were around your neck as we slow danced to The Way You Look Tonight. \"Don't you think that this song has been played for too much in pre-weddings?\" I ask after a bit of swaying. \"Would you prefer 'I'll Be' instead?\" \"Maybe.\" \"Maybe on the next wedding you'd be attending.\" Then you freaking twirl me around. \"Well, that woke me up, thanks.\" I laughed against the crook on your neck. The following day, you made breakfast for us. \"What time did you wake up?\" I groggily asked as I sat on the counter in the dining area. You were making scrambled eggs, bacon, and sausages. I poured myself some milk. \"Probably an hour or two ago. Here,\" you handed me a plate with scrambled egg, toast, and sausages. \"How did you know I preferred sausages over bacon?\" \"I didn't. Now I know,\" then you winked at me. I smiled at you. \"I have to brief you on today's agenda.\" I settle the plate on my lap and eat from there. You nod. \"It's the bride's hen party and the groom's hooker party. You've been asked to attend the groom's.\" \"Alright.\" You take a bite from the toast then sip your coffee. \"I hope I'm not asking you for too much.\" I look at my plate. You tuck your fingers under my chin and lift my head, \"Not at all. It'll be fun.\" Dad catches you and I washing the dishes and allows you to borrow one of his cars for today. You brought me to the bar where the bachelorette party was held and my cousin asks you to stay for a drink before, and I quote, \"they pretend to be single for a night.\" And so you did, and you stayed a little while longer because my drunk friends asked permission to smell you for they were curious on how sexy you smelled. I couldn't help but roll my eyes. \"He could tie me down, any day,\" my cousin uttered, \"Woof.\" I almost spat my drink. \"Okaaayyyy, it is time for the thorn to leave the roses,\" my sister exclaimed as she was holding her second drink. I walked you to the door of the function room as they were teasing us to kiss. And you, oh so naturally, pulled me by the waist and kissed me tenderly on the lips. \"WHAAAAT. THAT'S TOO CUTE!\" My cousin shouted. \"Okay, bud, don't mind them.\" I opened the door for you and you pulled me in a second time and we kissed longer as you locked your hand on my nape. I felt a buzz in my ears when we pulled apart, I felt my heart in my wrist as you kissed me on the temple before leaving the room. \"TIME TO GET DRUNK TONIIIIIGHT!\" I already was. I remember zoning in and out from the alcohol. I remember withdrawing money from an ATM and pulling you out of bed after you've asked me if I was okay. I remember feeling your skin or I remember the dream of it, how you took care of me that moment, and how careful you were as you planted kisses and traced my skin like I was fragile like porcelain. I remember the dream of your arms around me and I remember floating above the clouds. I woke up to breakfast-in-bed and my parents leaving a note on the fridge saying that lunch would be in a few hours. \"What happened last night?\" I asked you. There was an expression that flashed across your face I didn't recognize. \"You were wasted,\" you said. I hid my face in my hands and groaned. \"No wonder why my head hurts. And there's another freaking lunch out.\" I lazily threw the schedule across the table and continued, \"As if we haven't been doing that for the past two days. Thanks for breakfast.\" I pick on my food. \"So, I picked you up last night and cash fell out your purse as you tripped in the room.\" \"Oh yeah, I forgot about that.\" \"You lack 300.\" \"What?\" \"300.\" \"300 for what?\" \"Last night.\" \"Last night? Wait what did we do last night?\" You didn't say anything. Holy crap did we do it last night? \"I'm saying that you would have lacked 300 if we did do something last night.\" \"But we didn't?\" I couldn't control the panic in voice anymore. \"We didn't.\" \"Are you saying you could have cost 17k if we did do it last night?\" \"17300.\" \" What. \" \"But we didn't do anything last night because you were diligent about it and we had a verbal contract that it wouldn't be part of the job you assigned me to do. Otherwise, the deal is off. I'm just here as your date for your sister's wedding afterall.\" \"You would tell me if I did something to you last night though. Right? I would pay for it, you know.\" You took my hand in yours. \"You just gave me a headache, that's all.\" And I believed you. You were obedient and there was nothing imperfect about you. You were anticipated by everybody and everyone wanted to talk to you and share a seat with you. You took longer from me than you usually would and maybe there was something wrong. Maybe I was too drunk to remember, but I took your word that there was nothing wrong, that nothing happened last night. Then, my ex took your seat on our table. \"Hi.\" \"Hi.\" I smiled and he smiled back. \"You look lovely. As always.\" \"You look fancy yourself.\" \"Congratulations on your sister's wedding.\" \"Pretty sure you should be telling her that instead.\" \"I did. I think she found me annoying.\" \"Impossible. She loves you.\" Then he was quiet. \"I suppose.\" I didn't know what that meant but it felt like it weighed a lot. \"You're beautiful,\" he said and I was heartbroken over again. Then you landed a hand on my shoulder and sat on a vacant seat beside me and settled a glass of water for me. You apologized for taking too long and shook hands with my ex. \"I'll leave you two,\" he stood up and left. \"So, did he beg you to come back?\" I shook my head. \"So, what was that about?\" you asked. \"I don't know. He looked tired and sad.\" I rested my elbow on the table and cupped my chin on my palm and followed him with my eyes. He looked so tired from the world, from the wedding. I remember what it was like to fall so deeply in love with him and the pain that it brought afterwards. Like I wasn't supposed to be so in love with him. You tuck my hair behind my ear and smiled at me. \"You know, you're a different kind of lovely when you're sad but you make the world stop when you smile.\" You brush your knuckle against my cheek and lean in to kiss me on the lips. You drove us to a small part of town, along the mountain ranges, to our summer villa, where the nearby Church was where the wedding would be held. Mom and Dad asked me to tour you around the area after we've settled in our room. The rooms in the villa were much larger and the beds were wider than our place in the city. I crawled on the bed and you followed suit. \"You know almost everything about me and my family and I don't know a damn single thing about you. Other than the fact that you're taking a master degree in Biology.\" \"Well, I'm allergic to citrus and I don't like olives on my pizza and pasta. I adore your family and the dynamic you guys bring. I get nervous about screwing this up even if I've been in the industry for more than 7 years. I think I'd miss you even if I haven't met you.\" I felt your hand rest over mine as we lay on the bed and laced our fingers together. We walked along the edges of the hill from where our villa was built. And sat close together on the grass of the edge that faced the sea. \"My sister is getting married tomorrow.\" \"It's going to be great.\" \"She looks so happy.\" \"She does.\" \"I want to be happy too.\" Music began to play from a distance, from which must have been the villa. Soon enough we'd have to go back for the dinner and the fireworks show that the groom prepared for my sister. You took my hand and kissed my palm. I felt a tug on the pulse on my wrist. \"I'll make you happy. I won't make you feel less loved.\" If this was part of hiring you, I wonder how many hearts you've broken and how many hearts had spaces for you from those two sentences. I smiled at you and kissed you. \"Thank you,\" I whispered against your lips before heading back to the villa. The sun began to set before dinner started and I caught you sitting in the living room with Dad. You were wearing your suit and tie, similar to the photo the industry sent, but better. \"Dear Lord, I'm soaked,\" my cousin said beside me, \"Just look at him. Straight from a catalogue.\" You saw me standing by the door frame and excused yourself from my Dad to meet us. \"Why the hell are you so bloody perfect? Is there nothing wrong with you? Do you have a hairy birthmark on your butt?\" I looked at my cousin like she suddenly grew another head and neck. You laughed and said, \"No birthmarks.\" \"Bloody perfect,\" my cousin said and left. You held your arm out for me and I took it before approaching Dad. Dad stood up from his chair and offered it to you. He grasped you on the shoulder and said, \"Okay.\" And left. \"What was that about?\" I took my seat. \"You're beautiful,\" you whispered in my ear. And I actually believed it. They were serving us dessert when my ex-fiancé asked to have a word with me as I was getting more wine from the cellar. \"You look gorgeous,\" he said. \"Geez, if your girlfriend heard that there'd be a cat fight.\" \"There is no girlfriend.\" \"What?\" I nearly dropped the empty bottle of wine I was holding. \"What?\" I asked again. \"I broke it off with her, two nights ago.\" \"Why?\" The room was suddenly too small for two people. \"I was hung up on your sister.\" \"My sister.\" \"Yeah. She was why I broke off our engagement. Because we were doing it like rabbits and I was obsessed about her.\" I couldn't breathe. I couldn't comprehend what he was saying. Why was he still talking? He was asking me to say something. I didn't know what to say. I was lost for words. I didn't… Then he's saying something like sorry and I didn't want to hear it anymore. I remember looking at everybody and everyone blaming everyone. Including you. I remember my sister blaming you for telling me and my cousin telling me sorry that I found out like this. But all I kept in mind was that you knew. \"You knew?\" I looked at you. I remember the hurt flashing across your face and the way your eyes dilated from pinning you with the pain I radiated. Then I walked away. You followed me a moment later in the boat house a few meters away from the villa. \"How? When?\" I asked when the pain was a bit less and before the silence became unbearable. \"Yesterday, when your sister was missing. Your dad asked me to look for her. And I found her and your ex arguing.\" I didn't say anything for a while. \"He didn't want me back, he wanted my sister,\" I finally said. You kissed me on the shoulder and wiped my tears away. I wasn't a different kind of lovely when I was sad, I was a different a kind of broken. My sister arrived in our room that night and apologized. Then she said, \"Please. Not on my wedding night. Not tomorrow.\" I suddenly so angry with her. \"Don't worry. Tomorrow, it'll be perfect. You will walk down the aisle and marry the man you love and I will smile and say all the right things. But bear in mind that the longer you keep the fact that you have been screwing his best man while we were still together the night before the wedding, the more things you will be keeping from him after your wedding.\" I couldn't remember why she was apologizing and what she was apologizing for. I remember her leaving and I remember you trying to soothe that deep ache in my chest. I was inconsolable. An hour before the wedding, it went chaotic. My sister told her groom about how his best man was screwing her 5 years into our relationship. Then it was all a blur, the groom chasing my ex outside the chapel. My sister crying in the back. You chasing after the groom and the best man. Me approaching my sister and her apologizing countless times. I waited for you outside the chapel until you arrived an hour later and the groom jumping from the topdown car and running to the chapel. My sister was getting married and you were ready to leave tomorrow. You went down the car and held your arm out for me and we attended the wedding. We danced in the reception and you continued to say all the right things and everyone adored you. As the reception drew to an end, Mom approached you and asked you to have dinner with us sometime after the wedding. \"I'll leave my schedule open,\" but I knew you wouldn't but it felt like you really would. You were believable in the end and you were so good at faking it that I completely forgot that you were. We were getting ready to leave tomorrow morning as we were packing our things. Dad gave you food to nibble on to the ride to the airport. \"What is it?\" I took a peak. \"Olives.\" I laughed so hard that night and you pulled my face closer with both hands and kissed me again and again and again. We were in the airport and the ride back home was quiet and we slept throughout the entire flight. You waited for me and helped with my luggage and continued to help me bring them to the company car I hired. I asked where you wanted to be dropped off and said that you should see me off first. I was confused but didn't contest to it. We were in my apartment not long after and you helped me with my luggage and brought them inside. I asked if you needed something to drink before heading back to your place. You didn't and I walked you out of the building and waited for your company car to fetch you. \"I'm sorry for the drama, it wasn't part of the package,\" I said. \"I loved every moment spent with you.\" You company car arrived the moment I had the urge to pull you in for a kiss. I watched as you loaded your things in the trunk and I wanted to ask you to stay, to quit the business, and continue your master degree and date me. But I didn't.

Me: (sent a "},{"Movie":"Cursed","Title":"Portrait of a Friend","Author":"Rude and not Ginger","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4600070","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I know this isn't the first story with Bo in this type of situation, but with the way he was it shows that somebody close to him in his life had to be homophobic. Sure, any teen having to deal with being homosexual would have a hard time, but up until he came out to Jimmy, Bo seemed afraid of being gay, and he had to call others gay, as though he was worried someone would figure him out, so he had to divert the attention. To go as far as bullying, that shows just how much he was in denial and how much he didn't want to be gay. To go to that extreme, he had to have been close to a homophobe, and it makes since he'd have spent his entire life with that person, taught that gay is wrong, so it had to have been a parent. Portrait of a Friend There was something up with Bo, what it was, Jimmy had no idea. Both he and Brooke had tried questioning him on it, but the black haired teen would only snap at them. So, they'd taken it upon themselves to pay closer attention to their usually cocky friend. To the causal onlooker nothing seemed up. He was still captain of the wrestling team, he was sometimes late to class in the morning, but that was nothing unusual. He looked more tied, but that could be put down the exam stress. Only Jimmy and Brooke seemed to notice any change. Bo was loud, loved being the centre of attention, and always had some bizarre reason for not doing his homework (\"My pen ran out of ink, so I went to buy another pen, but I got lost on my way back and eventually got taken home by a tourist who luckily had a map with him. By that time it was late, and I tried my pen but I found it was a dud, and I couldn't go back again or I would never find my way home\" or a simpler \"I'm afraid I simply had better things to do\"). Now, he'd sit threw class and lunch hardly saying a word. He wasn't socialising much, and when the teacher asked why his homework hadn't been handed in, he'd merely shrug his shoulders. So, when Bo swaggered into the classroom that morning, smirk on his face and took his usual seat, ignoring the teachers questions as to why he was late, Jimmy thought maybe he'd been over analysing the situation, maybe Bo had just been a little stressed. He watched as the other teen rocked on the back legs of his chair, feet up on the desk and chewing on a pencil. \"Feet down and concentrate, Bo.\" Mr Townrowe snapped. \"Can't sir, I've just gotten comfy.\" Mr Townrowe strode over to Bo's desk, and knocked his feet to the floor, causing the chair to fall back onto all four legs. \"And your essay? Did you bother to do it?\" Bo pulled an innocent face. \"Well, the thing is sir, I really wanted to, but I had a late night, you see, I was up all night demanding better pay and conditions for our fine, hardworking teachers.\" He was met with a scowl. Bo tugged on his ear. \"Er, the aliens took it back to Betelgeuse as an example of fine Earth literature.\" \"You can see me after school, you will write it up then.\" With that, he turned and strode back to the front of the room. Jimmy was also about to face the front from watching the sceptical, but he saw an odd look on his friends face, he seemed… relieved. That was certainly odd. What part of staying at school longer would appeal to him? Perhaps he was trying to avoid something. Reminding himself to ask Bo about it at lunch, Jimmy turned back to the class. \"So.\" Jimmy said, putting his tray down next to his friend and taking a seat. \"What was all that about this morning?\" Bo raised his eyebrows as Brooke joined them. \"All what about?\" \"This morning when you got detention, you looked almost pleased with the fact.\" Jimmy elaborated. \"Oh, that, I'm simply setting a new record for most detentions received.\" Bo shrugged with a light grin. \"Be serious for once.\" Brooke said, rolling her eyes. \"What's troubling you?\" Bo swallowed, his eyes momentarily scanning the cafeteria, as though searching for an answer. \"It's nothing. My aunt's visiting for a few days, and I'd do anything to avoid her, she still talks to me like I'm five.\" Brooke frowned. \"You're good at sarcasm Bo, but you're a rubbish liar. Come on, what's really bothering you? We just want to help.\" Bo scowled, anger welling up with the questioning. They just couldn't let it go! They'd been badgering him for weeks now, and quite frankly, he was pissed off. At least, that's what he liked to tell himself. It was easier to be angry than scared. \"I've told you before, it's nothing!\" The dark haired teen snapped. Jimmy sighed. \"Bo, please? We know something's up.\" \"Well maybe it's just you two idiots constantly annoying me!\" With that, Bo stood from his seat and strode off, leaving his meal untouched. \"Well that went well.\" Jimmy said as the door swung shut behind the other boy. That evening, Bo walked as slowly as possible back home, thankful he hadn't taken his car that morning. Still, when his house came into view, he wished he lived further away. He licked his lips worriedly as he slid the key into the door and slipped inside. For a few moments, he stayed still, listening for any sounds. The place was silent. With a relieved sigh, he dashed up to his room, depositing his school bag on the floor by his bed. He fell onto his back and stared up at the plain ceiling. He was tired, he'd hardly spelt in days. Maybe he could get some sleep until his dad returned… Bo's eyes snapped open, and he spent a moment trying to work out what was going on, then he heard a door bang downstairs. Seemed his dad was back. Bo wasn't sure how long he'd slept, or if he even had. His head felt light and foggy with sleep, so some time must have passed. He stayed perfectly still, straining to here the noises downstairs. It sounded like his dad had gone into the living room, as he was pretty sure he could hear the TV. If he just stayed in his room, out of his dad's way, he'd be fine. Bo turned onto his side, facing away from the door, and pulled the covers up over his shoulder. He closed his eyes, but knew he'd be unable to fall back to sleep. Not the with threat of his father only downstairs. Time ticked by as he just lay there, willing his dad to go to bed early. Alas, little seemed to work in his favour lately, and so he wasn't surprised by the shout of \"BOY! Get down here now!\" Bo begrudgingly kicked away the covers and got out of bed, slowly making his way downstairs, wanting more and more to turn and run with each steady step. He stood in the doorway of the living room, reluctant to go in. His father was sat in the armchair, watching football on the telly. He had a beer in his hand, but it didn't seem like he'd had much; not that he needed alcohol to be a basted, he did fine by himself. \"What?\" He asked when his dad didn't look away from the screen. \"Make me some dinner, that's what you fuckin' queer's do ain't it. Can't be real men, only good for cookin' an' cleanin' shit.\" Bo scowled, but didn't reply, he was getting off easy here. Most likely his dad just couldn't be bothered to do anything while the game was on. Bo glanced at the telly to see the score, he'd always been a football fan since he was little, but after he'd admitted to his father that he was gay, he no longer let him watch. Apparently he was a sissy-girl and football was only for real men. Seeing that the team he'd always supported was winning, Bo turned and headed into the kitchen. He wasn't the greatest cook, but he wasn't that bad, and before he new it he was handing his dad a plate full of hot food. He was about to scurry out of the room, when his dad told him to stay where he was. Bo stopped, and shifted from one foot to another anxiously. His dad said nothing more, just continued to watch the game and eat silently. Bo was nervous, he tired distracting himself with the telly, but he couldn't focus on it, his mind kept on running away with ideas of what his dad wanted with him, each one worse than the last. Subconsciously, his hand rubbed at his side, where a huge, ugly bruise was hidden behind his t-shirt. After what seemed like forever, yet still much to short a time, his dad had finished, and placed the now empty plate on the floor by the side of the armchair. He turned from the telly to look at his son. \"At work today, I over heard a co-worker telling another the daughter of his wife's friend turned out to be a lesbian. Her parents sent her to a rehabilitation camp were she learned the proper heteronormativity way of life. I believe you would greatly befit from this.\" Bo looked at him a mixture of shock and disgust. \"A 'rehabilitation camp'? I'm not a junkie! There's nothing to fix! To Hell with heteronormativity, people are different, and you can't change that, there's nothing wrong with me!\" That apparently was a bad thing to say, Bo had never seen his dad looking so furious. \"A man's place is head of the family! Not prancing around like some fuckin' fairy!\" He wasn't giving up though. \"Well tough shit, coz guess what? I am a damn 'fairy'!\" Before he quite knew what had happened, his dad had picked up the plate and thrown it at him, hard, which hit the side of his face. At the surprise impact, he stumbled backwards and tripped, landing on his back with a thump and cracking his head on the floor. Momentarily dazed, he had no time to get away from the harsh kick to his chest. All of the air was pushed from his lungs, causing him to gasp, and his father wasted no time raining in a few more blows. Pain erupted all over his upper body, the blood vessels under his skin burst, creating vicious bruising. He could hardly breathe; each kick robbing him of the precious little air he had. Each one connecting with his ribs, threatening to break every single one. His eyes stung with tears and his head was throbbing. He tried to curl up into himself, but the agonizing blows to his chest stopped him. He tried to get out of the way, but he could hardly breathe, much less move. He was trapped, unable to defend himself as ever part of his chest and head screamed at him in pain. He tried telling his father to stop, but no words would form due to lack of oxygen. \"No son of mine will be some fuckin' cock-suckin' fag!\" His father sounded estranged, he spit the words hatefully and his dark eyes shone with fury. Hot tears of both anger and pain streamed down Bo's face. In a way, the words stung worse than the physical pain, to know that his own father hated him enough to treat him this way. Another kick and a horrendous crack ran out across the room. Two more kicks, and another crack. He wanted to scream, it hurt so much, but he was completely helpless. His father continued his assault and Bo could do nothing. Pain had taken over, he couldn't think, he had to force himself to gasp in air, but each breath felt like his ribs were piercing his lungs, ripping them apart and burying deep inside them. Finally, after two more broken ribs, his father just walked away without a word, stepping over his son as though he were merely an unconventially placed object and shut the door behind him. Bo was left on the floor. He wanted to curl into himself, to protect himself, but he couldn't move from the pain, he couldn't even breathe. He lay there, alone, broken, gasping and shivering for the entire night. TBC[Chapter 2] Forgot to say last chapter, I'm not American, and have never been to America, but I'm trying to remember the correct words for things (e.g. chips rather than crisps), so let me know if a word/phrase is to British rather than American and I'll change it, thanks. Portrait of a Friend When Bo hadn't turned up to school for three days in a row, a worried Jimmy and Brooke had gone round to his house after school. Bo's father had answered the door, and told them that Bo had gone to stay with his mother for the week. Neither were satisfied. Bo's mother lived in New York, and he'd tell them if he were going. Therefore, when a week had passed and still no sign of their friend, they'd gone back. Bo's father had informed them that he was ill, but would be returning to school the following morning. They'd asked to visit him in his room, but the man was quick to get rid of them, saying something about not wanting them to catch Bo's bug. The next morning, Jimmy and Brooke arrived early at school, looking out for any sign of their friend, despite the fact he was usually late. They were just worried. \"I hope he shows up,\" Brooke sighed. \"I really want to see him, make sure he's ok.\" \"Bo's a big boy, he can take care of himself.\" Jimmy shrugged, but he sounded just as worried as his girlfriend. \"Well, if he doesn't show up, I don't care what his dad says, I'm going to see him.\" Brooke promised, eyes set in a glare. \"See who?\" Both teens jumped at the voice coming from behind them, and spun round to see Bo looking back. \"You, you silly git!\" Brooke laughed, giving the black haired teen a friendly hug, missing the wince as she pressed against Bo's still healing ribs. \"Just where have you been?\" \"Went to visit mom in New York, last minute thing, but I ended up getting a slight case of the flu.\" He shrugged. Jimmy couldn't help but think that it sounded rehearsed. \"Well, I'm glad you're back.\" Jimmy said, clapping a hand on his shoulder. \"You have no idea how boring class is without you there to annoy the teachers.\" \"It's a flourless talent so few posses.\" Bo grinned as the three headed inside towards the lockers. Looking in the restroom mirror, Bo was glad to see no visible trace of the mark which had been left on the side of his face from the plate. For days it had been an angry red before fading to a ugly bruise and disappearing. Class was in session, and so Bo felt safe enough to hitch up his shirt. There was a long scrape across his stomach from when his dad had pushed him the day before and he'd fallen against the sharp edge of the oven door. He traced a finger across it with a feather light touch and ignored the ever so slight tingle of pain it caused. Sighing, he lifted his shirt up further, exposing his chest, not quite feeling comfortable removing it completely. It was still bruised, both front and sides, but the purple and yellow and faded into green and blue. The few kicks he'd received since then hadn't helped, but thankfully his ribs seemed to be healing pretty well. It no longer hurt so much to breathe, but he still made sure to take steady, even breaths. Jimmy and Brooke had thankfully quit bugging him so much, once he'd started acting more like his old self, disrespecting teachers, being loud and slightly obnoxious, they relaxed more, having decided what ever was bothering Bo had settled down. Some part of him so desperately wanted to tell them everything, but he couldn't, he was too ashamed. Ashamed of what his father did, ashamed for letting him do these things, ashamed he wasn't strong enough to stop it, but most of all, he was ashamed of himself. He was weak and stupid, and he sure as hell wasn't a good enough son. Everything had been fine before, when his dad had thought he was normal, but it all fell apart. Bo had finally admitted to himself that he was different from most boys, and after telling Jimmy, after having been attacked by a God damn werewolf he thought he could handle it. He knew his dad didn't like gays, but he'd thought his dad might understand, after all, he was his son. How wrong he was. Bo laughed bitterly as he thought about it. Of course his father wouldn't accept him for who he was. He clearly remembered a time when he was just thirteen years old and confused as to why he was looking at guys rather than the girls as his friends did, he was in the mall with his parents, before the divorce, and there had been two men who looked to be in there mid twenties in the grocery store chatting away, hands clasped as they shopped. Bo remembered all of the hateful things his dad had said, looking at the men as though they were the worst type of scum. With a defeated sigh, Bo let his shirt fall back into place. Maybe if he tried to be normal? What If he got a new girlfriend? Perhaps he'd start to feel something for her over time. After all, girls were queuing up to go on a date with him. Deep down though, he new it'd never work, he'd been with Brooke for months and every kiss meant nothing. Every time he closed his eyes when he was with her, he imagined someone else, a strong flat chest, toned stomach, muscled arms and lean, not the round breasts pressed against him, the softness of her. No matter how hard he tried to change his way of thinking, his mind would always wonder. Maybe though, just maybe, if he could find the right girl, one who wasn't so girly and all pretty smiles and soft features, maybe he'd be ok. And if not, perhaps it'd still get his father off of his back. With one last sigh, Bo left the restroom and headed back to class with a heavy heart. He scanned the cafeteria, ignoring his friends chatter, mostly his wrestling team mates talking about the latest fight on the telly. After a few minutes, his eyes landed on a table off to the side, full of a group of chattering girls, mainly on Kim Welsh. She wasn't the prettiest girl around, but she also wasn't ugly, rather plain looking really with her short dark brown hair she sometimes spiked in a fashionable way, dark green eyes and average build. Her hips were slightly narrow, and her breast size was nothing to brag about to your mates. She shared a few classes with him, and although she wasn't one of the popular kids, she wasn't unpopular neither, sort of middle ground. He didn't know to much about her, but from what he did know, she wasn't the type that liked to hang around the mall waiting for the new shoe shop to open, nor the type of person who'd spend hours on end getting ready for a party, she'd just throw on some clothes and have fun. Without a word to his friends, he got up and walked across to the group. Some part of him feeling like he was betraying himself with his actions, but he mentally shook it off, he just wanted things to go back to how they should be. All talk at the table stopped as he reached them, many of the girls blushing or sending him a smile. Ignoring the others, he hopped up onto the table, so he was sat facing Kim, practically next to her. He gave her a grin. \"Fancy going out Friday?\" She looked at him sceptically, after all, they'd never even spoken before. \"Excuse me?\" \"You know, me, you, doing something. At the same time. Together.\" She seemed at a loss by the sudden interest shown by one of the most popular guys in school. Her friend next to her gave her a little push. \"Oh my God, go on, say yes! If you don't I sure as hell will.\" Kim still didn't look wholly convinced as she looked Bo over. \"Go where exactly?\" Bo shrugged. \"Anywhere, you chose.\" After slight hesitation, Kim nodded. \"You like punk?\" \"Yeah, most of it.\" \"I got two tickets for a concert, friday.\" She went into her bag and pulled out some paper and a pen, quickly scribbling something down. \"Here, my number.\" Bo nodded as he took it, glancing at it before folding it up and pocketing it. \"Later,\" he winked, before hopping off the table and returning to his seat, leaving behind a mildly confused Kim and her giggly friends. Back at his table, he ignored his friends questions, instead wondering if he'd just made things better, or a hell of a lot worse. TBC[Chapter 3] Portrait of a Friend \"C'mon, you're never gonna beat someone like that!\" Bo shouted as Dale Withers, new guy on the team, tried to take down Kyle. \"Don't try knockin' him by his stomach, you need a grip on him, throw him sideways and down.\" Dale did as told, and managed to get Kyle to the floor, unfortunately, he seemed so pleased by that he lost concentration, and Kyle had all the time he needed to flip him and pin him down. Bo groaned, running a hand down his face. \"God damn Dale, that's the third time this week! You've got to remember to pin him or you're gonna lose.\" Dale sent him a sheepish grin. \"Sorry Bo, I guess I need more practise.\" \"Hell yeah you do, my sister could take you, and the only sport she does is ridding a horse twice a week.\" He shook his head. \"Still, I guess I'll cut you some slack, you've only been on the team two weeks. Next time though, you'd better not get flipped, or I'll let Ali have a go with you.\" Dale cast a wide eyed look at Alistair Western, who stood at about six foot six and was build like a body builder. Despite his scary person and tough look, Bo was one of the few people who new Ali was really rather a softy at heart, and always did his best to avoid any confrontation. Of course, new guys on the team didn't need to know that, it sure helped them focus when they knew the consequence of not doing so was facing off with the giant muscle man. \"I'll do better next time; I guess I just get carried away.\" Bo nodded. \"Ok guys, may as well leave it here today. Anyone up for pizza?\" He wasn't hunger, but nowadays, he'd always come up with reasons to avoid going home for as long as he could. \"Count me in; I'm starved, missed lunch.\" Joe said as the group headed for the locker room. \"Pizza sounds good right about now, beats physics homework.\" Ali snorted as he pulled open the door. A few more agreements came as most of the team went to hit the showers. Bo merely had to change his t-shirt and pull on his grey hoody. He'd only coached today, not willing to risk banging up his damaged ribs and tender flesh. He waited around for his team mates and friends, diverting his gaze when they wondered out of the shower one by one with only a towel around their waists. He wondered how they'd react if they found out he bat for the other team, if they'd be disgusted and refuse to change in front of him, or even be in the same room as him. Shaking his head to himself, Bo put it out of mind; he had no interest in coming out to anyone else. Jimmy, Brooke, his dad, his brother and his sister knew, no one else, and his brother and sister - both of who were older and already at collage - had only found out second-hand from their father. Bo wasn't to sure how they felt about it, he didn't get to talk to them much, but he hoped that they'd understand. Occupying himself with his thoughts, Bo waited for everyone to finish dressing, before leading the way out and heading for the parking lot, some people catching a ride with another, Bo ended up taking Dale with him. \"Nice ride,\" he commented once seated inside, gazing round the car with sharp green eyes. \"Thanks, it was a present from my uncle last year.\" Bo said as he left the school grounds. \"He runs some big car dealership in Texas.\" \"Cool, I've got some family in Texas, s'where my mom's from.\" Dale grinned, running a hand threw his spiked hair. The rest of the drive was spent just making small talk and when they pulled up outside the pizza place, some of the guys where already there. The evening went by quickly, everyone joking about and relaxing. The time was filled with of loud talking, naming of many girls the team members would love to sleep with (in a rather un-civilised way), talk of the latest wrestling matches on telly, and arguing over pizza slices. Before everyone even realised, the sun was sinking behind the trees, and slowly the group broke apart. Dale took a ride with someone else, and Bo found himself giving Ali, and Chad, a blonde team mate who Bo had known since freshman, a ride home. Both lived close to him. Chad was gone first, then Bo pulled up outside Ali's. Before opening the door and stepping out, Ali turned to him. \"You alright man? You seem sort of tense.\" Giving him a forced grin, Bo nodded, looking as reassuring as he could. \"Yeah, I'm fine. Just thinking is all.\" Ali frowned, not looking convinced. \"I don't know, you seem kind of off these last few weeks.\" \"Seriously man, I'm fine. You worry too much.\" Bo laughed it off. \"Now get your fat ass out of my car before you damage it.\" Giving him a friendly punch on the arm, Ali opened the door and stepped out. He shut it, waved, and headed for his house. As soon as he'd disappeared from view, Bo let his head fall against the steering wheel. He really didn't want to go home. He banged his head a few times against the wheel lightly. \"Come on man, stop being such a pussy.\" He muttered to himself. Taking a breath, he put his car into drive, and headed home. Two minutes later, Bo was looking up at the rapidly darkening sky. A pale full moon was just visible behind wispy clouds, taking his mind back to that night which seemed to mess up everything. If it weren't for that damn animal attraction shit of Jimmy's he'd have never had to admit anything to himself, and right now he wouldn't be stood outside his own home in the cold wind trying to build up the courage to go in, instead he'd be in the living room, having a beer and watching the game with his dad, cracking rude comments and shouting at the telly. He looked away from the moon, and pulled out his key. There were no lights on in the house, for that Bo was grateful, it meant he was alone. Not bothering to flip them on, he darted up the stairs, heading straight for his room. He opened his closet door, and gently took out his hardly-ever-used guitar. His mom had bought it for him before she went out for a pint of milk one day and wasn't heard from again for fourteen months, only to randomly get in contact with her new life, boyfriend and kid included. Shaking his head, Bo settled down on his bed, strumming the strings to no particular rhythm, just making one up as he went along. It was oddly soothing, as though the music was the only thing in the world, wrapping around him in a fake scene of security. He aloud himself to relax and fall into it, forgetting about the rest of the world. He sat and played for twenty minutes, and would have continued if not for hearing the phone ring. The set the guitar aside on the bed and stood. He made his way downstairs and picked up the cordless phone in the living room. \"Hello?\" \"Hey Bo.\" Bo blinked when he heard his brother's voice on the other end of the line. It was a very rare thing indeed that he rung. \"Hey Leo. Not that it isn't good to hear from you man, but what's up?\" \"I'm looking for dad; I really need to talk to him about something. He around?\" \"No, I don't know wh-\" \"Never mind, ask him to ring me.\" And the line went dead. Taking the phone away from his ear, Bo frowned at it, as though it where the phones fault his brother had hung up on him. Setting the phone back in its rightful place, Bo returned to his room, hoping the reason Leo hadn't took the time out to speak to him was because he was busy, not about what their father had told him about Bo. He assured himself it was the former, after all, Leo was getting married soon and he seemed to permanently be dashing about, not stopping unless he had to, trying to get everything ready and sorted. Returning to his room, his picked back up his guitar and played into the night, falling asleep long before his father stumbled in early the next morning. \"Kim?\" \"Yep.\" \"…And is there a reason you suddenly asked her out?\" Brooke asked; text books in hand as she stood facing Bo, who was sat on a wall outside school. \"Someone new to hang with.\" Bo shrugged, not showing any interest in the conversation. Brooke frowned. \"You don't even know her, and you obviously don't find her attractive. I understand you might not want to come out Bo, but you're hardly helping yourself here.\" \"Whatever. I'm not exactly doing any damage.\" \"But what if Kim started to like you?\" Bo shrugged. \"I'll dump her before she ever got attached.\" Brooke scowled, not at all pleased with that answer. \"Oh yeah, that's real nice Bo. If you don't want to come out, then don't just pick up any girl. You'll only complicate things in the long run.\" \"What the hell do you know?\" Bo answered back, hopping off the wall. \"If I want you're opinion, I'll ask for it, otherwise, keep out of my business.\" The bell signalling the start of school sounded, and Bo turned to leave, but Brooke grabbed a hold of his arm. \"What's wrong with you Bo? You've been really short tempered lately, and you're not acting like yourself.\" He pulled his arm from her grip. \"Shouldn't you be looking for Jimbo?\" Not saying anymore, he turned away from the school and crossed the street, heading away. Brooke sighed as she watched him go. She knew he'd not return to school today. Turning to head into the building, she promised herself she'd find out just what was going on with her friend. \"We could always follow him?\" Jimmy suggested over lunch, having brought his own, as the cafeteria food wasn't something suitable for even a starving man. \"Spying on a friend would hardly seem right.\" Brooke sighed. \"Maybe we should talk to his dad. He must have noticed any change in Bo's behaviour.\" \"I don't know Brooke.\" Jimmy said, looking very unsure. \"Something about that guy creeps me out.\" \"Well, Bo won't talk to us, and he's the only family he has around here.\" She said reasonably. Jimmy still didn't look to happy with the idea. He looked down at his food, trying to think of a way to get around this. Honestly, he had no idea why he didn't like Bo's father, he'd only met him just the once, but since being bitten by a werewolf he'd become something of a good judge of character. \"Maybe we could find out his mom's number.\" \"Would Bo even give it to us?\" Jimmy shrugged his shoulders. \"Maybe, maybe not. If not, we'll just pick pocket his phone, her number must be in his contacts.\" Brooke raised her eyebrows. \"You can't spy on your friend, so now you want to steal from him?\" \"It's not stealing! We'd put it right back, besides, it's for his own good.\" Jimmy defended. Brooke sighed. \"Fine. But we'll ask him first. If and only if he doesn't agree we'll take his cell.\" Jimmy grinned a rather wolfish grin and finished his lunch.[Chapter 4] Portrait of a Friend Life, it is so… organised. People keep to a set schedule, even if they don't realise it. They need structure in their lives; otherwise they'd fall and have no idea of how to pick themselves up. Wake up, have breakfast, rush to work, have lunch, back to work, go for a drink with a friend, go home, have dinner, sleep. Simple, organised. But if something changes, if you stayed in bed to long, and are late for work, you panic. You're schedule has fallen apart, and you can't put it back together. People like to think freely, but they act as they are expected to. With enough of this, people don't even know which is correct. Should they stand while everyone else sits; be their own person? Or should they play it safe; stay in the herd where nobody can single them out? The answer is simple. You'd say you'd stand, but the time comes and you'll stay sitting. Nobody wants to be different, nobody wants to be that person everyone looks at funny, nobody wants to be the odd one out. Everyone has a tale to tell, weather it be something to be proud of, or a dirty little secret. And it's never true. It's merely woven from the truth. And if you ask enough you can see the line of real and lie. It was first told as being in the day, then it happened in the night. There where three men, then in another version there were five. Everybody lie's because nobody is ever satisfied. But sometimes, people will lie because they're scared. Sometimes the truth hurts a whole lot more than a lie, and nobody wants to hear it. \"Whoa, you really like to complicate things don't you?\" Jimmy said with amusement after he'd finished reading threw what Bo had written. \"Either you're trying to annoy the teacher – that really wouldn't be a shocker – or, I'd hate to be in your head.\" Bo frowned, taking his work back. \"What do you mean? There's nothing wrong with it.\" \"Well it is sort of unclear. Like flipping a coin, but it lands standing up rather than on a side. It was a simple question asking the outline of human nature.\" Jimmy replied. \"But human nature isn't simple.\" Bo argued. \"It's full of questions and self denial and greed and uncertainty. People don't have their lives planned out; they just like to pretend they do, because that's safe. If everything is planned, people think nothing can go wrong. But that's stupid, 'cause this is life, and life loves to screw you over. That makes people act in ways they wish they wouldn't. Makes them duck down their heads when really them want to raise up tall.\" Jimmy raised his eyebrows. Never had he seen Bo so into a piece of school work. It seemed human nature and characteristics were a thing that fascinated the other teen. \"Ok, not that it isn't great to be reassured that all that hair gel hasn't got into your brain, but it really is rather late to be getting into a debate about this don't you think?\" Glancing at the clock on the wall of Jimmy's room, Bo sighed seeing it was already nearing one in the morning. \"Yeah, I guess.\" Leaving his work on Jimmy's desk, Bo fell back onto the camp bed, hands behind his head and staring at the ceiling as Jimmy climbed into his bed. A moment later, the light went out and the room was bathed in darkness. \"Hey Jimbo, thanks for letting me stay over.\" \"No problem.\" Jimmy said with a yawn. \"It's nice to have someone other than my sister to talk to around here. Hey, Bo?\" \"Yeah?\" Jimmy rolled onto his side, looking over his bed at Bo, just visible in the dark. \"How come you never told me about going to see your mom?\" There was a pause; the only sound a single car passing out on the road. \"I guess I just didn't think to. It was kind of unexpected. I don't really see mom much, and she just rang, asked if I wanted to go.\" \"What's she like?\" Bo frowned, turning his head to look at his friend. \"What's with the game of twenty questions?\" Jimmy shrugged as well as he could being on his side. \"Just curious you know? I mean, both my parents have been dead awhile… I just…\" He trailed off. Bo felt a moment of shame; he'd forgotten that Jimmy's parents where dead. \"She's just average I guess. I remember when I was a little kid she'd take me to the park at weekends and we'd always get an ice cream after. Every Sunday she's take me to my grandparents and we'd all have to go to church. I never really liked that much, first few times it was fascinating, but being a kid, I soon good bored of it. She never complained though, just smiled at me and told me to settle down. When I started to get older, she seemed to grow apart from dad. We never really did things together anymore either. Then one day, after I'd just turned thirteen, she just wasn't there anymore.\" \"What do you mean?\" Jimmy asked, voice soft as though if he spoke to loud Bo would stop talking. \"It was a Tuesday; that morning just pasted like any other. I was ill that day, home from school. We needed some bread and milk, and a few other things, so mom put on her coat and shoes, said she's going to the store, and she'd be back soon. She left, and never came back. No one knew what had happened to her, I couldn't get out the image in my head of her laid dead somewhere. Anyway, my dad was mad at her and didn't do anything, so I went out looking for her. Turns out she did go to the store, just didn't come home. I tried asking everyone mom knew if they'd seen or heard anything from her, but nothing. For about a year, every time I turned a corner, I was just wishing I'd see her. Hoping she'd turn up on my birthday. Hoping she'd be waiting at home when I returned from school. It was about fourteen months after she disappeared; right out of the blue she called. It wasn't a special day or anything, I'm not why she chose to call, but she did. I remember begging her to come home, but she had a new life in New York, boyfriend and baby included. I was just sort of extra baggage after that.\" \"Whoa, that sucks.\" Bo snorted in amusement. \"Yeah.\" \"So she just upped and left without a word or warning? Never even bothered to get in touch to let you know she was ok? What did your dad do?\" Shifting on the camp bed, Bo looked back up at the ceiling. \"He fell off the wagon for a bit. Spent more time drunk than he did sober, lost his job to. My brother had already gone to collage by then, so me and my sister looked after him. Thankfully it didn't go on. After about a year he pulled himself back together, got his life back on track.\" Silence fell again, and Jimmy turned back onto his back. After hearing that, he really didn't fell right asking Bo for his mother's number, and so he kept quite. Instead, he wondered silently what he would have done if his mom had just disappeared one day. Well, she and his dad sort of did, but not threw choice. He tried imagining him and Ellie as kids, taking care of a drunken dad. He couldn't. \"I'm sorry.\" \"Don't be. Things happen.\" Bo brushed it off. \"I thought you where tired anyway?\" A chuckle. \"Yeah, I am. Night Bo.\" \"Night Jimbo.\" Jimmy fell asleep soon after, while Bo gazed up, eyes firmly open until day began to break and he fell asleep when his eyes refused to stay open any longer. \"Well?\" Brooke asked, coming to stand by Jimmy at the lockers that afternoon at school. \"Did you ask him?\" \"I,\" Jimmy tried to come up with an excuse, but failed miserably, and sighed. \"No, I just didn't feel comfortable asking him.\" Brooke let out a huff. \"This was your idea you know Jimmy.\" She grabbed him by the arm and began leading him away. \"Come on.\" \"Where are we going?\" Jimmy asked, trying to free himself from his girlfriend's tight grasp. \"Bo's in the gym.\" She explained. \"Now's the prefect time to grab his cell.\" Jimmy looked at her in surprise. \"But I thought you were against this?\" Brooke shrugged as she marched them down the corridors. \"I was, but since you failed miserably, I've decided to take initiative.\" They came to a stop outside the boys locker room and carefully opened the door, peaking round. It was empty and so they stepped inside. \"Right, we need to find his jacket.\" She pointed over to the left. \"You look over there, I'll check the right side.\" A few minutes later, Jimmy found Bo's jacket, and called Brooke over. He dipped his hand into the inside pocket, where he knew Bo kept his phone, and pulled it out. \"Got it.\" Brooke reached his side as he was looking threw the contacts. He came to a pause on 'Mom'. \"Do you really think we should do this?\" He asked, now thinking how much of a bad idea this had been all along. \"Come on Jimmy. We're just trying to help.\" Brooke answered softy, giving him a reassuring look. With a quick, jerked nod, Jimmy pressed call and put it onto loud speaker so they could both hear. It rang a few times. When Jimmy was about to hang up, someone picked up. \"Hello?\" Jimmy and Brooke both paused when they heard a masculine voice on the other end. They'd never thought that someone other than Bo's mother would answer. \"Erm, hi, er. I'm looking for-\" Stumbling over his words, Jimmy then realised that he had no idea what Bo's mom was called. He started again, doing his best to sound calm. \"Sorry, erm, I'm a friend of Bo's. I was wondering if I could talk to his mom?\" \"Kid's not got himself in any trouble has he?\" The guy asked, not sounding too happy. \"No, no, nothing like that.\" Jimmy assured. \"I just thought his mom would be able to help me out with something.\" There was another pause, this time from the other side of the line. Then they heard the guy called for a Tracey, obviously Bo's mom. There was some muffled talking, then a women's voice on the line. \"This is about Bo?\" \"Yes,\" Jimmy nodded, even though she couldn't see him. \"He in trouble?\" She interrupted before Jimmy could say anymore. \"No. He's just been acting kind of funny lately, and I was wondering if maybe you noticed anything off with him last week?\" He asked hopefully, glancing at Brooke who gave him an encouraging smile. \"Last week?\" Tracey asked, sounding confused. \"How would I know?\" Both teens frowned at that. \"Well Bo was with you.\" Jimmy said. \"…Wasn't he? A snort of amusement. \"God has that kid got you fooled. I ain't seen Bo in a year. Not since all that trouble he got himself into.\" \"What?\" Jimmy asked; confusion in his voice. \"Listen kid, you sound like a nice guy. Last time Bo was here he was causing a right nuisance of himself, stealing, getting into fights, stuff like that. I didn't need all that shit when I have a little kid. I sent him back home, told him to give me a call once he'd got back on track. That was the last time I spoke to him.\" Jimmy and Brooke shared a look of disbelief. \"So… you think he could be doing that again?\" \"I don't know what that boy's up to. Listen kid, I've got to go, but tell Bo to give me a call sometime.\" The line went dead, and Jimmy slowly hung up. Why would Bo lie to them like that? Why had he been stealing and fighting? Jimmy knew from first hand experience that Bo used to be a total jerk, but he never hit Jimmy, nor had he even heard anything about Bo stealing. \"Now what?\" Brooke asked, looking at the cell in Jimmy's hand. \"I guess we could try talking with him again.\" He suggested, not sounding exactly thrilled at the idea. The last few times they'd tried that, Bo had gotten angry. \"What about his dad? He was the one who first told us Bo was in New York.\" Brooke said as Jimmy replaced the cell. \"Do you think he didn't know Bo wasn't with his mom?\" \"I have no idea. I thought I knew him, Brooke. Turns out I know nothing.\" Jimmy sounded defeated, and Brooke sent him a sympathetic look. \"I know, me to.\" She kissed him. \"Come on, we better get out of the lockers before someone comes in.\" They slipped out, both thinking on all that Tracey had told them. Both where now even more determined to find out just what was going on. TBC. I'm going to Lapland for a few days on Thursday (yay! my first holiday since I was 12), so I'll try to get the next chapter written and up by Wednesday, but if not, it might be about a week until the next chapter.[Chapter 5] Oh God, it's been forever, sorry *iz ashamed* I wasn't gonna put in any slash just yet, but I decided to be nice and did it for Lyra the BadWolf cause you're awesome :) Well, more teasing you with it here ;) Portrait of a Friend That evening Bo entered his house to a loud TV and even louder laughing and talking. His dad and two of his work buddies where in the living room, beer and friendly drunken shouting flowing freely. He kept his head down and tried to pass unnoticed, he'd only taken a single step when his name was called out however. He glanced up to find two cheerful faces, and one anything but pleased. \"Bo!\" One of the men, Gary, called as he stumbled over and threw an arm around the teen's shoulders, almost knocking him off balance when his full weight was dropped against him. \"When are you comin' to work with your old man then, eh?\" Bo gave him a tight smile, trying to get him off without being to obvious. \"I'm still at school.\" Gary gave a grunt and Bo turned his attention to his father, looking at his shoulder rather than meeting his eyes, and licked his lips nervously. \"Dad, Leo called the other day, he wanted to talk to you.\" He didn't reply, and Bo took it as a meaning to get lost, one order he was all too happy to comply with. If only Gary would move away. \"I've got to make a call.\" He said the first thing that came to mind, then realised that he actually did. It was Thursday, and he'd asked Kim out tomorrow, she'd said to ring her. \"Got a date?\" Gary asked, grinning a toothy grin at him and pulling he a little closer in a one armed hug. \"Yeah, I do, I need to call her.\" And he slipped out from Gary's grasp. He glanced at his father, who was looking at him strangely, but quickly looked away. Grabbing the phone in the hall, he dashed upstairs, ignoring the embarrassing calls from Gary. Ten minutes later, after an only slightly awkward conversation, he'd arranged with Kim to pick her up tomorrow at seven in the evening, which would give them plenty of time to get ready and do anything that may need doing before leaving for some concert of a band Bo didn't bother to remember the name of. Right now he was hungry, and knew it'd be the prefect time to head on down to the kitchen and get something to eat while is dad's friends where here. He couldn't exactly do anything in front of them after all. Still, nothing could calm his nerves when he was in his home. He padded down the stairs as silently as he could. Pausing at the bottom of the stairs, he listened to the three men's voices, still in the living room. Now was a good time to head for the kitchen, but Bo stayed rooted to the spot. What if his father came out into the hall, or wanted another beer from the kitchen. Minutes passed, and Bo was only getting more and more anxious. He should have gone minutes ago! Now his dad would come out for sure. Another minute passed, and the hall stayed empty, licking his lips and trying to ignore the to quick beat of his heart, Bo made a dash for the kitchen, still keeping as silent as he could. Without wasting time, he filled a cup with water, grabbed a bag of chips from the cupboard, and made a mad dash back out into the hall and up the stairs. Right now he didn't care for the noise, or how stupid his actions must seem from someone elses perspective. His senses said run. His legs worked extra hard and all he could think was getting to his room. Adrenalin making every emotion double and action increase. He didn't notice any water from the cup splash over the side and onto his hand. He had to get to his room. He was safe there. He put the food and drink on the floor and collapsed onto his bed, the fright having stolen his energy. He panted, having been robbed of breath at the sudden bolting, and waited for his heart to calm. Voices still floated up from downstairs as Bo laid still, the only movement he was making was blinking and the rise and fall of his chest with each breath. A few minutes passed like this, until Bo finally collected himself and reached down for his snack. He ate as slowly as he could, it wasn't as if he were in any sort of rush. Still, one bag of chips doesn't stretch far, and soon he found himself stairing aimlessly at the wall, listening to the sounds coming from downstairs. He didn't want to be here. Where did he want to be? He didn't know. He rolled over onto his side and scowled at the world in general, he didn't want to exist here, he didn't want any friends intruding on his life, he just wanted to be left alone in nothingness. …But, at the same time, being alone scared him more than he cared to admit. \"What do you think about Bo?\" Jimmy asked his sister, sat on the sofa watching some boring reality show on the TV. Ellie glanced at him from her position next to him before looking back to the telly. \"Why? Fallen out with him?\" \"No,\" Jimmy sighed. \"He's just been acting sort of strange lately. I rang his mom today, and she said a while back he was getting into trouble a lot.\" \"He's a teenager, all teenager's have off times. Look at you,\" Ellie smirked, \"you've been a weirdo right from the start.\" Jimmy gave her a shove with his shoulder. \"You're one to talk. At least I can say I've never fell for psycho who turns into a wolf every month.\" Ellie scowled. \"Animal attraction, I couldn't help that. Anyway, I don't want to talk about it. That time is now just a bad memory.\" She said firmly, ending any more talk about werewolves. \"Fine. But what do you think I should do about Bo? And it's not some teenager thing before you say it again. He's been acting way off lately.\" \"Maybe he's having family problems.\" Ellie shrugged. \"Has he argued with his dad lately?\" \"Don't know, but I was thinking off going round and asking his dad if anything's up, cause Bo just won't talk to either me or Brooke.\" Jimmy said. \"And can you please change channel?\" She flicked over onto a movie with many explosions and no plot. \"Here, will that keep your few brain cells entertained?\" She joked. \"You know, I've seen his dad around town a few times. He seems rather arrogant and self-scented. I wouldn't expect much out of him.\" Jimmy snorted in agreement. \"I met him briefly not long ago. I had the feeling he just wanted to slam the door in my face. He certainly got rid of me quickly.\" \"Dick.\" Muttered Ellie before she stood and headed towards the kitchen. \"I'll go start on dinner.\" An hour later found Bo outside a non-descriptive store, vodka in one hand and leaning drunkenly against the side of the building. When a person walked by, he'd ask in a not at all dignified slurred voice if they'd get him some beer. Due to being underage and having no fake ID, he'd already been thrown out a few places. Most would make a face, tut and move on, but some would comply and for that Bo was satisfied for now. He'd forgotten all his troubles and a pleasant buzz was keeping him both light and mellow. He took another deep drink and hiccupped, sniggering afterwards. The streetlights began flickering to life along the street, and Bo swayed on the spot, going slightly cross-eyed trying to watch them while it seemed the ground just refused to stay still. Soon getting bored of the lights, the teen began walking in a zigzag motion down the street, tripping on his feet a few times as he went. \"Man, you are wasted .\" Bo blinked as his mind slowly registered the voice, then he swung around a little to fast and almost toppled over as a horrid nauseous feeling crept up on him. \"Wh?\" Was all he managed to get out as a hazy view of Dale came into focus. \"I think you should go home, Bo.\" Dale said, taking a step forwards and steadying him with an hand on his arm. \"Piss o'.\" The dark haired teen muttered, pulling his arm away. Dale sighed. \"Seriously man, you should go home.\" \"Don't wanna.\" Bo all but whined, taking a step back and a gulp of vodka. \"Well, what do you want?\" Bo squinted; trying to focus on his friend threw the double vision and bight lights from streetlamps and passing cars. He thought about that question for a few moments, he wanted a lot of things. He looked over Dale, his dark blonde hair, green eyes and toned body. So Bo said the first thing to come to mind. \"Sex.\" Then promptly leaned over and kissed his stunned friend. TBC What rating would you guys like for more intimate scenes? Would ya like it graphic, or should I just sort of… breeze over it? ","Summary":" I know this isn't the first story with Bo in this type of situation, but with the way he was it sho"},{"Movie":"Omen","Title":"The Sergeant's Daughter II: My Boy hears Voices","Author":"vamprincesse","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9506423","Passage":"[Chapter 1] DAMIEN: OMEN II / OMEN III: THE FINAL CONFLICT The Sergeant's Daughter II: My Boy hears Voices The car stopped, and before my father could even take the keys out, Damien had my hand and was pulling me out. He dragged me outside forcefully, causing my feet to fall from under me. Damien caught me and looked back as we race-walked. \"You okay?\" He asked. \"Yeah, let's just go.\" I replied, looking forward at the house infront of us. We ran up the steps to the Thorn family's winter apartment. Which, was ours now as the heirs to the Thorn fortune. But, that wasn't important now to Damien. We should be celebrating, but instead, Damien was having a panic attack over the fact that a dagger had plumeted through my shoulder. He was dragging me up the stairs to the second floor and through the family room and kitchen to the bathroom. And, this was not easy for me, because of the pain I was in. Damien was sure to go slow on the stairs, knowing my condition. Damien would glance back at me every now and then to see my shoulder. The blood from my wound could seep through any moment now. We walked down the hallway to the bathroom and Damien kept his hand on mine. When we made it there, Damien pulled me inside. \"We need to treat that wound.\" He said as I sat down on the edge of the bathtub. Damien took out a towel from the cabinet under the sink and placed it by me. I took off my uniform's jacket and looked over at my shoulder. Blood was already leaking through my blouse and my eyes widened. I was still wearing my bandage... Damien looked down at the blood and sighed. He sat down next to me and reached over to the faucet. Damien turned on the hot water and it started to fill up the bathtub. I got down from the edge and sat down on the floor, my arm hanging over the side into the water. \"I really don't know how we're going to do this...\" Damien said as he looked into the water. I looked around and then back at Damien. \"Just...\" I scooted over, creatign space for Damien to sit down next to me. \"Sit down by me and clean it.\" Damien smiled slightly and stepped down next to me. He kneeled by me and looked at me. I smiled and looked into the water. My fingers were just barely touching the surface. \"Is it too hot?\" Damien asked, making me laugh. \"No, Damien...it's fine.\" I said smiling. We sat in silence for a few moments, I listened to the running water as it slowly took in my hand. I sighed and felt my eyes slip closed. Damien noticed the water creeping up to my blouse and he lifted up my arm gently. \"Raynee, I don't mean to be too...you know...\" He blushed and looked at me. I just smiled. \"But could you...take off your shirt?\" I just smiled at him. I couldn't hold back a laugh. \"Damien, it's fine.\" I unbuttoned my blouse and took it off carefully. The cloth slipped over my wound and I let out a gasp between clenched teeth. Damien pulled me close and held me there, letting my blouse fall to the floor. I could tell that Damien knew when I was in pain, even when I showed no signs of it. Are we connected like that..? \"Damien...\" I sighed. I tried to pull back from Damien's protective grip, but he held me tight. \"Damien...I'm fine. You can let go now.\" He slowly allowed me to pull back. As I did, he looked at me, blushing. I smiled, giggling at Damien's face. He looked into the water and back at me. \"We should probably get this over with...\" He said under his breath. \"You do know it's going to hurt, right, Raynee?\" I nodded. \"Yeah.\" I untied the blood-stained bandage from around my cut and let it fall to the floor. I looked at my wound and slowly lowered my arm into the hot water. The water came up halfway to my arm. Damien put his arms back around me as my hand hit the ceramic tub's bottom. I smiled, rolling my eyes. I looked up at Damien. \"I guess we'll have to pour the water on it.\" Damien turned off the water faucet and turned back to me. \"Would you like for me to do it?\" I paused and kept my head down, nodding. Damien kept one arm around me and I put mine around him. I burried my face in his shoulder and prepared to feel the stinging of the water. \"Okay...\" Damien said. I could hear the water move as he took a handful of it. \"Are you ready?\" \"Yes.\" I said. I shifted uncomfortably and squinted my eyes shut as tight as I could. Damien poured the water over my cut hesitantly, obviously knowing it would hut. Pain shot up my arm and I finched, hissing through my teeth. It stung pretty bad, worse than anything I've ever felt. Even worse than that time I spilt bleach on my legs a few years ago. Damien held me tighter and stroked my back lovingly, trying to ease the pain. \"Shh...\" He whispered. \"It's okay, the blood is comming of pretty quickly. I have an idea, actually.\" I pulled my head back to watch Damien as he grabbed the towel next to me. He dipped a corner of it into the water and let it drip. \"This might make it hurt less.\" Damien put the damp towel against my wound, and I watched curiously. Although it did still hurt, it wasn't as bad. The corner of the white towel quickly turned crimson red when it hit my wound. Damien let go of me and took hold of my arm gently. He began to dab the blood off of my wound until it was clean. Or, as clean as it could be. \"See?\" Damien said, looking at the cut. \"It's not that bad, Raynee. Look.\" I did as Damien told me to and looked at it. It wasn't as bad as most stab wounds that I had seen thanks to my Father, and that relieved me. It wasn't deep, but the blood was still oozing out. Damien brought the towel up to it again and dabbed the blood away softly. \"I'm glad it's not too bad. I was expecting a lot worse, I mean, Ann did it pretty forcefu-\" \"Raynee? Damien?\" We both froze at the sound of my father's voice. Damien looked at me with big eyes and I did the same to him. \"y-Yes, Dad?\" I answered, my voice shaking. \"Are you okay? I heard the water running, and I just thought I'd check on you...\" Damien put his hand over his mouth and tried to stiffle out his laughs. I playfully slapped him on the shoulder. \"I'm fine, Dad.\" I said as I took my arm out of the bathtub and snatched the towel out of Damien's hands. My Father was silent for a moment, and we thought he had walked away. Damien took this oppurtunity and motioned for me to stand up. I stood and handed Damien the towel, and he sat down on the edge of the bathtub again. \"Sit beside me, Ray.\" He whispered, and I obeyed. Damien started to dry my arm off for me. \"...Is Damien in there with you?\" We heard my Father's voice again. We both turned paler than normally. Damien immediately fell silent, and my face turned pink. \"...What?\" \"Is Damien with you?\" My Dad repeated, making Damien sigh nervously. I giggled quietly I could tell my Father was still getting used to Damien and I being in a relationship like this, regarding my destiny or not. Dad has always been so protective of me, and that's why I was suprised by the fact he had me go to Damien's school. Even if it is Damien's destiny to marry me, maybe even in a year or two if necessary, I know my Dad isn't fond of the idea. But, we all have to serve the Antichrist in a unique way, and that so happens to be mine. \"No, Dad he's not.\" I said, trying to sound as calm as possible. I was hoping Dad would believe me. \"Then where is he?\" Damien scoffed. \"He really doesn't believe you, does he?\" He whispered. I playfully elbowed him in the chest this time and he laughed. \"Shush, Damien...!\" I wispered, trying not to laugh. \"He's in his room, Dad. But he asked not to be disturbed...\" I thought of a quick repsonse, as horrible as it was. My Dad stood there for a few seconds again. \"Well, I shoudl go check on h-\" \"Dad, you're seriously going to disobey the Antichrist?\" I laughed. \"Isn't that the one thing we're not supposed to do?\" He sighed loudly and chuckled. \"Okay, Raynee.\" Damien put his hand on my back and smiled widely. \"Nice job..\" He whispered, kissing me on the cheek. I blushed, and looked toward the door again. \"Goodnight, Dad.\" I said as Damien started to dry off my arm again. \"Goodnight, Raynee. Tell Damien goodnight, too.\" \"I will.\" I smiled. We heard my Father's footsteps walk down the hallway and the hall light swtiched off. Damien and I remained silent until we heard the door to the second guest bedroom close. Damien laughed, causing me to look at him, still smiling. \"Well, that was interesting...\" He smirked. I rolled my eyes. \"What? I didn't want to get in trouble...\" Damien laughed again and looked down at my cut again. \"Well, I think it's clean for now. We should probably do this every night or so...we'll have to keep it hidden from your Father.\" I nodded. \"Okay.\" I stood up and picked up my bandage from beside the bathtub. It was still very bloody, I dipped it into the warm water as Damien was letting the water out by the drain. The water was a faint shade of pink thanks to all of the blood I had lost. I took the bandage out of the water and squeezed the water out of it. Damien came up behind me and took the bandage out of my hands. \"Here...\" He said as he knelt beside me. \"I'll do it.\" He wrapped the bandage around my arm carefully and tied it. I smiled at him and he smiled back. Damien leaned in and pressed his lips against mine, and I giggled. He pulled back and helped me up to my feet as I grabbed my blouse and jacket. \"Come on, let's go to bed...\" Damien said, taking my hand and leading me out of the bathroom to my room. I sat on my bed, putting on my blouse as Damien lay down beside me. I laid back next to him and he put his arm around me, causing me to cuddle up against him. \"That was exhausting...\" Damien said. \"I'm so tired.\" \"Me too.\" I replied, sighing and trying not to remember the events of today. I felt Damien move and pull up my blanket over us. Everything was so calm. I knew that as calm as it was in Damien's warm embrace, I woudl still have nightmares of what has happened and what was to come. The thought of it made me hold on to Damien tighter. Damien put his hand on my head and played with my hair. I had a feeling that Damien knows when I'm scared, and when he does, he plays with my hair. It has always calmed me down. Mom used to do it when I was little, from what I can remember. In fact, I really don't remember much of her. I pushed my thoughts aside and let my body relax into Damien's arms, hoping to get some rest. \"Goodnight, Damien...I love you.\" I said, smiling. \"I love you too, Raynee. Sweet dreams...\" Damien kissed my head and pulled me closer to him. I closed my eyes and let my exhaustion get the best of me. The last thing that crossed my mind was how I had managed to survive all of this. But before I coudl answer myself, I fell alseep in Damien's arms. -FIVE YEARS LATER- Damien and I were still sleeping when Paul came into our room to wake us up. \"Raynee, Damien...Time to get up. We have to rehearse...\" I hear Damien groan as he turns over, taking his arm from around me. The loss of his touch made me whimper and I curled up in the blankets. \"What time is it?\" I mumbled to Paul. \"It's only nine fifteen...The rehearsal starts at ten. You two need to get ready.\" Paul said as he walked out of Damien and I's bedroom. Damien groaned again. He sat up and swung his feet over the bed. \"Raynee he's right...we need to get up.\" I just stayed where I was, unmoving. I heard Damien stand up and walk over towards me. \"If you don't get up yourself, then I'll make you.\" Damien said laughing. I looked up at him and smiled weakly, still extremely tired. \"I'd like to see you try, Damien.\" I said burrying my face back into the satin pillow below me. Damien sighed playfully. \"Alright then...You asked for it!\" Damien lifted me off of the bed and I had no choice but to open my eyes and stare back at Damien. \"Good morning, princess...how did you sleep?\" He said cheerfully, putting me down on my feet. I stumbled a little, still trying to wake up. \"Fine...I would like more of it, though.\" I said, rubbing my eyes. \"Why do we have to do this stupid rehearsal again?\" \"Because we want the wedding ceremony to be perfect...\" Damien said walking over to the closet. \"But you're the Antichrist, aren't you? If you said so, I bet we wouldn't have to do this...\" I said, walking over to the vanity in our room to do my hair. Damien pulled out our clothes and walked back over to me. \"Well, Raynee, I want it to be perfect too. It's our wedding, not just a party or something.\" He said as he handed me my dress. I stared up at Damien, holding my dress. He placed his uniform on the bed and took off his shirt. \"Look, Raynee...Let's just get this over with so we can get the actual thing over with, okay?\" I nodded, beginning to brush my hair. \"Fine.\"[Chapter 2] DAMIEN : OMEN II / THE FINAL CONFLICT The Sergeant's Daughter II: My Boy hears Voices Half an hour later, I was dressed in a simple white dress and standing in the attic of the winter Apartment. We were soon to pack and move into the summer home for a few months, and then back to the academy with my father for school. But for now, the winter apartment was where we stayed. In a way we were stuck here. My father had warned us to stay put for as long as we could, it could be dangerous after a while. In the attic, my father and Paul had cleared out the old furniture and turned it into a Satanic worshiping place for Damien and I. Although, I was still very weary of the whole \"Satanism\" idea. My father understood, of course. As, I was raised a strong Baptist by my mother. I cringed at the memories of her. \"Raynee, you stand here.\" My father said as he lead me over to the right side of the altar by my hand. I now stood in front of a table. On the table were two candles, a dagger, and a small cup. It wasn't much, but at the same time it was elegant. Surely this stuff had a purpose...it wasn't just here for decorations. I looked up to my father questioningly. \"Daddy? What's all this for?\" I said, returning my eyes to the little setup. \"Ceremonial materials.\" He replied as he walked over to Damien. And that's all he said. I have to admit, it was quite frightening. What on earth did a dagger and a cup have to do with a marriage? I completely blocked out the sound of my father talking to Damien, asking him if everything looked okay and if he was pleased. My fingers trailed up the dagger's blade. It wasn't one of the seven daggers, but I'm sure it was valuable. I feared that it would be piercing my skin or Damien's in the next few days. Next I picked up the chalice and looked inside it. No liquid had yet to fill it, but I'm sure it would be filled with something soon. I wanted to ask Damien if he knew...but I kept silent. I sighed, setting down the cup and looking back at Damien. The sight of him made me smile, but that was short lived. I realized that this wasn't going to be the wedding I had dreamed of when I was a little girl. No beautiful floral arrangements to surround Damien and I on the altar, nobody to listen to us exchange vows and to watch us kiss, and worst of all...Damien is alone. Myself, my father, and Paul are all Damien has left. We're not even his real family to make the matter bother me more. I wanted to ask Damien what he thought of it but I kept still and bit my tongue. I looked over my shoulder at Damien, only to see he was walking up to me. He smiled and I took notice of what he was wearing. It wasn't his uniform like I had handed to him this morning...I had gotten ready in my old room instead of with Damien like I usually do. My father had suggested us getting ready in separate rooms on our Wedding day and I liked the idea. Damien was wearing a simple black suit with a blue tie, matching his eyes in color. I smiled at him. \"You're not wearing your uniform...?\" I whispered, leaning into him as he stood next to me. He shook his head. \"Saving it for tomorrow.\" Damien smirked and gave me a once over of my outfit. \"You look nice...\" I blushed. \"Thank you...I could say the same for you.\" Despite us being so close, every time Damien would say something sweet or do anything romantic, I would blush profusely. Just like when I was thirteen. My thoughts of our history ceased when Paul walked up in front of us and stood on the altar. Damien and I both just stared at him awkwardly, unsure what to say or do. Paul smiled down at both of us. \"Good morning you two...How are we today?\" He asked. \"Fine.\" Damien said, smiling faintly. I nodded. \"Fine as well...Just a little tired.\" I said, trying to blink away my fatigue. Damien chuckled. Paul just continued to smile at us. \"Well, we'll try to get this over with as fast as possible. We're just going to go over the ceremony today, alright, Damien?\" Damien nodded, looking at the altar. \"Alright.\" Paul looked down at the altar and picked up the chalice and looked inside of it. \"Now, in a few days, this will be filled with wine. Raynee, you hold this.\" He handed it to me and I looked inside of it. Damien looked over and peered inside of it too. \"Okay,\" Paul began again as he picked up the dagger. I immediately tensed up. Damien noticed and reached over to hold my hand. \"Damien, you'll hold this.\" Damien just hesitated. Paul laughed. \"Don't worry you two, this won't be injuring either of you.\" I sighed, my body relaxing a bit. Damien looked at me and let go of my hand, smiling. He took the dagger out of Paul's hands carefully. I just watched, hoping Damien wouldn't drop it or cut himself with it. \"Now then, next you two will exchange vows after the dagger ceremony. Then we'll do the rings, and that will be the end.\" Damien and I were shocked at how short it seemed. \"That's all?\" I asked as I sat the chalice down on the altar. \"It seems so short...\" Paul nodded. \"Well, it's not meant to be long. It's best to get you two united as quick as possible.\" Damien handed the dagger back to Paul. \"Why exactly?\" Paul just stood there in silence for a few moments, and I began to get worried. Damien was right. Why was it so important that we get married now ? Married at eighteen was certainly taboo. I glanced at Damien and reached over for his hand again, finding comfort in his touch. \"...It may not be safe here later on. You two should have already been married by now, but I knew how you would feel about that, Raynee.\" My father spoke up for Paul, making me whirl around in surprise to face him. \"Oh...Daddy, I completely forgot you were back there.\" I laughed. My father just smiled faintly back at me. Damien turned around to face him too, still clutching my hand tightly. \"But that doesn't really answer my question...Why won't it be safe here later on? We've together been here for four years...\" Damien looked towards me and I nodded. \"And, Daddy, we've been here my whole life. Why does it make a difference where we live?\" My shook his head and looked toward the door. \"I'll explain it to you later...we should go eat breakfast.\"[Chapter 3] DAMIEN: OMEN II / THE FINAL CONFLICT The Sergeant's Daughter II: My Boy Hears Voices I sat down next to Damien as we ate breakfast. I had helped my father make our food, just like always. Ever since Mom left, I had helped my father with almost everything. We ate in silence for the most part. I kept my head down, only acknowledging Damien next to me. He looked at me. \"You sure are quiet. Is everything okay?\" Damien gently put his hand on mine, making me look back at him. I nodded. \"Yeah...everything's fine. I guess I'm just nervous about tomorrow.\" I just stared down at my plate of eggs and toast. I had never really been someone who eats a lot. It would always worry my father when I was little. \"Ray, you shouldn't be nervous.\" My father said before taking a bite of toast. \"I mean, it is important for the both of you, but it will be over fast.\" My father gave me a warm smile. I just looked down at my lap and remained silent. Damien gave me a worried look. He leaned over closer to me and lightly kissed my cheek. \"Please try not to worry about it so much, love.\" I stared at him for a moment. Do I say it now or should I wait? ...No, I need to get this over with. Oh, but what will Daddy say about it?! He'll think I'm insane! Damien raised an eyebrow at me. I just blinked, looking around at the people around me. Paul hadn't said anything about my strange behavior. I took a shuddered breath. \"I...I think I need to tell you all something.\" I said, shifting uncomfortably in my seat. Everyone froze, looking at me. I looked down, avoiding my father's eyes. Damien's hand wrapped around mine again and I relaxed a bit. \"Well, say it then.\" Paul finally spoke. \"It can't be too bad.\" I swallowed hard. Here I go. \"I have decided on something.\" I lifted my head up and locked gazes with Damien. \"I want children.\" My father nearly choked on his drink. Paul laughed jubilantly, smiled at Damien. \"That's great!\" He said. Damien just remained still. He hesitated. \"...Now?\" I smiled, still nervous. My father interrupted us. \"No! You're too young, Raynee. You're only eighteen...It's already bad enough that you two are getting married at such a young age!\" Damien looked at him. My father paused. \"I don't mean like that...You two are just too young.\" My father sighed, looking over to me. \"It's just hard seeing you grow up so fast, Raynee. Prophecy or not, you're still my daughter.\" Damien still had his hand on mine, stoking my skin lovingly. \"Now, Sergeant, I'm sure she doesn't mean now. We have other things to worry about.\" Damien smiled at me and leaned his head into mine. I nuzzled up against him, feeling his familiar warmth. But only now, it gave me no comfort. \"Well, having a child now certainly wouldn't hurt you...\" Paul began. My father looked like he was ready to throw a punch at him. \"The prophecy does state that her and Damien must have a child.\" \"Didn't you just hear me, Paul?\" My father said angrily. \"Prophecy or not she's my daughter!\" I looked at both of them. \"Dad! Of course I didn't mean now! Being married at eighteen is enough as it is!\" I stood up from my chair, letting go of Damien's hand. \"I'm sick of this 'prophecy' dictating my life!\" All three of them were just staring at me. I had never been one to stand up for myself, or even talk like this to my own father. \"The prophecy doesn't dictate your life, Raynee. It's important that you and Damien get these tasks handled as soon as possible!\" Paul began saying. I just gazed at him. \"You both could die and have no one to take over! For god's sake, you both saw what Richard tried to do back when you were just kids. We have the daggers, but anything could happen. Either one of you could be dead any day now!\" I stood there, feeling tears burn my eyes. I suddenly turned around and ran to the stairs and up to Damien and I's room. I heard no one running behind me, so I slammed the door hard as I darted towards the bed. I landed upon it. I buried my face into the pillow on Damien's side. Oh god, it smells like him. I began to sob into the pillow, hoping no one would hear. Especially Damien. About an hour later, I was awoken by the sound of someone entering the room. I immediately sprung up from the bed, rubbing my eyes. \"Who...?\" I began to ask, but trailed off. I must cried myself to sleep, which I hadn't done in awhile. \"It's me, Raynee.\" I heard Damien say as he sat down beside me on our bed. He put his arms around me and I smiled. \"I'm sorry about what happened out there.\" I shook my head as I pulled away from his embrace. \"No, It's my fault I shouldn't have said anything.\" I sighed, wiping the sticky tears off of my cheeks. \"I just thought it-\" \"I'm glad that you mentioned it. I didn't show much emotion...but, I was so happy about that. I wanted to pick you up and swing you around, but I didn't want to worry your father.\" Damien smiled lovingly at me. I couldn't help but smile back. He still looks exactly the same...gorgeous blue eyes, his smooth hair that was the darkest brown and black I had ever seen, and his snow-white skin. I just loved every inch of him and I'm sure he feels the same about me. At least, that's what I hope. \"Raynee, you know I'd never let anything happen to you, right?\" He said, breaking me out of my thoughts like he always does. I nodded, smiling slightly. \"Of course I do.\" \"I know I say it a lot, but I want you to know it. You're pretty much all I have...\" I felt my heart falter at his words. I leaned closer to him and rested my head on his shoulder. \"I know. Believe me, I know how it feels to feel alone...\" Damien sighed and put his hand on my head. I closed my eyes contentedly, feeling safe. At least for now.[Chapter 4] DAMIEN: OMEN II / THE FINAL CONFLICT The Sergeant's Daughter II: My Boy Hears Voices Damien had held me there for a few moments, before finally letting go of me. He looked at me as I lay up against his chest with my eyes closed. I sighed and then opened my eyes slowly. I could feel him breathing slowly and hesitantly. I just lay there, soaking in the peace of the moment. I pulled away from him, smiling, and looked up into his eyes. Damien put his hand on my hair and kissed my forehead. \"I need to do something.\" I said as I stood up from our bed and walked to our bathroom. Damien smirked, making my cheeks turn pink. Something about that damned smirk was so attractive and playful. Every time Damien would use it on me I had to give in; It made my legs shake. \"Like what?\" He said as he layed down on the bed, resting his head on his crossed arms. He smiled up at me and waited for my reply. I rolled my eyes playfully, despite the butterflies in my stomach. \"I'm going to take a bath...\" I leaned up against the door frame and looked back at him. Damien sat up and grinned. \"Why?\" I flipped on the lights and began to close the door. \"Because I need sometime to think about...you know...\" I trailed off, pausing and waiting for Damien to say something. \"The baby?\" My head shot up at his words. \"Actually, yes.\" I looked at him questioningly. \"How did you-?\" \"I can read you like a book, Raynee.\" Damien smiled, walking over to me. I laughed and Damien put his hands on my shoulders. He leaned down for the second time and planted a kiss on my head. I blushed, burying my face into his chest. Damien chuckled. \"May I join you?\" I looked back up at him and nodded. \"Of course...just give me a moment.\" I pulled away from Damien's arms and walked further into the bathroom before shutting the door. Damien's voice ran through my head again. \"I'll be out here waiting!\" He called from the other side of the door. I started to undress, then paused. \"Don't you think you go tell Paul and my father that I'm okay now?\" I said as I took off my dress and slip. \"He's probably worried sick about me.\" I heard him sigh. \"Yeah, I'll go.\" Damien's footsteps followed as he walked out of our bedroom, leaving me to turn on the water. I sat in the warm water in the bathtub, looking up at the ceiling. My knees were pulled up to my chest and my pitch black hair was draping over my back and shoulders. My eyes slipped closed and I relaxed, letting my knees fall and my head slip under the water. Should I be as worried as I am?...Of course I should be, I'm engaged to the damn Antichrist. Oh, who am I kidding. Dad is right. We're too young...just babies ourselves. We haven't lived our lives yet, we've just begun. And there is the threat of someone discovering who we are. Then what? And oh, what if we have our babies by then. What will happen? Will Damien die? Will I die? Will the- I exhaled, causing bubbles to surface in the water. Maybe Damien Thorn isn't the son of the Devil and this is all just a bad dream. I'm in a coma...yeah, that's it. This is all a dream. You're not a vehicle to Satan's will and you are not married to the Antichrist. You're just a normal girl, in love with a normal boy. Everything will be okay when you wake up. You have no birthmark on your hand and there is no Damien Thorn. He's not real. Not real... \"Raynee?\" I sprang up from the water at the muffled sound of my name. \"Yes?\" I rubbed the water out of my eyes and pushed my hair out of my face. My eyes went to my right hand. Six-hundred and sixteen. \"Dammit...\" I said under my breath. I looked back towards the door. \"Who is it?\" \"It's me.\" I immediately recognized Damien's voice. I smiled, sinking back into the water. \"May I come in?\" His voice came through the door again. I closed my eyes and looked towards the door facing the bathub. I pulled up my legs to my chest, covering myself. \"Yeah, go ahead.\" I called back to him. I heard the door click, and then saw Damien standing before me. He smirked at me as he closed the door behind him. I rested my head on my arms which were crossed over the edge of the bathtub. Damien came closer to me and kneeled by my side. His hand reached out and he began to run his fingers through my wet hair. I just laid there, staring into his eyes. His smirk had turned into a gentle smile now and it made me smile back at him. I sat up and scooted closer to Damien, leaning in to kiss him. \"How are you feeling, darling?\" He asked as he pulled away, smiling. I leaned back into the water, looking at my legs. \"Okay, I guess.\" I ran my hands over my stomach and down my legs; Damien wouldn't take his eyes off of me. I looked back up to him and smiled widely. \"Would you like to join me now?\" Damien blushed intensely at my question, despite it being his idea in the first place. He quickly came to his senses and nodded. \"Of course...\" I moved toward the front of the bathtub. I pulled my legs to my chest and made room for Damien, who was now undressing. I kept my eyes down; I was much too shy to look at him. I heard the water shift and felt Damien sit down behind me in the bath. He suddenly wrappped his arms around my stomach, pulling me backwards. I leaned back against Damien, my face buried in his neck and his buried in mine. Damien had seen me like this before. We had undressed and got dressed in front of one another, but nothing else worse than that. He had sat beside me whilst I took baths before also. Damien had never really made any 'advances' on me before and I honestly didn't expect him too. At least he would wait until we were a little older, and I was okay with that. \"So,\" Damien said, holding me tightly against him. \"You want a baby?\" I smiled, looking back at him. \"Yeah.\" I laughed. \"I've always dreamed of having a baby...I think it would be amazing.\" I put my hands on Damien's. He noticed and stroked my finger lovingly with one of his own. He sighed. \"Do you want a boy or a girl?\" Damien leaned foward and looked at me, as if trying to read my mind. \"I actually want twins, Damien. If that's okay with you, I mean...\" I moved up against him, straightening my back. Damien only pulled me back towards him, playfully. \"Of course it's okay, Ray.\" He kissed my neck gently. \"Anything to make you happy.\" I looked back at him worriedly because of his words. \"But, wait, Damien. The prophecy says I have to do anything to make you happy. So, shouldn't we at le-?\" Damien silenced me with a kiss. I was taken back at first, he hadn't done this in awhile. Nevertheless, it made me smile and hold the kiss for a moment. Damien finally pulled back and spun me around to face him. My knees were still pulled up to my chest, making him able to do it with such ease. \"Raynee, please try not to worry about the prophecy. None of it really matters now...perhaps in the future but not right now . All that matters to me is you.\" Damien pulled me into a tight embrace, which was difficult because of the soapy water we were in. I thought for a moment, remembering Paul and my father. I attempted to pull away from Damien to protest even more. \"But, Damien, Paul said it has to be that way! We're not following-!\" \"Shh...\" He replied, holding me tighter. \"Raynee...just go with this. It doesn't matter, and if it did, I would know. They have to obey me, as well as you, but I'm not going to be like that. You're all that I care about right now. I don't care if it's against everything, it won't change how I feel.\" Damien looked away for a moment, towards the door. \"The only thing I care about now is us getting married tomorrow morning...\" He smiled and put his hands on my shoulders. I just sat there, shocked at his words. He really does care...Maybe I was wrong. After we had bathed together, Damien stood up from the water and grabbed a towel. He stood out of the bathtub and held out his hand. \"Come on, princess, it's getting late.\" Damien smiled as I took his hand and wrapped me up in the towel as I stepped out of the water. He then picked me up bridal style again and carried me out to our bed. Damien placed me gently on the bed, and then climbed onto it and lay next to me. He was still pretty wet; it made me laugh. \"Damien, you're going to get the blankets wet.\" I laughed. He only smiled. \"So? It's just water...it'll dry soon enough.\" Damien grinned and put his arm around me, pulling me into laying on his chest. I giggled and felt my cold, wet hair press against my face. Damien brushed it out of the way and looked into my eyes again. I was wrong about this. I'm glad he's real.[Chapter 5] DAMIEN: OMEN II / THE FINAL CONFLICT The Sergeant's Daughter II: My Boy Hears Voices After Damien and I had fully dried off and clothed for bed, we laid on the bed together. His arms were wrapped around me tightly and protectively, just like normal. Damien had fallen asleep awhile ago; I could tell by his breathing. It was somewhat calmer than usual. I sighed and tried to close my eyes. Dad is right, Raynee... I opened my eyes and looked at the ceiling. You're both unsafe. You'll be dead any day now... I groaned quietly and rolled over to my side, Damien's arms still around me. I looked out towards the window by our bed and looked out the window. It was rather dark out, but the moon cast an eerie glow across the fields surrounding our winter apartment. I stood still for a moment, then slowly looked back at Damien. He was sound asleep; he barely moved whilst he did so. I carefully took hold of Damien's arm and softly moved myself out from under him. He didn't seem to notice, much to my surprise. Damien was not a heavy sleeper. I don't blame him; you really couldn't be if you were the Antichrist. I sighed and sat up in the bed, looking down at him. He looked so peaceful. I smiled faintly and pulled the blanket over him and kissed him lightly on his forehead. My lips barely touching his pale skin. I stood from the bed slowly, watching Damien carefully. He stayed perfectly still. I looked towards the window again and began to walk towards it, making as little noise as possible. The fields were illuminated by the rays of light from the moon, giving me a perfect view from our bedroom. I stood still and looked towards the forest that surrounded us. There was a light sprinkle of snow on the ground, which I had just noticed. My eyes widened in surprise. It's the middle of March...there shouldn't be snow... I raised my hands up to the glass and touched it. The glass began to fog up around my hands...it was ice cold. I laughed to myself, keeping my hands on the glass. I leaned forward and rested my head on the glass, closing my eyes. \"Damien, stop!\" My eyes shot open and I stared out the window towards the forest once more. I felt tears well up in my eyes; and they dribbled down my face. \"Damien, please!\" I screamed towards him as Mark cried in pain. Damien stood there, ignoring me, and continued to glare at Mark with hatred. I knew what was happening. I wanted to shut my eyes but I couldn't look away. Through my tears, I looked at Damien. I was horrified: scared he'd kill me too. Yet, I couldn't stop watching. I was somewhat astonished by Damien's powers. I couldn't help but wonder...did I have them too? The snow began to be covered in crimson droplets. Mark was bleeding. Blood poured from his eyes, his mouth, and his nose. I tried so hard to look away; but something seemed to hold me in place. Mark was screaming in pain, the sounds drowned out by his blood. I was hysterical, crying loudly and so hard that I was gagging on my own tears. Damien continued staring at Mark until Mark fell to the ground. He emitted a low gurgling sound, his last breath, I assumed. \"MARK!\" Something snapped in me and I ran over to Mark, kneeling by his side. I scooped his lifeless body in my arms and held him, sobbing violently. Damien remained in front of us and I looked at him through my tears. His eyes seemed to be glowing as he stared down at me. His lips slowly curled into a smile. My eyes widened in fear, and I began to tremble as he walked towards us. \"Raynee...\" Damien began, in a calm voice. \"How much did you see?\" I hesitated for a moment, too scared to speak. I managed to cough out a sentance. \"St-stay back! Don't touch me!\" I held Mark's body tighter, tears dripping onto his head and chest. \"You killed him, Damien! I saw everything!\" Damien's smile twisted into a dark glare again. \"Mark wasn't loyal, Raynee, don't you understand?\" \"He was your cousin, Damien! He loved you...and you loved him...\" I choked back a sob and pressed my forehead to Mark's. \"Even I loved him.\" I could tell that set something off in Damien, like a spark to a fire. I heard him sigh heavily as he walked closer towards me. The snow was crunching loudly under his boots. I looked up at him, gritting my teeth in rage and anquish. \"Murderer...you're a MONSTER!\" I stood up, dropping Mark's carcass and lunging towards Damien. \"I TRUSTED YOU!\" My hands went towards Damien's throat and I took hold. He began to cough and gag and I pushed harder against his throat. Tears were streaming down my face and I squeezed my eyes shut; using all of my strength. I then felt something swipe at my face. Then warmth run down against my cheeks. I pulled back from Damien and put a hand up to my face, and was met with a icy stinging feeling. I looked at my hand and saw blood dripping from it. My eyes went to Damien. His eyes were narrow as he walked towards me as I backed up. I saw the blood underneath his fingernails. I whimpered in fear as Damien began to glare at me, just like he had done to Mark. I shook my head slowly. \"N-no...\" I gasped out, beginning to feel something warm and wet rise in the back of my throat. My eyes widened and I coughed and hurled violently, sending large amounts of blood onto the snow-covered ground. \"Please, d-Damien...God, no...Not now...\" My voice was gurgled and drowned out from the blood and vile I was vomiting up. Damien smiled and came close to me, inches away from my face. His hand reached out and cupped my bloodied chin, forcing me to look at him. My vision was becoming blurry...I could hardly breathe. \"Perhaps you're right, Raynee...I am a monster. I guess you really can't trust me.\" My eyes widened as I felt Damien press his lips agaisnt my blood soaked cheek. My vision failed and everything went black at that moment, sending me backwards into the snow- I snapped out of my somewhat comatose state as I felt my feet give way underneath me. I fell backwards to the hardwood floor with a scream, making Damien jump up from bed. I heard him call my name before he ran towards me; his feet hitting the floor quite loudly. \"Raynee, what happened?! Are you hurt?\" I felt Damien scoop me up into his arms, kneeling beside me. I shook my head slowly as I winced in pain. \"n-No, I'm not hurt...I just...\" I opened my eyes and looked towards the window. I paused for a moment, then looked towards Damien. \"I'm not sure what happened. I just remembered the cold...there was blood...and you said you were a monster. And Mark...\" Tears started pouring down my cheeks, and I couldn't control them. \"Damien, it's so horrible. I keep having these dreams- No, they're flashbacks- and they're horrifying!\" I could tell that Damien knew what I was talking about. He lifted me up higher off the floor and I rested my head on his shoulder, feeling his warmth. I sighed and closed my eyes; I listened to his heartbeat and nearly fell back asleep. Damien sighed, and then broke the silence. \"How long as this been happening?\" I thought for a moment, opening my eyes and looking at him. \"A few days, actually. Sometimes they aren't so bad. I'm surprised I haven't woken you up soon.\" I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes and looked to the clock in our room. \"What's the time?\" Damien looked up and then back to me. \"I can't see from here, let's get up.\" He sighed, hoisting me up into his arms as he stood. I was still in amazement that he could do this. I know that I've grown over the years...it must be difficult for him. Damien placed me down onto the floor; I stumbled a bit as I regained my balance. I held onto Damien's arm for support. We both looked towards the clock. 3:54 \"Damn, it's early...\" I whispered as I looked up to Damien. \"We really should try and go to sleep.\" He didn't respond at first, hesitating to answer. Damien smiled and looked down at me, making me blush. He then grabbed my ahnd and began to pull me out of the room and towards the staircase. \"I have a better idea, Ray. I have something to show you.\" I sat on the large, velveteen sofa in our living room with Damien. He was looking over at the bookshelf, digging through a box at the foot of it. I just watched curiously. To make matters worse, it was fairly dark in the room we were in. Damien had lighten the fireplace, but it only gave the room an eerie orange glow. I stared at the fire. \"I've always belonged to him...'' The familiar voice of Ann Thorn echoed in my head and I quickly looked away from the fireplace, squeezing my eyes shut. I tried my hardest to hold back a whine of fear. Damien quickly snapped me out of my trances again, walking over to me and kneeling by the couch. \"I found it...\" He said proudly. Damien, in his hands, held a small box. It was pale blue with a white bow tied to it, and it was very elegant for it's tiny stature. I stared at it, then looked at Damien. \"What is it?\" I asked. My hand reached out and I felt the soft, satin ribbon on the box. Damien smiled. \"It's yours.\" Damien handed me the box, sitting in it my lap. He then sat beside me on the couch. I just looked at the box curiously. \"Damien, you don't have to. I didn't know...I would've gotten you something too.\" Sadness then washed over me as I looked at him, but he just continued to smile. \"Raynee, you have no need to get me anything. You're enough and all I'll ever want.\" I couldn't help but smile at that. I felt my eyes begin to tear up and I placed my hand on his cheek. ''Thank you, Damien. It means a lot.'' He scooted the box closer to me, and my stomach. ''Go on then, love. Open it!\" I laughed and untied the bow, then pulled the lid of the box off. Inside was black tissue paper and a card. On it was inscribed, 'To my beautiful wife. I love you forever. Infinite love to you, my sweet rose. -Damien' I blushed and began to laugh, looking at Damien through tears of mirth and happiness. I moved back the tissue paper and inside of the box was another, even smaller box. I gave Damien a confused look as I wiped the tears from my eyes. \"What is it?\" I said, picking it up. Damien chuckled. \"Open it.\" He replied, watching me as I did just that. The little ornate box began to play a song. It was a music box! Damien had given me a music box! I looked around the outside of the cylindrical music box, noticing the details. It was covered in golden lilies and roses and accented with pearls. Each flower had three crystals in the center of them. And around the rim of the top, inscribed in silver was a phrase. I could hardly read it though, and Damien noticed my interest in it. ''Per vitam, mortem et in aeternum, te amorem...\" Damien said; he leaned closer to me. \"It means, 'I love you eternally throughout life and death'.\" I smiled. \"It's beautiful, Damien. Thank you..'' I wrapped my arms around him, and he did the same. ''But wait, you didn't look inside of it.'' He said as I pulled back. I looked back into the music box, which had stopped playing the delicate tune. Inside was another piece of black tissue paper wrapped around an object. I picked it up out of the music box and then sat the box down in my lap. I slowly and carefully began to unwrap the little trinket in my hands. Then I saw it. My eyes widened. \"It's a ring...?\"[Chapter 6] DAMIEN: OMEN II / THE FINAL CONFLICT The Sergeant's Daughter II: My Boy Hears Voices Damien grinned as I held the ring in my hands. I was speechless- love struck, actually. It as gorgeous and looked very expensive. \"Damien, I- I don't know what to say...\" I said as he held it closer to me, looking at it's details. The ring was polished silver, and was at first glance very plain, but the gems on it were very ornate. In the center was a heart shaped diamond surrounded by littler diamond clusters. Damien chuckled. \"Do you like it? He said as he rested his head on my shoulder. ''I wanted to give this all to you tomorrow, but I just couldn't wait. Plus, I figured it would cheer you up after what happened.\" Damien kissed my cheek and I giggled. \"I love it, Damien. It's beautiful.\" I said; kissing him back. He took hold of my hand and the ring. Damien then slipped it on my finger, smiling as he did. \"There...It's perfect. I was actually worried that it wasn't goign to fit you.\" I laughed, looking at the ring. I stared at it for quite a while, taking in it's beauty. I was in complete awe. No one had ever bought me anything remotely special before! Well, I had recieved a few things on my sixteenth birthday thanks to my father and Damien. But now, those items were nothing compared to the ring resting on my finger. \"Hey, Raynee,\" Damien said, breaking the silence and making me look up at him. \"It really is getting late. We should try to go back to sleep, we've got a big day tomorrow.\" He smiled and offered me his hand. I remained seated, looking at my feet. \"Actually, Damien, I was hoping we could stay down here for a bit.\" I held my music box tightly to me, a sign that I was quite nervous. I usually never go against what Damien says. I rarely even disagree with him. But, I knew he would give in to me either way. \"But, love, Paul is is probably going to wa-\" \" Please, Damien?\" I cut him off, looking at him pleadingly. \"I'm too scared to go back to sleep after what happened! Plus, it's nice down here. Can't we please just stay down here at least until five?\" Damien sighed, looking to the clock, which read four thirty-six. He then looked back to me, smiling. \"How could I say no to that face?\" He chuckled again, sitting back down next to me. I just smiled and looked at him sweetly. He returned the gaze, raising an eyebrow at me questioningly. \"And what do you need now, Miss Neff...or should I say, Miss Thorn?\" He smirked, causing me to blush an intense rose color. I giggled, feigning my innocence. \"Will you make me some tea, please?\" I asked softly, trying to woo him into agreeing. It always worked, and vice-versa. He kissed my cheek and pulled me close to him. \"Of course I will, princess.\" He stood up and walked to the kitchen. I remained on the couch, looking back towards him until he disappeared into the darkness of the hallway leading to our kitchen. I grabbed a blanket off the back of the sofa and watched the fire crackle away, waiting for Damien to return with our tea. Around ten minutes later, Damien returned holding two fairly large mugs. He sat down on the couch closer to me than the last time and handed me one mug. \"Careful, it's kind of hot still.\" He said, taking a sip out of his. I smiled, feeling the warmth on my fingers. I decided to take a drink, despite Damien's warning. The tea was sweet and strong, just how Damien always made it. His tea was always perfect. Although, he always had to add more sugar into my cup than in his. Damien hardly ever ate sweet stuff. At least, I had never seen him eat any. I knew he enjoyed a good cake once in a while though. I smiled, and looked towards him. \"The tea is wonderful, love.\" He smiled back, taking another drink. \"Thanks. I know how much you love your sweet tea. It's only appropriate that a girl like you would enjoy sweets and sugar so much.\" I smiled widely and shook my head. \"Damien, you never quit...\" He laughed at my words. \"Of course not!\" He replied, putting an arm around me. \"Why would I with a wife like you?\" My face turned pink at the thought of that happening tomorrow. I sighed.\"Don't get ahead of yourself, Damien. We aren't married quite yet..\" He sighed too, still holding me close as I continued to drink my tea. \"Unfortunately.\" He added. \"You really have no idea how long I've waited for this day to finally come. I knew that from the moment I saw you, that you were special- different, actually. There was something about you that just stood out. \" I beamed, leaning closer to him. \"How do you think I feel, Damien? I never thought I'd end up with you. A creepy girl like me and a beautiful guy like you? It's only in fairy tales.\" Damien's smile faded and he looked at me as he sat down his mug on the coffee table. \"No,\" He said, turning towards me. He took my hand in both of his and looked at me insistently. \"Don't you dare call yourself 'creepy'. You're perfect, I don't want anyone else but you.\" I rasied an eyebrow at him. \"But, I'm so weird. I wish I was normal...\" I looked away from him and down into my mug, gazing at the sugary liquid. \"Blonde hair and blue eyes would be a blessing.\" Damien then cupped my chin in his hands and turned my head towards his. \"You're beautiful, Raynee. In every meaning of the word. I don't want a girl with blonde hair and blue eyes. It's too common in girls today. You're unique. And I couldn't wish for anything more.\" He planted a gentle kiss on my lips and smiled. \"I love you, Raynee Neff. You mean everything to me.\" I was really speechless now. My eyes were wide with surprise and starting to fill with tears. All I could do was nod and force a smile. Damien's grin subsided, and he continued to look at me. \"I can tell you're about to cry.\" I shook my head and attempted to speak. \"I'm not-!\" My voice quivered and cracked. I looked at Damien and he just smiled, laughing. I quickly sat down my mug, nearly spilling it, and collapsed in Damien's arms. I sobbed uncontrollably, feeling both relief and fear. \"Oh, Damien,\" I coughed out as I grabbed onto him. \"It just doesn't make sense...\" Damien placed his hand on my back and rubbed it soothingly. \"What doesn't make sense?\" He asked, leaning closer to me, protecting me. I inhaled sharply and tried to hold back my sobs. \"How someone like you could fall in love with a freak like me!\" I felt Damien shake his head, holding me tighter. \"Shh..Raynee, no. Don't call yourself that...you know it's not true.\" He said comfortingly. \"No more crying, please? I don't think I can handle you going through all this in one night. Especially, the eve of our wedding day.\" I nodded and sniffed back my tears, pulling myself up to look at him in the eyes. He smiled lovingly and wiped away my tears. I blinked, feeling my eyes sting. \"I-I'm sorry...\" I whispered, feeling guilt strike me in my guts. Damien shook his head again, but still smiled. \"No, you don't have to be sorry for anything.\" He carefully placed his hands around me and pulled me to him, sighing. \"Look, how about we take our tea upstairs and try to get some rest? You'll be safe and sound as long as I'm with you. How does that sound?\" I glanced at the clock, which now read five-fifteen. I thought for a moment, then nodded. \"That sounds nice.\" I forced a smile yet again and Damien nodded. \"Alright. I'll get your music box for you, just get your tea...\" He said as he stood and walked to the fireplace, putting it out. It left us in complete darkness, except for the light of the moon. I grabbed my mug and Damien held his hand out towards me after he had gathered my things. We began to walk upstairs as I looked over my shoulder to the window. I stared out into the darkened forest and caught a glimpse of a small raven perched in a tree nearby, illuminated by the eerie moonlight from above.[Chapter 7] DAMIEN: OMEN II / THE FINAL CONFLICT The Sergeant's Daughter II: My Boy Hears Voices \"Raynee...Raynee...\" I felt a warm hand on my shoulder, gently shaking me awake. I groaned; then I slowly opened my eyes. My vision was blurry with sleepy tears and I reached up to wipe them away. I then sat up in bed, yawning. \"Yes?\" I said weakly. My voice was cracked from my crying outburst last night. After Damien and I had come back upstairs, it took my a few minutes to finally get settled down. It took me even longer to fall asleep; Damien had to lull me to sleep by talking to me and saying soothing things to me. Needless to say, it worked. Damien was somewhat used to me not being able to sleep most of the time. He knew that it was due to my night-terrors that I would occasionally have. My vision focused after a few moments and I saw Damien standing beside my bed, his hand on my shoulder. He smiled when he saw that I was awake. \"Well, good morning, Princess...How did you sleep?\" Damien asked, sitting beside me on my bed. He was still in his nightclothes and his hair was messy. I smiled back at him. \"Fine, thanks to you. I didn't have anymore nightmares- Actually,\" I paused, thinking. My eyes widened as I looked at Damien still. \"I didn't have any dreams, come to think of it.\" I grinned; and Damien smiled back. \"Hey, that's great!\" Damien said as he took my hand and lead me out of bed. \"Paul and your father want to see us downstairs. They said they needed to talk to us.\" Damien pulled me along out of the bedroom quickly, nearly making me trip over my nightgown. My feet seemed to have a weird habit of getting caught in things. I was thankful Damien was there to catch me most of the time. We both walked downstairs and into the living room. I looked to the windows; my eyes were shocked with the sight I was met with. I stopped dead in my tracks, making Damien do the same. \"What's the matter?\" I heard him say immediately. My mind sort of just went numb with shock and awe as I stared out to the window. Damien paused; seeing what I was looking at. \"It's snowing...\" He breathed as he let go of my hand and walked closer to the window pane. I followed behind him closely. \"I saw it before I fell last night. But, I thought I was dreaming...\" I said as I came up behind him. I stared outside the window with him, looking out at the blanket of snow surrounding us. For a split moment, I envisioned us standing out there together. Just like when we were kids. Damien pressed his hands up against the glass slowly and then he pulled them back. I scoffed playfully; making him look back at me. \"What were you expecting, Damien? For it to be warm?\" I smirked, and he smiled back as he shook his head; then walked over to me. \"No, I just think it's a bit odd that it's snowing and it's the middle of March.\" Damien mumbled; He took my hand in his and smiled faintly. \"Come along, love. Let's see what your father wants to tell us.\" I nodded, smiling. \"Alright.\" We held hands tightly and walked towards our dining room. I held onto Damien's hand a bit harder than I usually did. I was surprisingly nervous. My mind was racing more than it ever was. I was worried how my father was going to feel about this today. I knew he wanted the best for me and Damien, but we were still so young. Now that I think about it, my father has always been loyal to Damien. I remember when my mother wanted to enroll me in a Catholic school for girls; my father was immediately against it. Now I knew why! Even if Damien and I didn't know each other, we had always been loyal to him. When we walked into the dining room, we were met with my father and Paul sitting at the table waiting for us. Paul smiled as he stood up, walking towards us. \"There's the bride and groom to-be!\" He laughed; making me smile. Damien chuckled and held my hand child. \"Good morning, Paul.\" Damien said, smiling widely. I looked over to my father; and he slowly got up, coming towards us. I stayed silent, looking up at him. He smiled faintly. \"Hello, Raynee. Hello, Damien.\" I nodded, smiling back. I had a feeling he was thinking about yesterday. My sudden outburst about wanting a baby, the crying, Damien rushing after me. It usually went. \"Good morning, Daddy.\" I forced a smile and tried not to succumb to the awkwardness of this situation. I didn't really know what to say, honestly. Nothing could really release the tension. But, then again, this 'family' was used to it. I had had emotional outbreaks before countless times. Damien was used to it, Paul was, and so was my Father. Dad always knew I was sensitive and prone to overreacting. Before anything else could be said, Damien and I noticed the food on our dining room table. Our plates had been made already and were covered in massive amounts of food. It smelled amazing. Paul took notice of my staring. \"Looks good, huh?\" He said. Paul walked back over to his spot where he usually sat. \"We wanted to wait for you two to wake up before we started eating. And, you woke up just in time; it's still fresh.\" Damien looked down at me and smirked. \"We should eat now. I think it would be best to have full stomach during the ceremony, don't you think?\" He said as he lead me over to my seat at the table. I sat down and looked at my full plate in front of me. Blueberry pancakes, two fairly large pieces of toast with strawberry jam, and scrambled eggs with the same. I could never eat eggs without jam; my mother used to put grape and strawberry on them when I was little. They tasted bland and disgusting without a little sweetness. I looked over at Damien, seeing him sit next me. His plate had two pieces of toast, a few pieces of bacon, and plain pancakes. I knew he probably wouldn't eat all of his pancakes. He never did, so I knew I'd get some of them. Again, just like yesterday, we sat in silence for the most part as we ate. I sat there quietly and took a bite of my eggs, glancing at Damien. He sensed that it was getting a bit awkward again and broke the silence. \"So...\" He began before taking a sip of his orange juice. \"How exactly is this ceremony supposed to work?\" Paul smiled and put his fork down; he looked at me and Damien. \"Well, after we eat, you both need to get ready. We're going to follow the traditional route and have you two get ready an separate rooms. That way, you won't see each other until the ceremony.\" I opened my mouth, about to say something. \"No.\" Damien suddenly spoke with force, but at the same time, politeness. I looked at him and smiled as he spoke again. \"I want to at least help her get her dress on.\" My eyes went back to Paul and my father and I nodded. \"Yeah. I need help with my bows and lacing on my dress.\" My smile remained on my lips as I felt Damien's hand on mine. Paul nodded and smiled back. \"Alright then. It's your special day...both of your's. But right now, let's focus on eating.\" Damien and I unlocked hands and I picked up my fork, begining to eat my pancakes. My hands were shaking a bit and I tried to conceal it. What's wrong with me today? After we had finished our breakfast and discussed the ceremony a bit more, Damien and I walked up to my old bedroom to get myself ready. The room was exactly like it was when we were kids. The same palest pink sheets were on my bed, which was still painted gold. If you looked closely at the sheets on the bed, near where I used to sleep, blood stains were near my pillow. I remembered comming in here whilst my stab wound was still bleeding. Of course, this was before I started sleeping with Damien every single night. Damien walked over to my closet and opened it, looking for the dress I planned on wearing today. The clothes I kept in my closet were just the ones I didn't wear. Formal dresses andAfter five years, it still fit, much to my family's surprise. Damien smiled as he picked it up; he found it at the bottom of my closet where it had been laid after I had worn it the last time. The night I was stabbed... I shook my head in an attempt to get those damned thoughts out of my head. It was my wedding day for God's sake. Damien walked to me and looked down at the dress in his hands. \"I haven't seen you in this since the Academy's ball in seventy-eight...\" He laughed. I smiled, reaching out to the dress. \"It's still beautiful. Didn't Ann help you sew a part of this?\" I cringed involuntarily at Damien's words. \"Yes.\" I said as I slipped my nightgown over my head. I threw it to the ground and looked up at Damien, he smiled. I was still wearing a bra; a habit to leave it on whilst I slept. Damien held the dress out to me. I took it from his hands slowly, grabbing it by the straps and letting the skirt fall to the floor. It looked the same as it did five years ago. Solid black satin bodice with lace sleeves, ruffled chiffon skirt, and a bow towards the side with three blue roses in the center. Damien chucked. \"You were the only girl in the entire cotillion wearing black. Everyone was looking at you in shock and awe...I felt so lucky to be the one escorting you around.\" Damien walked towards the dress that was held in between us. \"May I do the honors?\" He smiled widely as I nodded. Damien unzipped the dress and held the skirt open, then I stepped into the dress. Damien pulled it up and I slipped my arms through the fragile, lace sleeves. He began to zip up the back, but paused. I looked back at him worriedly. \"Is it broke-?\" \"Your scar.\" Damien cut me off quickly, looking directly at my shoulder. Oh, no! I had completely forgotten about that damned scar! Of all places, why my shoulder?! I laughed nervously, trying to get him off of the delicate subject on our lips. \"Damien, it's okay. I'm sure my father won't notice. We need to focus on the ceremony anyways.\" He sighed. \"I should've protected you. I should have gone down there with you!\" My heart dropped. \"Damien, are you insane?! Richard would've killed you! I mean, Ann probably wouldn't have let that happen, but she would've killed me next. Better me than you...\" I turned to face him, holding the dress against me. \"That's all that matters in this prophecy. Better me than you. It doesn't matter what happens to me as long as it's not you!\" \"Don't you dare say that, Raynee! You know that I care about you!\" I said nothing in reply and turned around. Damien zipped the rest of the zipper up and began to tie the ribbon around my waist. \"Damien, I hope you realize that sometimes you can't protect me. It'll put you in harms way.\" I said, sighing loudly. Damien shook his head. \"It's not fair that you have to be the one to get hurt though. What's going to happen when you eventually do get pregnant?\" He spun me back around to face him once he had tied a large bow around my waist. And I thought for a moment, not able to come up with anything in response. He smiled. \"Exactly.\" I rolled my eyes and walked over to the vanity near my old bed. \"It doesn't matter right now, Damien. We have to get ready.\" I sat down, looking at myself in the mirror. The same face stared back at me as always. Creepy. Fat. Disgusting. Sinner. I pushed the thoughts aside; beginning to brush my hair. Damien came up beside me and put his hand on my shoulder. I relaxed a bit, feeling his warm touch. \"I'm sorry, Raynee.\" Damien breathed as he leaned down to kiss me softly. I smiled a bit, feeling him wrap his arms around me. \"All I want to do is protect you. You know that, right, love?\" I nodded. \"Of course I do, Damien. I've known that since day one.\" He smiled, rising up from the hug and taking a strand of my hair within his fingers. \"Do you plan on doing anything with your hair?\" Damien laughed. I shook my head. \"No. It never cooperates with me.\" I attempted to get it to pull back into a crude ponytail, but it fell apart quickly. Damien chuckled. \"Why not braid it?\" Damien sat down next to me on the wide stood in front of my vanity and began to fidget with my hair. \"I have an idea. Get me some hairpins.\" I pulled open one of the many drawers on my dresser and procured some old bobby-pins. I handed them to Damien and he bagan to work on my hair as a waited patiently. About forty-five minutes later, I was completely ready. Damien had run off to get ready as well; slipping into his old Davidson Military Academy uniform. We had found an old, black piece of tulle in Ann's closet. She had loved to sew and I had helped her a few times whilst she did. Damien clipped it to the back of my now up-did hair, and I really did look like a bride now. I wasn't sure if I would have a bouquet or not. My father had said he had that covered, so I assumed he had bought me one with Damien's help. I looked at myself one final time before walking out of my room. My hair was pulled out of my face for once, I remembered. It was braided into one piece and wrapped around towards the back of my head, where it was pinned in place. My veil hung beneath it and went down to the hem of my dress. For once in my life, I felt beautiful. \"Raynee!\" I heard Paul call my name from downstairs. \"We're ready to start!\" I sighed, trying to blink away my tears of anxiety. I knew that from this moment onward my fate was sealed. There was no going back now. From now on, I belonged to Damien Thorn. \"I'm comming!\"[Chapter 8] DAMIEN: OMEN II / THE FINAL CONFLICT The Sergeant's Daughter II: My Boy Hears Voices I walked downstairs and was met by my father and Paul. Paul instructed me to wait in the attic as we had planned, and my father just remained silent, looking at me worriedly. I knew exactly why and tried not to think about it much. Damien, who came out a few minutes after me, walked up with me to the dark attic silently. No one really knew what to say. My hands were shaking as Damien stood next to me, waiting for my father and Paul to arrive. We were standing together in the attic, where the ceremony would eventually take place. Paul and my Father would both preform the ritual to make it a bit easier and quicker. Needless to say, I was ready to get it over with. Damien leaned over to me slowly, making me jump in surprise. \"Are you nervous?\" He whispered as we continued to wait. I nodded; My mouth was kept shut as I looked at the altar in front of us. Damien sighed. \"Raynee, it's alright. Soon, this will be over with...It will only take a few minutes.\" He smiled faintly, staying close to me. He reached over and grabbed my hand gently, holding it comfortingly. He chuckled lightly. \"Your father and I bought you a bouquet.\" My eyes went to him. \"You did?\" I finally spoke, shocked that I had predicted that same thing. \"What flowers is it made of? Roses, I'm guessing.\" Damien smirked. \"You'll just have to wait and see, love.\" He grinned at me, turning back to the altar. We waited a few more minutes; occasionally talking to each other quietly like two schoolkids during a silent test. It was agonizing to say the least. The tension was immense and my mind was racing. Try to get your mind off of it... I looked at Damien for a moment. I smiled, seeing his uniform again. \"I haven't seen you in that for a while...\" I giggled, stepping closer to him a bit. Damien looked down at me lovingly. \"You always did love this uniform...\" He smirked, kissing my cheek sweetly. I blushed as he pulled away, keeping my eyes on the altar in front of us. Damien did the same, stepping closer to it. \"What is all this stuff?\" He asked, running his hands over the dagger on the table. On the altar, twelve black candles stood carefully around a single red one. They were unlit and it did;t aid the fact that Damien and I were standing in near darkness. Next to the ring of candles stood a bell, and next to that stood the dagger. The chalice from yesterday stood there too. Damien looked into it and grimaced. \"It's red wine, I think.\" I made a disgusted face and cringed. \"Ech... Gross .\" I said as I stepped up to him near the altar with Damien. I took notice of a small length of black ribbon on the opposite side of the table. \"Woah, Damien, look at this!\" Damien looked over at the ribbon and grinned, picking it up and looking at it. \"What do you think it's for?\" I asked, watching him inspect it between his fingers. \"Well, if they plan to use our blood in the ceremony, they can use this as a tourniquet...\" Damien smiled, seeing my horrified reaction. He laughed. \"Just kidding, princess.\" I sighed, shaking my head. \"That's not funny, Damien.\" He smiled comfortingly, wrapping an arm around me gently. \"Sorry, darling.\" Then, we heard the attic's doors click open as Paul and my father walked in. Damien and I immediately pulled away from each other. Paul smiled at us and laughed, seeing our surprised faces as we turned around. He chuckled, making my father shoot him a harsh glare. \"Enjoying your little moment of alone time, you two?\" Paul asked as he walked behind the altar. My father walked towards us and stayed near the altar's side. \"Don't give them any ideas, Paul...\" He warned, looking at me. Damien smiled, adding in his two cents. \"Sergeant, I can fully assure you that there were no ideas to begin with.\" I laughed at Damien's words despite myself. \"Dad, don't worry. You can trust Damien.\" I said, looking sincerely at my father. \"You know how much he respects me.\" My father nodded, smiling a bit a Damien as Paul was fidgeting with the setup on the Altar. Damien and I watched silently. We were unsure what to do, honestly. Paul struck a match and began lighting the candles one by one, slowly illuminating the room. I smiled. \"Hey, now we can see a bit more.\" I laughed. Paul smiled and nodded, lighting the red candle lastly. \"Light always helps, doesn't it?\" He said as she extinguished the match, tossing it down. \"Alright, now here's how this is going to work. Just follow my instructions and this should all be pretty quick. Got it?\" Damien and I both nodded. My heart was beating quickly as I became more and more nervous with each passing minute. I knew this was supposed to be a happy. wonderful time for Damien and I. But, in reality, I was just scared. I wasn't just being married to the person I love. Oh no, I was being married to the Antichrist. \"What exactly do we have to do?\" Damien asked, watching as Paul held the bell. \"Don't worry. I'll walk you two through the ceremony as we move along.\" The room went silent. Damien and I glanced at each other nervously, Damien seeing the tense look in my eyes. He reached for my hand gently and held it, running his fingers over my skin in an attempt to comfort me. We waited. Paul rang the bell three times, slowly. Then, spoke loudly, echoing in the darkness. \"In Nomine Dei Nostri Satanas Luciferi Excelsi! In the name of Satan, I call upon the forces of Darkness and the infernal power within! Consecrate this place with the power, love and light of Lucifer.\" He then pointed to us, picking up the red candle and closing his eyes as he called to our God. \"Join with us, we say in the binding of these two who shall be as one. They desire to make their union a matter of record, so that their friends and the society in which they live may bear witness and lend support.\" I glanced over to my father quietly. His eyes were closed and his head was lowered as if in prayer. Damien was doing the same, much to my surprise. I just stood there; my hands were shaking like crazy as I attempted to stay still. \"We are Lucifer! Consciousness flows, one to the other, so this couple may share a mutual wisdom and unified vision. Paul continued as we stood before him silently. I finally gave in and lowered my head like my father and Damien. I knew they'd want me to do it. \"Satan, Your strength and constancy shall keep them together as long as they both shall live. We are Leviathan! Grant Raynee and Damien the qualities of serenity and patience and a love as deep as the ocean!\" He opened his eyes, and so did my father and Damien. I lifted my head slowly as I saw Paul pick up the length of black ribbon from the altar. \"Bride and groom, up until this moment you have been separate in thought, word and action. As this cord binds together your hands, so do your lives become joined...Give me your hands.\" Damien lifted his left hand, I lifted my right. Paul then wrapped the black ribbon around our hands and tied it tightly. I cringed a bit, feeling the ribbon rub against my skin roughly. Damien noticed and wrapped his fingers around mine as best as he could. He smiled at me and nodded reassuringly, telling me this would all be okay. I smiled back through the tears forming in my eyes. \"Raynee, you bring the energy of Babylon ...\" My eyes widened. Babylon? Where had I heard that name before...? \"I have always belonged to him!\" My heart dropped a bit, remembering that Ann was the Whore of Babylon. I thought for a moment, wanting to intervene, but I decided against it and kept silent. \"Raynee, you are boundless, dark, intuitive, and soft. I bid you blend these energies with Damien to make your lives together whole. Take this cup as a symbol of your love.\" Paul smiled, placing the silver chalice filled with wine into my free hand. He then turned to Damien. \"Damien, you bring the energy of Satan; expansive, bright, logical and hard. I bid you blend these energies with Raynee to make your lives together whole.\" Paul carefully picked the dagger up off of the table and handed it to Damien. I watched nervously, biting my tongue. \"Wield this blade as a symbol of your love.\" Damien and I glanced at each other awkwardly as Paul looked to my father. \"Do you have the vows?\" He asked, looking to my father, who was digging around in his pockets. Damien and I looked towards him; our mouths still clamped shut. My dad walked over to the altar and handed Paul the pieces of paper. He then handed them to us. \"Damien, you go first.\" Damien nodded silently as he took a deep breath. \"Raynee, I pledge my blade, as I pledge my soul, ever to your service.\" He smiled, lifting the blade to me formally. I smiled back as I felt my heart quicken, making my legs go weak. \"Like this blade my love for you will be strong and enduring, so that our lives together will always be protected. Accept it, my beloved, and with it all that is mine becomes yours. Even if our paths should later diverge, yet I will always be your true friend, to love you and lend you aid and protection. By seed and root, by bud and stem, by leaf and flower and fruit, by life and love, in the name of Satan, I, Damien Thorn, take you, Raynee Neff, to my hand, my heart, and my spirit.\" Paul smiled, nodding. \"Alright. Now it's your turn Raynee.\" What are you doing? I looked down at the piece of paper in my shaking hands and sighed nervously, feeling my heart thumping around in my chest. \"Damien, I pledge this chalice, as I pledge my soul, ever to your service.\" I paused, hearing those words leave my mouth. I looked up to Damien and he smiled. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! I closed my eyes, squeezing them shut in an attempt to be somewhere else. Goddammit, wasn't this supposed to be a joyful day and not one of fear? I lifted the cup full of wine into the air like Damien had done with the knife and continued. \"A-as from this cup, my love for you will pour forth so that our lives together will be nourished. Accept it, my beloved, and with it all that is mine also becomes yours. Even if our paths should later diverge, yet I will always be your true friend, to love you and lend you aid and protection. By seed and root, by bud and stem, by leaf and flower and fruit, by life and love, in the name of Babylon, I, Raynee Neff, take you, Damien Thorn, to my hand, my heart, and my spirit.\" Damien then dipped the blade of the dagger into the wine, holding it there for a few moments. \"Babylon and Satan, female and male, dark and light... neither has meaning without the other, but through their eternal interplay the universe is born.\" Paul said, taking the chalice and daggers from us and setting them onto the table again. \"This bond I draw between you; when you are parted in mind or body, there will be a call in the core of you, one to the other, to which nothing and no one else will answer. By the secrets of the earth and water is this bond woven, unbreakable, irrevocable. By the law that created fire and wind is this bond written in your souls.\" He motioned for us to give him our hands, the ones that were bound together by ribbon. We lifted our intertwined hands and Paul untied the ribbon, letting it fall to the altar. He then looked to our hands, seeing we had already put on our rings. He smiled, placing his hand over the rings. \"Your vows have been made before your friends, the forces of Darkness and all the Gods of the Pit. These rings, like your vows, are without beginning or end. They are the physical representation of your promises to each other's spirits.\" Paul removed his hand from ours and closed his eyes once more. \"Above you are the stars, below you are the stones. As time passes, remember - like a star should your love be constant, like the earth should your love be firm. Have no fear and let not the ways or words of the unenlightened give you unease, for Satan is with you, now and always.\" He opened his eyes again and smiled to Damien and I. \"I now pronounce you husband and wife. The work of joy is done and yet begun...Damien, you may kiss your bride now.\" Damien turned to me and smiled, reaching for my hands and gripping them tightly. He leaned forwards and pressed his lips against mine briefly. I closed my eyes and melted into the kiss, just wanting to be alone with him to talk and have him comfort me. He pulled away though, and we were back to reality. I sighed. My father stepped closer to the altar, next to Paul and smiled at us. \"Hail Damien!\" They shouted, causing me to jump back a bit. \"Hail Raynee!\" You're doomed. \"Hail Satan!\" The room was silent for a few moments as Damien and I continued to hold each others hands. I looked around nervously as Paul and My father started to extinguish the candles and clean the altar up. \"...Is it over?\" I piped up nervously. Paul nodded, smiling. \"Yes, But Damien has a surprise for you.\" He replied as he put the candles away. I looked at Damien nervously. He chuckled, letting go of my hand and walking over to behind the altar. \"Remember how I said I was going to get you a bouquet?\" He asked, reaching for something that I couldn't see. I nodded, staying quiet. Damien then pulled out a bouquet of brightly coloured, yellow, pink and orange flowers. My father and Paul smiled, seeing Damien's hopeful and loving face. \"I know how much you love these little flowers when they bloom in Spring. It was rather hard to get them in this time of year, but I went an extra mile for you, darling.\" Damien laughed, holding the flowers out to me. I just stood there, staring at the flowers in his hands. Something about them seemed familiar somehow. I thought for a moment, wondering where I had seen these before. They're chrysanthemums. Then, it clicked. Mark's funeral. They're the same flowers that were on Mark's casket. Something in me snapped and I screamed, jumping backwards in shock. I was so horrified; how could they have forgotten? How could Damien not remember? Just...how? I felt my feet suddenly and harshly slip out from under me, sending me backwards tot he floor. I had forgotten about my long, thin veil. Before Damien could run over to catch me, my head hit the wooden floor below me and everything went black.[Chapter 9] DAMIEN : OMEN II The Sergeant's Daughter II : My Boy hears Voice s I awoke to the sound of running water and voices. I couldn't tell what was being said; it was hard to think of anything besides the dull pain in my head. As I felt a cold sensation on my forehead, I opened my eyes slowly. Damien was sitting over me and holding a cold washcloth to my head gently, dabbing it over my skin now and then. We were back in Ann and Richard's old bedroom that was now ours; the light from the sunset peeking though the lace curtains near our bed. I wasn't in that damned black dress that had once belonged to my mother. Damien had undressed me and put me into one of my nightdresses. I groaned, feeling the pain in my head throb harshly. Damien smiled when I when I looked up at him with confusion. I tried to find my voice as I struggled to sit up in bed. \"Woah, Woah,\" Damien said, putting his hands carefully on my shoulders as I tried to sit up. He placed the damp cloth on the bedside table before guiding me back to the pillow. \"Don't try to move too much, Ray. You may hurt yourself.\" \"D-Damien...?\" I choked out, my voice weak and cracking. \"What time is it?\" He paused, looking over to the grandfather clock that sat in our room. The clock had belonged to Richard, and Damien could never bring himself to get rid of it. It was a beautiful clock, really. The exterior was a beautiful mahogany colour, and on the inside, there was a celestial pattern on the numerical circle that turned according to the time of day. The clock itself contrasted with the colours of our room, which we had redone after Ann and Richard were out of the picture. But somehow, the dark brown of the clock and the blues and whites of the room mixed together. Damien was certainly pleased with the outcome. 6:48 is what the same clock read. To my surprise, it was still rather early in the evening. \"Oh, god,\" I said, rubbing my forehead with disdain. \"How long was I asleep?\" Damien shook his head as he turned back to me. \"You weren't asleep. You were passed out cold.\" He chuckled lightly and turned back to me, placing a kiss on my forehead. \"We actually almost took you to the hospital. Your father was panicking more than any of us. He said since your head wasn't bleeding that you'd be okay. But, when he went to pick you up to carry you up here he...\" Damien trailed off, glancing over to my arm; the arm that bore the scar. I looked over to it, feeling my blood run cold. \"He saw it?\" I asked, feeling my eyes fill with tears. My stomach pooled with a mix of anxiety and dread. \"What did he say? Did you tell him the truth?\" \"I did.\" Damien nodded. \"I didn't know what else to say. Your father is a smart man...I would think he would recognize a stab wound's scar if he saw one. He was shocked, honestly. Shocked that we had kept it hidden for so long.\" Damien laughed. I smiled weakly, feeling him run his fingers through my charcoal hair. It wasn't a lie. We had, miraculously, kept the scar hidden for nearly six years. To our advantage, I wear long sleeves ninety-percent of the ti me, even during the summer. Damien and I were constantly on guard when it came to my scar. Truthfully, we knew it wouldn't be a big deal to just tell my father what happened. But, we couldn't really do anything about it anyways either. What had happened, happened. They had told us many times before that the daggers were dangerous to us. Paul had warned us countless times that the daggers were our only means of dying without regeneration. Immortality comes with a price, he said. It was akin to a parent warning their child about matches or not to play with fire. Unfortunately, Damien I were known for playing with fire. Literally and figuratively. We had done it once and we would most likely be doing it again soon. Before anything else could be said, we both heard the bedroom door creak open slowly. Damien turned to see who it was as I looked toward the direction as well. We both saw my father standing in the doorway with a worried expression. I carefully sat up in bed; this time, Damien letting me. \"Raynee? Are you alright?\" He called out as he stepped into the room. He approached the bed with a look of disdain as he looked at my shoulder. I felt a twinge of guilt run through me. Define 'alright'. I nodded weakly and coughed a bit, looking to Damien. \"Yeah, Dad, I-I'm doing better.\" I paused, seeing him still stare at the mark on my shoulder solemnly. \"Dad, Im so sorry. We didn't want you to find out this way, we didn't kno-\" My father practically darted to my side and held me in a tight embrace. The force from the powerful hug nearly made my head collide with the wooden headboard behind me. I head Damien stifle a laugh as he saw my shocked face. The action certainly woke me up and I was speechless for a moment as my Dad clung to me. Being a military sergeant for such a long time had made my father into a rather strong man, so he barely showed any emotion. That is, unless it ever came to me. \"You should've told us.\" His voice finally broke the awkward silence. The tone in his speech was flat, but somehow was filled with pain and worry. I felt myself cringe. \"I know, Dad. I- We were scared. Damien wasn't sure what to do and we knew we couldn't take me too a hospital.\" \"Raynee had said how taking her too a hospital would've brought...'light' to what had happened. I figured she was right, Sergeant.\" Damien spoke up too and leaned over towards me a bit from the opposite side of the bed. His hand wrapped around one of my free ones, holding it lovingly. Dad stayed silent for a moment and I could tell he was thinking of what to say. Damien could, once again, sense the tension in the air and decided to speak again. I silently thanked him. \"Raynee, what exactly happened to you earlier?\" He asked, his blue eyes meeting mine. \"You had acted like you had just seen someone die...\" His choice of words sent my world spinning. I felt my stomach drop and let out a choked sigh. My father felt me wince in emotional pain and let me free from his embrace. I adjusted myself when he let me go; pulling myself against the headboard and laying against it. I hesitated before speaking, thinking of how to explain what I had felt earlier. Fear was the first word to come to mind, but I knew t would take so much more to explain it to Damien and my father. \"...The bouquet. The flowers in it, actually. They were the same ones that were on Mark's casket at his funeral.\" I looked down at my lap, feeling the tears well up in my eyes. \"I remembered the nightmares and- The pain came back and I didn't know what was happening! I felt like I was dying, so I just screamed.\" I lifted my head to look at Damien and I could see the guilt in his eyes as he then looked to my father. \"Nightmares?\" He asked. \"You've been having nightmares?\" I nodded. My father looked to Damien, knowing he would have more answers than me at the moment. \"For how long?\" Damien sighed, seeing the concern in my father's eyes. \"A few months, she said. I always wake up and either find her on the floor out cold or in a panicked state.\" \"I wouldn't even call them nightmares. There more akin to night terrors, to be honest.\" I intervened, my eyes now glancing at the clock. It was getting late and I was wondering why my dad hadn't gone to bed yet. \"Sometimes it's more like sleepwalking even; I've seen you stand straight up from bed and walk a few feet, stand still for a few moments, and then collapse.\" Damien reached out and tucked a strand of my hair behind my ear. I smiled at his touch despite the awful situation. His words made me remember what had happened a few nights ago. My father remained silent, taking all of the news in. I could see the pain in his eyes and I knew he was trying to be strong. Finding out your daughter was stabbed and is now racked with guilt over who she is must have been a lot to take in one sitting. I sighed, looking up to my father as he stared aimlessly at the floor in sorrow. \"Dad, listen, it's late. How about we all just go to bed...It's been a long day. We should talk about this tomorrow when we're all a bit more rested.\" I laughed a bit, feeling the tension in the room rise by the minutes. I heard another door open from farther down the hallway, knowing it was Paul and that he'd possibly have answers. We had all always confided in Paul for answers; he always knew more about this than we did. Although my father was a very smart and wise man, he was in different ways. Paul always just had reasoning behind the strange things our family faced...he just knew. He stepped into my door's frame, illuminated by the dim light from the hallway coupled from the light downstairs. Seeing my father sulking near us, he gave Damien and I a look of sympathy and worry. Something he usually never did. \"Is everything alright...?\" Paul called out, stepping nearer to my bed and father. \"How are you feeling Raynee?\" I hesitated again. \"...Better, I suppose.\" It was a lie, but he smiled in response. \"You took quite the tumble earlier. How's your head?\" \"Better, again.\" I smiled, laughing a bit. \"What happened while I was out?\" \"Nothing much.\" Damien intervened. I looked towards him as I readjuste The d myself against the pillows stacked behind me. \"We almost called an ambulance for you, but your father said since your head wasn't bleeding that there was no need.\" \"Where are the flowers?\" It was a risky question to ask, I know. Damien laughed, clearing his throat a bit. \"Don't worry, Raynee. They're safe somewhere.\" Paul said, stepping back into the doorway and pausing before he exited. \"I swept them up and put them in some water right after we got you settled. Oh, and there's cake left too.\" My face lit up a bit, my eyes widening. \"Wait, there's a cake?\" Damien smiled at me and took my hand into his, rubbing it a bit. \"Surprise.\" He said, chuckling. \"It was going to be the second surprise after the bouquet. But, you know...\" I laughed at the irony, blushing a bit. \"Yeah, I know. I'd love to have some.\" \"Are you sure you're up for it?\" Paul asked as he looked at me with a worried look. I nodded in reply. \"I'm sure. Damien, will you help me up please?\" He stood, walking to me then taking my hand before gently helping me to my feet. The dull pain in my head throbbed harder as I stood, making me feel light headed. I faltered a bit and Damien caught me. I took a few, slow steps towards the door before letting go of Damien to walk on my own. He protested of course and insisted he help me down the stairs. I held onto the railing tightly as we walked; taking my time and wanting to get to the bottom as quick as I could. Damien laughed a bit and leaned closer to me, smirking. \"I can't imagine what's it's gonna be like seeing you go up them. Will you want my help then, dear?\" I then gathered my remaining strength to playfully hit him on his shoulder. The cake my father and Damien had picked out was gorgeous. It was rather plain for a wedding cake, at least compared to what I had seen. It was three tiers of chocolate cake with white icing; the piped roses on it where pink and the writing that read \"CONGRATULATIONS RAYNEE AND DAMIEN\" was the same. After taking a few pictures of it (and with it, despite my current state) we had sat at the dining table with our slices, eating silently. \"So, how is the cake, dearest?\" Damien asked, breaking the silence as I stuffed another forkful of the dessert in my mouth. \"It's pretty good. You know, for six hour old cake. \" I remarked, making Paul chuckle. \"That bump to your head brought out a sassy streak, huh?\" Damien laughed. \"I'm not too sure I'm fond of that.\" \"It'll go away tomorrow, I'm sure. Although, I'm not sure how well I'm going to sleep tonight considering I slept for so long...\" Damien laughed, shooting me a sly grin. \"Well, I certainly won't complain. I don't mind staying up with you.\" My face grew hot as his words and that damn smile he always gave me. What did he mean by this? I cleared my throat nervously, looking down to hide my blushing cheeks. \"We could watch a movie or something in the family room, I mean.\" He finished, seeing my reaction. \"Sound good, Ray?\" I swiftly looked up at him through strands of my messy hair. I laughed nervously. Nice save, Damien. \"Yeah...that sounds great, Damien. I'd love to.\" I smiled, taking another bite of my cake with a shaking hand. I heard Paul sit his fork down on the glass surface of our dining table. \"What time is it?\" He asked, looking around for the nearest clock; which was in our living room across the hall. My father looked to his watch. \"It's 8:47.\" Paul shook his head to himself before standing up from the table. \"Dammit, it's getting late. I need to be getting ready for bed.\" He paused, looking to me with a soft expression that was laced with concern. \"Raynee, are you sure you're okay, sweetheart?\" I nodded, feigning a smile. \"Yeah, I'm fine now.\" \"Alright. Just wanted to make sure...I'll be in my room if any of you need me. Goodnight.\" He said, picking up his plate of cake from the table and then walking out of the room. \"Goodnight, Paul.\" Damien and I called to him in unison, making us look at each other and laugh. Weird... \"I need to be getting to bed as well, actually.\" My father said, standing from the table and taking his plate in his hands. \"Are you two going to be okay tonight?\" A nod from us. My father smiled, as genuinely as he could. \"Alright. I'll see you two in the morning.\" He then walked out of the room, leaving Damien and I alone in the kitchen. The air was thick with tension; a warm tension that we could both feel, I was sure of it. We both knew what the problem was...We were just too scared to say or do anything about it. Damien fidgeted in his seat, stammering a bit before he spoke. \"...Do you want to go back up to our room?\" I looked up into his eyes, those damned blue eyes of his, and smiled as I nodded sheepishly. \"Sure.\" We pushed in our chairs and cleaned our plates before going up the stairs to our shared bedroom. It took ten minutes, ten agonizing minutes, for us to get up into our bedroom and shut the door behind us. Damien locked it just to be sure as I walked over to the bed, sitting down on the edge of it and looking at him through the darkness of our room. Now, the only light coming into the room was from the moon outside. It barely have any help as I watched Damien's tall figure walk over to me. He loomed over me, looking down at me with a smile that only I couldn't be horrified to see. Damien only spoke one word as he leaned down, burying his face into the nape of my neck. The feeling of his breath against my skin giving me goosebumps as I heard him whisper, \" Ready ?\"[Chapter 10] DAMIEN : OMEN II The Sergeant's Daughter II : My Boy hears Voice s The rest of the night was a blur to me. I don't remember much; the last thing I could recall was feeling the cold sheet's of our bed against my bare skin as Damien pushed me down to them with a smirk on his lips. I sat up in bed, or at least as much as my sore body would allow me, and looked around our darkened room. The sun was barely rising through the curtains next to our bed; creating just enough light to be able to see that Damien was still laying still next to me. I glanced over to the clock that currently read 5:37 AM in bright, blinking red LED numbers. I sighed, looking back over to Damien. He had every right to be tired after yesterday. From what I could remember of it, that is. I attempted to raise myself completely up off of the bed, but was met with a searing pain in my back. I couldn't tell just what it was, but it stung; it felt like my skin was broken open. Quickly, I turned my head to where I had been laying that night. Blood. Streaks of blood. They weren't thin, weakened ones either. They were thick; like they were from a deep laceration or cut. My eyes widened as I felt my stomach drop with shock and dread. What the hell had happened last night? Carefully as I could to not wake Damien next to me, I lifted the blankets off of me and stood. The adrenaline running through me made me ignore the dull ache in my legs as I came to my feet. There's not a chance this could've just been from my fall I had taken yesterday. Dad said I hadn't bled; and even if I been, the bloodstains wouldn't have looked like this. When I stood to walk into the bathroom in the next room over, something stopped me. I'm not quite sure what it was, but something in me caused me to look where I had been laying once more. The place where I had laid that night that had been covered by the blankets was stained in blood as well. Panic promptly replaced the adrenaline that had previously been running through me. In a fit of anxiety I looked at my legs, felt for blood on my stomach, and even braved the still lingering pain on my back to check for blood there. That's when it hit me; hard and sudden like news of death itself. Those long, thin, stinging wounds on my back were scratch marks. And that blood was coming from in between my legs. I almost dropped dead there and then at the realization. I stumbled backwards a bit, my hand covering my mouth in a silent scream of shock and horror as I stared at Damien with wide eyes. My heart felt as if it was going to beat out of my chest, my breathing was rapid as I tried in vain to keep myself calm. I continued to look at Damien with tear filled eyes as I listened to my mind screaming at me, wondering if this was all just another night terror. Had Damien and I really...? I slowly looked down to my once pastel pink, lacy nightgown that was for some reason still on me. Blood stains littered the bottom half; thick and still damp. I lowered a hand to touch the biggest stain that lay just below my stomach. It was still somewhat warm. Then, I felt warmth rise in my throat as I ran into the bathroom, shutting the door behind me as quietly as I could before doubling over and instantly vomited into the toilet. Shock filled my thoughts as I realized what had happened. I didn't do this often; I barely got sick, and when I did, my father always blamed it on my anxieties and panic issues. I never did understand why I had them before, but now I had a reason and knew it. I leaned up against the wall for a moment, looking up to the ceiling as to not look at the remnant of my stomach contents. Tears rolled my face as I suddenly recoiled from the pain on my back; involuntarily putting my hands in my lap and then recoiling those as well upon feeling the blood. Without even thinking twice, I pulled the bloodstained nightdress over my head and threw it onto the floor next to me. The garment laid in a heap at my feet and I hoped it wouldn't leave stains on the pristine, white tiled floor. I'd have to wash it before Damien were to wake. I steadied myself a bit, leaning up and balancing myself to sit up on my knees. My stomach wavered once more, causing my balance to suffer a bit. As I reached to the wall next to me, I made the mistake of glancing at myself in the mirror behind me. Just as I feared, the pain on my back were long, pink- though some were dripping with crimson beads- lines running all over my now nude skin, specifically on my back, in thin ribbons. I shuddered, looking away from the mirror as I felt myself blanch. I knew for a fact those scratch marks were Damien's work. I didn't just know from putting the pieces together; It was so much more than just that. I knew because they looked almost identical to the scratch marks he had given me on my face the day that Mark died. No, the day that Mark was murdered . A fresh wave of tears fell from my eyes as I heard myself phrase it that way. It was the cold truth, but I couldn't stand the thought that Damien was a murderer. He hadn't done it just once though. I knew he had killed many times before, and that he had even done it with me nearby. He hadn't done it recently; the most recent incident was Ann and Richard's deaths back when we were only thirteen. Much too young to even come that close to death. Much too young to commit murder. Sometimes, despite myself, I still can't believe Damien is the Antichrist. Even after nearly six years with him and being with him since I was thirteen, or rather since birth technically, I still can't bring myself to believe he's really the son of the Devil himself. I had convinced myself our parents had just raised us like this and it was all one big, cruel joke in an attempt to make us feel \"special' or something like that. I knew it wasn't that though. God, I knew, but I didn't want to believe it. My mind pushed back; Why would Damien's parents, both his Mother, Father, Aunt and Uncle, sacrifice themselves like that if it really was the scenario? I held my head in my hands as I let out a wavering, weakened sigh. So many people were dead. And they were dead because of me and Damien. Would I have to kill someone myself soon? Oh, but wait; I already technically had with Ann. I had plunged a dagger into her shoulder that night the Thorn Museum caught fire by Damien's hand. 'It was in self defense', My father had told me. Maybe that was right, but it didn't keep the nightmares at bay. I stood off the ground, not wanting to dwell on this subject anymore. I began to clean the evidence of the fact that I had vomited earlier until I was sure Damien wouldn't be able to tell. I tried to make it look like I hadn't even been there. The nightgown on the other hand was another story. I picked it up from the ground, where it had indeed left little red marks on the tile. I cursed under my breath as I carried it over to the counter of the sink. I turned on the water to lukewarm and then placed the garment under it. I had to try to get most of the blood out. I couldn't just take into the laundry basket; Dad or Paul would see and they'd know. What would they think? Surely they knew it was going to happen eventually...The prophecy said I had to have a child with Damien. Is that the only reason I was brought into the world? Just so I could be groomed into a bride for the Antichrist and to breed with him? This would undoubtedly be child abuse in any sane person's eyes. I felt the strong urge to vomit again but somehow managed to miraculously keep it down. As I looked up to turn the sink's faucet off, seeing the water below turn a dark, brick red, I noticed the marks on my chest as well. Bite marks. They were scattered across my breasts and neck, dark like bruises. I reached up and carefully pressed onto one, feeing that it was sore like a bruise. I wondered if I had bled from those too at Damien's hand. Against my will, I suddenly leaned over the edge of the sink and began to sob. I rested my head against the cold ceramic surface of the sink's counter as I felt my aching body shake with each sob that escaped my lips. I tried to quiet myself as much as I could; biting my lips until I could taste blood in a vain attempt to make myself shut up. What would mother say? What are you going to do now? You're much too young to be with child. My mind continued to taunt me with prodding questions until I had the courage to look at my reflection once more. I had forgotten to take my makeup off the day prior; smeared, dripping mascara lines ran down my cheeks. What was left of the rest of my makeup was smudged and running as well from my emotional breakdown coupled with the fact I slept in it last night. For once in my life, I truly thought I looked broken. I sniffled, wiping my eyes and attempting to salvage my makeup just a little bit. It didn't quite help as much as I had hoped for, and I had only succeeded in making a large black smear on my forearm. It made me chuckle to myself; it was pathetic, really. I would think the type of girl- or anyone, really- to be the protector and mate of the Antichrist to be brave and fearless, ready to lay her life on the line for him. While the latter might have applied to me, I definitely didn't think I fit the bill to be his 'protector'. My father or Paul would be more fitting by a long shot; Definitely not me, Raynee Charlotte Neff, the type of girl who cries after supposedly losing her virginity to the Antichrist himself. I shook my head to myself, dismissing my thoughts as I reached into the crimson water to retrieve my nightdress. It still had very faint smears of blood embedded in the pale fabric. I sighed, beginning to wring the now cold water out of it as I hummed a song to myself, trying to take my mind off of things. Then, I heard the bathroom door click. My face blanched as I felt my blood run cold. I immediately dropped the nightgown back into the sink out of shock, causing a large splash, much to my annoyance. Rosy water was now speckled onto the pristine white counters and tiled floor. I slowly looked towards the door a few feet away from me. Dead silence. But then, \"Raynee?\" Fuck. Fuck. FUCK. The oh-so-familiar voice of my husband, Damien Thorn, rang in my ears much to my horror, but not surprise. Just my luck. I paused and desperately looked around for something, anything to help my current situation. I definately wouldn't have enough time to wipe the bloodied water from the counters; and I'm certain the room still smelled of vomit. I took a few breaths to calm my racing heart, then turned to the door and finally called out in a voice dripping with a facade of faux calmness, \"...Yes?\" \"Are you busy, love?\" Damien asked from the other side of the door, his voice muffled. \"I figured you were getting ready; I just wanted to come and make sure you were okay. May I come in?\" Panic quickly crept its way into my blood; my chest felt like it was collapsing. My eyes darted around the room, looking for somewhere, anywhere, I could store the soaked nightdress I held in my shivering hands. I couldn't just leave it on the counter! What would my excuse be? I knew Damien would ask about it. Maybe I could hide it in the laundry hamper by the shower? No, it would the the rest of the clothes in it wet too. Wait! The cabinets! I came to my knees on the floor and then quickly opened one of the many cherry stained, wooden cabinets under our sink and stuffed the soaked nightdress inside. I'd deal with it later; water wouldn't be that much of a hastle to clean up. Then, I stood back to my feet and walked over to the door to unlock it for Damien. Our eyes met after I slowly pulled the door open, the lock clicking loudly. Damien's calm face turned to one of shock as he saw my current state. Messy, tangled hair, my makeup from the previous day running down my face in teary streaks, and the plethora of scratches on my skin. Damien stammered a bit before speaking. \"...R-Raynee? A-are you alright?\" I nodded in response without thinking as much as I really should've. \"Yeah. I'm fine; Just really tired.\" My voice cracked weakly, pathetically as I spoke. Damien's gaze travled back to my skin; to the cuts and bruises that decorated it in a macabre show of ownership. He swallowed hard, then stepped into the bathroom with me, shutting the door behind him. Silence followed suit. We stood together, not saying a word. I chose to stare at the pristine white tile beneath my feet, Damien on the other hand was still staring at my wounds. Finally, he sighed, then placed a cold hand on my shoulder. I flinched; maybe a bit harder than I should've. His other hand came to my chin; Damien tilted my head up so I could look him in the eyes. Those damned, crystalline blue eyes that always burned into my chocolate ones- absolutely lifeless in comparison. \"Do you want to talk about last night?\" I shook my head, crossing my arms over my bare chest. Damien pulled me close to him suddenly and held me in his arms with a wavering breath. I closed my eyes after a moment, bringing my arms to his back, holding him in return. The world didn't matter when we were together like this. Everything stood peacefully still when Damien held me like this. Here I was once more, bleeding breathlessly in his worried embrace. I pulled away for a moment to look up at him. \"I'm okay. I promise.\" I said, placing my hand gently against Damien's cheek. \"...Go downstairs. I'm gonna get cleaned up and then we'll talk, okay?\" Damien paused; I could tell he didn't want to leave me like this. But, he nodded. \"Alright.\" We separated. Damien glanced back at me somberly before walking out of the bathroom and shutting the door. When he was gone, I walked back over to the sink's counter. I turned on the faucet and let the water heat up, grabbing a clean washcloth from the cabinets. Listening to the running water, I began to cry again- hoping the noise would drown out my cries. Tears ran down my already stained and messy cheeks, only adding to the carnage that used to be my beautiful makeup leftover from I and Damien's wedding day. I was scared. Horrified , to be honest. I was scared of the consequences. I was scared of the future. I was scared of what was to come. I was scared to be alive . People would find out Damien and I were still out there...People like Damien's father and Richard; People who intended to harm us and our family. Those people would want us dead in the name of their beliefs. They didn't view us as people, real people with feelings and a family and a life as well...We were just prey. Their enemies. It wouldn't happen today, maybe not even tomorrow, but it would happen soon. Placing the washcloth into the water, dampening it, I then began to wipe off what remained of my makeup. The once white cloth turned a dull grey the more and more I scrubbed against my face, my tears coming off with my still-intact eyeliner. My next task would be to wipe the dried blood from my skin. I wasn't looking forward to it. I began to walk briskly down the wooden steps that lead to our foyer and living room to meet Damien as I had promised earlier. As my feet tip-tapped against the stairs, I did my best to tame my still tangled hair. I had forgotten to brush it while in the bathroom and I didn't feel like going back just to do that. The long sleeved, rather thin, ivory nightdress I had chosen to wear clung to my still dampened skin. I silently hoped and prayed that it would suffice in covering my wounds if my father and Paul were awake. I cringed at the thought of them seeing my current state. When I came to the living room, Damien was sitting on one of the two couches. He immediately perked up at the sight of me, giving me a small smile. \"Good morning, love.\" He said through the thick tension that surrounded us. I returned a smile. \"Hi.\" I said simply, coming over to the couch to sit next to him. I chose to still avert my eyes from him, staring at my lap instead as I felt him place his hand against mine. \"How do you feel?\" Damien asked with an air of worry in his tone. I feigned a smile. Despite the stinging pain that rocketed through my torso and legs, the crippling dread that ate at my brain, and the ache in my chest, I had to put on a happy face for him. \"I feel okay...What about you?\" He paused; I assumed he didn't know what to say, just like me. Damien entangled his hand into mine; our rings touching each other lightly. Damien waited quite a bit to speak. But, then, \"I'm sorry...\" I finally chose to meet his stare with a shocked expression. I sighed, leaning against him and nuzzling against his shoulder. \"For what? You've done nothing wrong.\" I of course knew just what he was apologizing for, but I didn't want to validate his guilt. Besides, wasn't this my job according to the prophecy? To be there for him in every way, to be subject to his will and to submit to his desires? A shudder ran through me. Damien noticed. \"...I should've been more gentle. You don't deserve what I did; I don't want you to see me like that again.\" He said with humility. Damien pressed a kiss to my hair, then lifted a hand to run his fingers delicately through it. \"Never again.\" Damien spoke with a sternness in his voice I don't hear very often. I pulled away from him then, giving him a pained look. \"Damien, don't blame yourself for this...You can't control our destinies. You have nothing to be sorry for...This is my duty as your wife.\" Damien gave me a disgusted look; not directly at me, but rather, at the words I chosen to say. I knew that despite the morbidly submissive- albeit interally sexist - tone of the facts, we both knew very well that they were true. Damien swiftly pulled me into a silent embrace, something we found we shared often. They were somberly beautiful. \"What a way to spend a honeymoon, right?\" I chided. We both laughed hollowly. Just then, we began to hear footsteps shuffling above us from the second floor of the manor. Damien pulled away, looking to the ceiling for a moment. I did the same, wondering just who it was that was up at this hour. At that thought, I glanced at the clock that rested on the fireplace's mantle. It read six thirty-seven on the dot. It was probably my father; he was still used to waking up rather early, even after his services in the military and his job at the Academy. I turned to Damien. \"Let's go upstairs...I don't want my father questioning why we're up so early.\" Damien nodded; I'm sure he got my drift. He stood, pulling me gently up with him. Damien and I continued to walk out of the foyer together and then quickly back up the flight of stairs that lead back to the safety of our bedroom. The hallway upstairs was dark and eerily silent as we walked into our shared room. What exactly we were going to do was unknown to the both of us. Go back to sleep, discuss everything even more, or just sit in awkward- almost mourning like silence. Something, anything to get our minds off of things; something we, again, found ourselves doing quite often.[Chapter 11] [ wow. hi there, readers. first of all, i want to apologize for my nearly-year long absence from this fandom, once again. i've rather moved on from the omen the past few years, to put it simply; though, that is no reason to not keep updating this story that so many of you all love. im sorry; i should be ashamed! you all deserve better...i promise i will try to update this story more frequently in the next few months. anyways, i hope you all enjoy the new chapter. i swear the next one wont take nearly a year to write. thank you for all of your support even after all these months. i love you all. - Luna ︎ ] ","Summary":" DAMIEN: OMEN II / OMEN III: THE FINAL CONFLICT The Sergeant's Daughter II: My Boy hears Voices The "},{"Movie":"Cursed","Title":"The End Is Rarely Happy","Author":"oOKayleeOo","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4167339","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Elle watched her brother as he ran off with the girl of his dreams and tried to smile. Sure, all was not right with the world. There were still starving countries riddled with AIDs, their parents had uped and died, and Elle had to move from inter-state to raise her misfit brother. Not to mention how much she hated her job. But, and this was the important part; she wasn't going to be turning brown and fury and that had to be something good in this big, wide world of bad. Elle sighed and went back inside, shutting the cracked door behind her. Who knew what time that kid-brother of hers would be getting home, well at least he was out with friends. That was a first, and it had to be a good sign. Better than reading those books. Maybe the werewolf feasco hadn't been all bad…Elle shook her head, trying to disloge an image of Jake that had floated to her mind. Jake smiling down at her in his rather off-beat club. Elle wandered into the lounge-room and found the book Jimmy had lent from the library. It was still open on the page describing how to cure oneself from the curse. She picked the book up, careful not to loose the page and skimmed over it. It was pure luck that Jimmy had chosen this book, Elle thought. If he'd picked another one we might have got it wrong. Might have missed something important. Might have turned fury. She put the book back down on the coffee table. She'd have to remind Jimmy to return it soon, they'd had it for a while now, and she knew full well who'd end up forking out the bill for it. Jake would have offered. Trying to keep those unwanted thoughts behind her, out of her head, Elle moved into the kitchen to do some cleaning up. The moment she saw the shambles Elle realized just how near impossible the task would be. Oh well all the better to keep those thoughts at bay. But they kept moving in on her, catching her unawares, tricking her into payng attention to them. Thoughts about Jake. His face when he asked her, told her to join him. She'd almost agreed. For a split second she almost forsook all she knew, everyone she loved, Jimmy. Almost. But she'd turned down the offer. She'd felt bad at the time. She didn't now. But Elle tried not to think about that. Instead: she did the dishes. Trying to keep her thoughts on all the broken plates that littered the room and how long it was going to take her to clean the mess up. And of course Jimmy was out with his new fab friends. No doubt he'd understood the ultimate mess and how he ultimately would have had to help clean if he'd stayed home. Smart boy. Elle thought, shaking her head and smiling that small annoyed one she saved for moments just like this. Well, not so much the house-getting-ruined-by-evil-wolfman-boyfreind-and-scary-dog moments, more her brother avoiding the house-hold chores kinds of moments. Bending down to pick up a semi-whole plate, Elle let out a groan of pain. A sudden spazem of fear seized the young woman as the terrified thought that she was still turning ran-throuh her like a shiver. Her breathing became short, sharp and panic-stricken. \"Oh, no. Please no.\" she whispered to the empty room, unintentionally looking at the burnt remains of her boyfriend. almost expecting him to move, laugh at her. But nothing happend. No claws, no fur, no rage. silence, just her short, staggered panting. slowly she patted down her side, where the pain was almost unbareable. she felt something warm and sticky. Elle let out a sigh of relief as she recognised the signs of extensive injurty. She'd failed to notice it earlyer and had no doubt it occurred during the violent fight for her and her brother's life. Maybe I've been in shock ? Wiping her hands on her pants, Elle carefully raised her black top that had drunk up the blood and hidden the wound from herself. Pealing the blood soaked top back and twisting to get a better look, the full extent of the injury came into view. \"Ah crap,\" she muttered. It was big and it was mighty, \"It's gonna need stitchs.\" Elle swore, even with her health insurance, all these hospital trips were going to add up into costing her a lot of money. At least she was human. Elle just had to keep reminding herself of that. And as long as the cops didn't come knocking about a missing Jake, all would be fine. Jake. Something had gone oh-so-very wrong in that relationship. Something had gone oh-so-very wrong with Jake. How had she not known about him before hand? How did she not tell that he was…well a homicidal, pathological, lanthencropic psychopath. Well at least she had an excuse about the lanthercopic part. Up till a week or so ago she didn't even believe in God let alone werewolves. Now she wasn't sure about anything. Take the Easter Bunny for instance, was that real? Elle could go insane with these kinds of questions. Best not to think about them, best not to think about Jake either. Best not to look at the crispy remains of him lying paitently on the floor. Boy was Ella going to have nightmares tonight. \"Screw it,\" Elle muttered, rolling the top back down over the wound. \"I'm going to bed.\" sure she should really be taking herself off to the hospital, giving her kid brother a quick call on the mobile -assuming he'd taken it with him - and all that. But right now she was tired. More tired than she'd been in a while, not since mum and dad had died. Not since the funeral. Without really thinking, she picked up the now clean silver cake cutter to put back in the draw. The cutter was burning hot, like acid. The pain ran like liquid fire up Elle's arm until she screamed and threw the antique piece of cutlery back into the sink. Gripping her hand she staggered back, knocking into the kitchen table, stepping on her dead ex. Elle looked down at the burnt palm and seeing the already healing wound: screamed.[Chapter 2] Jimmy leapt in to Bo's car riding shotgun with Brook in the back. They were laughing as they sped off doing at least thirty over the speed limit. But Jimmy was yet to see a police car in this area of town. They were laughing; Jimmy had no idea what the others were finding so funny. He was too busy laughing because he wasn't dead, wasn't fury, and wasn't cleaning. What more could he ask for in a day? He was almost hysterical. After a few deep breaths, and a few more uncontrollable giggles from the group Bo managed to ask \"Where we headed?\" he was still grinning and trying to stay focused on the road as houses and little trees trapped in pavement zoomed past. He gave Jimmy a sideways glance. \"I honestly don't care.\" Jimmy grinned in response, putting his hands behind his head and leaning back. He grinned at Becky in the seat behind. She smiled back while trying to get her hair under control. It was whipping around wildly in the wind. Finally she managed to tie it back and asked Jimmy if it looked ok. He said it looked 'fine'. And unfortunately the poor girl believed him. It is a good thing one could say, that she couldn't see her reflection in the revision mirror. \"What about my place?\" asked the girl once finished with her hair and leaning between the boys in the front to fiddle with the radio. Choosing something hideous and girlly. Bo groaned. \"Honestly,\" said he, raising his voice against the music. \"You'd think that after spending four months with me her taste in music might have improved.\" Bo joked, giving Jimmy a sideways grin. Her taste. An image flashed into Jimmy's mind. It was brief, gone before he could even fully register it. Brook. Blood. Jimmy leaning ever closer to lick the weeping wound….Jimmy blinked, and shook his head slightly. Momentarily disorientated the young man gave a wild look around the still moving car. Everything still seemed normal. Brook was bopping along to whatever noise she'd found on the radio and Bo was no negating his way though light traffic. That wasn't meant to happen, right? Jimmy had to stop himself from saying that out loud. You weren't supposed to think those kinds of things after you were cured, right? Especially about girls in which one was romantically inclined. And he was cured. That he knew for sure. As sure as Jake was ash on the kitchen floor, waiting for Mr. Dust Pan. \"You ok?\" asked Bo, sparing Jimmy another glance. He'd spotted the sudden change come over the guy and was rather concerned. After all he did own some kind of mutant, rabid dog. What happened if the monster bit him? Brook didn't notice a thing as she bopped along to the 'music' in the back seat, completely oblivious to the world. Jimmy tried to think of an answer. Somehow the truth just didn't seem to be a good idea. \"Uh…yeah…\" he responded in an oh-so-unconvincing way, \"…fine.\" \"…Right…\" Responded Bo, disbelieving but returning to concentrate on the roads anyway. There was a 4WD behind and Bo didn't trust them. His dad drove a 4WD, and that was proof enough for Bo. Besides, it was dark and he wasn't the best of drivers, even when he was concentrating. \"So, where are we going again?\" asked Jimmy, the mental moment he'd had really messed with him. \"My house.\" Brook called out from the back, \"remember?\" Jimmy saw her smile through the revision mirror and his stomach did flip-flops. This was the best worst day of his life. It almost made him wish he had more of them. Blood. The sent of it filled him. And for a moment the surrounding night seemed as bright as day. All right, there's something really not ok here. Jimmy thought, in a quietly panicked sort of way. He sat there for a moment staring intently at the dashboard while the radio continued to blast poorly written love songs and tried not to cry. After effects. Jimmy informed himself, faking knowledgeable. Obviously it must take a while for the wolf to get out of your system. \"Yeah,\" Jimmy agreed with himself. That had to be it. It seemed to make sense. \"What?\" asked Brook, with a curious expression. Jimmy did a double take, suddenly freaking out over how much he'd thought aloud. But by the look of only mild curiosity on her face he could tell thankfully not much. \"Uh, nothing, just thinking out loud.\" He responded. He tried to act calm, tried not to reveal to the other members of the car how freaked out he was getting. But his quivering voice, shaking knees and weak bladder were saying otherwise. Jimmy just had to hope they wouldnt notice. This wasn't supposed to be happening. This was meant to be over. Jimmy glanced down at his clenched hands in his lap. Half expecting them to be covered with that dark brown fur. They appeared normal. But looks, Jimmy knew, could be deceiving. After all Jake and that chick from Ell's work looked normal enough. Until of course they turned furry and tried to hunt them down. flashes of memory kept popping into Jimmy's head, the absolute terror he'd had as the werewolf hunted them down the halls in the restraunt...Jimmy decided this recount of everything that had happened that night was not the best way to try and calm himself down. And tried to think of something anything that could set his mind at ease and prove how he was just working himself up once again. So he turned to the one constant in his life that was unafraid to constantly point out his short comings and bring him down in general. His sister. If she was experiencing some of the same things he was, or worse, he knew it was time to worry. If she told him to get over himself and grow up; he knew all was right with the world. Jimmy reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out his mobile. The fact that it came out in pieces keyed him in pretty quickly on just how useless it was. Which was a shame as it was a gift from his now dead parents. He stared at it for a moment, trying to comprehend what he was going to do now. His mobile was ruined. It was like the universe was trying to make his life that bit more difficult. Now how was he going to get in contact with his sister? What if she was in danger? What if she was turning back? What if he was turning back? Right now, with his friends around them? What if he tried to kill him? There were too many thoughts running around uncontrolled and unchecked in Jimmy's brain. He was overwhelmed. He felt like screaming and leaping out of the moving car to find a tree to punch and make everything better. Brook leaned over and tapped Jimmy on the shoulder, \"You wanna use mine?\" she asked. Jimmy turned and looked at her with sorrowful eyes, not comprehending what she was saying. Just having the same horrible thoughts running over and over inside his head. Seeing his expression, Brook thought it best to clarify. \"My mobile,\" said she, giving his a glance over, the screen was smashed and most of the buttons seemed to be missing. There was even a little of what seemed like blood that had seeped between the cracks. She thought it best not to ask what happened. \"You want to borrow it? I'm on a Cap.\" Finally clicking, Jimmy nodded his head and Brook disappeared to rummage through her bag to find it. The mobile was pink with dingly-danglys hanging off it. Normally Jimmy would have made a fuss, but he wasn't concerned about such trifles at the moment. He just took it off the girl with out thanking her and punched in his home number. The phone rang for what seemed ages. Then it rang out. He dialled it again. And it rang out once more. On the third attempt it was answered (as things always happened in threes). \"Ell,\" Jimmy began, but didn't get any further because he was cut off with a low, threatening growl.[Chapter 3] Ellie hadn't slept well that night. In fact she'd hardly slept at all, even though she'd downed more than the recommended dose of nighty-nights that she'd discovered in the bathroom cabinet. She wasnt entirly sure how they'd gotten there. But that didn't stop her from waking up in a cold sweat not fifteen minutes after her head hit the pillow. The sheets were tangled around her neck and she awoke with such an uncontrollable panic that ran through her like lightening, that Ellie let out a scream before she was even fully awake. Ellie struggled momentarily against the sheets, somehow thinking they were Jake trying to strangle her before she realized where she was and that yes, her boyfriend \"ex\" she reminded herself was still in the kitchen. Breathing hard and sitting bolt up in the large bed, Ellie glanced around the dark room. Everything seemed normal, her bloody shirt was still on the floor by the door where she'd tossed it before going to bed, the photos of her parents still sitting untouched on top the draws. Everything was fine, her parents smiling out from their little frames in a strangely reassuring way. Wait a second! Ellie took a double take on the situation. It was night and all the lights bar the kitchen which was downstairs were off. It should be pitch black, how could she see the photos? their smiling faces? And then that sinking feeling as the memory of the cake-cutter slowly seeped back into her muddled mind. Without thinking but with great deliberation, Ellie slowly moved her hand to her side where the painful wound had sat quietly only a short while before. What she felt there made Ellie let out a small sound of dispair. There was only a slight tenderness and the raised bump of an almost healed wound. With the realization that this was real Ellie tried scrambled off the bed, trying in a vain attempt to escape the fact. The fact that she was not cured, the fact that there was something growing inside her. Ellie tried to leap from the bed, however had not completely detangled herself from the blankets. Thus instead of landing on her feet and running from the room; her foot caught in the bed-sheets and she fell full length off the bed. Managing to knock her draws and make all the smiling pictures fall and smash around her as she lay momentarily stunned on the ground. She almost expected another wolf attack to come down on her. \"Oh, god, oh god\" Ellie panted as she got herself back up off the floor and half crawled out of her bedroom before running down the stairs and into the kitchen. She stopped suddenly at the entrance when she spotted Jake and stood transfixed as she stared at the body, her eyes wide with fear. Silently she shook her head and backed away from the kitchen. She didn't know where she was going or what she was going to do. But going back into the kitchen was not part of her plan. Bad things happened in the kitchen. bad situations only seemed to get worse when she was in there. Without really thinking, Ellie moved into the lounge room and picked up the phone. Some part of her knew she had to call Jimmy. Had to tell him to get home and as far away from his friends as possible. It wasn't safe. The numbers lit up the moment she hit the call button, illuminating her hand as she held the cordless. Ellie screamed again as she looked down, throwing the phone across the room. She stared at them. They weren't hers. Her hands weren't hers! \"This cant be happening!\" Ellie cried, tears of desperation rolling down her terrified face. She held her hands away from herself as if they were contagious and of all things tried to back away. Still holding her hands out before her. \"Why is this happening to me?!\" she whimpered. The mark of the curse on her palm was obscured by the soft, downy fur that had begun to grow and was now quietly moving further up her arms. Her nails had already turned dark and sharp like those of a wolf she was so soon to resemble. \"No.\" Ellie whispered, her voice barely above a whisper, shaking her head in denial as hot little tears ran down her face. \"No.\" She knew she had to fight it. Push back the changes. Refuse the curse. But how? She couldn't. They'd tried, and they had failed. They had killed the one who caused this and it had done nothing! Their last hope had died when Jake had. Her back came in contact with a wall and Ellie slid down it, curling up into the foetal position and whimpered. Her hands still held away from herself, in the vague hope that the distance from her body would slow the process. It was around then that the phone rang for the first time. Sharply, Ellie looked up from her dark little spot in the unlit room and focused on the sound of the cordless. She contemplated getting up to answer it. But it was too far. She just wanted to curl up and die. The noise of the phone was so loud it hurt her ears, she wanted the sound to stop. After a while it did; which was nice. But then it started up again. The noise went on and on. Ellie was half tempted to crawl all the way over there to tell them to stop ringing and let her wallow in the misery and monstrosity that was to be her life from here on out. The phone rang again. Obviously whoever was on the other side of the phone-line was not very sympathetic to Ellie's predicament. The sound was so loud; it was like someone was drilling inside her head. \"Persistent little...\" Muttered Ellie as she got up rather unsteadily to her feet and moved towards the phone. Her gait was off; there was something wrong with her balance. She reached for the phone that had managed to land on the sofa and hit the receive button. \"Ell\", her brother's voice came through his voice was slightly crackled, Ellie realised she must have thrown the phone harder than she realized. More importantly, however her brother's voice sounded mighty panicked. \"Jim,\" Ellie went to tell her brother that he had to get out of the car and back home ASAP. That things had defiantly not gone according to plan and there was something severely wrong with the situation. However, to Ellie's dismay, all that slipped out from between her lips was a low growl. \"Ellie?\" she could hear her brother's panic stricken voice crackle through as she dropped the phone and reached up with clawed hands to touch her face. There was utter silence as she felt the features of a face she no longer recognised.[Chapter 4] Jimmy was silent for a moment when he heard it Jimmynwas silent for a moment as the phonensuddenly disconnected in his ear. Frozen for a spit second as the carnsped down the dark streets in shocked silence. In those that secondnhe couldn't hear Bo's hoon-loon talk, nor could he hear Brooknsigning off key in the back seat. He could only hear his sister; overnand over that horrible, inhuman growl. Slowly,nthe boy looked down to stare at the phone,nas if the pink, shiny receiver would somehow explain why this wasnhappening again. \" I'mnnever gonna end with you, cuz I've gone to deep we know it'sntrue. And we're heading off into the blue. I'm in love with you;nI'm in love with you.\" Brook wasnsinging at the top of her lungs. She was totally digging this song atnthe moment and the young woman had started squealing when the firstncord had been played through the tinny speakers of the car. But she'dncut herself off when in leaning over to crank up the volume even morenshe'd spotted Jimmy and more importantly; she'd seen how intentlynhe was staring at the mobile. \"Hey,\"nshe called out over the booming volume. \"You sure you're ok?\" Jimmynturned and faced the young love of his life with a hauntednexpression. \"I have to go home.\" He said in a low tone that Brooknhad to strain to hear over the booming music. \"Why?\"nshe asked, interested, but not entirely concerned. \"What'snwrong?\" \"Mynsister….\" But Jimmy couldn't thing of anything else to saynafter that. \"Shensick?\" asked Bo. Once again taking his eyes from the road andngiving his passenger another look over. Jimmy wasn't looking toonhealthy; he seemed to have gone through three shades of pale sincenthey'd left his house less than twenty minutes earlier. \"Yeah.\"nreplied Jimmy, seizing the excuse and making it his own, \"realnsick\" he added as an unwanted memory of Elle staring in horrornas her hand as bones shifted less than hournbefore. \" Wenwere born only to fly, and if I'm not with you I know I'm gonnandie. And in the end I'm in love with you, I'm in love with…\" the song was abruptly cut off when Bonmuted the sound. \"You really want to go home?\" he asked lookingnmore than disappointed. \"I'm sure your sis's been sick bynherself before.\" Bo suddenly sneered \"you finally get to hangnwith the big kids and you're running home whipped?\" Jimmynsnarled, a low and unnecessary growl emitted from the boy's throat.n\"Listen fudge boy,\" he growled, he'd never said anything sonhomophobic in his life and some small part of Jimmy's mind wasndisgusted at himself. \"But you and your little chemoflarge here\"nat this he jestured at Brook who wore an expression of confused hurt,n\"have no fricking idea what my sister is going through.\" Hensnarled, \"But if you don't turn this hunk of junk around I'mngoing to rip out your spleen.\" Well thatncaused an interesting silence. The two other members of the vechilenstared at Jimmy. \"Getnout.\" Bo said flatly. Jimmynblinked, suddenly realizing exactly what he'd said and how far fromnhome he was. \"No, wait, I'm…\" the boy tried to self explainnbut Bo was having nothing of it. \"Justnget out.\" He said again, louder this time. Brook was just staringnat Jimmy open mouthed as if he'd just grown a tail or something.nAnd in Jimmy's case that was quite a likely story. Without evennrealizing it he checked for one. \"I'mnsorry…\" It was the only thing Jimmy could think of saying. And hendidn't have to see the expression on the driver's face to knownthat it was nowhere near enough. \"Brook…\" Jimmy turned to facenthe girl in the back pleadingly. But she just shook her headndisbelievingly. Jimmy looked down at his hands mortified and ashamed.nHe was still holding the mobile. It was still pink. He let out a lownsigh, put the mobile in the drink holder and left the car. Bo spednoff without so much as looking back at him. Cranking up the volumenjust spite the boy stationed at the side of the road. It was thennthat Jimmy realized he probably should have called a cab beforenhopping out of the car. Because it was a long walk home. And by thensounds of how Elle was doing, it was unlikely that he was going tonmake it back unchanged.[Chapter 5] It was unreal. That was the emotion, not disbelief or shock. Unreal. Until this moment Ellie didn't know such a feeling could exist. She staggered up the stairs, making her awkward way towards the bathroom. Limbs that weren't hers. There were twinges of agony as her brain continued to map out the motor-neuron network of her changing body. And a strangely warm itch that had started from the center of her spine and moved upwards and outwards. The house she'd known since she was born seemed so different now. She could truly 'see' it for the first times. The tiny, once unnoticeable cracks in the paint. finger prints of five-year-olds long since thought washed away in past years. Unreal. She stumbled into the bathroom, clearing the sink before the mirror in one fell swoop and grabbing the scissors from behind the cabinet. Ell had to make it stop. Had to take it back. Herself. She was going to keep cutting until she found herself again. Under the fur. It was everywhere. She looked like the modern envision of the wolf-boy-made-girl. Just started cutting. She just started cutting everything. So close to the skin that she was bleeding. Her arms, her hands tiny cuts turned into manic slashes as she realized the inhuman persistence of the change. It was becoming impossible to use the scissors as her hands...her claws evolved. Became bigger, more primitive. But Ellie was persistent also, opening the scissors to their full extent gripping one side. Hardly noticing as the blade dug into her padded palms. Dragging the exposed blade along her forearm. Pushing down until she knew it was tearing skin. She needed it to. She had to expose the human underneath. And when she couldn't feel the arm through all the pain, she looked into the mirror and saw the face. She didn't scream. Ellie was beyond screaming. She didn't think about what she did next. No time for thinking. Ellie saw the face and in one swift moment she raised the blade from her arm struck her temple. Deep. Handel to scalp. Blood welling at the base and mixing with her new coat. Ellie blinked. The blade, caked with hair and blood, was still in her hand. Her arm was a patch work of healing wounds. Tentatively Ellie reached up and touched her temple. Watching her untrusting reflection. Nothing. Just hair and the disturbing undergrowth. A hallucination. Somehow that brought her attention back to her brother and the terror in his voice. He was still out there. In danger. Dangerous. There was no way in hell that Ellie wanted to help him. To expose herself like this. A monster. Something that a part of her still screamed couldn't exist. But this was not a matter of want. Her brother might be the most annoying little problem-child on the earth. But he was her problem, and as Ellie stared herself down in the mirror, she knew she was going to take care of it. She snarled at the reflection, exposing two rows of terrible razors. She still felt like Ell. Underneath it all she was still there. She had to be. In one fluid moment Ellie turned from the mirror, released the blade and began the search for her brother. Author's note: Hey everyone, long time no post, don't worry I noticed too and have a few things to say on the matter. Firstly sorry about the very long delay in posts. I orinally only meant this to be a one-shot but continued it due to popular demand and have been stuck for a plot ever since. Secondly: I hate unfinished stories and would hate to become one of those people who don't finish them so I am making a promise that this story will be completed before the year's out. Thirdly: Ideas and inspiration for the development of this plot would be awesome![Chapter 6] Horror, shame guilt. There's a lot of emotions that a person can feel at any one time. Fear, exuberance, shame. The list goes on. Jimmie shuffled his sneakers in the loose roadside gravel. This, he had to admit, was a bad situation. In fact, Jimmie would quite willingly go as far as to admit that it was a very bad situation. Quite probably one of the worst he'd managed to get himself into thus far. When it cane to stupid, insulting and outright disgusting things that one can say, Jimmie had taken the cake and candles tonight. He clenched his fists and breathed through gritted teeth. He'd really done it. \"Why the hell did I even say that?\" Jimmie swore to himself quietly in the hush of the undeveloped outskirts of town. He could just make the lights of suburbia in the distance. A good hour or two walk until he got back to streetlights. Jimmie sighed and shuffled his feet. He'd better start the trek back sooner rather than later. There was something seriously déjà view going on and it was getting scary. More scary than before because of one major difference. No Ellie. Even if he was never going to admit it, to himself, to his sister or anyone else; Ellie made things better. She was his big sister, and when things turned to custard she was the one to deal. In the thick of it with him. When mum and dad died, Ellie came home. They ordered pizza for a month. Jimmie didn't have to go to school and Ellie didn't go to work. And when the dog-food ran out they ordered pizza for the dog…until they got a letter that said Jimmie was going to get expelled if he didn't turn up for school in the next week. Jimmie didn't know how to cope with this without Ellie. It just didn't work. Ok, so maybe he hadn't coped too well with this with Ellie…but that was beside the point. The point was that this was a MAJOR freak out. And he was having it on the side of a road. Running a stressed hand through his hair, Jimmie tried to work out just how screwed he was. But he couldn't get past the part where it didn't make sense. He'd done everything by the book. Everything. And it worked. It worked perfectly. They had won. They had killed Jake and they had won. That was how things like this work. Kill the evil boyfriend and everything just works itself out. That's how it's supposed to go. Only…. Only Jimmie was having so much trouble not thinking about the fact that there was something small and warm blooded in the scrub a few feet away. He could practically feel the heartbeats inside his head. They were small and fast and almost flowed through him. He wanted to consume it, make it his. The thought of it thrilled him and made him feel sick all at once. This was not ok. Ellie was not ok. The small animal inside the scrub shifted nervously, dragging Jimmie's focus away from the task, the desperate situation at hand and back on its tiny life-force hidden from sight. Fighting the urge to dive into the half dead bush and hunt down, rip, tear, taste the tiny animal…Jimmie swallowed… he was loosing it. Seriously, dangerously loosing it. Was this how Jake thought? About people? Permanently? All the time? He hoped not. He hoped so. The moon was almost unbearably bright and Jimmie felt like he could see forever. He inhaled deeply, tasting the air… all the interesting things he never bothered to notice before this moment. It was amazing. Every sent, every flavor. Details beyond his ability to describe. He could just stand here and breathe for hours. Ellie. There was something wrong with Ellie. Jimmie shook his head. There was something wrong with him. It was getting harder to focus on one thing. Not with the bright moon, and the warm smells. And his sister. He had to look for his sister, before he lost it completely. And apologize to Bo. No! Screw Bo and that little bitch of his! Jimmie snarled. Bo left him out here. No phone, no way home but his own two legs. Wait , an expression of panic ran across the young man's face, this wasn't him . Jimmie rubbed his forehead, trying to erase these angry, violent thoughts that couldn't belong to him. Had to belong to the wolf. The wolf that couldn't still be inside him. Pushing its way back out. He could almost feel it, testing him. Swallowing him, consuming him like a tiny heartbeat of a small beast bleeding out. Jimmie breathed in deep and held it. Trying to drive the thoughts away, silently praying to whatever could be listening that he didn't, wouldn't start turning fur-real on the long way home. That would not end well. No. The sound of his own footsteps followed him. A twit snapping making him jump like a startled deer. Until he realized there was only him and himself for company. Nobody else, but shadows moved, crawled, followed him until he was forced into a jog just to stay ahead of them. And when they kept up, stalking him so openly that he made an all out run. Sprinting for home. Running as fast as he could, away from the thoughts that burned like fire inside his skull, and even faster still as his back arched and fur erupted down his spine. Muscles bulged, his head felt like it was being split open. Jimmie screamed. For his sister, for his parents. For it just to end. Author's Note: Hey guys, sorry for the sllllow updates, and the rambling that sort of occurred in this chapter. I've kind of lost touch with the flow of this story and I'm just trying to get a feel for it again. Anyway, let me know what you think.[Chapter 7] \"I don't think we should have just left him there.\" Brook said quietly. It had been a long silence since the sudden drop off. When Bo graced her with nothing more than a look in the review mirror, Brook tried again. \"I get it. He was a dick and made a dick move.\" She started, \"but..\" \"No you don't get it, ok?\" Bo interrupted sharply, his foot planted firmly to the floor. \"I…\" he snarled and glared at her in the revision mirror again. This was hard to say. He felt stupid, and somehow…bad for telling Brooke like this. \"I…\" \"If you're trying to break the gay to me, Bo, don't worry. I kind of already knew that for a while.\" She smiled at him through the mirror. \"Jimmie didn't let the cat out of the bag on that one.\" Well, that was an unexpected shock to the system. But before Bo even had time to recover from this, Brook suddenly unclicked the seatbelt and, much to Bo's protest, shifted herself into the front passenger. Scaring the wits out of the driver as he tried to focus on both the road and telling Brook that she was raving mad. \"Don't you know I'm speeding?\" He demanded, slowing the heck back down to just above the limit. He gave the girl a bewildered look and turned back to the road, bewildered expression still in suite as the trees turned into houses. \"You're such a chicken.\" Brooke joked as she clicked the belt on and fiddled with the radio. Then, to Bo's disappointment that worried look crossed her face again. The same one she'd given him in the back seat. \"I still don't think you should have left him there.\" She said to the radio. \"How's he going to get home?\" She shot Bo a glance. \"He's got legs.\" Bo replied coldly. Brook looked at him. \"It's like an hour from there back to his house.\" She said factually. Bo narrowed his eyes, but didn't say a word. He'd not taken the turn off towards his street. Choosing instead just to follow the road. He was too angry to stop drive. Besides, now he wasn't even sure what to do with the night. Brook watched the necessary road fly by and disappear behind suburbia before turning her attention back to Bo. \"I didn't know Jimmie was homophobic…\" The word sounded strange coming from her. \"He isn't…or wasn't…\" Bo's rage filled expression shifted to one of hurt confusion. \"At least I didn't think he was.\" Then he was angry again, \"But clearly I was wrong.\" \"Maybe you're not.\" Brook replied, touching Bo's leg. Bo glanced down at her hand. \"I don't know, but Jimmie…didn't seem himself. I think….\" Bo let out a huff and tightened his grip on the wheel. \"He was real worried about his sister… maybe she had an accident or is in hospital or something.\" Brook offered, \"I mean… with what happened to his parents, I can kind of understand if he'd freak.\" Bo just grunted in response. \"He said he was sorry.\" Bo mulled that over for half a block. \"You think his sister's that sick.\" Bo said. They had slowed right down to cursing, heading without realising it in a tangled way almost back in Jimmie's direction. \"I don't know.\" Brook said honestly, \"Jimmie is one of the sweetest guys I've ever met… aside from you of course\" She tagged on when Bo gave her a look, \"and this just seems so out of character.\" Bo couldn't argue with that. Jimmie was, well, there was a reason why Bo came out to Jimmie. Two actually, the first was obvious: Jimmie was one of the sweetest guys Bo knew and Bo, well, Bo kind of liked him a little more than the local priest would have approved. At the same time; Jimmie was one of the sweetest guys Bo knew, and earlier that night Bo had felt that even if he was rejected on the doorstep, they could still be friends. Because Jimmie was just that cool. Half an hour ago had not been cool. But Brook had made a point which was unfortunate, as it put a damper on his fantastically bad mood. \"Alright.\" Bo muttered defeated. \"I'll drop him back home.\" Then he grinned at the passenger, \"But you owe me a slushy.\" \"Scouts honour.\" Brook replied, giving Bo a mock salute as they returned from whence they came.

Sure, all wa"},{"Movie":"Omen","Title":"And they meet again","Author":"piercedbutterfly","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8281000","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \" Now kids, this is Lucas. He's new at class. Say hello to Lucas.\" As the children said what the teacher obeyed, the blond boy examined the classroom. All the children were smiling-a new classmate is always fun. Except a girl in the corner. She was staring at Lucas with her big brown eyes. She knew everything. Lucas didn't get scared. What could he do to him anyway? \" Lucas, the only empty seat is near Delia, over there.\" The teacher said and showed the girl. Since Lucas sat near her, he knew they would be something worse than two simple enemies. \"Hey George!\" I shouted and hugged my boyfriend. \"What are the plans for tonight?\" I said. He didn't speak, thinking. \"I think we should go to the fair. But not alone.\" He answered. \"What do you mean?\" i was really confused. \"Why don't you take your best friend and I can take mine.\" \"Double date?\" I asked. \"No. Not likely.\" I sighed. \"I don't know if Delia likes the fair.\" \"Come on Roxxi! You can convince her!\" \"Why do you want a double date?\" \"First, it's not a double date and second, I'm gonna bring Lucas with me whatever in God's name happens, so…\" I answered me. I started laughing. \"You're unbelievable.\" At the fair I walked with Delia in the crowd. We were supposed to meet George and Lucas at the roller coasters. \"You'll see, George's friend is nice.\" I said to Delia, who was paler than a ghost. \"What's his name again?\" she asked. I tried to remember it. Shit, I never remember that name! \"I don't remember.\" I admitted. \"Then how do you know he is nice?\" \"George told me.\" \"Why do you believe whatever he says?\" \"Delia stop it!\" I shouted. She laughed. This might have ended up to a fight if George didn't appear in front of us. A blond boy was behind him. \"Hey girls!\" he said. \"Delia, this is Lucas.\" Immediately, I felt like things froze for a second. Delia stared at Lucas. He starred at him. \"Do you know each other?\" I asked. \"Yes. We were classmates in junior high.\" Lucas explained without leaving Delia from his eyes. I smell exes I thought. The train or whatever this thing where you go up and down is called was fun. I sat near George in font. Lucas and Delia sat three seats behind. \"What was that?\" I asked. \"I tell you what it was. They know each other, they dated, but they broke up because one of them cheated the other one.\" \"Who cheated who mister 'I-can-see-the-past'?\" I joked. \"Delia cheated Lucas.\" \"No, way. If Delia doesn't like a guy, she breaks up with him.\" \"And, seriously, do you think Lucas could cheat on a girl? Like, what is that? The joke of the year? And how do you know Delia was like that always?\" I sighed. \"You are right. Maybe they weren't a couple. Or maybe they broke up with no reason and now…\" I turned back. Delia was looking at the left, Lucas at the right. \"Yeah, someone cheated.\" I ended up to the conclusion.[Chapter 2] \"The train was fun\" I said after a ride. \"What's next?\" George looked around. He's look stopped at a pink building at a shape of a heart. \"Oh, no. No Joseph, not train of love. Please no.\" I whispered, hoping Lucas and Delia didn't hear me. \"Come on, what can possibly happen?\" he said. I didn't feel released. \"Guys, what about Train of Love now?\" I asked Lucas and Delia. Lucas frowned. Delia seemed disgusted. \"I don't take no for an answer guys. Come on.\" Joseph said. They both looked like: Who do you think you are? But, they agreed. I believe in miracles. As we got in the train, I realized we were alone. Me and Joseph at the front, Lucas and Delia behind us. It was quiet. A stupid love song came out the megaphones and little pink Cupids started to fly around us. The walls were decorated with hearts, big and small. Uh, why did we agree anyway? I was so bored in there. So did a pigeon which had entered somehow the place. And a raven. Weird. I was about to start snoring when I heard a splash from the back. Joseph and I turned around, to see an empty boat where our friends sat a while ago. \"What the heck-\"I started. We started get panicked, but then we heard something from the front. The pigeon and the raven were fighting with each other. What the hell s going on here? \"I don't know!\" Joseph shouted. Did I say that out loud? Before I could say anything else, I saw Delia's hand holding the boat. Her one eye was purple. \"Delia what-?\" Joseph started but then we saw Lucas getting in the boat using his one hand, the other one seemed like broken. \"Guys, what happened?\" I asked. \"The boat moved like insane and then it drop us down.\" Delia explained. \"As we were trying to get back up, we got hurt.\" Lucas continued. \"For God's sake!\" I said. \"Get up out of here!\" I shouted, noone knows to whom. But I was sure there were microphones and cameras in there. But silence answered me. Even the pigeon and the raven had stopped fighting and they were standing there quietly, but ready to fight again. \"God…\" Joseph mumbled. \"Hey guys, come to our boat. They other one's shit.\" We helped them get to our boat and thankfully after some minutes we were out. \"Excuse me, can you tell me were the nearest hospital is?\" I asked him. He didn't answer to me because Delia pulled me back. \"What are you doing?\" \"You guys need to go to the hospital.\" I explained. \"No, we don't.\" Lucas and Delia said together. Then they glared at each other like they hated themselves for that. \"Things can happen, okay? It's no big deal.\" Lucas said. I sighed. \"Nice idea, stupid. 'What can happen?' These were your words!\" I shouted at Joseph. \"We'll never gonna trust you again on where to go.\" I added half angry half joking \"No, I'm sure he's not gonna say any idea to the future.\" Delia said. Lucas glared at her. \"Don't even think of-\" \"Don't even think of what?\" Joseph asked. Lucas turned to him. \"Nothing.\"[Chapter 3] Lucas' POV I went to my house after an hour. Seeing noone was there I walked out and went to the nearest church. Saint Paul. I opened the door. It was empty. \"Father. Help me.\" I mumbled and started to pray. Delia's POV Dad wasn't home when I arrived. Neither did Alexander. Exhausted, I took a warm bath. Then, I examined my eye. Darn son of God did a nice job. I walked in the kitchen to get some ice. As I picked the ice up, I saw something to my hand. The three sixes. 666 Why were they in my hand? I sighed and with the ice on my eye, I started examining it. It seemed it was there for years. But that wasn't possible. Lucas' POV I finished my pray two hours ago. I got up. My hand didn't hurt. Not at all. I smiled. \"Thank you Father.\" Back to my house my mother was waiting for me. \"Lucas, are you alright?\" she asked me. I nodded and she smiled. \"Then get straight to bed. You look so tired. We will talk about it first thing in the morning.\" \"There's nothing to say mother. She appeared. So did her brother.\" Delia's POV \"Delia?\" I heard an innocent voice. I opened my eyes. Alexander was back. Without a word I checked his hand. He didn't have the mark. And instead, I did. You are the one Delia. A voice said in my head. I got up. I was the one who will beat Christ. Not my brother. Me. I.[Chapter 4] Hannah'POV The next day I walked out of the classroom. I was still confused by what happened yesterday. I just didn't feel like Delia's injuries were accidental. I mean, I saw them. I listened to what they said- or what they didn't. It is obvious they hate each other. I tried to find Joseph. He's class was empty. I called him. He didn't answer. Where are you? I sent him. Great. Now I'll be alone for the rest day. Delia didn't come to school that day. She was ill. But Lucas wasn't. I was sure Lucas' arm was broken. But today he was fine. I sighed. My imagination drove me crazy. Maybe his hand had a bruise of something. The boat was broken. They were exes. It was just a coincidence. Everything is a coincidence. Relaxed, I walked to my locker. When I opened it, a raven was staring at me. It seemed familiar. Way familiar. Then, a white pigeon flew in my locker and started fighting with the raven, which left. The pigeon gave me a look, like saying 'It's all right'. And it flew away. I shook my head. A pigeon gave me a look? A pigeon ? Hannah, you should see a doctor. Immediately. Before you think that they were the exact same pigeon and raven from yesterday. What the hell?[Chapter 5] In girls' bathroom, I tried to think. How can they be the same birds anyway? They followed me? And if yes, why didn't I see it before? And why was it staring at me? Does that have to do with Delia and Lucas? Where did that come from? And why Joseph is not answering? Oh God. I opened the faucet. Then closed it again. I've cleaned up my hands three times just in case some one comes. It was useless. My phone rang. I opened it. I had a message. Sorry I didn't answer, I'm at the school nurse. Joseph I closed my phone and put it back to my pocket. What happened to Joseph? I looked at myself in the mirror. My brown hair was a real mess. I decided to forget the birds for a while and grabbed my brush from my bag. Joseph shouldn't see me like that. \"Joseph?\" I gasped. We were at a silent corner to speak. He's white face was full of bittings. His black hair where uncombed. His black eyes were red. His clothes were cut. \"What happened?\" I asked. \"You won't believe me.\" He answered. I sighed. \"Trust me, I will.\" \"Ravens attacked me.\" I frowned. \"What?\" \"See? I told you, you wouldn't believe me.\" \"No, no. I believe you.\" I said, shaking my head. \"Can you say me details?\" \"Well, I was walking at the basketball field, when some ravens got close to me. I didn't pay attention. But then they started to bit me and I fell on the ground.\" \"And…?\" \"You won't believe me.\" \"Come on Joseph!\" \"A pigeon.\" \"A pigeon what? What did a pigeon do?\" \"Nothing!\" \"What do you mean nothing?\" \"A pigeon just came close to me! And the ravens left!\" he shouted. What the hell? Now, Hannah, is that a coincidence? \"Why are you staring like that?\" Joseph asked me. i shook my head. \"A raven was at my locker a while ago.\" I answered. \"And two birds, a pigeon and a raven were at Train of Love yesterday.\" Joseph sighed. \"I believe it's just a coincidence.\" \"That's what I'm telling to myself all day Joseph! But, how?\" \"I don't know Hannah. I don't know.\"[Chapter 6] \"What do you mean 'no'?\" Me and Delia were returning to our houses after school. It was a perfect time to ask her about the party. \"I mean I'm not coming to your Christmas party tomorrow!\" she said. \"Why?\" I asked. \"Because I imagine who is gonna be there!\" she shouted. \"If you mean Lucas, ok he will be there! But there will be a lot of other people. You won't have to even talk to him.\" I replied. \"Also, we both know I am not a Christian!\" she said. \"So? It's a party! You don't have to be a Christian to come. Come for fun.\" I answered. \"Secondly, I doubt that there are gonna be three people who will celebrate because Christ was born in there!\" I completed. She remained silent, and then sighed. \"No.\" Delia mumbled at last. \"I'm not coming.\" \"Ugh, come on! Do it for me!\" I begged. \"I'm not gonna celebrate Christ's birth for noone!\" she shouted. We remained silent. When we reached her house, she left without saying goodbye. What a weird girl I thought and then ran to my house. I was late. Two hours before the party. I was alone at the living room, waiting for Joseph to come at help me decorate the place. I was still thinking about Delia. I'm ok, you are not a Christian. But. First, show some respect to the other religions. Second, I can't believe she will stay all alone at her house in Christmas day. Also, what the hell is wrong with Lucas? Maybe they do hate each other but that's not an excuse for leaving me without my best friend today. I decided to talk to her these days. I heard the bell. \"It's open!\" I shouted and Joseph came in. \"Ho-ho-ho!\" he joked and kissed me. \"How are you?\" \"Fine. You?\" \"I feel better now that I see you.\" \"Shut up!\" So, we started decorating. We moved the furniture, we decorated the Christmas tree and some other stuff I am bored to do alone. After we finally finished. We had 45 minutes to get ready. I took my shower and chose a fine blue dress for tonight. My phone rang. It was Delia. \"Hey girl, wanna hang out with me tonight?\" she asked. \"Um, wish I could, but tonight is the party.\" I answered. What was her game anyway. \"Uh, yeah, the party. You're gonna leave me alone then?\" \"Don't act like a cry baby you can still come you know.\" I said. \"No way.\" \"And I'm not leaving the party in no way too, so unless you come, we will talk tomorrow.\" \"Let me ask you a question: You don't have any other friends. Who is gonna be in the party?\" What the hell? \"I have friends you know. I invited twenty people. Well, eighteen without you and Joseph.\" \"Seventeen.\" \"Why?\" \"Do you really count Lucas in?\" \"Stop it okay? Lucas is a good guy.\" \"That's the point!\" she shouted and closed the phone. We really need to talk tomorrow. I don't care if she hates Lucas, or she is not a Christian or whatever. The point is my mood is horrible after every time we have a conversation like that. And I don't want her ruin my happiness.[Chapter 7] Lucas sat at his chair. Delia stared at her new classmate. \" Where are you from?\" she asked him. \" New York.\" \" We are on New York.\" \" We came back with my family. Why are you so interested?\" \" Children! Be quiet back there!\" the teacher said. \" Sorry miss.\" Lucas. \" Sorry miss.\" Delia joked. He did nothing. \"Don't even dare to touch my brother or you will be really sorry.\" Lucas turned at her. \" I don't know what you're talking about.\" He said. \" Yeah right. If you dare, try to kill him with your 'holy' hand and I'll show you what my hand can do.\" \" I don't want to hurt you or your brother. In fact, I don't know what you are talking about right now.\" Lucas answered without any anger in his voice. Delia furious hit his leg with hers. Lucas did nothing. She tried again and again, with no result. In the end, she gave up. Lucas smiled. \" Evil always wants to threaten good. But it can't. It never could, can or will be able to beat good. Evil fails\" He said staring at his book. Delia stared for a while at him, then angry gave up for the second time. \" Again and again.\" Lucas completed. The girl, her eyes glowing from anger took a pencil and draw at line in the middle of the desk. \" Your space\" she said showing the right. \"My space [Lol. Myspace] . Don't dare to touch mine.\" Lucas touched the left one with his finger. Again and again. \" Never think that I'll be afraid of you.\"[Chapter 8] When the last person left me house, I realized that the party was fun. Actually, it was amazing. I thought that I wouldn't have such a good time without Delia, without my best friend. Way weird. It was like I didn't need her that night. I danced with Joseph the most of the time. I shouldn't say this but ok: I had a wonderful time with a bunch of other girls. I could say I preferred them from Delia. I felt horrible. But thankfully, I felt like that after the party was over. The next morning I woke up at twelve because of my mum. I turned to the other side to win some more minutes of sleep, but my phone rang. For a moment I thought it was the alarm clock so I turned it off and threw it to the ground. But then, I realized I didn't have an alarm clock in my phone. I almost fell form my bed to reach my mobile. I had a call from Delia. Oh God. I called her back. \"Why don't you want to talk to me?\" she asked. \"Oh Delia I'm sorry I didn't want to do that.\" \"Why did you do it then?\" \"If I said that o thought the ring was the alarm clock would you believe me?\" \"No.\" \"So, I thought it was the alarm clock.\" \"Whatever?\" \"Exactly.\" \"So, do you want me to pass by or you have another party?\" \"Shut up!\" \"You know what? The only thing I hear from your mouth lately is 'shut up'!\" \"I'm sorry. But you act like…\" \"Like what?\" \"Like a baby. You make me feel horrible because you didn't come to the party.\" \"If I act like a baby, you act like my mum! And you are not my mum! And you know what? It's not my fault that you feel like shit everytime I say no 'kay?\" I didn't find anything to answer. \"Anyway, do you want me to pass by from yours?\" Delia asked. It was useless to continue the argument. \"I just woke up. Why don't we do something later? In the afternoon maybe?\" \"'Kay. I'll call you later.\" She answered. \"All right. Bye.\" I kept holding the phone near my ear for a while, hearing the beeps before I fall .asleep again.[Chapter 9] We decided to meet at the cinema. I really didn't know what movie was on, but what does it matter? We weren't going to see the movie anyway. \"So, why are you so mad again?\" Delia asked me after we bought our tickets. We were the only people who would watch the movie. We sat at two seats in the middle. \"You know Delia, sometimes… I don't know, you make me feel sad when I do stuff without you. And I think you want that.\" I said calmly. [Is there such a word?] \"What makes you think that?\" she asked. It was obvious she didn't give a shit about what i was about to say. \"You know, before the party, you called me and asked me if I want to hang out with you, when you knew that I was having a party. And no, I know you didn't forget I was having a party.\" I explained. She sighed. \"Well, if I promised not to do it again, what would you say?\" For one more time, I could see she was bored with the conversation and wanted to finish it. And I knew se would win so… \"I'd say 'ok! That's a start.'\" I said. \"Great!\" she cheered and gave me my coffee. When he gave it to me, I saw something in her hand. \"New tattoo?\" I asked. She sighed again, acting like she didn't want to know about it. \"Yeah, kinda…\" \"What is it?\" She showed it to me. They were three 6's. \"Oo-kay, that's weird.\" \"Yes, it is.\" \"You've changed your mind? You don't want it anymore?\" \"Kinda.\" \"Whatever. When you decide, tell me.\" I said. She kept staring at the screen, which was turned off. \"Hey, you can get over it you know. It hurts, but I don't think you have a problem.\" I said. \"The movie started.\" She answered. \"What? You think you will hurt?\" \"Hannah, just watch the movie already.\" \"Whatever.\" We didn't talk about it the rest of the night.[Chapter 10] Some boys were talking outside junior high school, about first day at 7th grade. Among them, a shy boy, with brown hair and green eyes, was new at town so he didn't talk much. His name was Joseph and was talking at Lucas, the first friend he had at his new school. Some meters from there, a bunch of girls were gossiping. They all looked fascinated about their new school. Expert from Delia. She was staring at Lucas and his new good friend and her eyes looked like flames. Literally. They must die, both of them. Then she turned at her best friend Hannah, when she heard that her best friend said \" The guy with the green eyes near to Lucas is cute.\" ' Too bad' Delia thought 'she has to die too. And I just thought I was having fun with her. Oh well.' She was sure her thoughts will come true one day. And they did. Well, not all of them.[Chapter 11] Suddenly, it was May. Really, I don't how fast the next months passed. Like it was yesterday when me and Joseph invited Lucas and Delia at the fair. Like someone was messing with time or something. When I told that to Joseph, he said that I was going to miss high school and I realized how fast time goes when you don't want something to end. Well, he had a point, although, I hate high school. Delia didn't say anything. Wow, lucky me, what a nice best friend I have. These months she became more and more serious. She never had time for anything. She spent more time alone, disappeared somewhere in this world. Well, not far from five or so blocks anyway. Another weird fact was that Lucas was about to get killed like five times in one day. Two times, a car popped out of nowhere and almost hit him. One time, some weirdoes shot us stuff. On fire. Screaming \"Die!\" and other lovely words. But Lucas wasn't hurt, or burnt or anything, although he was closer to these guys. The other time, another weirdo shot us with a gun. Ten times or so? I don't mind. But we had no scratch. And how can that be possible? We were the people who psycho was trying to shoot. Or maybe… \"Why would a person shoot us?\" Joseph asked me. I had no idea. We were at my room after hanging out with Lucas. I was lying at my bed and he sat at a chair. \"How about the kids? Or the cars?\" \"Okay, do you realize how many cars exist in New York city? And a lot of kids these days are having fun doing things like that.\" He explained. It was true. \"Just, lots of unexplained happened lately.\" \"Like?\" \"You know, in October, with the pigeons and the ravens?\" \"It was one pigeon and a lot of ravens.\" \"Whatever. Then, everytime we go out someone does something like shooting us bullets or things on fire and stuff.\" \"Hey, cool down! That's happening like a week or so.\" \"Three weeks.\" \"Two weeks.\" \"Fine. You know what I mean.\" \"Yeah, but may I ask you how you connect this with the birds.\" \"They happened this year.\" \"Thank you very much.\" He said ironically and came to sit near me at the bed. \"I mean, hello! This year happened a lot of things!\" \"Like?\" \"I turned eighteen, it's out graduation year, it's our second year of relationship, the fair got lot more interesting….\" He explained. \"I don't know but since October, you know, when we got at the fair with Lucas and –\" I said and suddenly froze. I just had a really…interesting feeling that… \"What's the matter?\" \"What if I told you that had to do with Lucas and Delia?\" \"Okay, I can handle just one more of your theories.\" \"It started at the fair where Lucas and Delia were met. After that, the birds appeared.\" \"Yeah?\" \"People don't attack us when we hang out. People attack us when we hang out with Lucas .\" \"Okay, you're telling me that Lucas and Delia is the reason we were almost killed by cars and syches?\" \"Didn't you realize that Lucas was never cut or burnt or hit?\" \"Your theory is crazy.\" I sighed. Maybe it was. But why there was a voice in my head saying \"You are right.\" ?[Chapter 12] \"Hey Delia.\" \"What to you want?\" I was talking to Delia outside her door. She was angry I was interrupting her from something she wouldn't tell me. \"Just to hang out. It's been time that you don't answer my phone or you're busy. Do you wanna hang out?\" \"Sorry, I'm busy.\" \"Busy with what?\" \"Busy with something I can't …wait, come in.\" she had idea. Oh my God. Nothing was changed at her house from the last time I saw it. Except that there were like four dogs in the living room. They were just the dogs I hate: big, annoying, and noisy. These kind of dogs attack me when they see me (that's why they are annoying), but these dogs just looked at me. With a deadly look. I would think I'm crazy for thinking that but I was starting to think animals can talk to you. I followed her to the basement. There was only a statue of Jesus Christ, in the cross. Delia spit at it. \"Why do you have this in your basement?\" \"Because I hate Jesus Christ. And I want you to follow me.\" \"Follow you?\" \"Do you remember Damien Thorne?\" \"Yeah. Kinda. He was supposed to be the Anti-Christ.\" \"He was. And I am his daughter.\" \"What?\" \"Are you deaf?\" \"No, but…what are you talking about?\" \"I have to continue what my father left me to do.\" \"Which is…?\" \"Kill Son of God and make all people believe in our true master, Satan.\" \"And…what do you want from me?\" \"To follow me. To be my helper. Something more than a disciple.\" \"How can I be your helper anyway? I don't even agree with your ideas.\" \"It's not that hard to be my helper. Do it like Dean did.\" \"Dean?\" \"Didn't you say you know about Damien Thorne?\" \"Yeah, but not the details. Who is Dean?\" \"His helper. You should know his work. I'll inform you lately.\" \"And you said Jesus Christ is on earth. How come noone knows about him?\" \"Well, people don't, but you do.\" \"No, I don't.\" \"It's Lucas, Hannah.\" \"Yeah, right.\" \"I'm serious. I know you have been attacked when you were near him. I organized these attacks.\" \"Why?\" \"Because he is Jesus Christ!\" I was silent for some moments. Then I shouted. \"I am not helping you!\" \"Yeah, right. Hannah, you can say no. You can't leave.\" \"Really? Watch me!\" I said and run upstairs, then out from the building. The dogs barked and almost broke the windows behind me. I didn't care. The only thing I was thinking is that the things about the Christ and Satan might be real and that that Dean sound way familiar.[Chapter 13] I called Joseph. \"Hello?\" \"We need to talk.\" \"Okay. Where and when?\" \"In 10 minutes, at the church.\" \"Okay. See you.\" \"Wear your cross.\" \"Okay.\" Joseph didn't come. I waited for half an hour. I couldn't believe he left alone now. But I couldn't stay there for much longer. I should tell someone. There was noone at the church, except some old ladies. I got into the confessional. After a while the parson got in. \"I don't really know if I have something to confess.\" The parson remained silent. \"An hour ago, she told me that she wanted me to follow her to Satan's road. She thinks she is daughter of Satan…no, she thinks her father was the Anti-Christ and that she has to spare Satanism to the whole world. I don't know why I'm here. I just needed to talk to someone and I was so freaked out to go home or anywhere else but here. I'm sorry if I wasted your time, goodbye.\" I said and got out. I saw the parson near me. \"Who is your friend?\" He seemed serious. \"Her name is Delia York.\" From his face I realized that he knew her. \"So it's true. She is the one.\" What was he talking about? \"I need to talk to someone before I talk to you again. Until then, beware!\" he said loudly. I saw Joseph getting in the church. \"Sorry I'm late but Deli found me and…\" \"She told you about…\" \"Satanism.\" \"What did she tell you?\" \"Not much. I left as soon as possible. Again, sorry I was late.\" \"It's okay.\" I said and hugged him. \"She's horrible.\" I cried hard. Joseph got me out of the church and drove me home. Then, he helped me go upstairs to my room. Although I couldn't think of that, I slept almost immediately.[Chapter 14] The next thing I remembered, I woke up to the hospital. I was alone, my bed and my chairs near me were empty. I tried to move, but I realized my left hand was on a plaster. So did my left leg. What the hell happened? The door opened. My mum got in. \"Sweetie! You are awake!\" She came close to me and hold my right hand. She was smiling, but I could see she was crying before. She had a scratch at the chick. \"What happened?\" I asked, confused. \"Darling, don't you remember anything?\" she said and started to cry again. She kept crying when dad and Joseph got in. After I hugged them-as much as I could-I asked again. \"After Joseph left you home, you were acting like insane. You scratched the doors, you were screaming. When I got in, you tried to hit me, but you only managed to make this scratch because you…you fell down the stairs. All the stairs…\" my dad said. I looked at Joseph. He shook his head. We both had an idea of whose fault is that. After an hour, my parents left and I was alone with Joseph. \"That girl's insane.\" Joseph mumbled. \"She's not insane. Everything Delia told you it is true.\" \"How do you know?\" \"When I reached the church I got to the confessional. I told the parson the entire story and he seemed…how to say it? He seemed scared or something.\" Joseph remained silent. So did I for some minutes. Then a nurse got in and said that Joseph must leave. ","Summary":" \" Now kids, this is Lucas. He's new at class. Say hello to Lucas.\" As the children said what the "},{"Movie":"Omen","Title":"Promised","Author":"takara410","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9020103","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I do not own I woke like any usual day; I slowly walked down stairs to kitchen. The head chef Serena placed a platter of pancakes, scrambled eggs, sausage and a small portion of grits. To swallow it down with, I had no pulp orange juice. \"Morning princess.\" I smirked at the name \"You have been calling me that since I was little. You never use my first name.\" I say going through our routine conversation. She kissed the top of my forehead, while putting two plates on either side of me. One of with breakfast with meat, and a different one a vegan one. I'm not a normal girl, I live with Damien Thorn who controls Thorn industries, and is thinking of running for UK office. I only live with him during the school year; once it's over, I fly back to the US of A to live with Isaac though everyone calls him Eli. He does controversial films, not shocking he's the vegetarian. Eli is only here for today he needed a cast member, I love meeting them. \"Good morning Emerald ready for school? Think you'll pass your math teat?\" Damien asks while sitting down, and biting into a piece of bacon. I look at him \"My name is Gypsy.\" I say though I know conversation won't get anywhere. \"Gypsy is not an appropriate name, besides Esmeralda, your middle name is just as beautiful.\" He says in an affirmative tone. \"I like it, it's free.\" I say eating some eggs. I heard shuffling and something heavy drop. Eli sat down greeting us, it was a normal breakfast. My mom suddenly showed up, she was humming a lullaby she would sing to me when I was little. She turned around and jumped when she had seen us, putting her hand over her heart. \"Sorry I was lost in my own world.\" She smiled at me, though the love did not meet her eyes. It's because of her sickness, that's all. \"Morning mom, I hope you slept well.\" She nodded her head, a little to slow. \"I did, should you not be getting ready for school. That project you have to finish.\" I jumped up \"Your right, can you drive me?\" I asked desperation in my voice. Her sickness started to show again, she started stuttering and shaking at first slow but then it got faster. \"Gypsy, I'm sure your mother would love to, but as you can see she is just not up for driving.\" Damien said I nodded my head, getting up and getting my stuff .while wiping my eyes. I smiled as I finally got to school Sebastian was there. I think he's cute. He's tall, has long hair that can be tied into a braid, and his eyes are blue. Damien said bye, I think not sure. I ran no jumped out the car saying bye to him. I walked up the stairs \"Hey Sebastian, did you finish the homework for Mrs. Prange?\" He shook his head \"I could not answer questions two and three on page thirteen. I took out my homework , giving it to him \"Here, Nathan helped me with it.\"He smiled thanks and started copying it. I had a boring day of school, though it was a weird time at near the end. I was stopping a known mean girl of scaring an American girl. She smiled at me \"Thank you.\" I heard Amber's friend say \"You know she's the queen.\" I gave them a look, so conceited but ignored it as I helped her up. \"I'm Gypsy, your name?\" I say picking up her things. She thanks me \"My name is Kaitlin, I'm new here.\" She says with a smile on her face. \"I know, you're the one other American here.\" I say smiling She looked at me with curiosity in her eyes \"Who's the other.\" \"Me!\" I say smiling at her, while jumping at her, which I think spooked her. \"Your American?! I couldn't tell, your accent is just like theirs.\" She says looking at me strange. \"I know, I have been going to schools here, since I entered second grade. I learned it so no one could bully me.\" \"That's smart, doesn't it carry with you when you go back home?\" She asked as we walked towards her locker. \"It does, but I only stay for the summer, so it's not like I have actual friends back in the states.\" I admitted with a sad tone, thinking of all my fast friends \"Well I could really use some friends, without a British accent.\" She admitted with a smile as she closed her locker, her bag in her hand. I smiled \"Awesome, let's go to my locker so I can get my stuff and write down my stuff for you.\" She nodded her head, they were now heading for her locker, and Sebastian was leaning on it. I smiled at him \"Hey, Sebastian how was class?\" He nodded his head \"I was the only one who got it right, thanks.\" He gave me my homework back as I opened my locker. I noticed Kaitlin was trying to hide behind me, which was strange since I was even smaller than her. \"Don't be shy.\" I say looking at her, but she just looked to the ground. I looked to Sebastian; he got my signal and took out his hand \"Sebastian.\" She took his hand \"Kaitlin.\" I smiled \"Awesome were now friends.\" We walked to the doors; I was shocked that Uncle Nathan was there to pick me up. Damien must have a board meeting. I looked to Sebastian \"Video game night?\" He looked at me \"Sure, not sure I can sleep over though.\" I nodded my head \"Cool.\" She grabbed me by the side \"Why are you going in a limo?\" She didn't whisper it silently enough so Sebastian answered. \"She lives with Damien Thorn, head of Thorn industries. Her family is close to him so they live in the house.\" He said looking to the limo. \"Wow, I didn't know you were rich.\" She said he was suddenly going back into her shell. \"No I am not, he is. My family was just coming here and he offered a place to stay until we could find our own place since they are good friends. We just ended up staying in the house. He admitted he likes it since the house would be less vacant.\" I said grabbing onto her arm, hoping she would understand \"We did the same with my uncle, before we moved here.\" She aid knowing where I was coming from. I smiled; I heard the horn honking which made me stop smiling as the driver got out the car. \"Miss Emerald, we must hurry to beat the traffic!\" I sighed turning to him \"Alright Shane.\" I drawl out the A, I hugged her bye and left, Sebastian already in the car. I wave bye as we drove off, Nathan smiled as he drank his coffee. \"Did you make a new friend Gypsy?\" I nodded my head \"Yep think were going to be great friends and I can have some girl time.\" Sebastian looked at me \"You invited me to play video games.\" I shrug my shoulders \"It` not like I could have invited her over just like that.\" I say with a snap. Sebastian looked at me \"You invited me to play video games.\" I shrug my shoulders \"It`s not like I could have invited her over just like that.\" I say with a snap Nathan looked at me interested \"Your new friend is a girl?\" I nodded my head \"Yep, cant` wait to have girly sleep over's and talk about boys.\" I say with a smile on my face. They both seem a little uncomfortable, but then again their guys. I looked out the window, as we passed through town. \"Mom is getting better.\" I knowingly avoid their looks. \"That's good angel.\" Nathan said sipping his coffee. I nod my head, I touch the necklace my father put on me when I was little. I wish he was here, though he passed away when I was six. \"Shane, we need to stop at a game shop.\" I say pulling down the middle window. \"Aren't you a little old for dolls, miss?\" I laugh sarcastically \"You know they have a new dress for peppermint patty. I just have to get!\" I say with desperation in my voice. He laughs \"Alright I am heading to the shop.\" I smile and sit between Sebastian and Nathan. \"So what games shall you two waste your brains on?\" Nathan asked as Shane pulled to the side of the curb. No press was here, which was great since, they loved to take pictures of me. \"A true classic a game of Cow and Chicken from the show cartoon network, along with Goo Zombies two.\" I say bouncing up and down as we enter the shop. I smile at the owner and search for the games, while Sebastian got sodas, it may be Tuesday but we are acting like its Friday. Nathan was leaning on a wall, finishing up his coffee \"Nathan they got Mario classic!\" I say holding it up for him to see \"Get it, and I'll play with you.\" I nodded my head adding it to the others. I put them on the counter with the sodas; Nathan gave me the credit card since someone called him. I smiled as the owner put them in a bag \"Back in thirty days.\" I nodded my head as we left the shop. A flash blinded me and soon others did. I just heard shouting, and the clicking of pictures being taken. Sebastian pushed me through the crowd, and I felt Nathan's hand guiding me. I soon heard gunshots and some one yelling while saying the word \"God!\" Sebastian pushed me into the car. Shane stepped on the gas, \"What the hell happened!?\" I asked freaking out. Nathan opened a soda, telling me to drink it slowly. I did but I wanted answers. I repeated my question through sips. \"I'm not sure, I need to tell your mothers and Damien that you're all right.\" I nodded my head, Sebastian was holding my shoulders.[Chapter 2] I do not own Eli was driving Esmeralda to school. \"So how do you like Mrs. Morgan?\" He asked looking at her through the rearview mirror. Esmeralda who was four but very bright for her age, thought about her teacher. \"She's nice and she gives me things that other kids don't have.\" He looked at her \"Oh? Such as?\" \"One time she gave me sugar cookies instead of oatmeal cookies like everyone else. Another time would be for nap time she let me have a different cot other than blue.\" Eli turned the car, to park it \"Well I'm sure you deserved them princess.\" He got out the car and took her out of her car seat. He carried her all the way to her classroom. Her teacher smiled when seeing her \"Hello little Esmeralda are you ready to learn?\" She nodded her head; Eli put her down, saying goodbye and getting a hug from her. Esmeralda ran to the other children and began playing tag with them. Eli left but not before making sure to say goodbye. When all students arrived the teacher, Mrs. Morgan had all the kids sit in their assigned seats. She began teaching them numbers and colors first in English, Spanish then in French. Esmeralda she noticed had trouble with French but not Spanish. Morgan noticed that along with other students, after the lesson she let them play. Later in the day, she heard a knock on her door, and went to answer it. She smiled when it was Mr. Damien. He nodded his head as he entered the class room. She went to collect Esmeralda's things as the little girl ran to him. He noticed her hair was in one long braid instead of down. He picked her up ready to ask Morgan about the hair but she got to it first. \"We were watching a Barbie princess movie, all the girls wanted their hair like a Barbie.\" \"I will be bringing some movies other than that garbage to watch.\" She nodded her head giving him the backpack. \"Esmeralda is getting better with French words and phrases; Spanish is not so well on.\" He nodded his head \"Thank you say goodbye Esmeralda, time for lunch.\" Damien put Esmeralda in her car seat, and got in the driver seat driving downtown. He took her to a buffet, ignoring the looks as he put her down in a safe place. He checked and saw that his guards were outside. He got a plate and put mashed potatoes, chicken nuggets and macaroni and cheese. He put it in front of her, and had her stop drinking her sprite. Esmeralda smiled and enjoyed her lunch, Damien just enjoyed his coffee. She looked at him \"Want some?\" She held out a chicken nugget. He shook his head waiting for her to finish, he got jello for her when she was done. His phone began to ring; he answered it while picking up Esmeralda leaving a tip. \"Time to go princess.\" She grabbed another chicken nugget on the way out. As he drove to his office, he looked at her through the rearview mirror. \"Are you sure you don't want to eat at a different place?\" Esmeralda thought about it \"Can we go to McDonalds?\" He frowned \"You know that's something both Eli and I agree not to eat.\" She frowned \"Why not they have apples, that's healthy!\" \"The only thing that is healthy, besides you would still be thirsty from the little juice carton.\" He parked in his parking spot, right between his uncle and cousin car. He took her out of her car seat offering to carry her but she fussed saying she did not want to be a baby. He let her walk but held her hand the entire time. They took the elevator to the top floors and she let go of his hand running to his cousins. \"Uncle Nathan!\" Nathan stopped talking to see her and smiled \"Can you take me to McDonalds?\" She asked hugging him He looked at her strangely \"Did you not have lunch?\" \"She did, but she keeps asking for McDonalds.\" Damien answered, looking at her a little mad. \"I told you it's unhealthy, plus very fattening.\" Jonathon walked up to them \"Sir's the meeting is about to start.\" They nodded at him, Damien looked at him \"She already had lunch; she might want to take a nap. I left her school stuff in my car. Eli will be picking her up. He said all this while buttoning his jacket, picking up Esmeralda and putting her in the male secretary's arms. He kissed her on the forehead and left with his cousin. Jonathon sat down at his desk taking out toys and giving them to her on the floor.[Chapter 3] I do not own I ran into our house wanting to hug my mom and have her pet my hair. I instead ran into Damien who picked me up ,petting my hair. \"Are you alright baby girl?\" I nodded my head, a little upset. He carried me up the stairs into my bedroom. I was shocked that Eli was here. He took me out of Damien's arms , kissing me on the forehead. \"Are you alright ? Did you get hit?\" I hook my head \"No I'm fine… why did he do that?' They looked at one another, that's what I was looking for ; they knew. \"The police are saying that he is a person who had gone mad.\" Damien aid walking over to me \"How about you rest, wake up and we will talk some more.\" I nodded my head ,Eli put me down on the bed. \"Your not to much of a shock to dress yourself are you?\" Eli asked with a smile. I shake my head \"No I'm fine you can go.\" Damien whistled Angel and Muffin came running in. They hopped onto my bed, licking my face. They said their goodbyes, and Damien closed the door. I got up changing in a light blue tank top and shorts that were really revealing. Maya the head maid bought them, saying I should show off. I don't care for the shorts though. I went in my bed and fell asleep feeling my dogs at both my sides. I was soon being woken once I felt a wet tongue on me. I looked to see Muffin, my Chihuahua upset.\" Muffin I'm up you can stop.\"I pushed him away to go clean my face. Angel followed my heels while Angel stood at the doorway. Angel watched me interested as I cleaned my face. I changed clothes again to jeans and a red shirt. I was brushing my shoulder length hair looking at it, I think I want to dye it. Some one interrupted my thoughts by knocking on the door. The dogs ran to It Muffin ran into the door actually. Angel stopped a good foot away. I picked up Muffin kissing him on the head as I opened the door. Malachi was at the door; only bad news would come out his mouth. I smiled at him none the less. \"Your mother, Damien and Isaac have agreed that you shall go back to America with Isaac and myself.\" I shook my head after he said all three agreed, the only times they agreed was when I had to go to bed early or a punishment. I pushed past him ,running to Damien's office. I busted in, shocked to see Jacob but not Nathan. Damien was looking at me shocked I was here. \"I'm not leaving.\" He stood up \"You will only be gone for a few days.\" He walked to me \" I want to stay, I am not leaving!\" I shouted folding my arms. \"It was a random attack right, nothing more I want to stay here.\" He sighed sitting partly on his desk. \"Gypsy I am gad you did not sleep later.\" Eli said hugging me from the back, I stopped frowning at Damien to smile at him and hug him. \"Did you have to get a flight back?\" \"No, I was getting on the plane just as the news report came on. I got a ride back knowing that is where you got video games.\" I nodded my head but was confused he said that his flight leaves early. What has he been doing all day that he was getting a flight back after school ended? \"Where's my mom?\" I looked between the two. \"She was in the game room last I saw.\" I thanked him running to the game room. I opened the door to see Sebastian playing my game Lollipop Chainsaw. \"I was playing that!\" He paused the game to turn around \"You were stuck.\" He turned around playing. I walked to the side of the couch \"No, I wasn't.\" I said folding my arms. He gave me \"yeah right\" look as I looked to mom; she was playing a card game at a table. I sat in the opposite chair \"Mom I'm up.\" I say slowly and carefully. She continued playing her cards, but stopped laying them down, even petting them. I looked at them in envy. She stared at me \"That's wonderful go get your father I would like to speak with him about your birthday that's coming up.\" She went back to her cards , humming a rhyme that she would sing to me. I touched her hand \"Mom dad isn't here.\" She stops playing to look at me , without showing affection to the cards. \"Of course not, he found out what you were.\" She said with a sad sigh and then smacked me to the ground. \"Mom!\" I shouted in pain, Sebastian jumped over the couch, pulling me off the floor with muscle I never knew he had. He had us run out the room and locked the door. I heard my mother screaming and banging the door. Sebastian had us run down the hall to the living room. Damien and Eli had stopped reading and watching TV to run to me. Malachi who was playing pool with Shane had came and grabbed Sebastian. \"What happened !\"They all shouted directed to the each of us. \"Mom attacked me but I'm okay thanks to Sebastian.\" I say holding my cheek. \"Attacked you !\" They all said I felt my anxiety coming up bit I swallowed it down. Damien must have noticed so he looked to Sebastian. \"Tell us what happened, and where is she now?\" \"Gypsy was talking to her mother, who thought it was her birthday. Their was no change in voice or tone when she had slipped, like usual. I came to Gypsy's aid a minute to late. I grabbed her and took us both to safety. As I locked the doors she was thrashing about.\" Sebastian said without hesitation. \"Go and give her another dose of medication and call the doctor.\" Eli said Malachi left instantly while Shane left only when he received a nod from Damien. My cheek felt better , so I stopped holding it \"She said dad died because he found out what I was.\" I said weakly not wanting to cry, but could not help it. I felt arms around me, I was so glad to have Sebastian by my side. I turned to hug him, though I was sad that it was Eli. He wiped away my tears \"Your mother's sickness was just talking ok, nothing is your fault.\" He said I nodded my head smiling at him. \"Let's go put ice on that cheek.\" He took my hand as we walked I stopped which made him look at me \"Sebastian your staying the night, right?\" He only looked to Damien, who thought about it \"It has been along stressful day, plus his parent are most likely expecting him home.\" I frowned looking at him with sadness. \"Please Damien fix this, I want him to stay please.\" I begged needing my friend He sighed as if it was a troublesome thing \"I will see what I can do.\" I smiled and looked to Eli who looked mad. I swung his arm to get his attention, he smiled at me and we continued to walk to our hospital like room. I have never been in an actual hospital room, except when I was born. He waited with me until Doctor Lacey Springley came in; she was in her sleeping clothes. \"Who is the patient?\" She asked prepping herself. \"She is, along with her mother.\" Eli said watching her carefully. Doctor Lacey inspected my cheek \"All she would need is some ice on it.\" The breaking of glass was heard, Eli grabbed me and held me so could I could smell him. He smelt like outside. Shane and Malachi were holding my mother and putting her on the table. Eli had me escorted out and took me back to the living room, where Damien got off the couch to hold me.[Chapter 4] I do not own I didn't go to school the next day , I slept in it was enjoyable. I had cereal for breakfast while Serena shook her head at me as she whisked something. I was going with Damien to work, Eli had to really leave since filming would begin. I dressed in black jeans, red tank top with a black bra.I put my hair in a high ponytail and wore awesome black boots. Damien stared at me as I walked down the stairs. He was so still it was unnatural. I looked at my outfit, it wan't innapropriate ,I mean my chest I a bit bigger than most girls. \"Is something wrong?\" He shook his head swallowing \"No, you just caught me in a moment.\" I smiled running out the door ,it was great not a dark cloud in the sky. I followed Damien as we walked into the garage. He picked a black classic car to drive. We got in, he waited for me to buckle my seat belt before he honked the horn for Shane to start driving. As we approached the gate papparazi had cameras separated though and got the papparazi confused. I turned on the radio ,though as I flipped only talk shows were on. \"So what's going on?\" Damien asked as I looked out the window. \"I met the one other American,the last day I was able to go to school.\" \"Oh really, how do they seem?\" He asked interested I thought about it \"She seems sweet but very shy, she even hid behind me as she talked to Sebastian.\" He turned left \"Well it's a good thing she has a friend like you, to bring her out of her shell.\" I nodded my head thinking back to her being bullied. Damien must have noticed and asked me what was on my mind. \"Well the mean girls friend had reminded us that Amber was the queen.\" As soon as I said that the car abruptly sopped. So glad I was wearing my seatbelt. I looked at him puzzled \"She was bullying you?!\" I shook my head \"No,her friend was saying some remark.\" He started driving again \"You would tell me if you were getting bullied right? I mean you could even tell a teacher, you know. They will help you I assure you.\" He said with sincere in his voice. I nodded my head \"Of course.\" I looked out the window watching as buildings and people passed by. We finally arrived at Thorn industries, I have spent a lot of time here. I nodded at the guards and secretaries; they smiled back though I have to admit I did not recognize all of them though they knew me. Maybe they aw me running around here when I was younger and they just got up in rank. Damien had me stay at his office, I watched tv or played on his computer. Not a lot of players online, since they were in school; where I should be. It was boring in his office after a few hours of watching youtube videos.I left his office and walked around ,I smiled and people smiled back at me. I saw Jonathon,I ran hugging was my babysitter whenever I had tocometothe office and that was a lot. I loved his hugs \"Hi princess how are you?\" He asked \"Fine,yourself?\" I asked as he started to walk so I walked to \"Well I am not doing so great, the muffins we always get,came over stocked. So now we have blueberry, cinnamon and banana flavors and others in a couple of baskets in room 10a.\" I took the hint headed for the office room. I grabbed two chocolate, and one blueberry. I headed for Damien's office. I sat in his chair, putting my feet up and watched Scooby doo. I don't know when I fell asleep but when I woke up I had Damien's jacket over me.I looked up to see him on the computer clicking , and typing , the TV was off.I wiped the sleep from my eyes \"How was the meeting ?\" He stopped to look at me \"It went well what do you want to do?\" He asked getting up ,I got up handing him his jacket. \"I want to walk.\" He nodded his head after putting on the jacket and buttoning it. We walked outside to the guardian, it was located in the middle of the building. It wasn't that big but it had a fountain, and little guardian. Eli had helped me plant it. It would really be enjoyable if I could feel the suns ray' right now. \"Damien can I ask you a question ?\" I ask with uncertainty in my voice. \"Of course anything.\" He says sitting down on the bench,I kick at the floor absent mindly. \"Well… theres a chool lockin ,I was wondering if-\" \"No !\" He said with a tired knew I won't give up on this. \"Why not !? Why do you say no to everything I enjoy ? I need friends !\" I shouted \"You have friends ,what about Sebastian ?\" He says staring at the fountain I sigh \"I would like more than one friend , I would like to have a girlfriend.\" His eyebrows raise \"Yes,someone I can talk to about boys and makeup.\" I say with happiness \"Can you not talk about such things with Sebatian?\" He asked I think he was serious \"As close as we are, I am pretty sure he does not want to talk about how cute boys are, or about the curse of a period.\" I say folding my arms. I notice Damien stiffen uneasiness of me saying period. \"See even you don't like to hear it,I say looking and pointing at him. He looked at me with guilt. \"I would be okay with you having over some girls.\" I rolled my eyes, folding my arms. \"Not at the house, I want to be somewhere.\" I sat down beside him, leaning on his shoulder \"Please let me go ,I will go to bed early for two months and anything else.\" He sighed \"You'd make a horrible lawyer.\" He ruffled his hair \"If… I let you go security will be doubled and I will call you every hour ,and you will answer me. You will stay with Sebastian's, when you feel tired you will call me immediately.\" He said with a no debate tone. I jumped up \"Your letting me go! Yay ! Yay !\" I started jumping up and down He got up and held mein place \"Do you understand?\" I looked him in the eyes, nodding my head \"I understand.\" Jonathon ran into the garden \"Sir the house is calling you.\" I watched Damien grab the phone and talked,I grew with worry. I watched as he hangs up \" What's wrong ? Is mom okay?\" He ignores me and walked to the door. \"Damien!\" I yell grabbing onto him \"Is my mom okay ?!\" I ask scared He looked to me \"From what I know yes, now let's go.\" We ran to the parking lot, regretting the muffins now. We hopped in and drove off, I saw two police cars as we got out. I didn't see my mom with the maids or even Serena. I ran under the tape , I heard Damien call my name. My dogs were running by my side. I ran up to the third floor and went to her room. She was on the bed, she wasn't sleeping though. I saw dried blood on the side of her head. I started to shake her , \"Mom, mom please wake up! \" I say starting to cry slowly. I heard a floor bed creak, I wiped my tears \"Damien help she's not-\" I stopped it was a priest he had knives in both his hands. As he walked closer to me he started saying something in Latin. I was not sure what he was saying. Angel growled and bit his hand, he then pounced on the man and growled warningly. Muffin peed on his face as I shook my mother. The cops came with Damien behind them. He picked me up bridal style, kissing me on my fore head. I heard the dogs bark so I called the dogs and they followed us. Damien put me down in the backseat, and slid in himself.[Chapter 5] I do not own Damien followed the doctor he watched the baby as the nurses weighed her. \"Are you sure she is mine?\" His eyes never left the child \"Yes, three digits of six on her head in the same spot as yours.\" He said \"Show me.\" The doctor went in the room, holding the door for his lord. The nurses looked at the man, he wasn't her father. They go a look from the doctor not to say a doctor picked up the newborn showing her his head. \"666…she is mine after all.\" Damien washed his hands and began to pick up the child. \"Don't you dare contaminate my future wife with your filfth.\" Eli said walking into the room. Damien turned to him \"If it isn't my bastard of a brother.\" He walked to him \"Your mistaken , this beauty is my wife.\" He picked her up , showing the 666. Eli looked at his seer, \"You said this is the one.\" \"It is my lord.\" She took out a small book turning to a page. \"See a girl who is born at this time and day. I even drew her mother .I just couldn't draw her face or any feature. Anytime I try I draw black smudges, crows and dogs.\" Eli looked at Damien \"It seems that not only do we share the same father but also also betrothed.\" Damien nodded his head \"Though history shall repeat itself.I will not only get the world but the girl.\" A nurse did not like how they were talking about the newborn. \"Gypsy.\" They both looked at her \"What?\" She walked to Damien taking the bundle from him. \"Her name is Gypsy, now I must take her to her mother.\" Damien looked at her shocked \"She's alive?\" \"Yes, now I must go.\" They followed her until she went into a room. They watched as the woman gave Gypsy to a tired looking woman the father thanked knew she would talk about them. He opened the door while knocking. \"Congratulation to the happy couple.\" The father stood up, shaking his hand. \"Thank you and you are?\" Damien smiled \"Damien Thorne I was entranced by your beautiful sleeping child. I had to come and meet the indulge me the girl's name.\" They looked at one another \"Gypsy.\" He grimaced that really was his wife's name, he smiled as someone knocked on the door. \"This is just a little something from me to you.\" He motioned for them to come in,one had a basket for parents and another filled with baby things. \"Please enjoy them.\" Damien noticed that the bundle was opening her eyes \"She's awake.\" Gypsy's first thing she saw was Damien's eyes. Damien felt a strong connection when their eyes met. The strong force left when her mother turned her away. \"Well I shall leave you to feed her, goodbye little Gypsy.\" He headed for the door. \"You can stay , I do not intend to breast feed.\" Eli came in \"I'm sorry for coming in unannounced but Madame please breastfeeding is healthy and natural for newborns. Please do not let your child not have a fighting chance against illnesses.\" Tracy looked at him, while looking at her child. \"And you are?\" Eli walked to the edge of her bed \"Elijah and I am filing around this area. We are taking a break. I inform parents how healthy it is for newborns to drink breast milk. If you are uncomfortable with it, people sign up and will be happy to do so for you. I can not express how you need to give your daughter a fighting chance against colds and viruses. Now if you excuse me.\" He looked to the nurse \"Miss if you could answer me a few questions in private.\" Damien exscued himself as well,he walked to the lobby where his followers surrounded him. \"Is she yours?\" \"Yes, the second her eyes connected I knew. Plus she has 666 on her head same spot as mine.\" He walked outside getting into the care after a bodyguard went in first. They talked about Elijah and how they would have to compete for her affections .His followers were shocked that her parents were alive and well. They talked about how they would have to keep her safe from enemies hands, especially in her weak state. \"We will have to make sure you are educated in baby care.\" Lydia said getting off the phone. He nodded his head not wanting to knowhow to change a diaper but will sadly have to know. \"What about schooling?\" \"Why would I care, she's a newborn?\" Damien asked concerned \"Not for long, we need to make sure we have her life sorted out.\" Lydia said He nodded his head he was glad his mate ha finally made it to the world. But reality set in, she was here. All he knew about girls was that they crowded around him all the time and liked to spend money. He sighed and was so happy to be at the hotel. When he opened the door from his bathroom, he saw parenting books. He sighed and picked one and began reading the book.[Chapter 6] I do not own \"I'm home !\" Gypsy yelled closing the door and locking it like her mother taught her. She stopped when she saw two men in the living room and not her mom in sight. \"Who are you ?\" She asked though she wasn't scared of him. \"I'm Elijah and this is Malachi, how was school Gypsy?\" She was shocked he knew her name, but did not show it. \"How do you know my name?\" He smiled \"I have known you since the day you came into this world. I gave you a black cat on your third birth day.\" His tone may had him seem like he had to think about this, but when it came to her he knew. He enjoyed the shock of recognition on her face. She yelled \"Be right back\" they heard her little steps run up the stairs. \"It seems she has not been dated by darkness.\" Malachi said looking at where she stood last. \"Yes, so it would seem.\" They soon heard growling, they looked to see a small dog growling at them. They looked at the dog. They knew who it belonged to, not only by its aura but by its eyes. Gypsy ran to her room, tossing her bag onto the floor and grabbing Salem. She ran down the stairs but stopped at seeing their frightened faces. She walked over to the dog looking at him mad. \"Angel go to my room.\" The dog ignored her and continued to growl, taking a step towards them. She clapped her fingers, yelling the dog's name. She stood like her mother, hands on her hips. \"Angel go to my room, or you will be sleeping outside!\" That got the puppy's attention; the dog whined and walked over to his mistress. He licked her hands and headed for the stairs, he gave the men one last growl before leaving. \"I'm sorry about Angel.\" She walked over to them, showing the cat plush. \"You gave me Salem?\" Elijah nodded his head \"Yes, I did what an interesting name, you gave him.\" She nodded her head \"I got it from the show Sabrina the teenage witch.\" She started petting the cat until they heard her stomach growl. \"How rude of me, we must get your snack ready. Malachi stay here.\" Gypsy grabbed his hand and they went into the kitchen. She asked him to get her princess bowl from that cupboard. As he did so she got the milk from the fridge. He helped her put it on the table; she told him where to get her spoon with a straw. She pushed the chair to the counter, climbed onto that and reached for the cereal. Eli grabbed the spoon, but slammed it onto the table to grab her. \"Gypsy please do not do that again, I don't want you to be hurt.\" She nodded her head; he saw a necklace that she was holding tightly. He put her down \"Did your father give you that necklace.\" \"Can you get my cereal?\" \"Who gave you the necklace?\" \"Cereal ?\" He took a breath slowly getting irritated. \"Please tell me who gave you the necklace.\" She looked at the necklace she did not realize she was still holding it tightly. \"Uncle Damien gave it to me.\" She said shrugging, wondering what the big deal was. \"Uncle Damien…Uncle Damien?\" \"Yes, he's been around forever. He said that when I get older that I will live with him.\" \"Live with him?\" Eli repeated his brother truly moves fast. \"Can you get my cereal now?\" \"Yes, of course.\" He grabbed the cereal but stopped to look at it health information. \"What are you doing ?\" She asked stepping onto his shoes, to try and see what he was reading. \"The health value.\" She nodded her head \"That's smart.\" He smiled looking at her, petting her head. \"Yes, and your mother was not smart in buying this.\" \"Yes, she was cookie crisp is gluten free.\" She said hands on her hips looking at him mad. He rolled his eyes \"I have something that will taste better.\" He went back to the living room, he went to Malachi grabbing the bag he was holding. He took out an orange and went back to the kitchen cutting it in half and putting both pieces in the bowl. He went over to her, picking her up and putting her in the chair. She trusted him so she took a bite. She finished and washed her hands. When they walked into the living room she took a good look at the man with red hair; before laughing. Both men looked at her \"Something funny Gypsy?\" She nodded her head, holding herself \"Yes, Malachi he reminds me of the princess from the movie Brave.\" Eli was only familiar with the film, since he saw the advertisement of the movie already on DVD. He laughed \"I think he'd look pretty silly in a green dress.\" She nodded composing herself, she looked at the clock on the wall. She jumped up \"Daddy's coming home in two hours.\" They were shocked the girl knew how to tell time \"What grade are you in?\" \"I'm in kindergarten.\" She said proudly The door opened a woman with long black hair ran in, picking her up. \"Oh sweetie you're not hurt are you?\" She hugged her, holding her tight. The girl laughed at her \"No Ellie, I'm not.\" Ellie smiled at this until she saw who the guests were \"It's you.\" They looked at her just as coldly as she was looking at them. Gypsy felt the tension but she did not know why they were acting like that. She heard a tired sigh and the steps of high heels and the slamming of the door. \"Ellie, why weren't you helping me with the groceries? It is hard to carry two cardboard bags and walk in pumps in the rain!\" Ellie sighed \"I advised you not to wear them.\" She picked up the little girl, not smelling her favorite cereal but fruit instead. They liked her puzzled expression \"I gave her some orange, she only finished half of it.\" Mary dropped the wet bags on the table, she was mad that one ripped open. She walked into the living room. \"I told you he could watch her.\" She said in a tone. Ellie looked at the woman with a glare.[Chapter 7] I do not own Eli helped Gypsy with her homework though he realized he just needed to check it. He wasn't surprised and quite proud of her, not one answer wrong. Her father, Richard had turned down the sports game and looked at Eli. \"So what brings you here?\" \"Well, we are opening up farmers market building here.\" He said truthfully \"What's a farmers market?\" Gypsy asked stopping from coloring to look at the adults. \"A farmer's market is where farmers and other people who have made things by their own hands come to sell their products. It is usually held outside.\" \"I want to go.\" Gypsy said smiling and standing up looking to her dad. Richard looked at Eli \"As long as my company will sponsor you I see no reason we shouldn't all go.\" \"We must make sure the weather is right, we would not want Gypsy sick now would we?\" Elli said walking in. She looked at the girl's paper and put it in her bag. She picked up the smiling girl sitting in a chair and began brushing her hair. \"Dinner is done.\" Tracy said walking into the living room and taking Gypsy off her lap. \"Elli how many times must I remind you, she is not a baby she does not need to sit on your lap.\" They both walked in the kitchen. \"Until she says she feels like a baby I shall keep doing so.\" Parents were at the head seat, Elli and Gypsy on one side and Eli and Malachi on the other. Gypsy thanked Elli for cutting her meat for her but did not touch it. Instead she stared at what Eli and Malachi were eating. Elli noticed she was not eating \"What's wrong?\" She whispered \"What's that?\" Her being a child she did not get whispering, so she said it loudly. Eli and Malachi laughed. \"This is a vegan dinner, while your family eats meat, Malachi and I do not .I live in a place where no one eats meat, or eats a lot of food you eat.\" He said She moved her head to the side, \"That's strange… is it good?\" He smiled \"Yes, would you like to try some?\" She nodded \"What are you eating?\" \"Grilled salad, it's just like a normal salad but you heat it up, plus corn on the side.\" He said looking from her to her mother \"Tracy, can you get me another plate, I do not want the food to touch the plate.\" She nodded getting up. \"Why not?\" \"Vegan food, is pure and comes from the ground, while you add different things to meat for it to cook. You may not like it if you taste the sauce from your steak on you r lettuce.\" Tracy put the plate in-between them and he thanked her putting some of his salad on her plate and gave her some of his corn. \"Thank you.\" \"You're welcome, princess, enjoy.\" She took a bite, hesitantly, but smiled while chewing it. Eli looked at Ellie smirking the entire time. Once dinner was over they moved back to the dining room. \"Do you eat like that everyday where you live?\" Gypsy asked sitting on his lap. \"Yes, we do how about this tomorrow I will make you something that every vegan child loves for breakfast.\" She smiled, Elli frowned looking at the clock \"Bath time !\" She sang out getting up. \"Aww, but I want to stay with Eli and Mala.\" She said not being able to say his whole name. \"No she is right, darling you need your rest.\" He kissed her on the forehead. 'Plus it is getting late, you need to get to your hotel.\" Ellie said with a smile. \"Don't be ridiculous we have plenty of room for you both.\" Tracy said taking Gypsy \"Follow me boy's I will show you to your rooms.\" They did with a smirk. Gypsy was the fifth person to wake up after her dad, Malachi, Eli, and Ellie. She walked downstairs with her slippers, though she was never cold. She held Salem in her hands as she walked into the kitchen, she smiled when she saw a plate of pancakes. \"Good morning Gypsy.\" Eli said putting another stack of pancakes on the table, this time chocolate chips. She smiled walking into her chair, she crawled into it \"Good morning Eli , Malachi.\" Malachi nodded, he was sipping coffee with soy milk. \"Good morning Ellie.\" She said to the woman who was cutting her pancakes and putting scrambled eggs and sausage on her plate as well. She started to eat and looked to Eli who sat down \"Can I live with you ?\" Ellie started coughing on her toast; she had to hit her chest. \"You want to live with me?\" He asked ignoring Ellie`s choking \"Yes, over the summer, like I do with Damien, I want to raise a piggy!\" Eli nodded his head \"I would be okay with that, just ask your moth-\" Gypsy ran out the kitchen but came back to get Salem saying \"he was still eating\" and then ran upstairs. Damien and Eli were both at her kindergarten graduation they were driving to Damien's rented house. A lot of people where, he invited every kindergartener in her class. Damien had just shook hands with another business associate, and walked to Tracy only to find her perplexed and worried. She grabbed onto him \"Damien, I can't find Gypsy.\" \"What! What happened?\" \"I don't know, I turn my back and she is gone.\" She put her hands into her face, ready o cry. Damien cringed there was only one woman he actually cared about crying. He noticed people were staring, she was making a scene .He ushered her to Ellie who had her head down in shame. He walked to his followers, who stood up , he gathered their children who were near or Gypsy's age. \"The queen is missing , whoever finds her deserves to be her best friend now go!\" The children nodded running off. Eli who knew Damien didn't have anything vegetarian except cheese and cracker shook his head. Though he saw Tracy running from Ellie he decided to follow her. She stopped at a bench, so he walked to her. \"Are you alright Tracy?\" She shook her head \"No Gypsy ran off for some reason.\" \"What, I will go help find her.\" She got up to grab him, but he already left. Eli went to his followers who were having a miserable time. \"I need Samantha, Rebecca, Victoria and Victor!\" The kids hurried to him \"Gypsy ran off now find her and you will be her best friend.\" The children nodded their head and ran off. Gypsy was in the playroom, huddled in a corner. She remembered what the old woman said \"A demons whore.\" She didn't what that meant but she knew she spit at her so it mean something bad. She froze when she herd children running and playing some game. She liked all the people here, but she didn't know anyone, she remembered their names but she did not know them. \"Hello?\" One boy said \"She hugged herself even more, she was always tiny. She heard him walk even more; if he walked past the door he would see her. She is hard to miss since she is wearing a red dress, and the walls are green. She closed her eyes as the person walked. She felt them tap her on the shoulder. \"It's Gypsy right?\" She looked up nodding her head. The boy looked at her, wiping her eyes with something silk. \"Why are you crying?\" \"Someone's grandmother called me a horrible name?\" He looked out the window; no one here would dare insult her. \"Who?\" She shrugged her shoulders \"I don't know she spit at me and called me—a demons whore.\" \"That's horrible, do you want to watch a movie with me?\" He said looking at the TV She nodded and he helped her up, wiping away her tears. \"Thank you, I'm Gypsy.\" \"I'm Sebastian, what movie do you want to watch ?\" \"Hunchback of Notre Dame!\" She said smiling He put it in \"So who's your favorite character?\" He asked sitting on the couch with her. \"Esmeralda !\" \"That's not shocking.\" \"Really, why not?\" She asked tilting her head to the side. \"Well your name is Gypsy, and Esmeralda is a gypsy plus you're both really pretty.\" She smiled \"Thank you.\" \"Your welcome, does Uncle Damien watch this with you?\" She looked at him \"Damien is your uncle to?\" \"Yes, I better go tell him I am in here.\" He said sliding off the couch \"Oh no I better tell my mom the same thing.\" He waited for her \"We can tell them together.\" He grabbed her hand and they ran outside. \"Mommy!\" Gypsy yelled, Tracy picked her up. Sebastian nodded to Damien. \"Gypsy what happened?\" Damien asked, taking her out of her mother's arms. \"A mean lady said I was-\" Sebastian nodded his head for he to go on, Damien looked between the two of them. \"Was a demon's whore.\" Tracy covered her mouth, and Damien searched the crowd. \"Is she still here?\" She shook her head \"No, she left after spitting at me.\" She wiggle din his arms. \"Can we go back to the movie?\" \"Movie ?' Her mother asked looking to Damien, who had no clue. \"Yeah me and Sebastian are watching Hunchback of Notre Dome.\" He put her down , smoothing out her dress \"Yes you may and it's Sebastian and I.\" She thanked them and left.[Chapter 8] I do not own \"I can't believe I am saying this about you, but I am jealous.\" Gypsy said throwing the controller on the bed. She scooted back, so she was lying on the pillows. \"Why?\" Sebastian and Kaitlin asked pausing the game \"You two get to go to school, I haven't been in three days.\" She said groaning. \"You do realize you are living in the Hilton hotel right?\" Kaitlin asked looking around the room, and moving her arms. Gypsy smiled \"Yea, it's just that, the manor was my home. It's burned; I don't get to see the normal staff that I grew up with. My mother is still in the hospital.\" She said eyes watering. Kaitlin went over to her; she had Gypsy put her head on her chest and started petting her hair. \"It's okay, everything will be good. The house is being rebuilt, and I 'm sure they will come back once it's complete. You did see your mother yesterday right?\" Gypsy nodded her head, wiping her eyes \"Yeah.\" \"You're just feeling homesick, that's all.\" Gypsy nodded looking to her \"Yeah, your right.\" She got up \"Hey what's today?\" \"You don't know what today is?\" Sebastian asked with a smile \"I haven't gone to school, it's not like I need to know what day it is.\" Gypsy said smiling and getting off the bed. \"It's Friday.\" Sebastian said \"Would you like to know the weather as well?\" \"No, I haven't been out of the house- hotel and have you been sightseeing?\" Gypsy asked looking to Kaitlin \"No, but Gypsy, Mr. Damien said –\" \"He's says that every day and then leaves.\" \"He has a job.\" Sebastian said looking at her \"Quit being a party pooper!\" Gypsy said throwing a pillow at him; he smirked when he caught it. She stuck her tongue out. Kaitlin laughed, they acted just like brother and sister. Gypsy smiled at her friend, she wasn't becoming shy anymore. \"Alright, Sebastian out, we have to get dressed.\" \"We?\" They both asked Gypsy grabbed his hand \"Yes, we.\" She pushed him to the other room in her suite, locking the door. She looked to Kaitlin smiling \"Alright, what shall we wear today?\" \"I am already wearing something.\" She said standing up and doing a spin. \"True, but I know you want some of my girly clothes.\" She walked to her closet and opened it \"Pick some out.\" \"Gypsy-\" \"I cannot hear you, I am taking a shower.\" She said while going into the bathroom. Kaitlin looked at the clothes; she smiled when she saw a white short dress with frills at the bottom. She put it on the bed, and found bracelets that were black. She took those out and put them beside the bed. She waited for Gypsy to be done, she looked out the window. It was so beautiful; she jumped when she heard knocking at the door. She answered it, she smiled and backed away. \"Hi, Mr. Damien.\" He smiled \"Hello Kaitlin, where is Esmeralda?\" He looked around the room \"She is taking a shower; actually I don't want us to get in trouble. Would it be okay, if we went out?\" She asked looking at him \"For an hour, at least?\" \"Out ?\" \"Yes, Gypsy wants to leave any way, I don't want us to get caught so could we go somewhere?\" She asked hoping he wouldn't get mad. Damien laughed \"Normally, she just gets Sebastian to leave. You are a good influence on her.\" He took out a credit card, and gave it to her \"Make it three hours, if it's one she will just be hyper.\" \"How do you know that?\" \"I helped raise her.\" He started to leave, but saw the white dress out. \"Since when does she wear white?\" \"She said I could wear some of her girly clothes, she doesn't want your money to go to waste.\" Kaitlin said hoping he wouldn't get mad. \"At least someone is wearing them.\" He was about to leave, when he stopped \"Kaitlin are you aware of the school lock in?\" She nodded \"Yeah, it's all the school can talk about, besides Gypsy.\" She said rolling her eyes. He looked at her with an eyebrow raised, \"The popular rumor is how she started the fire, for attention. I don't know her long, but she isn't one for attention.\" She said explaining her eye roll. \"Yes, that is true; tell Esmeralda I approve of you.\" He closed the door, just as the bathroom door opened. \"I live!\" Gypsy said smiling while holding her towel. \"So you watched Mulan again.\" Kaitlin said with a smile. Gypsy nodded walking to her closet, and then stopped. \"I know I don't have an outfit like that.\" She said crossing her arms. \"I did pick out an outfit-\" Gypsy smiled \"Where?\" \"On your bed.\" She said pointing to the outfit. Gypsy ran over to it, nodding her head \"I like it, you will look great in it.\" She then looked at her shoes \"What size do you wear?\" Kaitlin was put off \"Oh um seven Mr. Damien-\" \"Oh good, we are the same size.\" Gypsy went to get shoes and found some black shoes with a little heel. She pushed them to Kaitlin \"Try these.\" She turned to get dressed hen Kaitlin stopped her \"Damien stopped by and wanted me to give you this, and say he approves of me.\" Gypsy smiled, hugging her \"Yay! Now we really have to celebrate.\" She started jumping up and down, she went to her laptop. She turned it on and went on Pandora; she got it to play Gentleman by Psy. She started getting ready while dancing, Kaitlin watched while putting the borrowed clothes on. She watched as Gypsy, went to her vanity and stayed still as she began putting on makeup. Gypsy looked at her sister \"Do you know how?\" She shook her head; Gypsy got up and moved her to sit in the seat. Gypsy smiled when the music changed to \"U can't touch this\" Kaitlin was shocked how she did the makeup, and how she was done. Gypsy closed her closet and looked to Kaitlin and held a thumb up. Kaitlin nodded and started dancing wither, Gypsy opened the door and smiled at Sebastian .He watched as the two danced, shaking his head at their silliness. He shook his head when they tried to invite him; he turned off the music, just as it was changing. \"Are we ready to sneak out?\" He asked smiling at them \"Don't have to; Damien said we can sneak out for three hours.\" Kaitlin said fanning herself. \"Awesome, let's go.\" Gypsy said while jumping. She let herself fall on the bed; she got off and grabbed black flats. \"Kaitlin, did you change?\" Sebastian asked looking her up and down. \"Yes, she did, isn't she awesome?\" Gypsy was putting the credit card in her Eeyore purse. \"Alright, we can head out.\" The three friends walked out the room, heading to the elevator. Sebastian pushed the down button \"Alright, so first you call your parents, girly sleepover.\" Gypsy said taking out her cell phone, and giving it to Kaitlin. Kaitlin called her parents, Gypsy and Sebastian talked to one another to not ease drop. \"Alright, thanks mom.\" She gave the phone back to Gypsy \"She wants to meet your guardian before she says yes.\" \"Cool.\" The doors opened and they headed out, they smiled at seeing their driver. \"Hey !\" They all said \"Good evening to you all.\" He said then closing the door; he got in and started the car \"Where to?\" He asked looking at us in the rearview mirror. They looked at one another \"Anywhere?\" Gypsy asked looking at them They nodded and he nodded his head, he took them somewhere to eat, and then they went to a museum. \"Look at that line; we won't be able to go in before we have to meet my parents.\" Kaitlin said \"This is where being the charge of a politician comes in.\" Gypsy said grabbing their hands and going in, they got stopped by a cop. Gypsy showed him her card; he apologized a lot and moved out the way. She smiled and they looked at the arts and played the games, they enjoyed themselves. They stopped at the cafeteria, they were eating frozen yogurt. \"Will Mr. Damien be able to talk to my parents?\" Gypsy nodded and \"Yep, since its Friday he come home early. It's because of a promise he made to me.\" \"Ok.\" Kaitlin said her worry gone \"We should go shopping next.\" \"Don't you have enough clothes ?\" Sebastian asked not wanting to shop \"Yes, but come on we need something for the school lock in.\"[Chapter 9] I do not own Kaitlin had picked a sleeping shirt that had flowers and came with white shorts. Gypsy had a tank top that came with pans. They switched bottoms; they went back to the hotel. They waited for Damien to show up, so they watched a movie. Damien came showered and dressed in a different suit and they went into the limo. Gypsy POV Kaitlin and I talked while Sebastian and Damien talked about business. \"That's a beautiful necklace, where did you get it?\" Kaitlin asked \"I smiled taking it off to show her. \"My father gave it to me.\" I put it in her hand. \"That's nice of you Mr. Damien.\" She said looking at him \"I am a family friend Kaitlin; I am more of a father figure to Sebastian. I leave that to Nathan.\" Damien said \"Where is he, he wasn't at breakfast or lunch.\" Gypsy said curious \"He had errands to run, he will be back tomorrow.\" Gypsy smiled, nodding 'So…did your mom or dad decide your name?\" Kaitlin asked giving the necklace back. \"Mutual agreement.\" Damien said dryly Kaitlin nodded \"Gypsy how have you been doing on your homework?\" Damien looked at the girls, Sebastian cursed mentally, his friend has been doing the bare minimum. \"Yes, Gypsy your friends have been and teachers have been giving you, your homework. Are you all caught up?\" Gypsy looked at all of them, opening her mouth only for nothing to come out a few times. \"Well, I…have done some, though some work I don't understand.\" \"What part?\" Sebastian asked with a smirk Gypsy gave him a look \"The assignments in math, and science.\" \"You have the other assignments done?\" Damien asked Gypsy nodded slowly, Damien raised an eyebrow \"After dinner we will go after your homework.\" He said sternly Gypsy nodded looking to the ground, Kaitlin looked out the window. \"Oh good were here.\"[Chapter 10] I do not own Gypsy nodded looking to the ground, Kaitlin looked out the window. \"Oh good were here.\" Gypsy looked out the window as well; the house was a nice Victorian style house. \"It's beautiful.\" Gypsy said as they stepped out the car. \"It's what I call home.\" Kaitlin said as they stepped up the stairs. \"Oh good, you're here.\" A woman in a light purple dress said hugging Kaitlin She smiled at Damien \"Hello,I am Angel torelli.\" She said shaking his hand \"Damien Thorn.\" He smiled at her \"Your house is very beautifal.\" He said as they came into the house. \"Thank you,though it is my brother's are narrowing down our choices for a home next week.\" She said lookign at her daughter's friends. \" Hi I'm Gypsy Esmerlada.\" She said having her hand out \"I'm Sebastian\" Angel smiled \"My daughter has told me all about you two,you helped her feel welcomed.\" Kaitlin blushed and muttered \"mom\" \"Angel what does your brother do?\" Damien asked after looking at the pictures of Jesus Christ. \"Oh he is retired from his orginal job,and he is doing work for the lord now.\" Angel said smiling. \"That's good.\" Sebastian said dryly. Angel nodded her head smiling at them. She jumped up clapping her hands \"I almost forgot, Kaitlin made us some delicious appetizers. I will go get them.\" She headed out \"What did you make?\" Gypsy asked walking up to Kaitlin who was sitting on the couch. Sebastian noticed how their shy friend seemed to change, in posture and eyes. He excused himself and called the muscle and told them where they were. He then went to Damien who said no to wine being offered by a servant. \"Sir?\" \"I know, you have your knives on you.\" Damien \"Always.\" \"Good, you will need them.\" Angel came back with a plate of food, \"Here they are delicious apple turnovers with cinnamon.\" Gypsy licked her lips and got one thanking her, taking a bite and nodding her head. Kaitlin smiled \"Glad you like it.\" \"Would either of you two want one?\" Angel asked \"I get migraines with sugary things.\" Damien said \"I have never had an apple turn over, I will try it.\" Sebastian said grabbing one, he took a small bite. Spitting it out \"Wow, sugar overload.\" \"Yeah! That's the best part.\" Gypsy said already finished her first one and getting another. \"Gypsy! You don't want to spoil your appetite, leave room for dinner.\" Damien said worried Gypsy who had jumped at him yelling at her slowly put her hand down. \"Yeah, I guess your right. I need to wash my hands, where is the bathroom?\" She asked with a sad tone in her voice. \"I'll show you.\" Kaitlin said standing up. \"I need to use the bathroom as well.\" Sebastian said following them. \"Do you want something else to drink or eat?\" Angel urged \"No thank you, I can wait for dinner.\" She nodded stiffly. Sebastian watched as his friend tripped on her own two feet. He caught her \"Oh thanks, Sebastian.\" She said though he nodded and helped her up he noticed she said it in a slur. He helped her up and Kaitlin showed them to the bathroom, Sebastian went in the bathroom with her. \"Sebastian!\" Both the girls said Sebastian went into his wallet and took out a needle \"Give me your arm.\" \"What! No, I'm not taking drugs!\" She said pushing him away only to fall Sebastian took off the cover and stabbed her with it. \"It's not a drug, its adrenalin.\" He whispered. \"I only gave you a little.\" He assured her. Kissing her on the forehead, he headed out the bathroom. Gypsy felt her heart pounding, and started jumping while washing her hands. She opened the door to see Sebastian and Kaitlin fighting. \"Guys! What are you doing?\" She asked as Kaitlin kicked Sebastian in the groin. \"What! You're supposed to be dead!\" Kaitlin said mad and shocked Gypsy couldn't open her mouth for a few times. \"What! What are you talking about?\" \"My God, stop pretending!\" Kaitlin yelled and hit Sebastian in the throat. He couched out blood and cursed. \"Sebastian!\" Gypsy yelled running to him only for Kaitlin to kick her. Gypsy looked at her crawling backwards \"Why are you doing this?\" Kaitlin rolled her eyes \"Oh please like you don't know who you are.\" She spit on her \"Kaitlin, why are you doing this?\" Gypsy asked \"Oh please, like you don't know who you are.\" She walked over to Gypsy \"Run Gypsy!\" Sebastian said taking out a blade Gypsy shook her head and went over to him, though he pushed her away. As Kaitlin came over to him, he stabbed her with the knife. He stabbed her in the arm; she screamed and dropped the knife. \"It's okay, you'll be safe, and we need to leave.\" He gritted out grabbing her, they ran out the hall to see Damien knock down Angel. \"Let's go!\" He yelled grabbing her arm and they ran out the house, into the car, just as they were leaving two cars came out. One car stopped and let them in and they left. Gypsy jumped when she heard the sound of gunshots, she grabbed onto Sebastian.[Chapter 11] I do not own Gypsy had taken a bath and was huddled in her bed,she was still in her were off and she was watching the news, while crying. \"Here we are at 7620 Wurst, at the Torelli home, were a terrible crime and daughter had drugged and attacked Damien Thorne along with his godchild and young do not know the reason why, when the two were being arrested they were shouting and raving incoherent words.\" The reporter said Gypsy started crying when they showed her ex friend and mother being wiped away the tears that were grimaced, not only did she have the adrenalin in her system but also a cure for the used the arm, it was so yawned again, as tired as she was and sore she couldn't her heart wasn't beating as fast as it was earlier. Someone knocked on her door, she went in her covers and closed her knocked again and said her name. \"Gypsy.\" They opened the door, it was her nurse maid came in and closed the door. \"Gypsy.\" She said softer and walking to the bed , she sat on the bed. \"Come on sweety, I know your awake.\" She was taking the covers off. Gypsy moaned and reached for the covers, her eyes still closed. \"Yes I am.\" \"Look at me, my little Emerald.\" Cara urged , Gypsy opened her eyes and looked at her. \"She was my friend, why would she try to kill me?\" She asked and began crying, Cara held her and started comforting her. Cara held her for an hour before having her look at her \"I do not know why she did that, but you still have all of us.\" Cara lied Gypsy smiled looking at her \"Yeah your right, thank you.\" \"I will always be at you side, my little how is that arm?\" She asked turning on the light. Gypsy showed her wincing as Cara was touching it, roughly. \"Sorry, emerald.\" She looked at it \"No bruising, just sore for awhile.\" Cara looked to the TV, shakign her head at the news. \"No wonder why your not asleep.\" She turned the channel to Sprout. \"Look Cailou is on something calming.\" She then picked up the phone \"I would like two cups of hot chocolate and send a bag of marshmallows with that as 13 C.\" She hung up \"Thanks for staying with me.\" Gypsy said smiling at Cara. Cara groaned uneasily while getting up \"I'm not staying, that was for you and .I came to calm you down.I know you don't want to eat anything though.\" Gypsy frowned at this. A deep knock sounded through the room, \"Come in.\" They both said though Cara's was happier and Gypsy's was came in with a black wife beater and black pants. \"Gypsy, I am sorry to keep you waiting, the police still wanted answers from me.\" He nodded to Cara as she walked out the she moved out the way as a cart with hot chocolate and marsmallows was on it. \"Here you are.\" The server said with a smile. \"Hopefully this will calm you down little queen.\" \"Thank you.\" Gypsy said with a smile and getting out of smiled when she saw her disney princess cup was being used. \"Thank the staff for me?\" \"Of course.\" The server said with a smile, and then looked to Damien scared. \" , your hot chocolate with no marshmallows in it.\" Damien nodded \"Put it on the table.\" The server nodded and did so, he turned to get the marshmallow bag but saw Gypsy holding the bag in one arm and shoving the big marshmallow in her mouth. \"Have a good night.\" He bowed and left closing the door. Damien looked to Gypsy, she was finished with her big marshmallow and began sipping her drink. \"Come on get into bed.\" He said going on his side the right. She nodded going to the left and putting her drink on the table and climbing into was careful not to have her things fall on the she began to get comfortable she felt Damien put an arm around her and had her move closer to him. \"So what are we watching?\" He asked with an eyebrow raised \"Cailou, since it's calming.\" She said sipping some more hot chocolate before going back to her spot. Damien smiled when she went back to her spot in his he was mad that she would not be with him. \"Damien?\" Gypsy asked looked at her \"Yes, what's wrong?\" \"I don't want to go the school I stay with you, even if it's in your office?\" She asked with fear. \"Gypsy, I would love for you to be out, so you will be going back to America.\" Gypsy looked at him \"What! You hate it when I have to go back to America!Now your sending me !\" She yelled. \"Gypsy, the police said that it could be my competition trying to hurt you live with Eli, they won't even know where you live.I hate it, which is why I will search for them.\" Damien said hating to see her cry. \"Does that mean I can spend half my summer here?\" She asked with hope in her eyes \"Yes, we will arrange,can we please enjoy this time we have together?\" He pleaded She nodded her head \"Alright, will we still have breakfast together ?\" \"Yes, we will.\" He said petting her hair as she slowly fell asleep. Morning Gypsy smiled as she got to eat her pancakes, they were in the shape of bunny' shook his head as he ate them. \"Scissors cut paper.\" Gypsy said \"Bunny pancakes.\" Sebastian said while switching to eggs. \"See, you kids are fine.\" Sebastian's mother Claire said smiling \"We are recovering.\" Sebastian said \"We have to leave in an hour.\" Damien reminded them. \"Alright.\" The young teens said, Gypsy looked at Sebastian. \"Your finally coming!\" \"Yes, we need to make sure you are both safe.\" Claire said \"Yes, now let's make sure you have everything packed.\" Clara said getting up and Gypsy followed her with a smile. On the plane \"I can't believe we still have homework.\" Gypsy said arms crossed \"Did you really think, we would have a fre ride?\" Sebastian asked amused \"Who can study when your life is in with all the chores, we won't eve want to do homework.\" \"Chores?\" Sebastian asked unsure \"Yeah, it's fun to brush the horses and feed them though we have to clean out you can finally meet Victoria and Rebecca.\" \"Joy.\" He said going back to his book.[Chapter 12] Sebastian stared at the two girls who were in simple clothes, while they glared at him. \"Gypsy, I am sad to hear how you came hear,but I am happy none the less.\" Eli said kissign her forehead. \"It is great to be back, though it's not as hot here.\" Gypsy said smiling as she felt a beeze. \"Well let's get you both settled in alright?\" Mary, Rebeca's mother said then hugging Gypsy. Gypsy smiled but grabbed Sebstian's hand, pulling him \"This is my other bestfriend one who has helped me with my homework.\" She heard grunting,she smiled looking back to Nathan. \"Ofcourse Nathan has helped a lot as well.\" Nathan smiled at her Victoria and Rebecca had gotten Gypsy's lighter bags while two boys got the heavier had gotten help though he realized it's only becuase Gypsy was with went to Eli's house and the girls helped Gypsy put away her things while they just dropped Sebastian's things. Sebastain checked his room to make sure it's safe and then put away his clothes, making sure to have his weapons went out in the hall and realised his room was six rooms down from Gypsys. He walked to her open door bedroom, smiled at him \"Did you have trouble finding your room, or mine?\" She asked with care He shook his head \"None.\" She smile dand went back to puttign things away in her watched, still fasnicated by his best friedn and soon to be hasn't even used her powers fully, only a few times and they were to much so she had passed got everyone's attention, she had a good head on her shoulders and she was concerned for everyone. \"Did you call Damien to tell him we are here?\" He reminded her She stopped \"Oh my god no.\" She looked to her friends \"We'll be right back.\" They nodded and Gypsy left with a follow me. Sebastain didn't like how the only phone was in Eli's office, he really would be on his went into the office, running to the desk \"We have to hurry, Eli has to go back to work.\" She called Damien,he picked up immediatly \"Gypsy are you all right, did you arrive safely, where is Sebastian?\" She smiled it's great to know soemone cared \" We are both fine, yes Nathan made sure we did before havign to leave us, and Sebastian is right beside me.\" She said calmly. \"Damien you must calm down, you should try yoga or a girlfriend.\" Damien wanted to laugh at the girlfriedn part, Sebastian did though Gypsy mouthed \"I'm serious.\" \"I'll try some decaf, now are you sure you safe and fine?\" He asked again stressing \"Yes, my three best friedns get to finally meet why wouldn't I be happy? It's just the reasonig for it.\" \"Alright, let me talk to Sebastain.\" She gave the phone to him and she sat in Eli's chair spinning slowly in it. \"How is the situation?\" \"The one phone is in Eli's office, we are gettign along and the area is had to pass by guards and everything.\" Gypsy nodded her head at this,she got out her seat going to a loved how they made their own clothes, but it's not were sewn but with nice material and they sold their clothes to grew their own food , and bred horses as well though she hated it. Sh ehas fallen in love with so many but yet when she got them to do commands and under control a rider would come and buy at at least kept their original names for her others thought the name was cut but decided to change them. She waved back when she saw a child wavign at her, though she heard the phoen beign put down. \"All right, what do you want to show me?\" Sebastian asked She smiled at him \"Peanut and Jelly.\" She led him out the office and back to her room, where the girls were sittign on her bed. \"Going to show him Peanut and Jelly.\" The girls smiled getting up and followign them out he house. They were walking towards the animals he realised, he was guessing she named the liked strange names, hopefully she won't name her daughter soemthign crazy. He looked at Rebecca her hair was red adn she had soem freckles,he only knew oen red head. \"Are you Malachi's daughter?\" He asked She looked at him \"Yes is their a problem?\" She asked looking him up and down \"No, you have your father's frown.\" He said \"Told ya.\" Gypsy and Victoria said She shurgged \"So, I don't care.\" They stopped at a stable \"Peanut! Jelly!\" She yelled and soonthey heard stomping and horses whining. She ran to them, Peanut was stallion while Jelly was a were both th tiniest but all they needed was took them out their stable and they both began licking her hand rubbign their head on her. \"I missed you to.\" She said smiling. She showed Sebastian how to clean out thier shoes and care for them , he didn't notice that the other two had the horses had been cared for they took them out for a ride and then cleaned them and fed them. They slowly walked back to the house tired but showered and put on different smiled and ran to Sebastian's room. \"Let's eat.\" She said grabbign his hand and pullign him wonders where she gets the strength. The went to the dining room, he saw Rebecca and her father,the one woman and other was sittign at one head seat and Gyosy went to her seat, though he saw a seat on her left. He sat in it and waited for all the food to be put down, his stomach growled and smelling the was sad when he smelled grilled, it as just some finished his food, it was fillign though he liked his steak. \"Let's get to bed.\"[Chapter 13] I do not own \"Another day of back breaking chores.\" Sebastian said while rubbing his left shoulder \"I know it's strenuous, but I like it I mean with Damien I can see why everyone calls me princess. Though when I'm here training horses and doing things that are normally done by staff I appreciate things a lot more.\" Gypsy said wiping some sweat of her face \"I can't wait to go back home.\" Sebastian admitted walking over to his water bottle, he wanted to hit himself. He looked to his future queen. Gypsy was looking to the ground \"I just hope mom gets better.\" She went back to work Sebastian couldn't say anything comforting for her, it was shocking the woman was still alive though she's slowly turning to a vegetable. \"You look better.\" Victoria teased at him \"Yeah, why don't you eat some meat.\" He said winking at her She looked at him repulsed \"Sebastian then she'd get sick, she's never eaten meat you know that.\" Gypsy reprimanded Sebastian looked at Victoria \"I am doing better than expected,three weeks of no meat only feeling a little under the weather and vomiting once.\" He looked to Gypsy \"Once again thank you for taking care of me.\" She rolled her eyes \"I was just doing what you did for me when I got the stomach flu.\" \"Still your a good friend.\" He wondered how she would feel if he wasn't taking care of her just being her bodyguard \"Gypsy,Angelina needs help with her newborn twins want to help?\" She asked knowing how HER best friend loved the babies. Gypsy smiled \"Yeah, I'll meet you their after I shower.\" She said spinning and showing her dirty work clothes and face \"Of course.\" She looked ta Sebastian with hate and then left Gypsy did her work faster and then headed off with a bye, though Sebastian only had to fill the horses water and he'd be right behind her. Gypsy was wearing a light blue dress with boots and she headed to the house with the newborns. She enjoyed playing with them and she couldn't help to blush when the husband said she looked good with children. When his son, Michael said \"Yeah my children.\" Victoria looked at her with so much hate at that moments. They said goodbye and headed to Eli's house. \"So you like Michael huh?\" She said not knowing how else to put it Victoria stopped walking and looked to her \"What?\" \"You got really mad when he joked around.\" \"Joking around? He wasn't joking around, ever since he saw you when we were ten he's liked you!He's kept that stupid drawing you two made together when you were ten, you just get everything.\" She said tired and looking at me She looked at me sad, she put her hands on my face \"You don't even know why I'm upset.\" She looked around \"Come to my bedroom an hour after dinner, and I will explain why you get everything.\" She grabbed my hand and we ran for dinner. \"I thought you two were going to be late.\" Eli said at the head seat staring at me \"We stayed outside a little just to enjoy some time together, we didn't realize how much time had passed.\" Victoria said before I could open my mouth I hate how that happens between her and Sebastian I barely use my voice. \"On the weekend you can spend as much time as you want outside.\" Eli said That's a lie, though the latest I have ever stayed out was 9:05 and that's because I snuck out. Eli had spanked me that night, and consoled me for two whole days. \"Alright.\" I say then once most of the tension is gone we eat Once we finished dinner, some stay behind because it's their turn to wash dishes. I head to bed though I curse when I realize that I am on my period. I curse, I should be used to it I mean I am that unlucky rare girl to get her period at six. I still remember how happy my doctor was, who's happy a six year old can get a period? Even if I am a damn medical mystery. I sigh and take care of it with a pad and put on my bed clothes. Since it's cold at night and hot in the morning I change between long t shirt and shorts or tank top and long pants. I go with the tank top and long pants combo tonight and brush my hair out. I look at the clock, time sure is slow that only took twenty minutes. I put my brush down and decided to do some math homework. After I finished the first page , I hear a knock at my door. \"Come in.\" I watch as the door opened and it was Eli, I smile at him and put my math homework away. Though he looks at it \"You were always good with numbers, so why is it that you were late to dinner and now you are up past your bedtime?\" He asked looking at me \"I couldn't sleep.\" He doesn't seem to take my answer, he took a deep breath in. He was just staring at me , until he twirled some of my hair around his finger. \"It's true what they say, time does fly by when you have children. Not to long ago you came here wanting to raise a \"piggy\". He said with humor in his voice I smile looking to the picture of my pig, it's on my dresser. \"I cruelly named him Pork-chop.\" \"He was good bacon though.\" Eli said with a smile I laugh at him, though I stop when I notice he is staring at me. Strange it's the same look Damien gave me when he was on the stairs. \"What, noticing once again how I have grown?\" I tease He nods \"How can I not when you only have a summer with me.\" He said with sadness I get closer to hug him, though a panicked knock stops me. \"Yes?\" I said worried \"What is it?\" Eli said mad The door opens and Malachi is their looking worried he was about to tell though he looked at me. He didn't say a word. Eli looked at a guard I did not know \"Take her to my bedroom.\" He picked me up effortlessly and gave him to me. He walked me to the bedroom,put me on the bed gently and left with a bow. Went to the door though it was locked, I went to the window but they were locked as well. I didn't notice that before. I stayed up wondering what the news was, it was inside the house. Though that narrowed down the idea I could get out of here. While waiting I started to get so tired I could even stay up right, and my stomach was hurting a little. When I woke up, I felt something warm on my stomach and that it was morning. I moved the warm water bottle off my stomach but a hand was holding it. I turned to see Eli still sleeping, I sighed and turned the other way. I wish I had my mom, Serena or Cara. Somehow these two always knew she was on her period and had a warm water bottle or midol. Growing up she thought this was normal until middle school,then she found out it was usually your mother or motherly figure who told you about this and helped you. Though she would just tell Michael or Eli and they would get a female,then they would hold her and give her warm milk. She tried to get up on her own, but after her fifth attempt she sighed and stayed still. \"All you had to do was wake me.\"He said removing his arm \"I didn't want to wake you, you stayed up all night.\" She got up heading for the door. \"Your things are in the bathroom.\" He said getting up \"Thank you.\"She went their and did her business and came out. \"What happened?\" She asked as he was looking outside He turned to her sighing and frowning. He came over to her, picking her up and going to the bed. He sat down and put her in his lap sitting sideways. \"What's wrong?\" She asked looking in his eyes he seemed mad and confused He pulled her closer in his arms \"Do you remember our third law?\" She nodded her head \"We cannot take our own lives.\" She memorized the laws since she was eight. \"Why who broke the rule?\" Though she hoped it wasn't some one she was close with. \"Victoria, she took medicine that we got for her grandparents.\" He kissed my forehead, wiping away my tears. \"Last night, before I came to you I talked to her and she told me how she had lied for the both of you.\" \"I-\"He gave me a look so I didn't defend myself \"She also asked me if she could tell you something, something that she has always wanted to tell you.\" \"What was it?\" I asked hoping he'd tell me,but I wasn't going to get my hopes up. \"That she was unclear of, and for that I am sorry for.\" He kissed my forehead \"I must talk to her family and get things prepared.\" I nodded my head and got up from his lap. Someone knocked on the door, I went to it opening it. \"Damien!\" I say jumping at him. He smiled catching me with ease \"Princess, I hope you are well.\"I nod my head \"Yeah, what are you doing here?\" \"Yes, what are you doing here?\" I asked confused \"Yes,what are you doing here you weren't supposed to pick her up for another two weeks.\" Eli said mad he was even forming a fist. \"The trial of that crazed priest went through, and besides I missed MY princess.\" He said looking to me, I'm still in his arms \"Damien put me down, I'm not a baby.\" I said wiggling in his arms though he has a tight grip on me \"Of course your not, but be in my shoes. I haven't seen you in a long time. Though I do have good news.\" I looked at him \"What?\" I hope it's my mother \"I bought us a new house and it will be closer to the city. You can see it our staff already finished your room. Also Sebastian's family will be moving in as well.\" I smiled \"That's great.\" I looked back to Eli \"What about the funeral?\" \"It will go on tonight.\" He walked closer to us \"Go an tell you friend while we talk please, angel.\" Damien puts me down \"We do have some things to talk about.\" I nod my head and walk out the room of course the guards are at the door. \"Hey guys.\" \"Good morning.\" They all said before turning stiff I went to Sebastian's room knocking on his door. With Damien and Eli Eli looked at him mad \"You killed one of my people!\" \"She was going to tell Esmeralda about her future, you must have a tighter leash on your dogs.\" \"Their are no dogs around here.\" Damien smirked before looking to the window where a crow landed and beat on the window with it's beak. \"How dare you to think I would put the mother of my child in danger.\" Eli said Damien rolled his eyes \"Oh please, did you not see her jumping into my arms. You were a big part of her life when she was a child, but now she needs me more not your hippie junk.\" He said with disdain in his voice while looking at Eli's ceremonial robes. \"She will want to stay for the send off of her friend.\" \"Yes, but having her real friend and family will have her forget about her friends unfortunate demise.\" He walked out the room though looked back at Eli \"I'm winning dear brother.\" He said brother with disgust and left with his guys. Eli stared back mad wondering what he could do while getting things prepared.[Chapter 14] I do not own Gypsy POV After the funeral I had gotten some of my friends trinkets, like jewelry we've made, along with clothes and pictures. I fell asleep on the plane, I found my self waking up on Damian's lap. I slowly moved off his lap, rubbing my eyes. \"Morning sleeping beauty.\" Sebastian joked I stick my tongue at him \"It's not my fault, I fall asleep on planes-\" \"Or on car rides long or short.\" Damien teased while reading over something I looked at him \"After the funeral, I tired my self out.\" I said shrugging. \"Well I have good news.\" Sebastian said I walked over to the couch he was on \"What is it?\" \"My sister Jennifer, is coming here for an internship.\" He said happy \"Really!\" I look at Damien \"When were you going to tell me!\" I asked picking up a pillow and tossing it at him. He chuckled \"It was going to be a surprise.\" \"So what's she doing here this time? Hair, clothes, or photography something awesome right!\" I look between the two. \"She is now into teaching, she will be teaching at your school.\" Nathan said while carrying books \"Now that your awake, we can get you caught up.\" Sebastian went over to Damien. \"While Sebastian has been keeping up with his school work, you are a bit behind.\" He chided sitting next to me. \"I had a lot of chores to do, I had to also help with newborns. Sebastian could actually sleep through the night, I had to hep with babies.\" I said crossing my arms \"You helped with childcare?\" Damien asked looking at me with interest I nodded \"Yep, they come out crying.\" I complained \"Though I do like them when they start to crawl, and walk.\" She said with a smile \"So would you like to have children one day?\" Damien asked with humor though everyone looked at me. I thought about it \"Yeah, a boy so he knows to watch after his little sister.\" I said with a smile. \"Damien have you found a girl to have kids with?\" I asked as Nathan gave me a book. \"I have.\" Damien told me I jumped over to him \"Is she on your political team, or at the hospital, who?\" He smiled at me \" You know her that is all I'm saying.\" He kissed me on my head \"Now I believe Nathan was going to help you catch up.\" He said pushing me off the sofa I sigh, picking up the dropped book and for the rest of the long flight we study, though it wasn't so bad. Once we were done with English, math and geography I got to take a break since they were doing history. Though Nathan said I was being disruptive since I would answer right after he would say the question. When the plane finally landed, I was jumping up and down I could not wait to get out of these clothes, and into more of this year. When we went into the limo Jennifer greeted us. She's taller then me,and her hair has some red stripes in her hair. I loved it \"Please do my hair!\" I pleaded. \"That's the first thing you say to me, when the last thing you say to me is don't leave?\" She said crossing her arms \"Your right, I'm sorry. How have you been, you look good, so make me look good and please do my hair?\" I plead even giving her the puppy pout She laughs at me \"You haven't changed.\" She kisses my forehead and moves on to Sebastian. I go over to Damien and Nathan \"So can I get my hair changed?\" I ask pouting \"Why not, new you you can even go out shopping with her.\" He said smiling at me \"Awesome!\" I yell hugging him \"Though lets relax for a bit at the house.\" Damien said \"Actually can I see mom instead ?\" I ask Damien looks at me \"Of course, I will arrange it.\" He said smiling at me and we all get in the limo. We head home and the mansion is just as big as the other one, though I don't get the home feeling. The car parks and we get let out \"Jennifer, go and show the two their new rooms, while I go rest.\" Damien tells Jennifer who nods \"Come on you two.\" So our bedrooms on the other side, and Damien left us. Jennifer had me close my eyes as I entered my room. \"Alright open.\" She said smiling at me I did and I was shocked instead of the six year old bedroom it was updated for a sixteen year old. No ponies and princess, no pink walls. Though I did have the curtain over my bed. \"So do you like it, I figured you didn't want your room to show your views when yo were six.\" She said with a smile while also getting something out a desk. She showed me the paper I laughed, grabbing it \"No boys allowed girls rule.\" it was even in my sloppy handwriting I laughed \"I'm glad you kept this.\" I said looking at her She looked at me with sad eyes, while hugging me \"I heard about what happened with your friend and back in the US.I know how you feel, I mean she was your first friend besides Sebastian and the other girl you have been friends with since you were six.\" She had me look at he r\"But we are all here for you, remember what I told you when I helped you when you burnt your hand?\" I nodded \"Yeah, your not just Sebastian's older sister your mine as well.\" I said hugging her We moved over to the bed, she had me put my head on her shoulder. \"So how do you feel, do you feel like you should cry some more or talk about good times?\" \"I'm done crying. I just want to know why. I mean she really wanted to tell me something, and she does this.\" I get off her, looking at her \"It doesn't make sense.\" \"Things like this are never explainable.\" She says to me kissing me on my forehead \"Now how about you take that nap.\" I nod and go to sleep, though I hate how I forgot to change clothes. Jenifer waited until her future queen was truly asleep, before leaving. Jenifer went to her brother's room, she saw he was putting his clothes in the hamper. \"She looks good, how are you though?\" \"I'm fine, I just hate how they are slipping. I mean everyone knows not to tell her of her destiny and yet that bitch almost ruined it. If I wasn't listening in on their conversation she would have told her everything!\" \"You did what was right, okay so she's in pain but she still has you. Plus our lord is most likely happy, I mean you cut her ties to Eli.\" She said smiling and hugging him. \"Yeah, now let's go see what our lord wants.\"She said smiling and they headed to Damian's office. They knocked first and came in when the door was opened. \"How is Esmeralda?\" Damien asked sitting in the chair \"I got her to take a real nap.\" Jenifer said Damian nodded \"Good you will be her homeroom teacher, and she will be in school for morning tutoring. Sebastian you are getting a B- in math, you will be also getting tutoring as well.\" \"Yes sir.\" Damien sighed \"Sebastian leave, I need to talk to Jenifer.\" Sebastian nodded Damien waited until the door was closed to talk. \"I need you to start putting ideas of me and her in her head. You will also be her only girlfriend, do I make myself clear?\" She nodded her head \"Yes, sir.\" \"Good, now I have to see how worse her mother can get.\" He shooed her away and got on the phone Gypsy POV I had a great nap, I actually felt refreshed. I tried to get up though Angel and Muffin had other ideas. \"I missed you guys to, but you know Eli doesn't allow you guys over.\" I said picking up Muffin and going over to my closet taking out a shirt, skirt with stockings and underwear. I made sure my door was locked and I started my bath. It was so big,I added bubbles and got my Ipod and speakers having it play on random. I put down Muffin but kept an eye on him, he loves baths. I really don't want to smell wet dog with a hint of cherry blossoms. I got out of my clothes, stepping in the bath and thought about my life. I finally had a friend and she's crazy, it's weird how besides her no one else would hang out with me. I mean people didn't mind hanging out with me in groups, but they would rather we got our work done at school. Though Damien is okay with this, he stands us maybe because we are family. I mean he does get uncomfortable at times. I don't get it how come I don't have friends, I mean everyone knows my name and we talk friendly except a few. Plus at the end of the year Damien has a party then everyone acts like I'm not invisible , it's so confusing. I thought about it some more and then thought about, one time I had people sit with me was the time Sebastian got sick for a week. We talked it was nice to have a mix of girl and guy friends like on TV, we even got to hang out after school. Though it all changed when Sebastian came back, they all avoided me. I sighed \"So, Sebastian is making it hard for people to like me.\" I washed up and let the water drain, wrapping myself in a fuzzy towel. \"Though Sebastian has been my friend since we little.\" I hear barking and look to see Muffin in the tub playing with the bubbles. Shaking my head at him,I walk into my bedroom, sitting at my vanity it has pictures of me with Sebastian. He's my best friend I can't ditch him, especially since we are living together. I sigh confused and getting a little headache.[Chapter 15] I do not own Gypsy paid for her drink and went over to a waiting Sebastian who was already going to their table,though she grabbed his arm. He looked over at her confused as she dragged him to a table with people already sitting. He recognized them immediately, they were also at the school early Gypsy smiled at them and looked at Sebastian waiting for him to sit down. He sighed doing so and opened his lunch taking out a restaurant styled club sandwich with toothpick along with chips and fresh baked brownies that smelled fresh though they weren't. His drink was his standard water, Gypsy had an enchilada with Mexican rice and soft taco for dessert a slice of perfect angel food cake. She opened her sprite and smiled at the people dribbling at her and Sebastian's food. \"Serena, head chef I'm sure if you come over after school she wouldn't mind making you a delicious snack.\" Gypsy said looking over to Sebastian \"Thanks for heating it for me.\" Sebastian just nodded and once the kids were done looking at their lunches from home they began talking. Sebastian could not keep the smile of his face as the bell rang, he got up getting his trash while Gypsy got hers. \"Later\" Is all he said grabbing her only stopping to have them drop of their trash, they put their lunchboxes in their lockers and went to his sister's class. Though as they walked to it a boy bumped into the both of them, Gypsy caught herself but Sebastian fell to the ground. \"Stay out of my way next time.\" The dude said chuckling to himself as he walked off Sebastian got up, wiping himself off \" At least I haven't failed my grade and forced to repeat.\" \"Sebastian!\" Gypsy yelled frantic as the surrounding students \"oohed\" and formed a circle. The guy turned around the intent to kill in his eyes, he charged Sebastian who moved away a second early. He grabbed the guy's backpack and had him turn to him,Sebastian punched him hard in the stomach,letting him go. Everyone was silent,Sebastian grabbed Gypsy's hand and they walked to class. Jennifer watched her brother and little sister, Gypsy was staring Sebastian in concern every chance she could. Jennifer told them to read some pages while she wrote some things on the board. Gypsy wrote a note and passed it to Sebastian, hoping he'd answer. She went back to reading though she hoped he'd pass it back. Sebastian got the note and read it \"Hey U OK? You didn't have to punch him that hard :( Is this about lunch?\" \"No.\" He sent it back to her and began reading. Gypsy let out a kick when she got the note back, she wrote more and was about to send it back until a knock had her freeze in passing it to him. \"Mr. Harper wants to see Sebastian Lorre and Gypsy Thorn Peters.\" A female said We grabbed our bags and followed her out, while walking to see the dean I tossed the note in the trashcan. We didn't even have to sit down and wait. We went straight to his office where the guy Sebastian hit looked sick, and smelled off. We sat down next to the two chairs, and Mr. Harper nodded to the lady and she closed the door. \"You all know why your here, so would you like to talk first Ms. Thorne or would you all like to draw this out by waiting for your parents and guardians?\" He asked looking at me I really hate that word, guardian, I mean it just points out that I'm different. I jumped when Sebastian elbowed me,I blinked and looked to Mr. Harper. \"Mr. Harper, there is no reason to call our par-guardians. I mean it's straight forward in the school book that any student's caught fighting will be punished with either two day suspension,in school suspension, or the rod.\" I say remembering it straight from the book. \"Nerd.\" The boy muttered out loud That stopped me from talking, so I looked at Mr. Harper's desk. \"Richard!\" Mr. Harper said looking at the boy \"\"Yes, your correct\"He said looking at me\" but since your whole grade is talking about it and it's caught on camera. Plus Richard threw up and the nurse called his parents.\" \"Oh.\" \"So were both getting suspension?\" Sebastian asked \"It will all be decided once I hear what happened, though from the camera it seems like Richard was being his usual self and Sebastian stood up for himself and Ms. Thorn. Is this correct Ms. Thorn?\" \"Yes, Mr. Harper.\" He nodded his head and soon someone knocked on his door \"Open.\" \"Their Guardians are here.\" \"Send them in.\" Mr. Harper said clearing his throat I wondered who it would be, Damien or Nathan hopefully not Eli. He would think I was acting out or something. \"What is this about?\" Damien asked first \"Where is Mr.-\" \"I am put on the list to call, both of his parents would take a long time. It was just easier for me to be here. Now what am I doing here?\" Damien asked staring at Sebastian. \"Richard here,\"he nudged his head \"pushed Gypsy and shoved me to the ground after most liking failing another test and I punched him and he vomited where the nurse had to call for you.\" \"Richard!\" The boy's mother said \"Gypsy are you alright?\" Damien asked as he pulled me out of my chair to inspect me. \"I'm fine.\" I say hoping I'm not blushing, I hated it when he did that. He of course won't take my word for it so I will most likely go see my doctor. \"So is he getting in school suspension?\" Damien asked looking to Sebastian, I move out of the way. \"Yes, two days.\" \"Richard started this all.\" Sebastian said \"Haven't you hurt him enough.\" His mother said holding him to her chest \"Diana, we both know your son likes to start fights,after all these two have never bee in my office even when they were in kindergarten while yours has seen every principal in every grade so far!\" Mr. Harmon yelled at her She looked at him ready to cuss, until Damien spoke up \"So since this is Sebastian's first time being here and he was provoked no repercussions along with Esmeralda.\" I roll my eyes once again using my middle name,I'm shocked he didn't get my middle name changed to my first. \"Yes, that would be fair.\" \"No! That ruffian punched my poor baby, he has to be punished!\" Richard's mom yelled Damien looks like he wants to insult to her,along with Mr. Harper, Sebastian rolls his eyes and rubs his forehead. \"What if he stays after school to help a teacher, they use this punishment for lesser degrees thing like this.\" I say remembering the handbook , they all look at me. Though I continue \"It will be a punishment and it won't be marked on his record.\" \"Fine.\" Diana said tired \"I like the idea, how do you know all the rules?\" Mr. Harmon asked interested \"Photographic memory.\" I \"You two get your thing's for the rest of your classes, you both have a doctors appointment.\" Damien said and we hightailed it out the room. \"I can't believe they keep that boy in school.\" Jennifer said as she barged into my bed room. I shrug and turn down the TV \"What are you going to do?\" \"Pray I don't get him.\" She said with a smile I smile though that made me think about what she said \"Jennifer, are you religious?\" She stops spinning to look at me \"What little sis?\" \"Are you religious?\" I ask drawing out each word She sits on the bed with me \"Like pray and stuff?\" \"Yeah.\" I say slow \"I mean I know we don't but some of my classmates pray before they eat and stuff. So I was wondering if you are and you just don't want to make a thing out of it here.\" Jennifer shook her head \"No I can't say I am, I just believe that if you do what's good and show thanks to people you care about good things will happen.\" She kissed me on the forehead \"So how about you tell me why my little brother was really uptight after lunch, and I know it wasn't from hitting that boy.\" \"I wanted us to have new friends, so I asked a girl from another class if she wouldn't mind us sitting with them. They fell in love with Serena's food.\" Jennifer laughed \"That's not shocking, everyone drops what their doing to eat some of her food. Though speaking of love,have you got a crush onany cute boys?\" She asks sitting next to me and nudging my shoulder \"No, I'm actually trying to just find some more friends.\" \"Since when did Sebastian and you stop being friends?\" She yelled which shocked me \"We haven't it's just-\" \"I mean you guys have been best friend's since you were five,and once cliques start happening you-\" \"That's not it! I just want a group of friends.\" She looked at me mad \"If you want people who don't give a damn about you, I'm sure Damien will buy you some friends. Or you can go on Facebook, but you'll lose the one person who has saved your life.\" She walked out the room mad,slamming the door. \"That's not what I meant!\" I yelled at the closed door I looked at the doors confused. She had friends three best friends, what's wrong if I have another friend. Leaving my room,I head downstairs mad and confused at what Jennifer said. Jumping when I turned on the kitchen light and saw Damien at the table,holding a cup. \"Sorry that I scared you.\" Damien said walking to her \"Do you need me to wake Serena?\" I shook my head \"Just going to make some hot coco.\" \"I have some already made.\" He said nudging his head to the stove, and going to get me a cup. I turn around to get the marshmallows and eat one, covering my mouth when I thanked Damien, as I carefully got the cup. \"Good job on helping Sebastian.\" He said as I sipped my drink \"Thanks, it's just unfair how she wanted him to be treated.\" I said drinking my coco. He stares at me as I drink, so I put my cup down fully on the table \"What, do I have some marshmallow smeared on my face?\" I ask wiping it with the back of my hand He chuckles \"No, I am just very proud of you. Your taking your friend's death quite well, I mean normally when a death happens your usually sleeping in my bed.\" \"I think I have a better handle on it, I mean it's not like this is my first death after all.\"I take another sip \"True, you were younger when the tragedies happened, you've really matured I am proud of you.\" He said which makes me smile so I sip some more coco and eat a marshmallow We sip in comfortable silence,I finish my drink though getting up I almost fall. Damien catches me instantly \"I got ya.\" He said picking me up, I yawn while nodding my head and close my eyes as he takes me to my room. Damien carries her to his bedroom, taking her carefully out of her home clothes he just stares at her. Only thing stopping his view of her body fully is her bra and panties. He takes off her bra, he restrains himself to just look. He goes to his closet looking at the bed clothes that he bought for her this year. He takes out a sleeping shirt that should be tight on her along with shorts that were barely their. He puts on the shorts first, licking her stomach. Gypsy moves slightly but doesn't do anything else. He smiles at this and then put on the shirt. He takes a mental picture and puts on his own bed clothes before moving her into his arms and falling asleep. Damien POV I woke up by Gypsy shaking me awake \"Damien let go of me,I have to get ready to go to school\" She said frustrated I smiled while squeezing her tighter \"I want to sleep in.\" I say liking how I feel her breasts, they will be great to suck on. \"That's my line!\" She said looking at me while wiggling, she doesn't notice what I'm doing at all. Someone knocked on the door, I wanted to ignore them though I know I had work to do. Reluctantly letting her go, I answered the door. \"Princess isn-\" Nathan started panicked \"She's here,she fell asleep after she had some hot chocolate.\" Stressing the words hot chocolate Nathan understood \"I will clean up the mess downstairs then and will have Jennifer get her clothes.\" He said calm and left I closed the door looking to my future wife, she yawned and stretched. \"Damian how come I'm in your room?\" She asks slow I walked over to her,sitting down on the bed \"You came to me to be comforted, after your fight with Jennifer.\" She looked at me \"I told you that?\" \"Yes while drinking your hot chocolate, now how about you take a shower Jennifer should be here with your clothes.\" She stared at me before slowly walking into the bathroom,closing the door. I take out my suit for the day and think of the shoes to wear as well. \"Come in.\" I look to see who comes into our bedroom. \"I have her clothes right here.\" Jennifer said holding them out for me to inspect. I like the choice so I knock on the bathroom door. \"Yes?\" \"Your clothes are here.\" I hear the water turn off and she comes out wrapped in towel. I get hard instantly. She takes them \"Thanks.\" She looks behind me and then looks at me confused \"Where's Jen?\" \"She also has to get ready, are you done with the bathroom?\" I ask with clenched teeth She nods and steps out the way,sitting down on the bed. I grab my towel and rush into the bathroom. I could not get out of my shorts fast enough. After I relieve my self in the shower can I truly wash, hoping Nathan could tell Serena about Esmeralda needing something heavy to counter act the drug. Though she could possible stay home,it's been awhile since it was just us. When she was younger she would just need some toys and get to be on my lap at times. Though her being much older now and wanting to be with hoped she didn't get a crush on him and she just sees him as a brother. He sighed coming out of the shower,putting a towel on his waist. He walked out the room smiling that she was still in the room, she hasn't forgotten the lessons he taught her. He dressed though was disappointed on how she didn't even try to glance at him. \"Are you feeling alright?\" He asked while noticing her being spaced out,she shook herself from it \"Yeah I'm fine.\" She said smiling to wide He liked how he could always tell when she was lying \"Alright let's eat.\" He watched her closely as they sat down to eat breakfast. She could barely keep her eyes open, the others were watching her as well. \"Sebastian make sure to get Esmeralda's school work, she will be staying home.\" Damien said as the maids were taking the plates. \"What!No I'm fine!\" She jumped up though she swayed a little, Sebastian and me were ready to catch her. \"No your not, now Gypsy your staying home that's final.\" I command even using her fist name and she knows I only use that when I'm upset. She screeches and leaves out the room, Damien sighed taking out his phone. \"Hello Doctor Ivy, Gypsy will be seeing her mother today and -\" \"Don't worry, she'll be clinging to you.\" The doctor finished Damien hung up and finished is breakfast \"Don't you all have work or school.\" He said leaving for Gypsy's room. He knocked on the door \"Gypsy it's Damien.\" \"Unless I'm going to school I don't want to see you!\" \"You are being unreasonable.\" \"I'm fine, stop treating me like a little doll!\" She even threw something at the door Damien sighed and waited for the phone call, he waited until he could hear Gypsy run to the door. \"Hello? Doctor Ivy what is it?\" He asked making himself sound concerned \"Alright I'll tell her.\" He hung up \"Gy-\" The door opened fast \"What's wrong with mom!\" \"They wouldn't tell me over the phone.\" He said and they ran down to the front door where Nathan had the car ready.[Chapter 16] I do not own Gypsy paid for her drink and went over to a waiting Sebastian who was already going to their table,though she grabbed his arm. He looked over at her confused as she dragged him to a table with people already sitting. He recognized them immediately, they were also at the school early Gypsy smiled at them and looked at Sebastian waiting for him to sit down. He sighed doing so and opened his lunch taking out a restaurant styled club sandwich with toothpick along with chips and fresh baked brownies that smelled fresh though they weren't. His drink was his standard water, Gypsy had an enchilada with Mexican rice and soft taco for dessert a slice of perfect angel food cake.

I guide her to our waiting room. It's a hospital room that's two door down, that's quite nice. I had her sit down, she collapsed on the bed, she looked at me with tear stained cheeks. \"Damien what's wrong with her, she was doing well?\" \"I do not know, they want to wait until she's out of the red zone. Then they'll tell me.\" I kissed her on the forehead. \"Then you'll tell me.\" She looked at me with hope in her beautiful eyes \"In the best way I can …yes.\" She wiped away her tears though they only started again. I went to the TV and turned it on \"Look their playing Cyndi Lauper marathon.\" I turn up the TV She perked up as a song came on and started to sing along, she smiled \"Time after Time my favorite.\" \"You have many favorites.\" \"Unlike you, my musicians are not dead so come out with new songs.\" She teased though she lost her balance. I caught her and she looked to me after blinking many times. \"Thanks.\" She said uncertain of what happened as I helped her sit up \"This is why you should not be at school, you are obviously coming down with something.\" I said staring at her She nodded though regretted it, she held her head \"Yeah, I guess you're right.\" She crawled over to the pillows and laid down. \"Will I get sick like my mom?\" She asked worried \"No,\" He said shaking his head moving over to her \"We always made sure you were safe and healthy.\" \"Well, what if it's some sickness that I get after I have a kid like my mom?\" I looked at her \"You plan on having one child?\" She shrugged \"I don't know I mean mom-\" \"Your mother is different, she's weaker while you are strong. Do not ever doubt yourself.\" I said mad which shocked her. He grabbed her shoulders \"Do you understand me?\" She nodded feeling dizzy \"My head is reeling, can I eat some crackers?\" I let go of her gently \"Of course.\" I made a call telling them what she wanted. She smiled, falling down on the bed. I watched her, I obviously gave her too much, not to be in the red zone but still I watched as she relaxed into the bed. I gently touched her leg, she didn't notice I went higher slowly touching her with my fingertips which made her smile. I was about to go higher when someone knocked on the door, I went to get the door as Esmeralda jumped. I notice it took her a while as I opened the door, I got the crackers and juice and closed the door. ","Summary":" I do not own I woke like any usual day; I slowly walked down stairs to kitchen.

Going through the entertaintment column she remebered how people loved the smell of this particular flower, there was a time she did as well. But after working in the town´s flowershop since she was a little girl, no longer young enough to cause pity on those who she asked for food and shelter, now Odette could truly enjoy the smell only when she left the store, since outside was impossible for it to be stuck up her nostrils anymore. Hugo, her boss, insisted to believe every flower was special, trying to make her fall into his \"flower religion\" -Every flower is unique, you know- he lectured, -As is every person. For you to work here, you must understand the art of identifying every customer with a flower. From the moment they come through that door, a specific flower is already waiting for them; all you have to do is find it…- Odette would roll her eyes and ask: -What if the customer wants a bunch of flowers? -Vulgar of you to say bunch, no more… from now on, it is called a \"bouquet\", and it´s the same concept. Pure nonsense, she thought, but to earn money she had to play his game. Luckily, Apolline was there. Apolline was what one would call, a hopeless romantic, she would pretend every customer was in love with her, even if he was too young and when Odette was watering the flowers outside or cutting greenery to make \"bouquetes\" she often saw Madame Apolline writing letters from a distance, letters that after a week or so, she would send to herself and invite Odette to participate in the drama of \"General LaFitte\" who insisted he would take his own life if she didn´t reply to his marriage offer, or \"Monsieur Lefevre\" who said he would duel for her hand if necessary. At first, it was quite annoying, but Odette soon learned to appreciate the old hag. She was the closest thing Odette had to a friend after her parents died in a fire, roaring flames consumed her house one night. Fortunately, people said, it had done nothing to scar her body, but Odette could still feel the sting of the warm hearth that went out of control and had taken everything she held dear; sometimes she compared that sting with the one she felt when touching a flower´s thorns. -Pain will pass, little girl- Hugo said to cheer up her spirits But they didn´t cheer and the pain stayed there, not crushing her anymore but forever present, like a dragon in slumber waiting to bathe her in hot flames at the slightest chance. But… hunger and cold were different kinds of beasts, more like a pack of hunting wolves for they made Odette run and hide and yet, bloom from the sad bud that she was, or so Apolline liked to say. Hence, Odette had to become a wolf herself. A wolf with the smell of roses, Hugo often added when discussing her past with Madame Apolline whenever they thought Odette wasn´t listening. Truth be told \"rosesmell\", Odette´s nickname for the scent, WAS impregnated on her skin, on her hair and on her life now, probably from working all day long on a counter that had such flowers displayed all over it. And yet Hugo, with his loony way of connecting flowers to every single individual that crossed his way, insisted the roses had picked her as their person. -But not red roses, oh no – he corrected, shaking his long index finger in front on Odette´s nose, -yours is the blue rose. The rose for your eyes. -You´ll see little one- Apolline would then say, patting her head as she gave her a pair of garden scissors, a bucket and leather gloves too big for her hands, -It is true, you don´t look red to me… One day, you´ll live in blue, you´ll hear in blue and you´ll love in blue. \"As long as my skin doesn´t turn blue…\" she thought heading to the glassgardens, big crystal structures designed to maintain the heat within and prevent it from killing flowers during the long winters. Despite everything Hugo and Apolline said about blue roses and wolves in her temperament and her natural perfume, everytime Odette looked back on her life, there was only fire and bricks turned to charcoal, the smell of ashes suffocating her lungs and the moonlight to paint it all with its cold, lonely silver touch. But one day, Apolline had brought newspaper to wrap some dead lillies that had gone bad a bit too soon and Odette saw on the entertainment column that a theatre troupe was coming to the little village, which wasn´t odd, being so close to Paris had the advantage of getting to see lots of the art perfomances that were on its way to the big city and yet this time, the troupe had as a special bonus, the participation of ballet dancers. Odette felt the fire dragon in her move a little, pulling at her hearstrings… for her father had been a great ballet admirer, talking of its power to move people to tears and to shut someone´s mind using nothing but that touching gracefulness which made women look like flying swans and men like soaring eagles on a night sky. But in the end, Odette gave in to the wolf that had allowed her to survive. -Let´s go!- she had begged, Hugo and Apolline opposed at first… and yielded later when Odette threatened each one individually: Apolline, with writing to General LaFitte about her flirting with another suitor such as Monsieur Lefevre and Hugo, with telling Madame Apolline about how he compared her with an Egyptian cactus the moment she walked out the door after an argument. And after that one night, nothing remained the same for Odette, she even came to like the crap of being a wolf with the smell of blue roses. For the ballet had soothed that fire scar from years ago and the firebreathing monster from her chilhood seemed to back away at the languid sound of ballet music, the dragon would lower its head to the flat silky shoes on wooden boards. She could do it, she had to do it. Maybe it was impossible for a wolf to tame a dragon, for a blue rose to defeat red fire. But Odette was a fighter, many said it, and she chose to believe it for if she didn´t, she´d end up believing the opposite. Madame Apolline tought it romantic, Monsieur Hugo thought it idiotic, or at least he did until Odette promised him she would come back on winters to pay back what he spent, and of course, after Apolline swore she´d think about his proposal… the kind of which Odette wanted to know nothing about. She enrolled on a medium level ballet academy, not a bad one to close every door she might knock on later, but a good one for the next target she already had in mind… The Paris Opera House. After much preparation, that idle purple and orange afternoon was the last one on Odette´s life as a florist, at least until next winter. Hugo bought her a new outfit and she liked how her small feet looked with her new shoes on. She had grown a lot that year, her long legs looked pretty whenever she tried on the ballerina pointes and she had tied her dark and wavy chestnut hair in a neat ponytail that reached her waist; Odette caressed the cotton fabric of her skirt, Apolline had made it for her, a soft and practical sapphire creation that matched her eyes. Odette smelled it… \"Fantastic\" she thought with annoyance \"A day and a night in my possession and it already reeks of rosesmell\" Hugo´s parting gift had been more poetic, and also, most predictable. A flower. A blue rose resting encased in a red wooden box. –I dyed it myself – he said proudly, -using my special methods, it should last a month in that box. Odette was surprised he didn´t give her an actual real wolf just to match the flower but she gave her thanks anyway, already used to his eccentric symbolisms and despite herself, she smiled sincerely to this man that had been almost like a grandfather to her. -You can do it little one – he cherished her caressing her hair, as if she was still some 6 year old, -those wild pretty eyes of yours say they can take on the world. So go and do it. Odette didn´t know if her eyes were pretty but she felt exultant that evening. -Be always weary of men- Apolline´s last piece of advice, -you never know what they may ask, and you are as beautiful as a new made doll my child. As the maiden that came from a faraway star- she added to quote an old story she was fond of telling Odette long ago. But given Madame Apolline´s true expertise with men, she just smiled and nodded. The next morning was all kisses and goodbyes, after Odette jumped on the back of a hay cart heading for the capital, a short 20 minute ride, she waved to Hugo and Apolline and as she looked at the bright sky, the white clouds seemed to smile and follow her. Odette was no longer the rose girl, she even forgot about the wolf and the dragon, all the poems and all the warnings were gone for an instant. She was only an amazed girl, drunk with life. A/N Hello world! So, I´ve had this idea of a Merdette fic for a while now but I wanted to make it as romantic af haha, What do you guys think? Please, R&R;! Oh, and since English is not my mother tongue, I would reeeeally appreciate if you guys corrected me in spelling and/or grammar mistakes to help me improve present you a far better work, Thanks a lot! ;)[Chapter 2] Chapter II A young dancer -Again from the top! Louis fought the urge to roll his eyes and smiled diplomatically -Boy, if what you ultimately want is in teaching and not dancing… well, you better be damn good on the last one or nobody will come to your classes – his teacher warned. And he appreciated it. He really did. After all, Monsieur Beaufort had been the only one who stood by him when he challenged his family to teach ballet instead of executing it to perfection, the way all his predecessors had done before him, the way his father and his father´s father had met and married the prima ballerinas at the time, for the sake of love or for the sake to give the world much more perfect ballet dancers, Louis could not tell. At first, they solely refused; but after Louis said he would leave ballet altogether they agreed under one condition: Before becoming a teacher, he´d have to proof he´d mastered ballet. And he had no choice but to yield, Mérante was a tough last name to have and he meant to wield it to his advantage in the future. -Adjust your arms! Perfect! He had to, sometimes he thought he knew ballet positions better than speaking which made him wonder if he learned these before the other… No time for that, now he had to dance, be perfect, be the best. Only like that he could touch his dream, live it. If he managed to get the part for Romeo at the Opera House, he´d proof his parents what he was made of, if he could have a couple more years of successes just as good as the previous five… when Louis Mérante became the sensation as the new heir of a long dynasty of excellent ballet dancers. It wasn´t long before he realized that wasn´t really what he wanted, sure it was intoxicating to be known as the best in his generation, but record breaking and metal awards were the only and true rewards for anyone on that path. The other trail held unknown and secret adventures no one in his family knew about, least of all his parents who as soon as they realized his private teacher was telling him of the prizes in such a noble career, fired him, no second thoughts. With the next teacher, Louis learned to be more cautious. When he invited this new teacher, Monsieur Beaumont, to a luxurious dinner in a fancy restaurant as a thank you for supporting him, the man had laughed and told him: -Sure I´d like to go, but I didn´t do it expecting anything you know. No good comes from demanding someone to act against his own nature. I can see, and I bet I´m not the only one, that you, my young pupil, hate to be flattered and having people all over you; it´s in you to be a partaker, not the main hero. Mérante wasn´t sure if he should feel insulted or grateful at his comment, he assumed it was the first when Beaumont told him his previous teacher had probably seen it as well. -It´s not like you´re not the protagonist of your own life. Hell, I´ve been there when you´re defending yourself and believe me you looked like an angry lion. But I meant… you´re a giver, rather than a taker. And Louis knew he was right. Both his parents were takers, and it destroyed their marriage even before he was born. They would also have destroyed him if he had let them. But the so called lion had emerged and clouded his judgement. Ever since, his parents had acted as if he didn´t exist, only pretending to be a happy family during awards ceremonies and cocktail parties, forcing him to try and hide he wasn´t disgusted at how things had turned out. They finished practicing for the day and before leaving, Beaumont looked at him. Louis was tall for his age and had the sharp handsome features of the Mérantes, high cheekbones and a fierce determined gaze, yet somehow Beaumont saw nothing of his father ruthlessness or his mother coldness, the young Mérante had warm eyes and a kind disposition his teacher hoped would stay there even if Louis would go and crash against the walls of the competitive and somewhat relentless ballet world. Nodding affectionately, Beaumont left and Louis had nothing to keep him company but his thoughts. He bathed, dressed, had a light lunch and headed for the Opera House. His juvenile figure darkened by the black hat and his walk, once light and elegantly carefree was now serious and resolute, like if no step was taken in vain. On the main street he had to wait for a hay cart to cross and a light smell of roses reached him. He had to hurry, the audition would start soon and it was always better to be the first, for it would turn you to a reference point in comparison to everybody else´s performance Being Romeo in the play was only another step. Louis entered the stage with decision written all over his face making many of his peers and veteran dancers far longer in the business, ask themselves why did they even bother competing against the ballet virtuoso. Mérante danced and the whole world held its breath, the role of Juliet had already been taken weeks ago by Joan D´Autrelle, the current prima ballerina; and yet nobody deemed inadequate a far younger Romeo for the experienced female dancer. If Mérante was the one to take it…well, that´s how it was. After Louis performed, only 3 more dancers came to challenge him for the part, but the role was his and they all knew it. He came back home that afternoon with 3 tickets to the Opera for the premiere evening and a huge satisfied grin when he saw his parents' dislike, for they knew every step Louis took towards fame and immortality in ballet, was another stone in the catastrophe when he´d leave it all for teaching. After the sun set behind the horizon, Mérante left the quiet comfort of his bed to climb through the windowsill and get to the roof, breathing the night air and looking at the silver moon. The navy blue sky was clear, the starlight bathing the city, twinkling as if they were a thousand ballerinas wearing jewel crowns and waiting to dance on stage. Mérante thought it a miracle the prima ballerina at the time was much older than him; else his parents might arrange his marriage and tie him as they had tied themselves; he regretted the way he´d kicked on his relationship with them, for in spite of everything, he still loved them, but if there was no other way… well, then there wasn´t. Paris was still experiencing huge changes, transforming itself from the dark medieval era to the light and romantic city it was today. And, from what he´d seen, it would compete as well to have one of the largest structures ever built, a huge steel tower which the newspaper said to be the new apple in the country´s eyes; not that Mérante cared that much for engineering but the size of its foundations was just massive, coupled together with how much technology and money were being invested showed how badly France wished the world to see her. -Just like my family- he thought with a bitter smile, running fingers along his thick black hair and gazing at the sky once more. -If I ever have a family of my own, I swear to break every single tradition and custom that has made us become the selfish brats we are today. Sighing he climbed down to his room and dreamt of hectic cities, busy streets he crossed hurriedly as he laughed and ran from a policeman, distinguishing a lightly sweet smell of flowers he could not identify. He saw a black lion running in the wild, a wolf howling to the winter moon with its paws submerged in a sea of blue rose petals, the Opera House at the back. He woke up panting, but managed to get back to sleep and the next day, after breaking his fast, he went to the Opera for rehearsal. Deep within his thoughts, never realized he was heading straight to someone´s back until he crashed against it. -Ouch! - came out a male voice, sounding hurt and surprised. The young dancer apologized and saw that the other boy was about his same age and height, bulky with curly auburn hair and bright green eyes. \"Irish\" he thought with a smile, his previous teacher had been Irish as well. -Careful there mate! You had me brekky spilled all over my coat! Mérante had a bit difficulty figuring out his accent but after seeing his deeply appalled face and the old rag he called a coat, Louis realized the situation. But he was late for the Opera already… -I´m deeply sorry- he said sincerely, -I´ll tell you what, right now I´m in a hurry to get somewhere but if you wait for me right here, I´ll treat you on my way back… won´t be until noon though- he specified, rehearsals where long and required every bit of energy. -Uhmm- -My name is Mérante, Louis Mérante- he introduced himself extending a hand. -Oh, bloody hell, mate- he said after much thinking and shook a dirty hand against Mérante´s black leather glove, -I´m Connor, and I just wanted to have breakfast, bloody difficult to find food that cheap these days you see, but how do I know you´ll come back? Louis took a gold chain watch from his pocket, he might be taking a bit too much risk, but he always thought taking anything from the poor was the lowest point of anyone´s ethics. He offered Connor his watch. -Would this be enough guarantee? The big green eyes got even bigger, reflecting the morning light and almost seemed to clear the mist away from the Seine, which flowed freely and blue, underneath the bridge they were on. -You sure mate? I could make a living from that -I´m sure. See you later then- he waved and hurried to the Opera, he could always save and buy a new watch, Connor could live with a full stomach for another month, in the long run it didn´t matter that much. The rehearsal was as demanding as he´d imagined, by the end Joan was the only one with energy left to cope with him and a noisy snort came from the musician's orchestra spot when Romeo made his final dance, a tiny green poison bottle at the center of the stage. -You sure have the energy of a lion, boy- Madame Joan congratulated him after everyone had waved their goodbyes and a brunette violinist made a terrible attempt in talking to Monsieur Mérante, Louis bowed, genuinely surprised at the prima ballerina´s compliment. -You too Madame D´Autrelle, couldn´t think of anyone more enthusiastic to dance with. -All those turns… aren´t you a bit hazy? -I confess I am Madame – he said honestly, -which is why I must hurry to a more private place. -Of course – she agreed smiling, ever charming as she left. Louis grabbed one of the wooden columns at the corner as he tried to steady himself. -You trying to break a record? - said a familiar voice. -Monsieur Beaumont- he realized who had made the noisy snort from before, -I´m trying to give my parents something so they stop pestering me in the future- he confessed in a rush metallic voice, Beaumont couldn´t make out if he was angry or jolly. -The violin girl would surely like you pestering her- the teacher added jokingly. -Whether it´s me or the money I´m making remains to be seen. -It´s good you are that weary- he patted Mérante´s back as he helped him to get back to the dressing room. -How come? -Means you´re not stupid As the young dancer dressed himself neatly, Beaumont invited him for lunch, Louis tried to excuse himself as he told him the incident with the Irish boy from the morning. -Well, might as well go with you. It´s quite possible the guy has left with your watch in his rag of a coat…-he said between laughs, -for someone with a lion´s guts you sure are gullible. -I´m not- said Louis putting on his gloves as they left the Opera House, -I gave it to him as an apology, it´s up to him which one he prefers. -A watch or a single meal? - Beaumont said disbelievingly. -A watch or a job that would feed him- Mérante retorted -Did you tell him that? -I will. As they made their way to the bridge with the scorching summer sun above their heads, protecting their eyes from the stone street´s reflection, trying to see the auburn curly hair among a sea of velvet top-hats, silk and lace parasols and huge hats with dead animals and exotic feathers on them. Louis sighed. -He´s not here -Thought you weren´t coming at all mate- said a young voice behind him, Mérante and Beaumont turned and saw the boy with the watch hanging around his thumb, a majestic smile on his face and his bulky appearance a bit overwhelming -Thought you were gone -C´mon- he said, -I wouldn´t be a very good police candidate if I did. The three of them stayed in silence for a little bit, each surprised at the other. -I´m really hungry you know- Connor said with a cheeky grin -Of course- Beaumont regained his composture, -I´m Monsieur Beaumont, Mérante´s teacher and you are…- he said introducing himself. -Connor O´Neal, pleased to meet you sir- he said shaking hands, making Beaumont realize he was no beggar or street-boy at all, he was only very dirty and possibly very poor. -Let´s head for lunch then – said the teacher grabbing Louis by the arm, -I know an excellent little place by the river, just next to Notre Dame. After ordering their meal, Connor told them he was the son of a policeman killed in duty, his mother had died when he was little and he was hoping to make a living by entering the police body next month; so at the moment Connor was only surviving long enough to get there. On their part, Mérante said he was expecting to become a famous ballet teacher but first he had to excel at the dance to get rid of his family demands and Beaumont was helping him, Connor couldn´t quite get it. -Why don´t you just leave? -I can´t, I owe them a bit after all they´ve given me. Consider it as paying a debt. -You sure are honorable Mérante- Connor was amused, -This morning you were ready to give me your watch… -Yeah, let us hope this good sense gets you somewhere other than the streets for giving everything away- said Beaumont. They all laughed and enjoyed their meal. By the end of it, Louis thought he had known Connor from years and he sincerely looked forward to the next time he´d see him. -I´ll send you notes to let you know how I´m doing, won´t see you till I become a student in the police station. They shook hands and parted ways not without Connor saying next time, he´d pay the meal. -All right young man… we better start… -I´m glad -Excuse me? -Glad at least I have a good acquaintance outside the ballet world that I´m sure will remain in sympathy with me after I´ve sent everything down the privy. -Mérante, we´ve discussed this before – his teacher retorted sadly, -Those who truly are friends remain so no matter anything. -I know, but I don´t know how many of those I have. -At the moment, there´s two. The young dancer raised an inquisitive eyebrow, his sharp good-looking features turned to a puzzled expression -Connor and me- said Beaumont with a reassuring smile. Louis nodded and they both headed for the Mérante residence, there was still a lot of practice before tomorrow. A/N Hello everyone! I´m worried about my Mérante analysis so I don´t know if he´s too much OoC, but pls hold on with me ;) As usual, I hope you can review and comment on what you guys think so I know if it´s a good idea to continue or just leave it to rest in my imagination haha XD; I´ll anwer to reviews by PM in a bit, as usual if you spot grammar and/or spelling mistakes, please let me know to correct it. Thanks a lot and have a great day![Chapter 3] Chapter III A dancing wolf maid The blue rose in the box had lost some petals since she arrived in Paris, almost two weeks ago. The first thing she did when jumping off the hay cart was looking where she would live. An inn was too expensive and renting wasn´t even on the table. Apolline had recommended her to look somewhere she could pay for her meals, her staying and so forth, yet Odette wasn´t too sure about how she´d manage to attend classes during the day and work for a living at the same time. The only chance was to work at night or during weekends Thinking like this, she looked for taverns where they´d be either set to hire underage girls for how much cheaper it was, or unscrupulous enough to have them as barmaids and waitresses to entertain the night while the customers´ purse grew thin. Odette was especially weary of this last type of job. Finally, she came to this unusual tavern managed by a middle aged woman with her older brother, \"Britain´s Bride\" was the name of it, the first to the right on the Rue Royale and the seventh Odette visited looking for a job; the woman was named Orlena and her brother Philippe; much as the tavern, they were both British, and Odette couldn´t help but wonder if they had welcomed her when she said she´d clean the privy till its wood shone like the emperor´s or when she mentioned her status as a ballerina student. That evening, Odette understood why. Orlena and Philippe hosted noisy night parties, where every customer was like family, they usually where either Irish or British with the occasional French popping by to see what was the cause of such merriment, for Orlena could dance to the tune of traditional folk fiddle, jabbing and stomping on top of chairs and tables, making Odette marvel at her freedom of performance and truly taste the sweet liqueur of improvised dancing that flourished from the heart. She wrote so to Hugo and Apolline, who wrote back saying the proposal she refused to ask about before she left was on their impending marriage, which they planned to celebrate in winter so she could join them together with the rest of the villagers, along with the letter came a small papermade box. \"Forgot to put it in the box together with the rose little one. It´s meant to remind why you´re there, so you don´t get discouraged\" – wrote Hugo \"See you in winter\" The package contained a small howling wolf pendant that tinkled whenever she moved and earned a few intrigued looks from her bosses, who now called her the wolfmaid, playing with the \"barmaid\" word. Their teasing could have irritated Odette if she hadn´t been so absorbed by the academy. Ballet was tough, it was an art, true. But there was technique and science to it; Odette obsessed with perfecting the right moves, the exact position even when Florance, her school tutor, asked her to ignore it altogether until she had found the grace to perform. -Else you´ll look like you´re about to break; your toes must be iron hard but flexible as sallow branches. -But if I don´t perfect it, I´ll never get to the Opera- whispered Odette under her breath. -The Opera House accepts only the best; if there´s no beauty to your dance I seriously doubt you´ll ever get there Yet the girl who somehow smelled of roses wasn´t even close. Florance suggested not to starch her tutu until her movement was more fluid, the rich mist-like fabric concealed how stiff Odette was. -Careful though- warned Florance, -the material left starchless is highly flammable but as long as you keep your skirts out of the lamp´s gas reach, you should be fine. Well, that wouldn´t be a problem, if Odette didn´t show progress on her somehow good technique but graceless movements, she would stay at the backstage forever. Philippe advised her in his own way, of the little he knew of ballet but of the expert he was as a fiddler. -Violin also is an art you know, and requires a lot of technique to be played amazingly; but in the end, art requires feelings and that´s what makes it memorable- he lectured her, -Many artists had probably been the best performers but what your audience takes to heart is what you said with your music or with your dance. -Humans were made to feel my darling – added Orlena filling the jars on Odette´s tray with cold foaming Irish beer and strong amber whisky in small crystal shot glasses, -Anyone who believes otherwise is tragically mistaken. -Hey girl!- demanded a customer. -You´re being summoned wolfmaid- said Philippe with a smile as he took his violin out and made \"Britain´s Bride\" famous for yet another night of homeland´s fiddling. Odette shrugged and for nights in a row, after she´d cleaned and everybody was gone, she would put her tutu on and danced through the tavern on her ballet pointes, her wolf necklace jingling in every turn and every twirl, the blue nightlight coming from the windows diminished the yellow light coming from the hearth and the wooden roof candlewheels, massive wine barrels were stacked up the back wall. For an instant, Odette thought she was on her own stage, one she had built herself with tired muscles, broken bones with tears and with blood, where the firebreath of her dragon couldn´t get her for she was faraway, in a place where only stars shone, wolves howled and ballerinas danced… it was all covered in blue velvet. Odette opened her eyes, Orlena had a hand on her lips and tears running down her cheeks. -I think you´ve found it girl- she said trying to get hold of herself, -That was truly beautiful…-she wiped her face using her apron, -You were dreaming of something. Odette froze, she hadn´t really said anything about her past and frankly, doubted she ever would. But the tone in Orlena´s voice demanded for some kind of answer and from her point of view, Odette could say any stupid thing with just the right trembling volume in her voice and Orlena would fall for it. -My dream was blue – there, it was stupid and it wasn´t really a lie… yet like many things, it wasn´t the whole truth… but it still had the amount of it Orlena needed and the one Odette was willing to give. The tavern owner nodded knowingly and picked some trays up to take them upstairs. -Mine are red, Philippe says it´s because I´m too passionate. What do you think? -It´s because you are red- Orlena seemed confused, but then smiled and turned around to leave. After that night Florance noticed her dancing had improved exponentially, but nonetheless Odette refused to have her tutu starched -It´s tradition. Now you´ll look sloppy- she argued. -You think? - Odette retorted, -I think my skirts look like the snow dust a wolf leaves when they run. Florance was about to say nothing could be farther from any normal person´s imagination but the girl interrupted her: -I know I still have a lot to learn, and I still need to perfect many aspects of my dancing but I want you to consider issuing a recommendation letter for me, addressed to the Ballet Academy at the Opera House. Florance´s frown made her brows look as one single line. -Please- she asked joining hands in front of her, -I´ll work hard, if I´m accepted it´ll lift the level of the school plus you´d get to be among the best ballet tutors in the city. Florance gazed at her pupil´s big almond shaped eyes, \"the color of midnight sky\" she thought once, sparkling with that inner wild strength she had about her… and she believed in her, may God had mercy on her, she believed in her. -Alright, but no guarantees Odette. I´m not really that big within the Opera House or in high ballet circles- she pointed out, wanting the flowery smelly girl´s full attention, -And even if you do get there, it´ll only be harder. -I know, and I also wanted to ask you for something else… Florance crossed her arms in front of her chest -I´d like…- she started, barely a whisper. -¿Huh? Louder girl- -I´d really appreciate…if…- Florance could hardly hear her, Odette´s toes traced small circles on the floor -Gracious God, is that pendant just for show? Howl girl!- the tutor shouted. -I´d like to have the old blue jars that are in the storage! – Odette shouted back, Florance was pleased -What for? -My employer said every good barmaid gets to add a bit of decoration to the tavern; makes the place look quainter. And I want to put those jars in. Florance thought it weird, but said nothing as she gave her permission not before asking the address of her working place, promising to go whenever she had the time. Odette brought five jars back and before Orlena could say anything about her strange decoration idea, the girl knotted some old ropes she found next to a dock by the river, making five sort of nests for each jar and tied them up to the roof, the jars dangled along the joists and candlewheels. -They look like huge blue honeycombs- said Orlena -Well, Odette- pointed her brother, -you sure added the weirdest deco…up until now the Fleurdelisé flag over there had been the strangest thing in here, someone even painted up some of the chairs and tables in sky blue and put an anchor in that corner… -Anything from the wolfmaid- retorted Orlena teasingly, Odette rolled her eyes. For the next few weeks her ballet became increasingly appealing and her technique perfected, Florance said her recommendation wasn´t that far ahead. -Hey Odette- said Orlena one evening, her devilry low tone making Odette rather uncomfortable, -Have you ever been actually in the Opera House? -No- she said, not knowing what to expect. -Well, I happen to have tickets to see their next play \"Romeo and Juliet\", they say the next ballet prince will perform as the protagonist. -I don´t care about princes- she said honestly, -If I happen to go, my eyes will be on Joan D´Autrelle the whole time. -You´re not funny girl, I think is that skinny form of yours, if you had a bit more curves…- -Lena, that´s an invitation to the Opera, right? - Odette interrupted genuinely amused, her blue eyes blazed in diversion. -Well- Orlena decided to pull her strings a bit more –Let´s make a bet: if you win, I´ll take you to the Opera with the tickets, if I win… I will starch your white tutu! Odette opened her mouth to protest but thought better -You know how much I love my white tutu… -Of course! That´s what makes it fun silly– voiced Philippe. -Alright, we´ll compete over what? - asked the girl, knowing she had no way out. -Over the number of customers who ask for either the bartender or the wolfmaid!- suggested Philippe as he finished polishing his violin. -No way- said Orlena, -Everybody loves to be served by the girl that reeks of roses. -I don´t reek! -But you do smell of roses! – Orlena retorted, more than once she had tried to find the good quality perfume in Odette´s room that lasted all day long. But it was useless, she had come to accept the blatant truth of the girl´s scent. -Fine, fine… how about the amount of tips? Cash only That was interesting, Orlena would tend the customers that looked wealthier but Odette´s slender frame would look after more tables. -Works for me. -Right Said both at the same time. When \"Britain´s Bride\" opened, both would look at their tables with hungry eyes, so much so that Philippe thought they´d scare customers away or at least someone would try to cross and overstep the boundaries with Odette, and since Orlena could take care of herself, both siblings had often had to punch some faces without the girl noticing; even so, Odette was no simple-minded little dancer. She had mastered the use of her heavy serving tray as a flying weapon on her own, and her flowy sapphire skirt would fly away of the trespasser´s table. The competition was just for fun, Philippe realized, there was no way his sister wouldn´t take Odette to the function. Odette threw some coins to her cash stack as well as a couple of tickets to the theatre a guy gave her intending to take her out, but she just grabbed them both and thanked him as she walked away. She hurried to tend another, very crowded table of about eight people, almost getting on each other´s laps as they tried to fit in the little corner on the platform top at the back of the bar. She approached without going up the couple steps that separated her from them. -Hey yoh! -It´s the wolfmaid! -What can I do for you? - she asked politely, trying her nickname didn´t get her nerves. -Eight beer pints, the best you have! We´re celebrating! -Of course- she said, turning to leave and avoid the irritating green look in one of them, not much older than herself, with curly auburn hair. -Get ahold of yourself man! – laughed one of them. -Connor is all drooling over the little woman! -I´m not!- he said in a sorry attempt of defense, -Why do you call her wolfmaid? -No idea -She´s wild! -I heard she ate someone´s hand off after he tried to… you know what. -That must be it! More laughs Odette steadied herself next to the big beer barrel as she filled the pints, trying to think of nothing but the \"Romeo and Juliet\" ballet play. A/N Hey guys! Is this worth it? Did you like it? Please let me know! Anyway, I´m updating two chapters because my town´s having a bit of wifi difficulties[Chapter 4] Chapter IV Last dance \" Hey there mate! Can´t believe you´re the one from every brochure stuck on the streets lampposts, dressed in those damn tight things… man, must say you don´t look too good and I find quite irritating how the ladies think exactly the opposite. Anyway, I´m already enrolled in the academy. It´s a couple of years and then I´ll be out in dark alleys fighting for justice´s sake. Next week my peers and I will go to a very popular bar around here; it´s on Rue Royale I think and it´s called Britain´s Bride, they say proper music is played there and the bartender dances to it. Should you decide to join me, please let me know, I think you´ll be very busy though, it´s the previous night to your premiere. Nonetheless, please tell me everything about how you´re doing. Cheers! Connor\" Mérante folded the paper, he was willing to reply later and Connor would understand his delay. Usually he would answer the note straightaway after receiving it but not today; what occupied most of his thoughts was how Romeo and Juliet could be his last performance… if he managed to break the fouetté record, he could throw the damn award to his parents and be done with the whole thing. He needn´t more fame, Europe knew him and honestly, his mind was set on being a teacher far longer than a dancer; so he dismissed the mailman and headed for his private practice room, Beaumont was there and Mérante was relieved he shared his view on the performance, if Louis turned it into something as big as when France announced the Eiffel´s construction, then it was more than likely his parents would leave him be. That was basically the reason why he practiced to exhaustion, he knew the value of hard work and the fact that it didn´t really mattered where one came from in terms of talent, either you had it or you didn´t and the rest came from no small degree of willpower and guts; like a train going full speed to which one tried desperately to board, knowing it wouldn´t stop to wait. The love he held for ballet was special, he´d given it his childhood, soon he would´ve given it all his teenage years and he planned on devoting his adulthood as well; Beaumont jokingly said ballet would be his bride and his shroud… Louis wasn´t sure if it was a jest or his fate was woven into it the way his mother used to wove flowers in her hair when he was a little boy, there even was a song for her somewhere within the depths of the library. Days where hectic and full of dancing, girls from the Opera trying to ask him out and the world spinning before his dark hazel eyes as he performed the fouettés. The nights as well, full of that winter howling wolf dreams with blue roses on the snow, running lions and laughs of the policeman who chased after him. And after three days… -120… -Mérante, that´s good enough. -125… -Mérante, I said stop. -132… -LOUIS MÉRANTE!- shouted Beaumont and he stopped turning, grabbing his head in an effort to keep it on top of his neck and not flying across the country. -You´re not good at all if on that day you´re too nauseous to perform- his tutor scolded. -I´ve got to do this. -You already broke the record. -If I don´t get over the last one by a fair amount of fouettés they won´t be satisfied and you know that. Beaumont sat beside him on the wooden floor and put his elbows on his knees -I know that. They stayed in silence for a while, Louis had to keep practicing but for now he just tried to keep his eyes from turning. -Connor´s been writing, hasn´t he? -Yeah. -How´s he? -He´s entered the police forces, next week he´ll be celebrating with his new friends while I stand in front of a hundred lights and spin around till I vomit. -Don´t sound so bitter. -I´m not, I just can´t wait. Beaumont patted his head, as if he was a little boy and convinced him to give a couple more rounds before dinner. After an estranged meal animated only by the coming and going of servants with food platters, his tutor waved goodbye and Louis headed for his rooms leaving his parents to discuss the newspaper and whatever gossip his mother had picked in the city´s tea square. He laid down on his bed, still fully dressed and looked over Connor´s note again. Mérante couldn´t make it to the bar, that much was clear and his friend knew it, which was probably why he was extending a further invitation. With no small amount of laziness, Louis sat up and went to his desk trying to think on a decent reply; he wrote him he was still practicing for the play in which he´d hope to break a world record and finally be free, also saying he´d love to go to the tavern with him but it´d have to wait till after the season premiere and a week extra with little presentations now and then. Louis knew how little things would change if he couldn´t make a significant amount of fouettés in his performance, he´d have to wait for another perfect chance to do something incredibly stupid in miraculous circumstances and seize the opportunity to emancipate. But if he did break the chains, he´d have to design a plan to adjust his way of living to probably a far thriftier one; Beaumont said he could go and live with him and that he already had recommendations and other formalities for him to start teaching right away at the Opera House but Mérante wanted, through his own hard work, earn his own place with his own money. Not that he didn´t make enough; but living with his parents implied having the Opera giving them all his wages and payments, much of which were gone in mother´s lavish expenses and father´s travels. He finished the note back for Connor and rang the bell to send it first thing in the morning for the servants… it would be interesting when servants where gone and he´d have to go to the post office and send the letters himself, he was actually looking forward to it. Mérante removed his clothes, leaving only the undergarments, too tired to put on his night clothing, he laid there again and fell in a dreamless sleep. At the rehearsal next day, Beaumont told him he would be talking to the director about his farewell as a dancer only if he did make all the fouettés he was planning. -What is your top number? -150 -That´s quite ambitious Mérante, yesterday you were having difficulties just reaching 135 -I will reach them. -Alright – he said, trusting the boy´s guts and gumption. By the afternoon, Louis could barely look at something without thinking it was moving on its own \"Or am I the one that´s moving?\" The prima ballerina surprised him the following morning by saying confidentially she would be retiring soon. -You really sure Madame D´Autrelle? -Oh yes my boy, there´s a moment when you realize you should leave the stage before you break your hips and leave it to the next generation – she winked at him, -and, since the European audience already loves and knows you, I have no regrets, you´re already a familiar face Mérante; and I´ve seen you dancing since your big debut some years ago. Some call you the Ballet Prince -she whispered looking at the young man´s handsome features, -though sometimes I think you´re nothing but a grumpy lion. Mérante nodded, slightly amused by the comparison and limited to watch as she walked away, her long blond hair falling into a cascade as she released it from the hairnet. Despite the age difference Madame D´Autrelle was a good dancer, one from which Mérante was sincerely sorry to be parting ways from. -By the way Mérante, -she said from the stage back entrance, -my family and I were thinking of taking a long holiday but the train tickets are the same day as a theatre function I was planning to go with them… Would you like to have them? Louis who had an arm raised in second position, lowered it to look at Joan incredulously -I´m not into theatre Madame. -Oh please boy, -she said waving a hand- I´ll go get them from my dressing room, at least they´ll be a distraction from work for you and a respite for your parents. I hear they´ve been really distressed lately. Mérante couldn´t ask how she knew that since she left the stage to look for the theatre tickets. If he was to go to the function he´ll probably never ask them to accompany him. Madame D´Autrelle came back with a small yellow envelope she gave him with one of her enchanting smiles. -There´s three of them. -You´re too kind -Nonsense, consider it a parting gift- she said while leaving the wooden boards and moving towards the exit hallway. Mérante discussed with Beaumont over dinner what it meant for Parisian ballet the fact that one and potentially two of its most prominent figures would leave the stage. The Seine waters ran in front of the restaurant they were in while the waiter, dressed in a good tailored frac, brought their food; a light fresh salad with raspberries for Mérante and herb-crusted lamb chops and creamy pommé dauphine for his tutor. -They´ll manage. New blood is always needed. Louis didn´t reply immediately. -D´Autrelle gave me tickets for a theatre function, said it was a parting gift. -Really? What is it called? -Don´t know, don´t even know if I want to go. -Mérante you need to stop this attitude- retorted Beaumont in a low voice. -Excuse me? -This sensation of dread you have about you. Like if the apocalypse was approaching. You´re only going to change jobs, for heaven´s sake boy! -I´m sorry, it´s just… well, I don´t know what to expect -What do you mean? You´ve known tutors all your life! Sure you can imitate one. -Yes, but… -But? -What if I´m not good enough? -…Huh? -What if I got it all wrong and that is not what I´m supposed to be? What if it´s all an illusion woken by nice words someone told me once? -Did you knock your head somewhere? Of course it´s an illusion! Mérante raised both eyebrows and his skin became so white the candlelight made him look like a ghost -Every dream is an illusion until you work in bringing it to reality. Yes, they´re nice words as you said, but they must be strong enough you would live and bleed and die for them. Don´t think I don´t know you´re taking a high plunge here Mérante… but the important thing is your willingness in jumping, if it was totally delusional I´d talk you out of it and you know I would. But I think it reasonable because being a tutor is who you truly are, who you are meant to be… but of course that doesn´t imply your path would be free of thorns and obstacles. His pupil looked at him intently, drinking his words in. -There are times Mérante… when you just have to bet, rationally, but to bet anyway and hope for the best. If it doesn´t work entirely the way you expected, and believe me it would happen more often than not, then you work on some adjustments to make it look as you saw it in your mind…it´s just called life my boy. Mérante remained quiet the rest of the evening and Monseiur Beaumont left him be, while they both shook hands and headed for their respective homes, Louis whispered: -I´m sorry I´ve been so sullen these days- he apologized, his sharp dark hazel look drilling into Beaumont –I won´t be anymore, your words… your words were like a slap in the face to be honest, but they worked. I hope you can join me to the theater in a couple of weeks. -Of course- his tutor smiled back as they parted. The days passed quickly, but Mérante lived them intensely. Like if the fact of not dancing in public after \"Romeo and Juliet\" pushed him to a deeper level of connection with the movements, with the music, with everything he had mastered until that moment and he spun and turned and made all the fouettés he wanted…until he reached 150 the day before the premiere. He slept in the Opera that night as was his custom every time a premiere was launched, Beaumont brought tea with golden bread that cracked deliciously when pressed between his fingers and creamy light cheese to get him by the day, everything pointing towards the night. Mérante looked at Paris from the Opera´s roof, he was fully dressed and the rich black velvet of his custom was crossed with freshwater pearls on the sleeves, black leather belt and a rose knitted in fine black silk shreds on his back. The City of Light displayed its exuberance even from the heights, Louis thought about how old the city was and how many things had the river, the grass and the stones seen, his previous worries gone with the night wind and the silver moonlight touching his world in that decisive event. Below him, people were filling the audience seats attracted by the promise of the prima ballerina´s last dances and, even if they didn´t know it, his own. He went down hearing rushed voices and the rustle of last minute preparations on stage, the red fabric protecting them all from the spectators. Next time he was in this situation, he´d be nervous for the presentation of his own students, as for right now… the nerves were crushed beneath his willpower and his whole being was consumed by sheer concentration on dancing his best. Not caring if he moved everybody to tears or to laugh, to cheer or to dread; that was his last dance, a moment reserved between the ballet and himself. Beaumont wished him luck, he just nodded and absentmindedly passed in front of his own parents, although it didn´t matter that much anymore, sometimes he though Ballet itself had brought him into the world. The play developed smoothly, in between his executions on stage people told him he was making history, that it was the best representation of romantic ballet they´ve ever seen and the director smiled sadly, because of Beaumont he knew it was his last public appearance as a dancer but nevertheless, he pressed his hand against Mérante´s shoulder and murmured barely over a whisper -This is beautiful Mérante… please, rest assured that you have a position amongst the tutors here, if we´re lucky I can promise you the post of Maître Ballet in the Opera House for the future. This put him on edge, the greatest position of ballet tutoring in France… if he could get there, then the rest would slowly fall into place. And then came his last performance for the night, Romeo´s death and Mérante´s immortality with his fouettés. He started and never stopped till finishing, for that was who he was. And as he turned, he realized that was his purpose for dancing, and therefore it didn´t matter if he performed for an audience or for himself, if he had a small child in front of him full of dancing dreams and butterfly hopes that could fly in the sunlight. The purpose was there, dancing or tutoring. He loved ballet and would see it develop from beginning to end, like he was and infant and the dance itself was his tutor. That was it, he needed no more and he was content. The music ceased and so did he. The spectators were silent… but he was about to lose it. Then, everything happened too fast for any clear recollections, something red appeared before his eyes and the audience on the other side cheered and clapped, like a roar, like a beast threatening to bring the whole stage down. Beaumont came to his side first. -Mérante- he seemed out of breath, -187… you did… -A bucket- he interrupted his tutor as he tried to reach the dressing room, -I need a bucket. But he couldn´t leave the stage before emptying his stomach right on the spot. A/N Tadah! Spoiler promise: Next chapter they´ll meet ;) I hope to be posting it tomorrow, but expect it throughout the weekend XD[Chapter 5] Chapter V The lion and the wolf -Hmmm, hum…- Odette hummed the play´s music as she made her way towards her academy. Weeks had passed since \"Romeo and Juliet\" premiere, but the power of the ballet danced there had been enough to move her very core… she wondered if the wolf in her cried then. After all Louis Mérante, the Ballet Prince, had broken a world record before her very eyes, nearly all she heard about at school ever since was about how Mérante had carved his name in ballet´s history with 187 fouettés in a single solo, he vomited later of course, but no one seemed to care and Odette could only remember as she rocked dreamily from one side to the other, of his elegant silhouette turning and spinning without stopping. Her admiration for the dancer fueled when she heard he´d become a tutor at the Opera House, the youngest ever. Now, that was a great way to leave the stage… breaking a record with both the audience and the ballet teacher´s world. Even Florance admitted how difficult it had been for her to acquire the tutor´s license, and she had been 10 years older than Mérante at the time. But after Odette debuted at a small recital, the feeling of being able to touch the stars as she danced came stronger than ever, a whole sparkling world shining inside her… she decided that´s what she would try to share with her spectators, as Philippe had said once: the technique is important to your art, but the feelings make it unique. Her flowy starchless tutu was already famous by the locals and her peers, some older and some younger, admired all the different tricks Odette would find for training, for she could discover ways of perfecting her grace everywhere she put her gaze on, like if she was born for it. Whether it was at the academy or on the street on her way back to Britain´s Bride, Odette could dance taking as partners the snow and the rain, the ray lights from either romantic twilights or thunderstorms. She wrote to Hugo and Madame Apolline on Fridays and received their reply on Sundays and after her debut on the small stage, Monsieur Hugo would send a bouquet of blue roses after every single time she presented, honoring her performance and Odette would sigh and weep for she knew the trip was perhaps too much to ask for her friends´ bones, but it didn´t imply she didn´t miss them. On those nights she would dream she was already dancing at the Opera House, the dressing rooms filled with blue roses, woven on the canopies, the windowsills and around the mirrors, her fierce dragon sleeping at the back of her mind and the audience cheering her dance as the light rosesmell perfumed the air. She dreamt of a policeman drinking spiced wine from a golden goblet as he chased a black lion on the streets, heading for the Opera, but when it put its front paw on the white marble entrance floor, the dragon woke. Odette would cry, the dragon snaked its red tongue along sharp white teeth and breathed smoke as it engulfed her in bright yellow flames, the stage turned to ash and there was screaming as the lion roared to the winter night. -ODETTE! She woke up, her cheeks flushed and damped in tears, her chestnut hair splayed and tangled all over the pillows. -What is it? - Orlena´s face had worry all over it. -There… there was a fire… and it destroyed everything. Orlena put her strong arms around Odette to cradle her. -Hush, there´s no fire. \"Damn it, girl… when did we start caring so much about you?\" She asked herself as her gaze studied Odette´s nightstand; a withered bunch of blue roses landed its gray petals on the wood next to the old candlestick and the young ballerina´s wolf pendant rested between pieces of old hardened wax. Orlena smiled and grabbed it. -You said this necklace gave you a purpose, right? So never stop wearing it and maybe the nightmares will go –She recommended while securing the thin silver chain around the girl´s neck, -tomorrow´s night we´ll go to the theatre function using the tickets that stupid customer gave you and I´ll tell you what… Let´s go shopping during the day. We´ll leave Philippe taking care of stuff here. Odette smiled, really smiled and Orlena knew she couldn´t help but caring about her sweet wolfmaid. Always trying to be tough and take on the challenges and never asking for help… Odette was covered in iron to be sure, but beneath all that wild beauty and cold demeanor was a tender heart longing for something Orlena could not yet see. -Go to sleep, little girl, go to sleep- she said as she sang one of the many Irish folksongs she was fond of dancing. The next day was full of excitement; Odette had never gone shopping before and the packets wrapped in colorful silkpaper and hard decorated boxes were a whole new spectacle for her. -So…- whispered Orlena when they came back home, - do you like him? -Who? –said Odette without really listening, sorting their shopping -The cute police boy -Which police boy? -Green eyes, curly hair? The one that hasn´t stopped coming every now and then since the other night- -Oh- replied Odette giving little thought about it, -not really, I mean he´s a nice fellow- she admitted while piling up her bags and boxes, -but I´m not really into that sort of thing right now. -You´re not funny girl, that´s strike two. -Huh? -Whatever- Orlena gave up throwing her arms up in the air. –Go and dress yourself, I´m determined to steal some glances out of rich men tonight and it won´t happen if I´m accompanied by someone who looks so ordinary- she said to sting at Odette´s pride. As usual, she didn´t, the girl shrugged and taking her recently acquired belongings, headed for her room. Once in there, Odette proceeded to undress herself and looked at her reflection in the mirror… she might have been a bit curvier around her hips and the silhouette of her breasts wasn´t as big as the newspaper models, but there was something delicate about her movements and she liked to think it made up for her slender forms and truth be told, it wasn´t as bad as Orlena made her believe… she wasn´t flat as a board and there were still some years of woman´s growth ahead of her. The fair skin had a uniform coloring, getting rosy on her cheeks and creamy white on her throat and arms. Her long face gave her a touch of elegance and it was cradled amongst the wavy chestnut locks of her hair. The bright blue eyes had a dark undertone Odette found secretly mysterious, for they appeared almost black when she got angry and so blue when she was happy they looked almost violet. In the end Odette sighed and shrugged once more, there were things about herself she liked and others she didn´t as any other person; but she trusted Orlena´s shopping for her did a bit more than accentuate her thin waistline or the pallor in her complexion, so fashionable at the time. She started ripping the packages and opening the boxes to get ready; in 45 minutes she was done. Looking at her reflection once again, she decided to leave her long hair loose and wear no jewelry except the small pearl earrings Orlena had got for her and the silver wolf pendant dangling freely just beneath the white lace surrounding her neckline. The long sleeves made unnecessary the use of any bracelets. -You´ll leave your hair like that? - asked Orlena when she saw her. -Yes – she said, not so sure now that she saw the high bun the bartender had made above her head. -Leave her Lena- intervened Phillippe, -I think it suits her- he added sincerely looking at the girl, the long sapphire blue velvet dress had a square neck cut with white lace on its borders, her eyes were impossibly blue and her hair… Odette looked like a wild ice maiden. -You look beautiful too- she said shyly looking at Orlena, the woman had bought a night fantasy dress with red silk skirts and black see-through fabric for her arms, she wore big amber stones for her neck and ears and a shiny Spanish shawl above her arms. -Alright, tonight we´ll not worry about anything, understood? - said Orlena with fierce determination, -For I reckon tomorrow we´ll realize our savings have gone down the privy…- she added on a lower tone. -The carriage is here milady- announced Philippe in an amused voice, as he took the money out to pay for the rented carriage and gave it to his sister, -Don´t drink too much, alright? -Yes, I promise – replied Orlenna as she climbed to the vehicle followed by Odette. Philippe waved at them till the horses turned around the corner, he lighted the torch outside the back entrance of the tavern and opened its front gate, he hoped not many customers would pop by tonight. The theater was built not too far away from Notre Dame and it had the typical gothic look of most Parisian buildings… tall and gloomy at the top, warm and modern on the inside. Orlena instructed the driver to come back after the play and they both walked in; the bar tender waved at some friends and dragged Odette along with her, the woman chatted the minutes away as the girl contented herself with looking at the polished stairs, beautiful crystalware filled with cold white wine on some of the waiter´s trays as others had dark glass cups with another type of alcohol in them. Not knowing very well why, she grabbed one. The young waiter, too distracted looking at her hair and her dress, didn´t even ask her if she was old enough to drink. Odette sensed the cup was warm and smelled the red liquid. -It´s spiced wine- said Orlena, - you can try just a little if you like, I´m not your mother but can´t have drunk, you know. She nodded and tried it; it was nice, had a faint taste of cinnamon and apple, of vanilla and the sweet smell of Arabic frangipane. The wine made her a bit hazy and warm, her scent of roses all over the dress, Orlena dragged her again towards their seats in the theater and Odette felt embraced by the ambient; like if anything could happen as she steadied herself to watch the play. She forgot once more about the beasts living inside her as her artistic soul prepared to live the play, enthusiastically she fought and felt with the actors on stage. The function was about a married couple: she was a famous writer, but she pretended to be a male of course, and he besides being her husband was also her editor; Orlena looked at Odette as if thinking the play might be too much for her young mind, but the wolfmaid didn´t seem scared… if anything she looked excited, with her eyes turning purple making her companion wonder if maybe she had too much of the red spiced wine. The girl got involved on the conflict in such a way that probably she would´ve jumped on stage to participate, for Odette prided herself of seeing beneath the surface of the play´s argument and by the end of the first act, she had already taken part in one of the fighting sides. The famous writer was as reasonable and holy as any saint even though the play´s author, a man in the end, tried deceiving the public. Odette wouldn´t be cheated on this, nor Madame Apolline if she´d been there, the old lady had taught her a woman could perfectly get by in life under the same or worse conditions than a man. Hell, Odette was a living proof herself… why not? By the end of the second act and realizing things were starting to take a turn she deeply disliked, Odette was about to raise red banners and invite all women in the place to protest, stopped only by the thought that she hadn´t really payed for her seat… and therefore had no right to set up a scandal, she missed however, the cane of Monsieur Hugo who used it to knock the floor every time a line was not of his liking, laughing uncontrollably if it was otherwise and making difficult to understand the play for all those around him. When the theater curtain fell to indicate the intermezzo , a man dressed in tuxedo came to stand in front of everyone saying he´d be honored if, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the function´s inspiration, some members of the audience would be willing to present, in their own words, what they thought about the play. He regretted the author´s absence and indicated some cast members would be present during the little event to represent the play´s point of view while four spectators, chosen randomly, came to stand before the rest of the audience. The man then took a piece of paper out of his pocket and started to announce the seats, three people climbed up the stage and when the last one was called out, Odette´s knees started to tremble. Orlena turned to look at her. -Well, aren´t you lucky? C´mon! – she encouraged helping her to gather her skirts in a fist. Odette went up the stage using the small steps and let her blue dress waved around her as she looked at the audience, a mass now of colorful suits and dresses, she stared at the lamps trying to remember how to breathe. Orlena saw her from the distance… well, she was all flushed cheeks and white skin now, the wine she drank had given a light red kiss on the inner part of her lips. Philippe said something about her appearance when leaving… \"what was it?\" The first presenter was a lady, her one attribute was a bright shiny bag which one could say was filled with so much stuff it looked like it was about to explode, she said something about women being too tender to openly confront a man the way the protagonist from the play had done with her husband; the second was an erudite, talking like a parrot about Shakespeare, Grimm Brothers and Spanish Golden poem Era; the third one was all fun and giggles, he made poor taste jokes and unfortunate comments on the play´s custom design, the man in the tuxedo shut him up almost straight away. -Please Madame, if you could come to the front- he invited Odette. Her blue velvet dress richly reflected the light accentuating her eyes, so full of life they shone purple, her chocolate brown locks adorning her almost virginal features; Orlena could see she grabbed her wolf necklace to gather courage and as she let it go, Lena remembered. A wild ice maiden. The bartender looked up in hope of calming her nerves, and through the golden theater boxes she distinguished an elegant figure, not easily forgotten now as he had broken a ballet record not too long ago, Orlena wasn´t that immersed in ballet but she had seen his performance when they´ve taken Odette to the Opera House, and the attractive face of the young man had been all over the newspapers for weeks. Louis Mérante was looking at the stage as the rest of the audience, waiting for the outcome of such a strange and dangerous dynamic sort of game. Odette trembled a bit to herself and looked bright blue to others as she stared at the man, waiting for his question. -Which is, in women´s eyes, Pierre´s best attribute? Odette thought there could not be a more stupid question, men couldn´t understand how there were as many different types of women as stars in the sky: Tender Women, Women with Sex Appeal, Unattractive Women, Kissed Women and so forth; and men, who knew little to nothing about these labels, tried to figure women out from their own little one-sided dimension, the reason for their ignorance was that Unkissed Men were quite seldom anywhere. This was proven when the man asked the woman with the exploding bag about Marie's mistake in confronting Pierre, and she replied that if she had been in Marie´s place she´d never have fought with Pierre. \"Rubbish\" thought Odette, there was no planet in which that woman could take Marie´s position and the fact of even suggesting was beyond ridiculous; Madame Apolline had taught her about the best arguments on the eternal men and women fighting over who was better, and she decided to take all of those out and teach that little tuxedo man how small his world was. So Odette felt her heart beating at full speed, sending blood all over her, she told herself she´d better get used to be gazed at by so many faces and cleared her throat before replying with crystal clear voice: -I´m deeply sorry to differ from other´s opinion; but for me, Pierre lacks any sort of attribute… I consider him a male stupidity compendium- she could hear now the unison sound of the audience holding its breath, and couldn´t see Orlena smirking- this play should have been called A terrible husband The happy expression of the man in the tuxedo changed for one of horror, as he´d been thinking he was treating with a beautiful airheaded butterfly and found a hysterical angry harpy. -You´re saying that… -You asked me, as a woman- Odette tried to lower her voice to appear older than she really was, -what I thought of Pierre at the play. I think Marie is a complete woman: beautiful and successful, but for her the most important thing is Pierre´s love; which is different for him since he prefers her books and money. Using her career as an excuse, all he says is she´s a genius and she´s great, I wouldn´t object against it if once in a while he said she looks good with the dress she´s wearing- the public laughed, the atmosphere felt hot, she absentmindedly ran her hand to her hair in an effort to put it back. -I don´t think you´re paying enough attention to the fact he venerates her work and… -Yes, but he never compliments her as a woman, which never implies she´s not beautiful or that other men notice it; nothing compares to the fact one´s husband appreciates his wife´s beauty. The man studied her face, stopping on her lips and replied -You think flatter is better than sacrifice? \"Oh\" she laughed internally, it was likely her dragon would laugh as well \"You´re not going that way\" -Why do you call it sacrifice? Pierre lives thanks to her success as well. He´s one of those men that live for working and expects his wife to be the same; he forgets Marie is a woman that also needs the sentimental part, not to be taken lightly for it must be lived intensely. But with him \"marriage\" goes with \"work\", when it should go with \"happiness\" and \"love\". She gazed at the guy with a look that said \"You´re wrong if you thought you´d get me\". He cleared his throat and took his chain watch out, he apologized for taking so long and thanked immensely those who stayed during the intermezzo , he dismissed the four spectators and casted a last glance on Odette, the sort of which she could not identify as she gathered her skirts and returned to her seat where Orlena was eagerly waiting for her. -Heavens child! – she said, -was it the wine? -Was it stupid? -Not for me. Are you drunk? -Don´t know, I don´t think so but maybe the wine did make me talk a bit more that I´d normally have… Can we go? -Thought you wouldn´t ask- admitted Orlena, no one could say for sure what´d happen after Odette´s original presentation on her point of view once she was outside and vulnerable. So they deemed wise to retire sooner. As they left, Odette could already sense many, many stares drilling at the back of her head and thanked God there were no events as they got in the carriage and headed home. Orlena paid the driver and they got into the small kitchen where Philippe was reading the night´s newspaper, \"Britain´s Bride\" already closed. -How did it go? -Well my dear brother… remember how you said this little girl looked like an ice maiden? -Hummm… yeah. -She´s got everything BUT ice on her insides and she proofed it tonight on stage. -WHAT? They quickly referred Philippe what had happened and he laughed and messed fatherly on Odette´s locks. -Such a wolfmaid… -Shut up!- Orlena replied worriedly, -what will we do? -What´s the problem? -What if some of our clients recognize her and… and… -And what? – he said, not seeing any trouble, -Odette got up there, said her opinion and that was about it, if someone DID recognize her, and I say this because she was probably tiny as to the seats our usual customers could allow themselves to pay, what would they do except to agree or disagree with her? C´mon Lena, no one will come looking for a fight with a little girl. -Little woman now, if you ask me- she replied again, much calmer than before. -Well, we better get some sleep. You too Odette, this was a rushed night- he said pushing the little woman towards the old staircase. Next day, during daylight, Odette concentrated on her lessons; Florance said that if she continued her hard work, she would issue the recommendation letter for the Opera House the following week and Odette came home as happy as Christmas jingles. When Orlena opened the tavern, Odette sighed… there, at the table in the corner, sat her bright green eyed admirer, with two way quieter friends. -Wolfmaid!- he shouted, earning an annoyed look of other customers who were chatting or playing cards. She approached and shot him a poisoned gaze. -Keep shouting at me like that and I promise I´ll show you how much of a wolf I am- she whispered menacingly. The guy turned white and after a moment, he scratched his head, messing his wavy auburn curls and making him look way younger than he was, almost like a scolded little child. -Sorry, sorry… I´d call you by your name, but I don´t really know it. Would you please bring me some warm spiced wine? – he asked, an intent grin dancing across his features as he casted an adoring look to her face. Odette rolled her eyes and grabbed her tray a bit more firmly, not wanting to crush it against his stupid smirk… she knew he´d been at the theatre the previous night and had spotted her drinking, else he wouldn´t have asked for the damn spiced wine. Trying to hold herself together, she closed her eyes and heard the other man´s voice: -Please forgive him Madame, he knows little about manners. I´d like a beer pint. Odette nodded and looked at the third man, but got trapped in his eyes as soon as she did, a knot formed in her throat when a pair of expressive dark hazel pupils under black lashes stared back as her hands turned cold. There he was, the last person she thought she´d meet in this buried and trenched bar, she would never forget his face since it was all she saw at the academy for days and days, her admiration for his dance returned as a tidal wave. He´d grown an elegant, good-trimmed beard since his last photograph on the brochures and his handsome face revealed her he was not much older that herself. Louis Mérante, the man who´d broken an impossible world record just weeks ago, was looking at her curiously. Finally, he spoke with a silky voice in a metallic tone -I´d also like a beer pint, please. Half full. Odette nodded once more and turned back trying not look so startled and stiff, she picked the service of another table and took their money before allowing herself to look back. Mérante was talking and laughing, flesh and blood at her workplace, she grabbed her necklace again, so furiously its edges almost cut her fingers. She wanted a position as a student in the Opera House and that young man was teaching there… should she talk to him? Should she ask him for something? Mérante was a piece of her dream fallen into that dusty corner, fire ran through her veins and tickled her palms. -Odette! You´re about to spill the beer!- said Philippe. She hurriedly closed the tab and looked back again as she apologized. Not too sure how to proceed, she went back to the table and delivered the order as well as a cheese and bread board with a plate of Spanish and Italian cold cuts. They thanked her and the police boy was asking something about her name when Philippe took his violin out and Orlena prepared herself to climb on the wooden counter that functioned as her stage. This gave Odette an opportunity to walk away and keep thinking. She ended up deciding she´d just make a good impression for now; if the odds were on her part, Mérante would come back or better yet, he´d recognize her at the Opera House and made her stay there a bit more interesting by taking her as a pupil… \"Noup, that´s dreaming too much\" she admitted while cleaning one of the sky blue tables and took some empty jars with her to refill them. A/N Thank you all for your patience! I´m so glad you´re liking this, so I was able to upload a longer chapter. I´ll reply to your wonderful reviews in a little bit Seriously guys... you´re the best! ;)[Chapter 6] Chapter VI A wild ice maiden Mérante ended up inviting Connor and Beaumont to the theatre function with him. Things were good, he´d gotten out of his parents´ place just a week after his big break, they seemed almost relieved until he told them he´d be taking with him everything he´d bought using his money; which included most of his bedroom and a couple of trunks full of stuff he had acquired a bit more recently: kitchen and dining room hardware, white bedding and some furniture that he´d send directly to a rented storage, they´d stay there till he could afford his own apartment. For saving purposes, he´d been staying with Monsieur Beaumont since then. The Opera House director fulfilled his promise of having him as a tutor for beginners´ class; truth be told he was more of an apprentice but he liked learning as it was something he had stopped doing for some time now and the sensation of starting again was quite refreshing. The press was still talking of the big loss Louis Mérante´s absence represented for the Ballet stage but applauded his teaching endeavor with all the hypocrisy and double sensed kindness only the newspapers were capable of pulling off. His parents never wrote to him and at first it hurt a little; but as weeks passed, time took over that sting and Mérante spent the entire day at the Opera looking after his new students and preparing them for small recitals their parents excited about him instructing their children. Joan D´Autrelle said her goodbyes to the angry lion as she was fond of calling him and a new Prima Ballerina was yet to be chosen, the director had asked Mérante´s opinion on this subject but no new girl had taken the roll yet. As a distraction to his new demanding way of living, Beaumont reminded him of the theatre tickets Madame D´Autrelle had given him some weeks past and suggested asking Connor out as well, an invitation to which Mérante had fully agreed after having turned down so many outing´s offers from the Irish young man before. They dressed with good tailored suits and headed for the theatre, Connor was already there with the new smoking Beaumont and Mérante had given him early that week, he insisted he´d pay back but accepted it nonetheless since his wages weren´t really that good yet. -You get paid for studying? -Hell no mate, only for extra rounds when seniors don't want to. That´s my only chance of making extra cash. And they chatted as they waited the big crystal doors to the theatre boxes to be opened. The main topic for Connor was that he was in love. A beautiful barmaid, he´d said, making both Mérante and Beaumont look at each other in skepticism for Connor didn´t even know the girl´s name. -She´s as pretty as a winter sunset mate- he described her, -Works at the tavern I talked to you about in my letters. Then he had opened his eyes until they looked like they would pop out and pointed his index finger at someone behind them; his mouth open semingly gasping for air. -That´s extremely rude my friend- said Beaumont who hated bad manners. -That´s her! –Connor whispered, -the wolfmaid! -The what? - Mérante asked more than a bit confused. His friend grabbed him by the collar and practically grabbed him to the edge of the staircase, below them was a young lady dressed in a simple blue velvet dress drinking warm red wine, Mérante admired the sober elegance of her attire and saw her big blue eyes… or were they purple? drinking in her surroundings. -Well, she´s very pretty Connor- granted Beaumont next to them. -Pretty? She´s beautiful! Mérante was used to see beautiful women in expensive party dresses and decided that wasn´t it. Sure her long silhouette made her stand out among others but… there was something else there, the long wavy dark hair and lack of jewelry accentuated her features making her look like an ice statue someone had left there. -She´s got a wild beauty about her- pointed his old tutor. Once again, his words had hit the right spot. Mérante studied her more intently, there was ice and there was steel… odds were his good friend had no real chance to get her, he was all bronze warm greeting sunshine that could drown kisses in a wine cup. But she was something else entirely… like a cold goodnight farewell in winter. -She´s a dancer- his teacher said, -look at the way she walks. It was true, Mérante´s experienced eyes also noticed it, she moved with a certain grace difficult to find in people that wasn´t familiar with dancing. He smiled as he saw Connor´s loving green eyes on the girl. -Move on Romeo, the doors have opened- he announced while pushing him back. They found their box and talked no more as the play started, except when Beaumont mentioned him the same thing he´d observed earlier… Connor had no real connection to his newfound crush; and from what they´ve seen they were as different as day and night. The play was stupid, Mérante had seen enough arguments of this kind between his parents to find any originality in the dialogs, he even thought he might have directed the play himself. He was set up in convincing his friends into leaving the theatre after the sorry attempt of an entertaining intermezzo on a random man´s part until the guy summoned Connor´s newly found love on stage. The young woman climbed up the stairs and looked like she was about to punch anything that moved within arm´s reach, she came to the frontline looking quite annoyed and used a harsh tone to point out her opinion; her voice boomed through the dome with a silver bell´s clarity. She was not someone to be trifled with and Mérante found somewhat praiseworthy the firm trust she had on her sex´s strength. Her cold manners removing any kind of flirtation she might be using, she was who she was, never trying to be someone else… if one found her likeable or not made little difference. For someone used to a society filled with masks and makeup, it was an interesting change for him to say the least. In her, Mérante saw nothing but iron, ice and bluish beams of light. He turned to look at Connor, if he was head over heels for the young woman before, he could now vow his friend was so infatuated he´d surely declare her his supposed love at the slightest chance She went back to her seat after defending her posture so fervently, and Beaumont bended over to him so he could speak to his ear: -If the girl´s got as much spirit as it seems, it´s more than likely she´ll blow Connor off before he can even say so much as a hi. Mérante wasn´t sure how he´d managed to restrain a sudden burst of laughter; when he was about to reply with how interesting it would turn out to be if Connor did manage to get something out of her besides a punch, he saw the girl leaving her seat at the pit and heading for the exit… and restrained himself from pointing it out to Connor... later, he found troubling he didn´t even know why he´d been quiet. After the play, before heading for Beaumont´s house, Connor asked them to go with him to Britain´s Bride the next evening. -She works there- he explained, his eyes so bright they looked like two huge lampposts. Mérante laughed and accepted the invitation. And not only because he wanted to spend time with his friend. Somehow, as he stared at the ceiling, lying on his bed he realized the blue dress had the same tone of the roses in his dreams. He spent the next day lost in the Academy´s maze of hallways and rooms, he was in a bad mood and shouted instructions and corrections to his students more than usual. Beaumont had taken into private tutoring two other dancers now that Louis was no longer in need of his services and Mérante barely saw him around the Opera anymore. Monsieur Auguste Vaucorbeli, the directort came again to ask him to take a glimpse at the oldest girl´s class and argue with other teachers about the next prima ballerina; it was either that or bring someone from another country… maybe Prussia or the kingdoms north of Rome. Mérante promised he´d give it some thought and would be observing the older ballerinas carefully. He had lunch at a local restaurant, the establishments were disseminated all over the I´Opéra district and Italian food had taken prominence as of late; but for his taste they used a bit too many condiments and the options for food with no meat was scarce. It´s not like he didn´t enjoy a good veal steak, but realized he felt way lighter and soundly rested at night now that he´d left meat out of his diet; and despite Vaucorbeli´s insistence with giving a try to \"Madame LeHaut´s\" a young widow´s new restaurant that had opened its doors not long ago, Mérante preferred small not crowded places to have his meals. At the end of the day he was about to head home when he saw Beaumont waiting for him at the lobby. Suddenly remembering the appointment with Connor and breathing heavily, Mérante joined his previous tutor and headed for the Pantheón district where \"Britain´s Bride\" tavern was located. -You seem in a bad mood. -I am- he replied sounding harsher than he meant, -Vaucorbeli´s obsessed with finding a new Prima ballerina before next month and has asked me to inspect potential candidates the whole afternoon; had no time to prepare my lesson for tomorrow and my students look more like newborn fawns trying to walk than the swans they´re supposed to be. -Well, relax now –cheered Beaumont, while crossing the river bridge, -Now you´ll enjoy a whole new type of spectacle. Mérante rolled his eyes. Looking at his freckled friend trying to ask the barmaid out was as appealing as spending the rest of the evening stripping petals from daisies. They approached the neighborhood where the Rue Royale crossed Les Innocents graveyard talking about Mérante´s plans to move out of Beaumont´s place and rent an apartment now that his income was high enough, they kept walking until they found Connor waiting for them outside the bar. He was wearing the police´s uniform with no insignia since he was still a student and his bright expression made Mérante compare him to an excited cat gloating for a milk bowl. Connor waved his friend to come closer. -Good God mate!- he said looking with critical eye at his friends´ clothes, -next time you roam at night around here, try wearing a gold coin on your forehead… it´ll be easier for robbers to spot you. -What do you mean? Connor sighed and kept studying them -Your hats are good… since they blend you with other people. Get a bigger coat next time, to hide the silk of the neckties and the gold of your watch´s chain. Believe me, if the richmen that often visit the police station bothered to take care of themselves, half the robbery in Paris would disappear. Beaumont pulled his hat on and tried to close the front of his coat, his belly getting in the way and causing the Irish young man to smile. -Just have it mind next time. Rumors of laughter and soft Breton music came from inside the tavern. -Well, let´s get in! -Connor´s good humor was back at the top, he practically pushed his friends towards the door, stumbling against the stone steps as they felt the hearth´s warm and saw their comely and quaint surroundings. Connor guided them to an unoccupied table at the back of the bar and sat excitedly as his green pupils scanned the place. Mérante was used to have a couple of drinks in a bar as much as any man his age; but soon decided the cozy tavern was one of the best. It was homely and cheery, filled with working men who relaxed after a long day and women who joined their husbands and boyfriends to find some solace away of their busy days. He could see the big ale and wine barrels, behind the front bar, long shelves were filled with different bottles of whisky and Russian vodka, Portuguese port and cider, all lined up and appealing to the thirsty eye; from the kitchen came the smell of spicy potatoes and baking garlic bread. He eyed Beaumont and saw he enjoyed the place as much as him. Considering he just had to cross the Seine to get there, he decided if this night was agreeable, he´d visit the tavern a bit more often. -There she is!- announced Connor with a dreamy voice, then he shouted –Wolfmaid! Mérante raised an eyebrow under his hat, happy his friend couldn´t see the expression on his face. \"What´s the big idea, insulting her?\" -Keep calling me that and I´ll show you how much of a wolf I am- she replied when she was close enough, her voice whipped in his ears and he compared the sound with the cracking of ice. Connor apologized and mumbled something in a voice too low to comprehend. When Beaumont asked for his drink, Mérante picked at the smell of roses this maid exhaled; he stared at her intrigued and more than a bit curious. The young woman looked directly at his eyes, another thing she did differently to most women, he noticed. She listened to his order with such an indifference he thought she hadn´t heard him, then nodded and turned around, her moves were surprisingly smooth like a feather floating along the blue wooden tables. -Connor- he heard his old tutor, -She doesn´t look too happy when you use her nickname; I think it´d be less rude you asked her actual name. -What do you think I´ve been asking her since I met her? - he said in a sad tone, -I´d have an easier time talking to a wall mate. Mérante laughed and noticed that somehow the longer he heard about her, the more he wanted to keep listening. She came back with their order and when he looked at her again, she was looking right back with an indecipherable expression... he froze and ended up comparing it to the look a predator gives another before engaging in battle. Connor asked for her name but before she could reply, an idiot with a violin started playing, unleashing some sort of animal instinct in the other customers; they all started yelling and cheering as another barmaid climbed the counter to drum the wood with noisy stomping that prevented anyone from speaking, and the slippery maid left their table. Since Mérante couldn´t talk, he could only watch… little did he know his decision had been like shooting a bullet through his mind, an iron bullet with blue winter starlight at its core, a bullet that froze his heart and melted it later that night when he stared at the roof in his room. Connor had left right before the fiddle music finished, disheartened and with a terrible sense of defeat crushing him. The barmaid had refused to talk to him after refilling his pint twice, indignant at all his \"wolfmaid\" yelling and his remarks about her participation on the theater stage the day before. But Mérante had stayed with Beumont till finishing their drinks and food; he caught the wolfmaid´s name when the fiddler asked for her help in pilling up logs for the hearth. Odette. Sleep came to him when he thought with no small degree of something he could only classify as relief, that if she was a dancer a Beaumont was so confident about, she somehow would be part of the world he was planning to spend the rest of his life in. A/N You guys are great! Never thought this idea would have more than 100 views. For those of you who are wondering... yes, the tavern Britain´s Bride is the same bar where Félicie dances in the film. Pls let me know your thoughts :3[Chapter 7] CHAPTER VII Under a Christmas´ winter moon Odette crossed the Seine and headed for the Opera House as she had been doing every day since the recommendation letter issued by Florance, her old ballet teacher, had been accepted there. The director shouting and expressing his acceptance in the noisiest and to Odette, the dumbest looking, way possible. The Opera was always busy, she had classified for the top coryphées' level and her new tutor, Dimitriv Kerloff a man in his mid-fifties, had made sure the grace she had when dancing didn´t puff her up. There were times she thought he´d throw his shoe at her if she got the wrong move, but later… after class, the room was hers. And she would practice again, and again till sunset when she headed back to the tavern, there were strange times when she´d thought there was someone on the inner balcony of the room, but every time she´d stop to look the presence was gone. They were in midwinter already and when she announced Orlena and Philippe her intention of going back to her village for the Christmas period and how she´d be back in early January; they´d hugged her and when she left Orlena gave her a big and soft Christmas pudding to deliver at the flower shop in congratulation for Hugo and Apolline´s wedding. Odette got to her little town when afternoon´s snowflakes were falling on the street, after she crossed the door and the familiar flowery smell filled her to the very core… she knew she was home. Apolline was a delightful noisy old hag as she remembered her and Hugo would caress her head as Odette smiled thinking how ridiculous she´d look now that she was taller than him; the old man had trembling lips and watery eyes when he saw the dangling wolf necklace he´d given her but pretended he was just about to sneeze. That night they ate Orlena´s pudding as Odette told them everything about her time in the big city, not without mentioning how much she´d miss them. -You´ve grown so much little one!- exclaimed Apolline while they washed the dishes in the back of the shop, the way they did when Odette was still a florist girl, -I can no longer call you little one! – she smirked, -And you´re so beautiful now I barely recognized you when you came through the door… And look at you! - she grasped Odette´s skirt with a soapy hand, -Horrible, we´ll get you new ones… besides your clothes for the wedding of course, you´ll get to be my bridesmaid! You won´t be as pretty as me sure, but who knows? Maybe that dirty weasel of Cornell will notice you. -I´d rather not- replied Odette, Cornell was the one-eyed parish clerk, always insisting he had lost his eyeball at war which was funny considering the last one had finished before he was born. Next day, Apolline spent it in making a whole new change of clothes for Odette, she and Hugo had had every little detail for the wedding already planned and were just waiting for Odette to be resettled for she would take care of the flowershop on their honeymoon, which was scheduled to last a fortnight right after Christmas Eve. Odette rolled her eyes at their plan, she was expecting something of the sort but wouldn´t have thought they´d leave her on New Year´s Eve as well. -We´ve asked the Beaumonts to have you! – they apologized, the Beaumonts were the bakers of the town and often traded with Hugo for herbs and flowers which they used in their breads or desserts, a family so big Odette doubted they´d notice if all their kids were at their table during meals, -And they said they´d be delighted, you know how much Madame Beaumont appreciates you. Odette differed since last time she made a delivery to the lady, intended for her sister-in-law, the woman had laughed at the flower arrangement and called it tasteless and something she could´ve found on the field, an insult Odette found unforgivable since she had made the flower arrangement herself and took a bunch of flowers on the lake side as a model. Of course that had been a long time ago, but Odette could still hear Madame Beaumont´s raucous laugh on her ears. Two days later, Christmas Eve was there and on the same day, the wedding. Odette dressed in a jocular and cheerful green coat, with fluffy white bear fur on her fists and collar. Everyone said she looked lovely while she thought herself a Christmas elf helping Apolline get on the carriage that would take her and Hugo across country France for their honeymoon. On the morning after Christmas she checked the temperature in the glassgarden, the late delivery of Christmas trees took her almost the entire day; she closed the shop early and went ice skating on the frozen lake. Several families were there but she did her best to ignore them and practiced, hoping the extra difficulty on the ice would helped her improve much more than on wooden floor. Her graceful movements were not as smooth on the hardened water, but her hops and turns marked her as a fun target for the kids, who as soon as she landed or went slow enough were all around her. Flushed cheeks and rosy nose; Odette managed to make the kids help her; she commended each one to look at different aspects on her executions: one would look at how much icedust she splayed when landing, other at the angle of her twirls, other at the cuts she made on the ice with her skateblades and so forth; not really realizing how unusually useful her technique was, she was just being herself, the dancer that saw practice in every step and could take as partner the wind itself. -Hey Odette! Can you show me how you do that? -I´ll think about it…- she said, outwardly mysterious and inwardly amused as she removed the blades from her shoes, sitting on a dry trunk on the side of the frozen lake. -I´m so going to be a ballet dancer when I grow up as well! -Odette, when you… Odette? She was totally still on the mainroad just outside the flowershop and looked directly at two men descending a carriage in front of the bakery. -Monsieur Beaumont!- cheered some of the children while they ran to his side. -Uncle!- exclaimed one of the girls. -My, my, mademoiselle Gabrielle… aren´t you a lady now? Look at you Odette recognized the man that had visited \"Britain´s Bride\" frequently after her debut on that stupid theater stage; his kind tone and warm demeanor where almost identical to those of his brother, the town´s baker. \"Idiot\" she thought \"No wonder his gestures were a bit familiar\" -You should see Adelaide!- the little girl replied, -She has grown so much more than me this year! Odette even told her she could help her at cutting the flowers in Monsieur Hugo´s glassgardens!- she announced, a bit envious. -Really? The glassgardens? - Beaumont replied looking up, where the other crowd of children was, taking a bit of time to recognize the silhouette in the middle of it. Adelaide came forward. -Yeah, but Odette said she´d show you how to skate on ice. I´d like that too you know Gabrielle… But the older man had eyes only for the young woman standing meters away from him. -You… you are Hugo´s little florist girl? Odette, half dead of shame but still too brave to cower behind the door, moved forward. -Yes Monsieur. -All this time? -Since I was little, yes. -You know her from before? - said a silk husky voice from behind the carriage, Odette didn´t have to look at his face to see who it was. She knew his face and she knew his voice, floating to her from the classrooms where he taught his own students or the hallways where he passed by talking with the director or with other tutors. Louis Mérante stood before her as something hot and wet licked her veins, she imagined it was her wolfblood and somehow she was thankful for it… made her feel more confident and less like Babette, the blacksmith´s daughter, who would only come out of her house at night because of her bashfulness. She admired the young ballet master: the winter boots and his excellent tailored black coat, the circled beard favored him remarkably and those dark hazel eyes that were gazing back at her. They stood in silence for a bit until Beaumont spoke. -I did not know you were the one working for Monsieur Hugo, this is a happy coincidence indeed- he said while removing his hat and closing the small distance between them, - Sorry mademoiselle, we have not been properly introduced and I´m afraid I left for Paris long before you were born. I am Armand Beaumont, older brother to Denis with whom I´m sure you´re quite familiar with- he announced kissing her hand delicately. Odette assumed Denis was the bakery´s owner. -This is Louis Mérante- Beaumont continued as his friend came closer, Odette could see some snowflakes falling on his thick lashes -We´re both currently working in ballet tutoring- he finished as Mérante bowed to her hand without kissing it since he never once stopped looking at her eyes, something she found a bit odd. Was he trying to intimidate her? -Ballet? - shouted the kids. -You too Monsieur? -No way! -Odette, did you hear? -Odette is a ballerina! -And dances like a white swan! -You´ve never seen a swan dancing, you idiot. -I´m sorry Monsieur Beaumont, - she interrupted before any more chaos could breed –My name is Odette, and as I´m sure you just heard… I´m currently a ballet student at the Opera House. She deliberately didn´t mention her lastname, the tragic accident of the fire in her childhood had been newspaper material and she had no wish to put up with pity looks; she refused to endure anymore of those, they always managed to make her dragon murmur at night. -Really? Monsieur Mérante here works at the Opera. She didn´t bother to look surprised, she knew he worked there but there was no reason for her to talk to him and since Odette wasn´t in the beginners´ class, she refused to be seen by him, a bit shy at the possibility he might recognize her as the tavern´s wolfmaid. -I have seen you from the distance mademoiselle, but I was never sure if it was you- Mérante said, lying or speaking the truth, Odette could not tell. -Armand!- shouted a third voice from the bakery´s door. A man dressed in white, with oven-burnt skin, thick arms and a round belly ran towards his brother and gave him a bear hug, dusting his brown coat with flour. -Denis! -How have you been? -Missing family as always little brother. Madame Beaumont came rushing after her husband and hugged her brother-in-law as well. -Good to see you Armand! -The pleasure is all mine Didi. -We were just discussing the menu for the dinner and…oh well, but who´s this handsome young man? Introductions were made and Odette thought she was no longer necessary, she started to say her farewells and saw Mérante was about to say something else when Monsieur Beaumont, the baker, exclaimed: -Wait Odette! Hugo asked us to look after you during these days and there´s no way we´d let you roam around those damn glass-houses anymore. If you´d like, secure the shop and come dine with us. She hoped the sunset light masked her sudden pallor, but realized there was no way to decline without being rude. -Thank you Monsieur, I shall do so. At what time should I.. -At whatever time girl- said his wife, slightly amused at Odette´s formality, - Knock on the door when you´re ready, oh… and would you please bring some rose petals for tea? My mother has been a bit delicate lately, they don´t have to be fresh. Odette nodded bowing slightly and when she turned, she saw Mérante bowed as well. She went back to the flowershop and tried to find stuff to do, she cursed her previous responsibility for she had cleaned and prepared the flowers for the next day before going ice skating. As she headed for the glassgardens to grab some roses for Madame Beaumont she realized that Mérantes eyes and face kept appearing in her mind, judging it all to be a girl´s silly thoughts she shook her head and tried to distract herself by lighting the small stove in the hallway so it wasn´t freezing when she came back. The admiration she held for the ballet master was real, that was to be sure, but she decided she´d discover that night if he was an artist or a total idiot, she changed her skating clothes for something a bit more appropriate for dining in someone else´s house: a long woolen black overshirt that covered her new dark silken corset, a sapphire blue bodice and another green wool skirt that covered her boots, she looked at her reflection and saw the spring girl in her wither away as the winter maid in the mirror emerged… but that was about it, because the multiple colors made her look as a rotten flower someone left behind a vase; the main reason was probably the only piece of clothing that was truly hers was the bodice, the rest being Apolline´s… even the petticoat. The woman had no time to finish the girl´s new outfit before Christmas and only managed to make her a corset, the bodice and a Bavarian inspired dirndl she was supposed to wear on New Year´s Eve, beautiful and light, she doubted it was appropriate for the snow but Apolline insisted. Odette sighed and decided to wear the black skirt, didn´t matter if she looked too dark; she put on Hugo´s French cloak deciding it wasn´t too masculine and tied her hair in a ponytail, grabbing the rose petal´s bowls she reached for the door knob. Mérante was outside the shop´s door. Well, him and Monsieur Beaumont but she couldn´t help her eyes from noticing the young ballet master first. Her heart pounded… probably from the cold. -A storm is coming mademoiselle- said Beaumont, -We wanted to make sure you didn´t change your mind- he smiled gently. Odette managed to avoid looking at Mérante´s face and answered -Thank you Monsieur, but the bakery is just across the square… if the thought of cancelling ever crossed my mind I could´ve gone and said so myself. Somehow Beaumont thought she was the strangest kind of young lady he´d ever met; with her flowery smell and the un-flirty gestures that gave her a special mysterious charm, while they walked he saw Mérante out from the corner of his eye, gazing at the girl´s nape. As they walked into his good-sister´s dining room crowded with people and food, he decided to watch Mérante for the rest of the evening. His little nieces and nephews seemed to love this lady and fought over where she would sit. -Here Odette! It´s closer to the hearth! -She hates hearths you silly -But it´s freezing out there! -Hush!- urged their mother as she grabbed the bowl Odette was giving her, -Thank you sweetling, please allow this dynamites grab your cloak and sit wherever you deem… necessary to save us all – she winked. The florist removed her overcoat and sat on the middle of the table, opposite the hearth. The oldest kids were bringing bowls full of chicken and potato soup, steamed vegetables and roasted lamb shanks with rosemary, garlic bread, honey and raspberry sauce and light red wine to wash it down. -Gabrielle- called his brother Denis, -Please girl, I think the snow you brought must be melted by now, fill a jug and bring it for you and your siblings… won´t have you drinking wine just yet. Denis sat at the head of the table with his wife Didi at his left and Beaumont to his right, followed by Mérante, two more children and the oldest kid at the other table top, then came Gabrielle and Odette, next to her was his other niece Adelaide, who breathed the young ballerina´s hair and shouted with bright eyes. -Odette, you always smell so nice! -Just like roses! -That´s a new necklace! -So scary... Addy! Look! It´s a dog. -It´s a wolf silly- replied the girl, almost climbing on Odette´s waist and grabbing her long locks to look at her neck. To Beaumonts surprise, Odette didn´t look annoyed or irritated. Strange since it was her normal mood at the tavern and from that first time she saw her in the theatre. She looked relaxed and ready to smile, with the soft curl of her lips accentuating her lushly pale features -When I grow up, I want to be like you Odette. The young woman left the spoon to stare at Gabrielle and told her with a hoarse tone. -When you grow up, you´ll want to be yourself Gabrielle. You´ll see you´re far better than me -But… -Gabrielle! - called her mother –Please leave Odette alone for a bit and eat. Beaumont heard his brother asking Mérante about what he thought of the countryside now that he was visiting, but had to repeat the question much to Beaumont astonishment… for if Mérante wasn´t listening to his host talking to him, he must´ve had his attention fixed on something else. -Excuse me, sir. Denis smiled and they both chatted during some minutes, Beaumont trying discreetly to look at his young friend when he finished talking. There was no little surprise when he caught him eyeing the ballerina on the other side of the table, engaged at the moment on some kind of competition between the two little girls and Eugéne, his oldest nephew, over who could finish their plate first. Surprisingly, Gabrielle won. -No fair!- said her brother, -you had like a third of what the rest of us had on our plates. -Win´s a win- said Odette giving small pats at his niece´s back to prevent her from choking, she looked at her glass and randomly asked for the water´s jug. Mérante passed it. Beaumont stared at his friend, oh God, he´d seen a look like that in many men´s faces. But never saw it on his old pupil. At the very least, it was an admiration look. At the very worst, it was an intrigued look, the kind of intrigue that started with flowers and roses, passing to wine and dancing and finished with moonsongs and broken hearts. In blue velvet, the ballerina was like a bluish ice virgin… here and now, one could realize Odette´s wild beauty flourished from within, her manners had a raw rashness and her eyes shined violet in reflection to the warm hearth´s golden light, her untamed naturalness flowed from her heart now no longer encased in its usual frost. He´d just have to ask which version of the admiration or intrigued look Mérante was using. -Mother! Are we going to give her the present? -Oh yes, but that´s for dessert…- replied Didi mysteriously, -Hugo and Apolline said they´d pay you for dessert here every day, it´s custom made. -Really? - She said, utterly surprised. After Odette finished, Didi brought her a small individual dessert, -Monsieur Hugo specifically entrusted us with this task for you. The dessert was an apple cinnamon cake; he could sniff at it from where he was. On top of it there was an artistic frosting arranged in the shape of blue roses. -He´d say you´d understand it. -I do- she said, too touched to reply anything else. But she ended up sharing the cake with the kids. After the table was cleared, Beaumont decided to absorb the children´s attention towards him and see what would Mérante do now that Odette was unoccupied. With his nieces and nephews around him, the young lady was able to catch her breath and sat on a small stool, the farthest from the hearth. If she had caught the eye of his young pupil, he´d try to get closer under a different excuse than attempting to warm himself. Minutes passed and Beaumont thought that maybe his suspicions were unfounded when Mérante walked over to the stool, Odette calm and sleepy. Cursing himself for he was too far away from them to hear anything, he tried to discreetly observe their talk. Mérante seemed cool and relaxed, polite and correct and not giving too much away by his demeanor and it could´ve passed as small chat for the non-observant viewer, but Beaumont knew better for Mérante´s eyes never left the girl´s face as if he were trying to memorize it. Beaumont had never really seen anyone that had caught his young pupil´s attention, every attempt the other ballerinas or music girls at the Opera had been shut down almost immediately, then again he´d never seen anyone like Odette before and he no longer could blame Connor for having her as a crush, for even Mérante had fallen… His inner laugh almost deafened him; he wasn´t sure of course but odds were even. The cold ballerina who could very well either skate on hard ice or serve foamy beer on hard floor; such a curious combination that no one could leave it pass without noticing. He wondered if Odette knew the peculiar magic her smell and her eyes were capable of imbuing; ice and steel on the outside while her life roared from eyes that no one could surely say were blue or purple. Mérante tried his best not to lean, but even Beaumont saw he found it difficult. Some sort of barrier was melting and Odette´s mirth over the conversation was palpable. -I´d love if Monsieur Kerloff could think the same way. Can´t really say I enjoy fearing for my life or the pianist´s every time either makes a mistake. -Still, I know Monsieur Kerloff has only three pupils, so you must be very talented or have a very strong heart. -Well, I´m not to judge my talent sir, as for my heart… life has taken care of its strength. -One could say life has the sole purpose of shaping us using very difficult experiences. Odette remained quiet for a bit, doubting he was trying to use such a lowly hissing voice on purpose. Trying to keep her tempered wolf in check, she replied without looking at him. -I´d give something to know it. -What? -The experience you talked about. -Simple curiosity or simple gossip? – he asked, his fangs back on… Odette couldn´t figure him out. When he first talked to her, she was weary fame and good looks had made him an insufferable idiot; but he wasn´t. Then she thought being pushed constantly to perfection had made him bitter and pragmatic, like a snake trying to bite; but he wasn´t. Next, after half an hour of casual conversation, she decided he was black… black elegance, black strength, black temptation into diving in his voice and never look back. And standing there next to her, smelling of expensive cologne with a drop of the wine he drank at dinner, she saw a lion. Dark hazel eyes and the blind black fortitude that had brought him where he was; making his rude fixedness in staring at her almost a compliment; for somehow she´d managed to stop a powerful storm and made it look at her in the eye. But there was no room for compliments, there was no room for anything really. He´d been subtly testing her during the whole conversation, and she had no idea if his daring had crushed on her as a ballerina or as a human being. Yet somehow, she found herself caring to pass the challenges… and deep down she knew that if he´d been any other man, she would have blown him off long ago. \"This is total madness\" but the wolf was howling. Outside, the winter moon shined in all its might and she found herself wishing she had stayed in the glassgardens cutting rose´s thorns from the stems, it was far less puzzling than the puddling mess her mind was turning into. -Simple selfpity- she replied, cold as ice. And to her satisfaction, he seemed out of words. -I´m sorry sweetling- interrupted Madame Beaumont, but Odette felt as if she had emptied a water bucket on top of her, she was grateful, maybe it would take away that golden spark suddenly nestled in the base of her spine, -The storm might get worse and it´s likely it´ll stop from even crossing the street if you want to leave later. Odette sent hundred blessings to the skies and made her leave; said hurried farewells, put Hugo´s cloak on and went back to the flowershop, running and looking at the sky. Out of the lion´s reach, she felt like a wolf again, her blood singing and the fierce melody in her soul seemed to send a storm of blue roses towards the winter moon. \"Am I drunk?\" she thought, \"I´m … I´m…\" she felt, not realizing Louis Mérante was still looking at her silhouette from the window. A/N So sorry for the delay guys! But writing regularly became complicated since uni starts next week and I also restarted at my part time job... so life is tough again XDXD And I DID start a chapter... but I wasn´t really IN LOVE with it, and i refused to give you guys something not worth while. So... what do you guys think? You can´t imagine how difficult it was to think of these two talking for the first time! Had to watch the movie thrice and...I fell for them all over again :3 Now, I´ll answer your sweet reviews here to non-account users ;) Loren Glad you liked it! The reason I take so much time in making it is because ballet is a really delicate art and this ship is sooooo cute XD Tess Here you go :3 hoped you enjoy reading as much as I writing it. It´s very important for me the story follows a natural order because all the symbolism makes it surreal, so at least we need to have that. Don´t you think? Guest Awww, it really warms my heart to see you that impatient ;) Karen García IKR, It´s very touching you appreciate this the way I do. I love the movie and I shipped Mérante and Odette the minute I looked at them. Sad there´s so few shippers :/ but at least we know it was us who started it :3 Just me The background for me was really important since it´s the foundation of the rest, the romance and the loveliness of these two is a bit fluffy, but those reality dots every now and then are what gives the story the balance for the magic, XDXD Thank you all! You are the best and please remember to R&R; to let me know what you think ;)[Chapter 8] Chapter VIII Of kings and queens -Well, she got you. -Excuse me? -Don´t bother to deny it Louis. Mérante knew pretending innocence was as stupid as trying to shoot a ghost, but still tried to defend himself. -She´s Connor´s sweetheart- he said even though much to his shame, a couple of hours ago, Connor was the last person on his mind. -She´s nothing of the sort, and she never will be - replied his old tutor putting on his nightclothes, -you know that, I know that and I bet even she knows it. So, stop being a whining prick and say something. -What do you want me to say? Connor is my friend, he was there first– for some reason, he was furious. -Connor IS your friend, true. And he´s my friend as well, and as far as I know friends are there to keep each other from getting hurt or making brainless decisions. Odette would make him suffer, she already does but on the other side; she seems to make your mind spry. -That´s… -A hard truth, and yet hard truths are the ones we should hold on most. -Regardless, this is dangerous territory for friendship and… -Is it dangerous to have someone between your heartstrings? – Beaumont interrupted again, realizing he was actually enjoying this exchange. Putting Mérante on edge was something no one could do easily, and making him snarl like an angry lion was resulting quite entertaining… almost as amusing as when he defended his ambitions in front of his parents, his father turning green and his mother red while he retorted lazy freedom quotes he´d heard somewhere before; astounded at how square-minded they were, -Most people I know come to like the taste of it. Mérante kept an obstinate silence. -Come to think of it… you haven´t still admitted you like those cold languid purple eyes… -You are truly vexing my friend, - his companion said after a few seconds, removing his clothes, moonlight reflecting his hard abdomen muscles, -But I won´t, we had an interesting conversation and that is all. -C´mon Louis… shall I come up with a song for her? – he taunted once more, lying on the bed, composing music was one of his hobbies as it had actually introduced him to ballet. -Her eyes are blue. -Excuse me? -I said her eyes are blue, - he repeated while he sat on his bed to remove his shoes and underclothes. –Make sure you get that right. Beaumont smiled triumphantly, -I shall, maybe tomorrow night you can tell me the color of her hair as well. -Chestnut. Beaumont rolled his eyes. -Keep denying it all you want Mérante, but you swore no oath to Connor and even if you don´t ask for it, I´ll talk him out of her. -That´s outrageous, you´re making it look as if you were on my side. -There are no sides here boy, I told you long ago. Nobody should go against one´s nature, Odette goes against Connor´s. -And she goes with mine? – he retorted with a sarcastic giggle. -She doesn´t oppose it. -Sounds like a curse. -Connor is a bit of a twerp, he needs a patient lady for his idle wits. -And what do I need Beaumont? Are you nature´s own doctor to come up with people under the guise of remedies? -I´m no such thing but I do spend a lot of time thinking and reading and looking, which gives me a bit more insight than most. Mérante sighed and lied down on his bed, grasping the candlewick firmly between his index and thumb to extinguish its golden light. The swift hot sensation was good, like a snap into reality. He was almost afraid to sleep, for if he dreamt there was going to be icy howling, the faint smell of roses and winter snows, a wolf´s paw in a night where everything was blue and still, and blue and cold, and blue and dreamy. And blue. A tickling sensation was born in the pit of his stomach. -You need…- Beaumont continued, sure he was listening even if he´d left the room in darkness to pretend otherwise, -I don´t think there´s anyone you truly need Louis, you love ballet that much. But if you ever find yourself in desire for company or a woman with the brain to put words on her mouth different than fashion or butterflies and still make them sound as passionate as a lover´s embrace, then yes. I think Odette is your wolf. Then suddenly, dreaming wasn´t so bad. Next day he felt so heartsick and treacherous to Connor he could scarcely stand. But now his fury was on him, filling him with strength; the next moment he felt tall and mighty, almost like a lion. \"And a lion doesn´t sulk in slumber\" He breathed and he felt, the kids wanted an excursion to a nearby barrow with him and Beaumont. Mérante complied with a smile and marveled at the beauty of a winter morning in the countryside: bright scarlet frostfires and stands of lemongrass in russet and gold on either side of the road, a clear sky welcomed the waking sun, making Mérante want nothing but to lie down once more and gaze at it all. The barrowtop wasn´t too hard to reach but the children were hungry and in a bad mood when they got there, luckily their uncle had stolen soft croissants and berry jam from the kitchen, which the kids ate enthusiastically before running downhill back to the village. Mérante remained in silence and even during lunch, he secluded himself in deep thought. Only talking when someone addressed him and payed no mind even when Beaumont told his family out loud he sometimes got possessed by a gnome that ate his tongue. Gabrielle and Adelaide asked their mother to go for a walk after their nap and Mérante, much to his own surprise, volunteered to take them. Not that it was too weird, after all Adelaide at least was the same age his youngest corypheés were. They went around the square with only a couple of feminine heads turning to look at him after recognizing his face. -Is he…? -So stylish! -Don´t forget his looks!- he heard them giggle. Adelaide and Gabrielle asked him to go to the lake side to see if Odette was around; but it was too early in the day for her to be ice skating and the flowershop was still open, yet Gabrielle wanted to make sure the ballerina dined with the family. Mérante let the little girls go ahead and enter the shop as he, for the sake of prudence, stayed outside and admired the flowers displayed in huge claypots on stony steps outside the closed door. The girls left the establishment in a bliss with a bunch of pink lilies each. -She said she´d come! And much to his regret, when coming back to the bakery, he found himself looking at the clock on the wall. The snow fell on the rooftops the moment the ballerina closed the bakery door behind her, because of the cold her skin was pale and her lips were red; the grace in her movements prevented him from looking at the soup in his bowl and the cadence in her husky voice kept him from listening to Beaumont, sitting to his left. -Monsieur Mérante- he said sarcatiscally, - if you keep distracting yourself like that you´ll pour the soup all over the table. Imagine how entertaining that´d be!- he added while pushing his old student´s elbow to make him loose his balance on the spoon. -Huh? - Louis replied, but recovered quickly enough to avoid making a fool of himself. Beaumont tried to hide his disappointment and murmured: -Maybe tomorrow you should sit next to her, at least you could pretend to be interested in something different than her face. I thought this was dangerous for friendship. -There is no sin in becoming friends with her. -I wasn´t talking about friendship. Mérante didn´t reply. After dinner, Beaumont sat with the children while his brother and sister-in-law discussed the increase of the flour and fruit´s price. Louis was thinking again about an excuse to approach the ballerina; but she came on her own. -Good evening sir, would you like to play a bit of chess? He hadn´t noticed the wooden box she carried next to her hip. -Sure mademoiselle. But I fear… -Those who fear of losing have already lost- she interrupted while arranging two chairs and the small stool she sat on the night before. -Would you like the black or white pieces? -I don´t mind- he said. She picked the black ones. -Gabrielle told me you climbed Mont Marine this morning- she voiced, just for small talk. -It was hardly a climb, more like a walk to the top. -Still, it made them sweat. -I guess it did. The landscape was really beautiful. -I used to hate it He paused his white rook in midair to look at those eyes again. -Is that so? She seemed to think about it and mumbled in a soft voice: -When I became a hungry orphan, winter was my sworn enemy. I often thought snowfall laughed at me, at my cold feet and my empty stomach. When morning came and painted everything in gold, I remembered the times I would go out to the woods with my parents and gaze at the sky. Winter just made everything harder. She paused and took his pawn with her black knight. -Which is why I´m now grateful to it. -How did you end up in the flowershop? - it was an extremely personal question, he realized as soon as he spoke. But Odette shrugged and replied in the same tone -My house was made of gray stone walls, I often thought it looked like a castle and I was its princess. The back wall of the shop had also gray stones and I liked to come up with games there; that´s how I met Monsieur Hugo, he played with me and gave me blue flowers to bring back home. When it all ended he tried to look for me but I was gone. -Where did you go? -Nowhere. His eyes left her face and he felt a genuine sorry. Her life, so different from his own, was the sad story he thought he´d glimpsed from behind her gaze; but to imagine it and listen to it was different and he felt out of place, as out of place as she´d be if put in the middle of a flowery meadow, with the midday sun above her when that wintery purple glance was made to look at white snows. -When I saw the flowershop again, he´d removed the stones for bricks. He knew that wall was all I had of my imaginary castle… but upon looking at me, he said wild things belong in the wild not in a castle. And I no longer felt pity for myself. A strange fascination was born in his mind, he felt full of life and yet very tired like if he had just performed a difficult dance on stage. -I like chess- she commented again, realizing he was somewhere else and as expected, he came back, -They say playing chess empowers one´s memory until thoughts long forgotten return. -I don´t know if I´d like that- he said, thinking of her words, - And I often find that what people say is only legend and rhyme. -Many times it turns out to be true as well- she said, pushing her black queen forwards. -I´m not denying that- he protected his king with a bishop and a rook. She adopted a testing tone and her eyes drilled his. -They say night´s beauties fade at dawn. -All beauties fade mademoiselle. -Even those who are from the city and from the field? He couldn´t make out her riddle, he only could reply in the most sensible way -Of course. -How curious- she whispered, taking the rook that protected his king with her queen, -I would´ve thought the beauty in ballet never died. -It does when the dancer leaves the stage- he replied as she threw his white queen on the pile of taken pieces, -But it remains in the memory of the ones who saw it. -Tell me, Monsieur Mérante, - if she had asked, he was sure he´d tell her the scent and color of his most personal belongings, so full of her sweet liqueur he was, he might´ve lost the chess game on the board, the warm smoky air from the hearth reached him and brought Connor to his mind. –I thought you were a thorny self-centered teacher, then a frowning observer of life and now I don´t know what to think. -It´s better we remain a mystery to each other mademoiselle Odette, life is full of them…Check mate. She looked at him not sure if he referred to them or the game, gazing at the board she realized Mérante´s queen had a straight line to her king now that she´d taken his rook. -When I was a child I stared into the stars so long I should have set the sky on fire, - he added, she was at a loss of words but Mérante sensed it wouldn´t be for long… and he felt that was the reason he felt what he felt. Odette wasn´t a young woman with whom he had to take care of the harshness in his words or how dirty the world was; she had seen it and she had lived through it long enough to tell her own tales. –I still do. But the stars are still there and the night still comes. Both of them were riddles, they were enigmas and yet her heart was the wild one, the one full of magic and summer snows falling on icy roses as perfumed as her long chestnut locks. She used her index to knock her king down on the board, Mérante looked at it… her queen and her rooks survived, his king and some pawns stood still on his side. -Chess is also a mystery Monsieur, nobody knows how it might turn out and yet people still play it. -People like to think of themselves as kings and queens, perhaps that is why. She glanced at her queen. -If I was no princess as a girl, I highly doubt I´m a queen now. -You may still become one, for a king. Odette turned her eyes towards his king. -I don´t want a king. -Then what do you want? \"My God…how did we get here?\" he thought, a bit surprised and a bit scandalized, speaking in riddles that were clear as water for each and about inner thoughts they´ve never had truly said out loud. Her words were like a long forgotten bane as her eyes left his wits a blighted mess, and it was all too welcomed. \"Too much\" -I´d like a friend- she said, almost like a plea. And he relented, God be good, he relented for if he didn´t someone else would. A/N Hi people! Once more, thank you all for reading and pretty PLEASE... let me know what you think since it really encourages me to keep it up, ;)[Chapter 9] Chapter IX A black lion The days prior to New Year´s Eve passed in a swirl of color and chat. Odette would stay at the flowershop during the mornings, skate in the afternoons and talk and awe at night. She soon realized her life revolved around dinner time, when she could talk to him. Smacking herself because of it and seeing their conversations required all the inventiveness she could gather to get back at Mérante whenever he was trying to trap her in wordplay, it was like a breath away from her normal life, like the feeling of crossing under a waterfall; as days went by, Odette was in no position to deny she was attracted to the young ballet master and between conversations, chess plays and times when they would only stare at each other she could swear there was something there. Something that tasted like honey and smoke, so untouchable and yet so real she could feel it throbbing inside her as if it had the power to intoxicate her soul, her dragon and her wolf. The black eagerness he made her feel became uncomfortable, she had no time to fall for anyone. Back in Paris, she could pull herself together, all the strength that had made her climb to the Opera had faded like summer winds… here, in her hometown she was vulnerable, the phantom from her childhood hovering over the rooftops and under her bed. But Mérante´s mute challenges and kind regard were starting to melt her frozen armor, so carefully built over the years she had almost forgotten it was there. The nights full of defiant talk and quiet whispers, they were like drops of water filling a crystal jar, the water was fresh and reflected all the dreams she ever had, adding a new one. -It´s hard to fall in love, little one- someone had told her once, whether it had been Apolline or her own mother, Odette was now longer sure. Her parents were starting to be part of a bane in her heart that she tried to avoid, as if they were buried deep in the sea \"Well, at least they´re buried somewhere\" she thought, as the real ashes of her parents were still scattered in the charcoaled wind surrounding her old house, -It´s like falling into a dream, you can never tell truth from lie. The phrase had always scared her, telling her love was like being drunk all the time. She had seen drunk people way too much by now and they always did stupid things. But it scared her even more the fact that being drunk with the ballet master´s poison was not a repulsive idea, making her as stupid as any drunkman. Everyone wants love, but they don´t want to feel vulnerable. \"Like trying to go to heaven without dying\" she thought as she put on the black and blue dirndl Apolline had made for her. Her reflection told her maybe the heart shaped cleavage was a bit low; and decided to place a rose there; it was a formal dinner after all. A loose bun gave softness to her face and her ever present wolf necklace had to be left on the nightstand. The moment she entered the Beaumont´s dining room, Odette thought wearing the dirndl had not been a bad idea after all judging from the admiration looks the little girls gave her and the appreciative nod Madame Beaumont regarded her with. Mérante´s face was, as usual, an enigma sent to torment her with stupid thoughts and silly dreams, his dark hair shone like the surface of a black pearl and the gentleness in his hazel gaze was coupled with an appealing sentiment she could not quite describe except it made her feel like if her dragon was humming. The snow was falling outside when they all sat for dinner and Odette could swear little Gabrielle sat on Mérante´s chair on purpose, the wink in Monsieur Armand Beaumont eyes betrayed his oddly solemn appearance. So, Louis Mérante sat beside her; his hand resting a mere inch away… she smacked herself inwardly, again. -May I offer some wine mademoiselle? He never waited for her reply and just poured the red liquid in the glass, Odette stared at it and nodded in appreciation. -Are you enjoying your stay here Monsieur? She said, but regretted it a minute later, they were close enough now to start better conversations, and yet she sighed in relief… drawing a line there was better for when she returned to Paris, things could easily go back the way they were. -I thought we were past this Odette. Her head was underwater, realizing without really thinking that things would never be as before. She looked at him intently and he smiled. -Excuse me, I just thought there were better ways to start a chat than asking a question whose answer you already know. Instead of blushing, Mérante saw her cheeks turning white. -What are we past from Monsieur? He could almost hear the lion in him purring to her battle chant, her gaze so blue it looked violet and the nerve she had to pierce directly into his head. -Forgive me mademoiselle, perhaps I made a mistake before in believing I could give you what you asked the first time we played chess. Odette found it remarkable he remembered and replied in a hoarse tone. -There´s nothing to forgive, I was too hasty in my reply. My apologies. She drank a sip of wine and remained in silence, warring against herself once more. -During New Year´s Eve, -he said, -my family used to organize pranks on each other based on something funny that had happened during the year, at first I thought it was a normal custom until I realized nobody else did it. But..-he paused, -As soon as I asked, we stopped doing it. -I don´t remember my family had any special New Year´s custom besides a small banquet. We never had a lot of coin to spare. Eating foie-gras for instance, was a real luxury for us. -Feasting is just a matter of perspective- Mérante said after having some more caramelized turnips on his plate. -Is it? -Even crows can feast. The vision disturbed her a little bit, she remembered those birds squawking on the morning after the fire, the birthday song for her dragon. -Yes, I think so too. -Do you? - that wasn´t really like her, either she questioned his opinion or was openly against it. -I mean… it wasn´t really that long ago that crows flew over these regions like clouds announcing death. Revolution took its toll everywhere, but the countryside around Paris was a dumpster for corpses. Crows even feasted on royalty back then. Mérante didn´t need to think about all his history lessons to know she was right. -Makes you think how much a crown is really worth, when crows can dine upon kings. She thought a little bit on his remark before adding -They might have eaten him, but we killed him first… I often think about what was really happening in the minds of the citizens back then that made them cut the head off their own king. -There was nothing in their heads Odette, they were as empty as their children´s bellies. She looked at him again. -Sometimes I wonder what would I have done have I lived back then; if I would have remained loyal to the crown or to the people. It was his turn to drink some wine, he had to in order to keep up with their conversations… and with her voice and with her rose scented hair. -You once told me winter made everything harder and I thought it somehow made you wiser; it hasn´t even been a century since the Revolution and old wounds still bleed. The conflict started in spring but I wonder how long it would´ve last had it begun during the snow and the ice. You might´ve been Jacobin and Girondin on the same year; or you might not have cared at all. -I guess we´ll never know then- She finished while placing her cutlery on the empty plate. -But I do know. Odette said nothing as she helped to clear the table, his dark hazel gaze haunted her with the echo of his last phrase and even after having dessert and sitting close enough to the hearth not to be frozen by the blizzard storming outside, she kept a courteous silence. \"He thinks he´s got me figured out\" she realized, fuming. \"He thinks I…\" Mérante approached, just as she knew he would and Odette decided to continue the intellectual exchange they had during dinner. The young ballet master thought himself trapped by her suggestive charm, nonchalant demeanor and cold politeness added some sort of spell over his mind he could not decipher yet, and he wasn´t even sure he wanted to; for he enjoyed her distant care and the frosty magic in the way she regarded him, her witty talk and phrases loaded in silent challenge. The shadow Odette threw over his friendship with Connor was decisively the only thing between them. But it was an enormous shadow, and he was afraid of its pitch blackness. -Tell me one thing then Monsieur, -she asked as soon as he sat. –If you think me capable of shifting loyalties as the seasons waste away. There´s no point in me making promises, therefore I´m capable of every kind of deceit and insincerity. He leaned his elbows on his knees as he got closer to her face, she could see him even more carefully now that he was near: his sharp jaw curve, the length of his black lashes, his attractive face made her almost forget to listen to his voice. And the only thing Mérante thought about was the ice in her words and the fire in her eyes, and the fact she got to choose which of those she´d give him crushed him by realizing once more he really didn´t give a damn about it as long as it was for him. And for him alone. -And capable of equal amounts of honesty, - he added, to complement her previous speech, -We all are. Every man and woman has darkness and light in their hearts. Even those who´ve sworn to help us in our perils. The world often forgets that the ones who are able to heal are also able to kill. -You mean doctors? -Not only doctors- he replied looking back at her with an intent look, so intense she had to turn and gaze at the flames but thought better about it and turned again to face him. -You´re very intense when you discuss- he said. \"You´re the fairest thing I´ve ever seen\" he thought, Odette was someone out of his world, like the maiden from a faraway star one old folktale spoke about and as she dared him once more in a staring duel he remembered the first time he saw her, and he compared it with that moment, now that he knew her. This woman, this warrior wolfqueen had been made for that ravished wilderness part in his spirit that Beaumont insisted only Odette could tame. She was so close to him she could perceive his scent, full of all the odours she enjoyed since she was a little girl running through snowy woods. \"Louis Mérante…\" she pondered inside her hammering head, \"It´s good for me we´re so very away from each other back in Paris, living totally different lives, for if not… this winter would´ve been much more dangerous\". The tone of their conversation decreased to mundane matters and when Odette announced she meant to go home he looked genuinely disappointed. That night, in the quiet dark of her room, she put on her starchless white tutu and the pair of blood red silken ballet pointes she´d bought after much effort in saving money for a long time, and danced her captivation for only the moon to see. The wild enrapturement she had started to feel for Mérante made her feel as powerful and mighty as a thunderstorm. \"Am I in love?\" she thought while pirouetting. \"It´s so sudden and abrupt\" and yet, she had never felt so understood before, and in no way she sensed her spirit in chains or her wolf shedding tears for its lost freedom. Odette greeted the New Year with ballet in her moves and Mérante in her thoughts. The flowy and soft white skirt caressing her thighs and calves… if she´d been a real wolf, she´d be moving her tail. . . . -You were right. -Oh? Beaumont sat on the couch next to his old student and offered him some wine. -I´m always right, you´re just too slow to admit it. -About Odette -What about her? -I´m falling in…. -I know that Louis, -he waved his hand- But the good question is, what will you do about it? -I appreciate Connor, and I appreciate Odette. I won´t do anything to hurt them -I don´t think you´ll hurt Odette by making a move; she looked quite pleased whenever you were around. -I´ll hurt her if I do something and break it if I feel regrets. -Excuse me, but the situation you and Odette are in is nowhere within the realms of regret. We´re getting back to Paris next week and neither of you will be able to pretend you don´t know each other anymore. The Opera is a perfect scenario; your admirers will surely be disappointed but- -I´m not going to do anything Beaumont. His teacher sighed. He knew Mérante had the temperament of a lion, loyal to a fault and stubborn enough to exasperate a saint. But he also knew there were certain chances in life one could only get once, a ship one could only board in its maiden-voyage. In the matters of the heart… love was like a trickster; waiting for people to leave their guard down. -I loved someone once, you know?- he said out loud. His voice a quiet whisper, sadder than anything Mérante had heard before. They kept silence for some moments and Mérante asked -What happened to her? -Doesn´t matter now- he rubbed his nose, -what matters is what you do now Louis. True love comes once in a lifetime -I don´t believe in that and you know it. -Perhaps now it´s time you do, love is like the night and the storm in the heart of the sun; it´s ancient and forever burns at the center of time. Makes you do stupid things but you´d rather die now than live forever without it. Mérante didn´t fight back the way he always did, but remained deep in thought. -I never wanted nor asked for this to happen. -Nobody does- replied Beaumont as the cracking of the fire made him feel all the peace he could get out from his long broken heart.

A bending wolfqueen Next week, they were gone. Thanks be to God, they were gone; and although Odette missed their conversations, there was little time for her to be idling now. Hugo and Apoline had returned on the second week of January, both of them suffering a terrible cold they caught somewhere near the border with Prussia, and even when she offered to stay longer, Hugo insisted she had to go back to keep chasing her dreams. They got up of bed to say farewell; tears and hugs as they saw her dangling wolf necklace and a new crystal case for a fresh blue rose. -We bought the box in a village by the shore- Apoline said, -they use seawater to temper the glass, so the locals say it contains the essence of the ocean. -Keep dreaming big, little one. And Odette swallowed her longings and her whispers to show a smile that didn´t quite reached her eyes, which had the pale cyan of the sky and the sea smell in her imagination, for Odette had never seen the water of the waves washing over sand. There was something off, she felt like crying, like if there was something that would change forever before she came back to her little hometown. And there was some true in that, for she never came back. . . . Just going back to \"Britain´s Bride\" she was greeted with bad news, well… not exactly, they were bad news for her only. Orlenna and Philippe were just like she remembered; except they now had a passport and a ticket for a ship for the New World. -I never knew anything about this!- she exclaimed, somewhere in battle between trying to be happy for them but also being extremely sad for their departure. -We couldn´t tell you until we were certain love- Orlenna replied, her amber eyes shining with glittering drops she tried to hold back, -It´s been something we both wanted to do since leaving Britany, have a land and an opportunity to go up in life, you know? But we don´t want to leave you alone, so we have a deal for you… Odette refrained the thousand reproaches that were about to leave her mouth for them not telling her sooner, so she could have had time to find a new place. -Here, there´s enough money for one more ticket…- The color on the young ballerina´s face left all of a sudden and Phillippe thought she´d never looked so sickly, something must´ve happened back in her little village. -Odette- he said- are you all right? Did something happen? She turned her eyes to him and once more he and his sister marveled at the ability of her pupils to shift their shadowy undefined color to match her mood; for they knew there were times her eyes were impossibly blue, a shade as deep and rich like a sapphirine amethyst, and yet now… there was only gray, a bluish gray. -Well… now that you ask, yes. My very old adoptive parents came back from their honeymoon with a cold that could turn to pneumonia any minute; my two best friends who happen to be my landlors are about to leave forever and I think I´ve fallen in love with a famous ex-ballet dancer in the worst moment of my career to be in love with anything other than my art; my two friends are offering me a ticket to go with them all right but there´s nothing for me in the New World and I´ll be left here, trying to fulfill a dream that if I ever manage to make into reality, there will be no one to celebrate it with!- she howled in an explosion of cold colors, red blush on white skin and rosesmell. And she felt her dragon purring, cornering the wolf that was so alive just some days earlier, proving her once more life was as soon up and as soon down like dead and alive were the blue roses´ petals Hugo sent her instead of his presence after her ballet functions. Philippe and Orlenna were silent for some minutes before he finally said: -Is it Mérante? You mentioned him in one of your letters- Odette nodded, momentarily regretting having sent them letters during her holidays. -He seems like a fine man- Orlenna whispered, remembering the one time she saw him dancing and then at the bar, his dark hazel gaze fixed on the wolfmaid. -He is- Odette retorted –but there´s nothing I can do right now. He´s starting his teaching and I´m trying to become a prima ballerina before spring comes- her shoulders fell, as if bearing all the bad things that happened in the world just on her own Hot boiling tears streamed down her cheeks before she could stop them, and both Philippe and Orlena remained silent. -I´m sorry- she said, trying to recover –Too much is happening at the same time and I´m trying to cope. The young girl headed towards her room, but before disappearing in the shadows engulfing the staircase, she looked back and said with a face that could break anyone´s heart, so much that it certainly broke theirs. -I cannot go with you beyond France, when are you expected to leave? Orlena couldn´t say a word, so it fell on Philippe to respond. -Next month. Odette nodded and shut the door of her room, somehow the bartenders felt as if she was closing a door to something else as well. The young ballerina sat on her bed and arranged the blue roses in the vase, put on a nightgown and stared at her reflection on the mirror. She had grown taller since autumn, her skin had a new glow and her body was definitely that of a young woman… but her eyes had a new obscurity to them and it hung over her like a shadow, a gloom she wasn´t quite sure how it´d appeared but was there nonetheless, and she wondered if it was the dragon in her mind and her dreams, breaking finally free in the reality. Her wavy hair reeked of rosesmell and it was in that moment more than any other, that she missed her old town, the flowershop, Hugo and Apolline, now coughing their lungs out. She thought of Mérante, of his attractive face and elegant words, contrasting so much with her situation for she knew they could never stand as equals, he was a ballet legend and a promising master while she fought to have food on her plate everyday and tried to earn herself a place on stage in the Opera House. So that night, the wolfmaid shut the door to her heart. . . . The next weeks were spent in silence and dread, as if her whole world knew what was coming and decided to keep silent, a deep breath before a performance, the hushed stillness before the thunder. Monsieur Kerloff recommended her for auditioning in the next Swan Lake presentation, and she assumed he wished her to postulate as the white swan, ironic life pushed her to be Odette in the play just as in reality. But when he asked for a pianist to rehearse the steps, Odette realized he wanted her to be the black swan, Odile. -You don´t strike me as the sweet and innocent white swan, Odette- he said shrugging, -Now more than in winter, the melancholy I sense in your dance has become darker- he didn´t say it as a criticism or asking for explanations, and Odette thanked him for it, -That and your foolish refusal in starching your tutus makes you an interesting subject of study- his tone made the young ballerina feel like an animal in training, -I wonder if Vacourbeil would consider you for…-but his voice died in whispers as he snapped his fingers to indicate the pianist to start playing. Truth was Monsieur Kerloff wanted Odette to be the next prima ballerina and somehow he felt August Vacourbeil had been biased to look in her direction by someone either very rich or very influential. But now that his young pupil had the Opera´s attention, he´d make sure it payed for it in gold and applause; for it may be Kerloff kept his nose out of his pupil´s personal life, but he noted the callosities in her hands and occasional bruises in her arms, typical in waitresses that carried a heavy weight for long periods of time. And that earned her his respect, never once she complained and always came back with perfected movements, almost like one of those persistent predators in the white forests, hunting under freezing winds and despise the odds, going back to their caves with a prey; in that light she was like a hungry beast, like a winter she-wolf. Her piercing blue eyes told a sorrowful story wherever they fixed and now the Christmas period was over, the lushly purple in them he once saw turned to a dusky gray, a gray colder than the clouds before a storm. She was the black swan or she was no one at all. . . . Odette finished packing her belongings in the trunk and made herself ready to go serving at the new Madame LeHautt´s café, a position Orlena had gotten for her before leaving for the new continent next week. -She´s hiring lots of people- the bartender assured her when Odette retorted serving in a fancy café was way different than at a quaint tavern, -And she has no problem with you sleeping in the rooms in the upper part of the building since other girls do it as well. But Odette knew she had no choice other than accepting and pretend everything was fine, news of Apolline and Hugo´s health had stopped arriving and she was getting frenetic, with no money to go back and check on them, and no money left if she managed to get there and call in for a physician. Like many other things in her life, there was nothing she could do about it, so she let it pass as she let pass hundreds of opportunities to talk with Louis Mérante, she didn´t want his compassion much less his pity and what she did want from him was useless right now if she desired to fulfill her dream first. The day Orlena and Phillipe left for the new state of York on the other side of the ocean, she felt so out of everything she could barely breathe; her heart so full of pain it kept her dragon clawing its curved speared-like nails along the spine´s fur of the wolf, exhausted and asleep in a corner. Looking back, she felt as if both her friends were just ghosting around the harbor, the wood of the ship´s deck crackling their silent steps as they left French ground forever. Odette bid farewell to their shouting and the waving of their arms but strangely, no tears left her eyes even though her soul felt as lonely as ever, because she sought and found only to be let down time after time. She believed, if only for its sake while being torn in different pieces that scattered in the wind, like the snowflakes Hugo used to show her during winters. If only… if only… if only she was able to wrap herself in that hope to shine brighter than the flames that engulfed her parents, brighter than the black scales of the dragon or the yellow eyes of the wolf, for regardless of her fight there was so much she could do for herself. Her arms stopped waving goodbyes as the ship disappeared in the skyline and the crystal box Apolline had given her when coming back from her honeymoon slipped from her pocket and dove into waters as gray as Odette´s eyes shining with biting tears. That night she dreamt with the blue roses covering the dressing room, their thorns keeping the dragon away, but it extended its huge wings and destroyed the roof allowing the silver moonlight to come in, a lion roared outside while the raging dragon breathed fire on the room, torching the entire building as the sky turned as red as blood and the blue rose petals rained on it all. So beautiful she would´ve wept if her tears hadn´t already dried out, and so frustratingly tragic she could´ve unleashed her wrath to set the stars ablaze herself. But all her sadness and all her anger bled into her dance, they both got her the black swan; Monsieur Kerloff was happy and she tried to be happy as well, but thought about the night Orlenna revealed she and her brother were leaving, when Odettesaid that if she ever achieved her dream there´d be no one to be glad with. And she had been right, her fingers were just grasping such dream and she was all alone. But even when her new job required her undivided attention since her new boss was always on the verge of hysteria, Odette´s nature was not in surrendering, she wouldn´t let anything to come in between her and the prima ballerina´s position, not even when Mérante himself came to her to congratulate her on acquiring the part. Or so she thought as she spotted his elegant silhouette heading towards her when they finished the last rehearsal for the day. -Madame Odette…- he said, that deep husky tone that got the wolf licking her vertebrae. -Monsieur Mérante... –she replied. Louis compared the sound once more with the cracking of ice, chirping of needles breaking glass and silver bells stroking in Sunday mornings. She was still the icy lovely maid he met in winter, panting because of the effort of her recent dancing, humanizing his memories of her and sending his head in distraction with the movement of her neck when breathing that caused the wolf necklace to flicker on her chest, or how she gave off that faint smell of roses. Both were shivering but tried their best to conceal it, much for the entertainment of Beaumont, watching them from the pit. Hello again!

A lion´s heart . Beaumont saw them from the distance, and thought with an inner laugh they were the embodiment from an old folktale about a maiden that came down on earth from a faraway star and a king with no queen, one had only to spice things up to imagine the rest of the story, a beautiful reminder of a bygone age, one where love seemed to feed everything. He thought that was precisely what those two needed, add herbs and spices and off they´d go; not so naïve to live only of love and stories… but Mérante had a place of his own and enough coin to spare inviting a girl in occasional dates. And even then, Beaumont realized Mérante saved quite a bit of money in this department, for years different ballerinas and academy students or young musician girls pursued Louis, if it was because of his lastname or his payroll, there was no way of knowing. But the young dancer with the smell of roses had been the one his old pupil´s choose, the one his police friend had seen first and the one he could not have that easily, given the cold magic she regarded everyone with. Maybe that´s what made her attractive, or maybe it was just her eyes and her scent; after \"Britain´s Bride\" had closed with no explanation, Meranté had searched for her relentlessly, but the young woman had a talent to disappear and now that she´d gotten the part for the black swan, it was really the only moment anyone had to talk to her, he´d said so to Louis and sooner rather than later, the young man left him chatting with his back turned on him while Louis himself headed towards the stage where Tchaikovsky´s music died as slowly as the white swan in the play. Beaumont shrugged and went towards the exit, if Meranté needed time with the wild ice princess, he´d give it. . . . -Have you had luch yet? Odette hated lying, but saying the truth would probably mean he´ll ask her out, and that was the last thing she wanted or needed right now, so she avoided the question altogether -Haven´t seen you in a while Monsieur, I´m glad we could meet- she said while removing her red silken pointes and walking towards the exit hallway shoeless, her feet barely taping above a whisper contrasting with Mérante´s heels clacking on the wood. -So am I mademoiselle, but don´t think I have not realized you´re not answering my question, which means either you have not had lunch or you do not want to eat with me. Which one is it Odette? It was the first time he called her by her name and the sound of it from his lips left her dumbfounded, like a lighting had just stroke her, but managed to contain a bit and replied with her usual coldness -The truth lies in both reasons sir, though you are right I have not had a meal today yet, I have no intention of going to a fine-lunching place by the river, much less I wish you to pay for my share and if you´re thinking- -Excuse me Odette, I thought I told you back in your town my offer was being your friend, and as of that night, you accepted. Has Your Highness changed her mind? Something within Odette was triggered when she heard him call her like that, she removed her hairnet and as her long chocolate waves embraced her face like a slow waterfall, she replied with that tone Mérante had learned to like and to dread at the same time. -I did accept your offer- was her biting remark, making it sound like an insult, -Never again call me Your Highness, I told you that same night I was no queen.- her voice a silver whip that cracked ice. Louis walked in silence with her to the changing room, Odette turned and simply said: -5 minutes- before locking the door behind her. He smiled on the inside and remained calmed and composed on the outside, the girls from the choir and stage looking at him with ill placed interest. It was then when Pierre Noirblanc, the Opera´s costume manager came with three large packages. -These are for mademoiselle Odette, as well as this- he gave him an envelope not even looking at his face, probably assuming he was the manservant of the ballerina… normal considering most dancers with rooms on that corridor had one.- And this-He indicated pointing at two young men that were carrying among the two the hugest bouquet of roses Mérante had ever seen, blue roses… so big his extended palm couldn´t cover one and so dark in their color they looked like the bottom of the ocean near their center, where the smaller petals were clustered. Mérante let Pierre leave the boxes on the floor, he took the letter and knocked at Odette´s door -I hate when people hurry me up. -Two men will have hernias if you don´t open right now That made her rush, and Mérante couldn´t help but an inner smile when her slender form revealed how much had she hurried to open the changing room. But before she could protest, the men with the roses carried them to the inside, almost crushing her under their feet. -What the…? The bouquets were left on each side of the boudoir, perfuming the room and, to Mérante´s eyes, enriching the room in a very Odette-like way. He gave her the card and resisted the urge to close her mouth to change her dumbfounded expression, she opened the envelope and read it, taking his breath away, the reason being simply because her face softened into one that broke his heart, he´d never seen that sweet and melancholic gesture imprinted on her face, on a face where her eyes should´ve been blue and yet, they became a shady kind of gray. Mérante carried the boxes and left them on a table next to the huge mirror in the back of the room followed closely by Odette. He knew from experience Noirblanc was in charge of giving out the costumes for the dancers in order to test their measures and for them to leave comments on how they felt the fabric and the tightness of the attires. -You lied to me. He hummed affirmatively but distractedly as he opened one of the boxes. -You could ha- her voice stoped as he grabbed the dress and displayed it for her to admire, it was a black custom, black feathers were put all over the skirt and on the heart shaped cleavage, following her request they hadn´t been starched and flowed beautifully towards the floor like morning mist; black satin covered the bodice, when she touched it was as soft as the petals of the roses and the sunlight gave dark multicolored reflection to the different layers of feathers. The other box had a silver jeweled diadem sprinkled with small pieces of handcut crystals that shone like raindrops and the last box had her shoes, black silken pointes. She tried on the diadem without thinking twice she was being observed by Mérante, she looked at herself at the mirror. Louis hadn´t moved a muscle, admiring her from afar as if she were a shooting star crossing his dark night sky, the tiara on her chestnut hair gave her an elegant yet austere look. Not swashing but sober and recollected; discreet and subtle. He cleared his throat, and she finally came from wherever she was, looking as if she had forgotten he was there. -I´ll put the dress on later He said nothing -I can´t have lunch with you Again he remained silent, respecting her determination to draw a line, maybe it was wiser this way and the sudden certainty of it struck him like lighting; Mérante was sure Odette wasn´t indifferent to him, but they were far too young to bring out any serious conclusion of it. Perhaps it was better to wait a bit. And yet, he was afraid Afraid she would leave as suddenly as she had appeared, the first time he saw her, she was dressed in heavy blue velvet, all ice and snow. He worried the last time he´d set eyes upon her, she´d wear nothing but that silver beam of light with the power to melt and freeze his heart in a second, leaving him all alone in the darkness once she´d disappeared -I must leave you Monsieur- she muttered and yet, she stood still in front of the mirror, then quietly she grasped a blue rose between her slenderly delicate long fingers. No small was his surprise when he realized the tears that started to fell from her gray eyes, he startled as Odette gave an angry sigh. -I´m truly pitiable, aren´t I? Mérante knew not what to say, not once had he been alongside a crying woman, much less a woman whom he earnestly cared about, he stepped forward but she hugged the roses, her back turned to him, leaving Louis to only guess her expression, her face buried among the blue petals that received her tears as if they were a sad winter rain. She never had been so close and so far away from him. He could have replied he didn´t find her worthy of pity, but that wouldn´t do. Odette hated vulgar expressions and denying negative statements a person says about themselves was the perfect example of it. In fact, Odette was worthy of no small degree of feelings for him, he searched his emotions and said, a knot tied in his chest. -I find you many things Odette, but not pitiable. But she seemed no to have listened and carried on: -Do you know the loneliest thing in the world? He had a pretty good idea, how many times had he stared at the roof in his parents´ house feeling a stranger in his own family? But allowed her to continue -Monsieur Mérante- her voice cracked, but not like the ice he remembered, she was too upset to care about manners, -My world is shattering, falling to pieces around me, and all I can do is stare blankly, not knowing what I did wrong- he only knew she was talking to him because she had uttered his name, for she was looking at her reflection, Mérante dared not to move, for fear of breaking the sweet spell of intimacy she had conjured around him, he was sure she had never bared her soul like this to anyone, and he was ready to do anything to soothe her, even just to give her a good memory in the middle of all the misery she was in, which by the look of it, it was great and huge and black, like a terrifying dragon. -The way sadness works is one of the strangest riddles in the world- he said, her face lifted up from the flowers, -Tears come from the heart and not from one´s mind- her face was red and her eyes were as blue as the Seine waters. -I know nothing of what you´re going through Odette, there are times when one´s dreams look like broken winged butterflies, and we may sometimes go to bed hoping to fall asleep before we fall apart. But as my old teacher once told me…-he didn´t want to make her sadder, but he couldn´t lie to her, all Mérante could really was hoping that in telling her the truth, her spirit would be strong enough to own and understand it so well, she could find a remedy were none was visible. -That´s just how life is. Illogical and sometimes painful, and more often than not, we´ll simply need to depend on those who care for us not to despair. She gave him a look he could compare to that of a wolf after being shot by the huntsman. -Look into the abyss Odette, what can you see? She shook his head while she finished ruining the beautiful bouquet of blue roses -What if I fall? -My my- he laughed softly –But what if you could fly? Then, after a moment´s silence, she looked at him as if about to tell him something else, but he interrupted, not stopping to think -Is there anything I can do to ease your pain? Her voice came like the murmur of water -I don´t know how my foster parents are. I have received no letter from them for some weeks now; and work… work is not well. His heart spoke before his mind. -I´ll go to your town and see how they are. She rose her face, the colors left her skin and again she seemed the wild maiden with bluish clouds above her. -You would? His heart expanded with the prospect of being of service to her, his black determination came down unto him with the same strength he always had. -I would- he said with his mouth, \"for you\" he said with his eyes. –I´ll expect to be back in time for your debut nonetheless. Wouldn´t miss the new prima ballerina´s presentation for the world. She blushed prettily but frostily, her flush was more of a stony taffy color than the simple cherried peach most women had on their cheeks. -I thank you sir, I… sincerely do. -Repay it by never calling me \"sir\" I beg you, I´m not two years older than you and it makes feel like a grey-haired gentleman with a cane. Odette nodded and showed him a small smile as she grabbed one of the roses she hadn´t crushed with her arms or damped with her tears, lush and full of the smell she had come to own with the years. He held it without saying a word as she left the room, but before he did the same, Mérante exchanged the rose for another in the ruined bouquet, still moist with the young woman´s tears. Putting the flower in an inner pocket of his waistcoat, Louis gave a sigh and headed towards his place, he needed to make last minute preparations, hoping to be back in time for the Swan Lake premiere in three days time. . . . Odette lied in bed that night looking at the moon that glowed through the window, beyond her curtains. She was left with nothing and no one; and yet Louis Mérante was a constant in her fleeting life, now even more when he offered himself to go and check in for Hugo and Apolline. The ballerina found herself thinking of his dark hazel eyes, his jetblack locks and kind gaze, the elegant curve of his jaw and his silky low voice that had managed to break her glass cage. Her heart was in an uproar, she longed for an antidote to counteract the feelings that were starting to root in her chest, for that poison was sweet but it´d kill her all the same, she stirred on the mattress. Her white cotton nightgown revealing the soft curves of her body and the starlight painting her creamy white skin with a silver gloss. Odette covered her eyes, there was nothing she could do now except to wait And dance. Dance for glory and kingdom, a kingdom where her queenship was not a cause to shed any tears but to rejoice in its artistic simplicity; she´d dance with her soul on that stage, lighted just for that night with the new gas lamps the Opera had bought from Monsieur Eiffel´s workshops and novelties market. Hang the dragon, the wolf and all her inner demons, Odette was a ballerina and if she would not prove it to the world, she would prove it to herself. . A/N One more! Thank you all for sticking with me, I hope this chapter had good reviews since it´s a transitorial chapter SPOILER ALERT! I´m just now starting the new chapter and it´s called \" The wake of the dragon \", I´ll let you wild guess here hahaha XD As usual I thank all the favorite/follow clicks and I write to my lovely reviewers that I can´t contact through PM Number 1 fan Aww! I loved your nickname hahaha, so sweet. I really appreciate the previous chapter didn´t seem too off. As I think Odette must´ve had her injury for a long time to be so bitter when Felicie met her. And some other things must happen for her and Mérante to be so distanced... PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE let me know what your thoughts are of this one, ;)[Chapter 12] Chapter XII The wake of the dragon The streets had that sweet sleepy merriment usual in the twilight hours, the waters of the Seine were painted in orange and pinkish lavender. Connor leaned his elbows on the bridge white rail, looking down on the flowing river. He couldn´t say he was happy, Beaumont had spoken to him earlier that day about the wolfmaid. The ballet master told him about his obsession for her, obsession unfortunately fed by the hundreds of pamphlets handed out by little dirty boys anxious to receive a coin in exchange for news, yellowy paper brochures stuck on light posts and street walls. They all had her face drawn on them, her ethereal features hardened by those stormy eyes, cold and sad. Yet, for all of this, Beaumont told him she was no good for him, her melancholic countenance and sharp words would damage his good spirit. -I know you Connor- he said, -You´re a nice fellow, but waste a bit too much time trying to get people to like you. I´m not saying it´s good or bad, that´s just how it is. You don´t really like arts and dare I say, you somehow made fun of Louis for dedicating his life to dancing. Odette won´t…can´t, if I may add, be with someone who doesn´t appreciate what she does for a living. Remember what you told us when we saw her in the theater months ago? -Not really- his voice rasp and cracky. -You said she was like a winter sunset, and she is my boy, but then you´re like a summer morning. It can´t happen and if it does, it´ll break your heart- he said in an almost forbidding tone. -Did she say something? - he asked raising his eyes, as green as spring grass. –I´m sorry Beaumont, but it seems weird you´d try to dissuade my interest without any… -No, you´re right- Beaumont interrupted, rolling the far side of his mustache with his fingers. –Look…- he started, -I think Odette is falling in love with Mérante, or at least she likes him. -What? - Connor´s eyes were beginning to get moist. -But he won´t do a thing knowing you like her. -He better… -But that´s where you got it wrong… really Connor, what´s the point? -Does Louis like her? Beaumont kept silent but it was hardly necessary for him to say anything at all, after that the conversation died together with the sun in the horizon. Before they reached the bridge, Beaumont asked him -Will you come to the function? -Can´t- he replied in a low voice. –My patrol is around the bridge. -I see. Beaumont put his hand on his shoulder and spoke in a fatherly tone. -Connor, I know choosing is painful, it has always hurt and it always will. But one must strive on in the hope of finding whatever your heart is looking for, you´re young and therefore I know there´s still a wide long path for you to take, full of surprising encounters, shining maids dressed in silk with lacy fans, and…mind you, after some bad experiences it´s more than likely you´ll find her, the one you´re meant to be with. The young policeman gave him a small smile and Beaumont took it as a good sign, he put on his top-hat and adjusted his cane, grabbing the golden handle with firmness. Tonight was the Swan Lake premiere, and he wished to see Odette in all her might. -See you then Connor, please don´t mention anything to Louis, he wouldn´t be happy if he knew I told you this. Connor shook his head softly, his auburn curls bouncing and Beaumont repressed an urge to mess his hair, so he smiled and turned to walk towards the Opera. A few lantern bugs were starting to come out, their little lights flickering on and off on the river, the violet misty plume the sun had left on the sky invited him to day dream. . And he would´ve if the shouting hadn´t erupted in his brain like a thorned whip. He would´ve if the darkness of the sunset hadn´t been suddenly turned alight by the fire. A fire so bright and so high he thought the whole city would burn. -The Opera House! -The Opera has caught fire! -Fire! Fire! Connor thought the end of the world was upon him, people running towards the bridge, running in panic from a danger they had already left behind but running only for the sake of it, like a herd of deer escaping a lion. He began to walk towards the Opera House, ironic how his obligation as a public server urged him onwards but his duty as a human being was to go backwards. Men tremble on the cusp of half remembered tales of people dying in fires, and as he got closer, the air got warmer, the smoky smell of burnt wood and lime dust reached his nostrils; and Connor couldn´t help but shake in fright as he saw how the massive building was brought to its knees by the flames. The windows were shattered which meant there´d been an explosion… \"The ultimate monument to French Art\" was how the newspaper used to call the Opera House, an Art that was now engulfed in flames hotter than any tears any art could´ve provoked on any eyes. Its architects vowed another Revolution would come before the building fell. But blood runs truer and thicker than oaths, blood as red as the sky set ablaze by the fire. Like the old folktale of a queenless king who fought a dragon to keep his lover, a beautiful maid from a star; the dragon shattered the spears from the king´s army, its claws scratching the clouds as the sky was torn in two. Connor stepped on the marbled lobby, the source of the explosion was from the stage according to the fireguard; and there was still people trapped behind. He walked towards the back where the air was a bit more breathable but the wooden walls looked like they´d been grabbed by a giants hand and then trampled by savage horses, burnt petals of flowers roamed about… he walked carefully among the debris, it was so hot he discarded his police coat. An open door to his side revealed him where the burnt petals came from. Two huge bouquets of what had been blue roses lied there, utterly destroyed, the flowers where either flying to the roof or its petals floating amongst the splinters. He heard screaming and rushed to the backwall of the stage, there chaos reigned still between people running from the flames, fireguards, police and theatre attenders. -There are some dancers on the stage! -But the flames have already eaten it up! Connor grabbed two little dance students and ran towards the nearest entrance, carved from the wall where the fireguards had managed to put the fire out. Once there he left the girls to the physicians gathered in an improvised tent and ran back into the Opera, he approached the stage once more, its embers red and hot like the sun in summer. -Leave! -Leave!- screamed so many throats that it sounded like a thousand voices -It´s going to collapse!- someone shouted. Connor grabbed a man that had fallen square on the ground, and dragged him towards the exit. But he didn´t manage to get there in time before the stage´s back wall fell. The only thing he could think was throw the man with all the strength he had left before his world crumbled from the core and his life twinkled like the starlight he´d seen in the wolfmaid´s eyes, it wavered and then it stilled, turned out in the crash of the stage´s dome. . . -HURRY THE BLOODY UP!- shrieked Mérante in blind rage at the driver, almost hanging from the davit. But it was near impossible to move opposite the direction of all the other carriages running away from that red mayhem, the torch in the night the Opera House had become was a sight enough to chill up his very core, but knowing Odette was somewhere in all that fiery vortex made him nauseous. -I´m sorry Monsieur! But this is as far as we can get, the police is blocking the way. Louis heart fell to his stomach, as true as the devil, the gendarmerie was allowing people out but no one in. Frustrated Mérante looked as some others tried to break through the line, undoubtedly anxious to go and look for their loved ones. Through gritted teeth, the young ballet master turned to the driver of his rented carriage and shouted above all the confusion. -I´ll need one of your horses. -But Monsieur… Louis Mérante waited for no response and threw his gold handwatch and his purse to his hands as he untied one of the horses to mount it, he ruffled the reins and sent the scared animal rearing up to the front, right into the policemen perimeter. The sinking sensation in his gut intensified as he heard the whispering tremor of explosions and felt the earth quivering. Terrified to look in the way of the Opera, he strived on. His soul was shouting for the black swan´s ballerina, seeing nothing but her crying face when she´d asked him to go to her hometown to check on her old foster parents and he couldn´t say he brought good news; their sickness combined with old age had proven fatal. They were still alive but barely, the flowershop was no more and they were being taken care of by neighbors and friends. Mérante had no idea how in God´s name was he going to break her the news before it broke her heart; the moon blazed against the fire, as if challenging it to glow brighter, its silver light painted in red, a red moonlight was a bad omen in old times… and now Mérante just thought it made everything look like it was covered in blood. The Opera was closer now, shouting and crying could be heard now and thick gray smoke coated the streets like the breath of death, reeking of burnt timber and the acid rock leaks when it shimmered white hot. He saw a little kid knelt next to his mother, crying with his face covered in black smudges. He saw an old lady with a dress that had once been velvety red. He saw a teary young man between his lover and his mother, struggling which needed physician tending the most. He saw Paris sinking underneath that tragedy, like a weeping princess whose crown has been stolen under a nightmare moon. The impressive building was a gigantic lantern, the hatching place of a bloody new French tragedy, the birth of a monster, a fire monster, a dragon. He gave his horse to the young man and carried the boy´s mother to the improvised medic´s tent. And then he looked among that sea of burnt would be corpses, hoping and fearing at the same time to find Odette. Frantically he started pacing amidst the bedplates and sacks. The entrance in the far side was being crossed non stop by the fireguard bringing bodies, each time making his soul shriek in anticipation. He tried to make himself useful by helping nursemaids and physicians to move the bodies around, realizing that if we wanted to find Odette tonight, that was probably the best he could do; his last memories of her gray eyes haunting him like a ghost over the medical tent, his blood boiling when he realized she had asked him without words to promise her he´d come back. -I promise Odette, I swear to you I´ll…- but it was past time to swear anything to her sobbing face, the blue orbs looking back at him in silent torment as if she was carrying the burning inferno of a starheart on her back. Then, as seconds turned to minutes and minutes to hours, his mute and momentary calmness fluttered away… What if she?...No, no, no, no… He finished helping a doctor amputate the limb of a theater assistant who had been crushed under some rocks and approached one of the fireguards, the Parisian coat of arms on his uniform indicated he held a position of power in the ranks. -Have you evacuated everyone? -Hmm?- He turned back to look at him, his face covered in smudges and exhaustion, -Yes sir, all the ones we could rescue have been rescued. -Beg your pardon?- He stumbled with the words. No fireguards were venturing into the building anymore, struggling with putting the fire out. -There´s… -PEOPLE ARE STILL IN THERE? -There´s nothing more we can do for them sir- he said, a sad hood clothed his sored eyes. \"I promise you, Odette\" Mérante´s mind had only his silent oath in the middle of this doomed night. -Look, if I send my men in there, we´ll only end up with more casualties. The only option now is to extinguish the fire and hope they had managed to get somewhere safe. -What about the people who were on stage? \"I promise…\" -We believe the fire originated there sir, there´s not much else to do. Now, if you would excuse me… \"I promise…\" Mérante released a quiet scream. Can a shout be silent? He turned his head and looked into the tent once more and then to the Opera, the fuming wrath of the fire had gone out to be replaced by a rather terrifying stillness under a smoky screen, the sort of feeling a child gets when realizing he is lost in the woods. \"I promise…\" -NO! The young ballet master ran towards the building only to be stopped by the fireguard, he could hear her cold magical voice again lamenting over her life and how it was unfolding in the worst possible way. The truth, his memories and his dreams were mixing, all of it coming upon him in a rush of steel and shadow. -Louis!- she called, even when she never did say his name in reality. A storm of rose petals blew across a blood-streaked sky, as blue as the eyes of death. Stupid how now he realized the recurring dream he´d been having was about this night, a night for howling a tragedy, the way her wolf necklace howled in winter winds about her dance and her eyes. -Sir, collect yourself if you please! Odette called again. \"I promise\", he whispered, \"Odette, I promise\". For years he hadn´t known what was really living like until he met her, her frozen countenance and her fiery heart. He sat there, in the corner of his life like a Harvest Day pumpkin, only taking part whenever ballet was involved. Yet the purple in her eyes had shown him a person is not only work or what it produces, it is a whole life, a life everyone knew was hard because it kills you in the end and yet, as merciless as the world was, she also taught him its magnificence. The anguish of imagining her lifeless form under the soot and ashes; her beautiful eyes, fashioned to be in tune with her mood, closed forever; her chestnut hair covered in cinders; her winter-kissed lips dry and cold…No, no, no, no. -Knock him out -What? -He´s desperate and clearly not thinking, some hours out and he´ll be himself again Mérante felt a punch in his stomach, followed by a kick to his back and a final pressure to his nape… In his wrecked mind, the dreams came in a rush, breaking havoc in his brain and devastating his heart. \"Promise me\", she had cried, in a room of the backstage that smelled now of blood and roses. \"Promise me, Louis\". The smoke had taken her strength and her voice had been faint as a whisper, but when he gave her his word, the fear had gone out of his would-be-lover´s eyes. Mérante saw the way she had smiled then, how tightly her fingers had clutched his as she gave up her hold on life, the rose petals spilling from her palm, dead and black. After that he remembered nothing, not Connor, not Beaumont, not anyone who had been in the Opera in that cursed night, a night fit for a soaring dragon. Hello everyone! Hope everyone is doing great! Hmm... I´m not sure to go through with this story really, the feedback is not that numerous anymore and it really brings down many inspiring ideas one can have. Hope you like nonetheless and depending on the follow up of this one, I´ll decide to continue it or not. Thanks a lot to the ppl who´s been keen on the story, (don´t you dare thinking I don´t appreciate it) and I hope you enjoy this chapter, which was sooooo very hard to write with so many things and emotions happening but here you go! Lots of love, PrimaScrittura[Chapter 13] . Chapter XIII . The death of the wolf . Odette looked at the city through her window, she lived in the upper rooms of Madame Le Haut´s restaurant where she was no longer a wolfmaid, only one of dozens of waitresses clad in black taffeta and a white doily apron. Madame Le Haut was a young but cruel woman, sneaky, devious and false but she could handle her. So far, the lady had failed to notice her and only threw piercing looks at her whenever she came back from her rehearsals. That day, when she´d announced she´d be dancing the black swan´s part for the Swan Lake to the other girls, she felt her vicious glance fix on her. -I don´t care, there´s nothing she can really do except firing me- she said to herself as she finished her ballerina bun, pinning it in place. But truth was she wasn´t so sure… disturbing tales on how Madame Régine had put her husband out of the way and have full access to the widow´s dowry filled the restaurant´s kitchen and corridors, things like the late owner of the Le Haut´s fortune had been murdered, poisoned by his wife with nightshade berries, stabbed by a hired thief in a back alley, or even that the merciful odorless arsenic had done the job. If one believed the rumors was of no consequence; murderous or not Madame Le Haut was ruthless with whomever dared to cross her. On the debut night, she went out through the back door, where the scullery maid glanced at her with a severe look, despising her for not spending the entire day in the restaurant, but Odette shrugged and walked past. It was not the scorn of the many that left her confused and vulnerable, but the kindness of the few, specially the kindness of the ballet master given with that dark hazel bliss and wise countenance. How was she supposed to protect herself from him? The way he´d looked at her before he left was… it had been… she couldn´t put her finger on it, the void her mother left in her life was now more visible than ever, maybe if she´d been around, she could´ve helped Odette to put her frozen ice walls up again. \"A maid has to be mistrustful in this world, or she will not be a maid for long\" she thought, as a light morning rain began to fall. Monsieur Kerloff asked how she felt that day, if she´d slept well and practiced hard. -I´m good sir, I thank you. Kerloff looked at her the way a grandfather would´ve looked at his own kin. He only had a son, and he had sailed for the New World long ago, news were scarce and seldom arrived, so Kerloff had gotten used to the fact he´d never see his son again. But weird as it was, there was something in Odette´s eyes which reminded him of his lost son, maybe the melancholy or the sadness in them turning from blue to purple to gray in an instant. -Very well then, this is the time sheet, follow it to the letter and you should be fresh and rested for the function. In the meantime, he would discuss those wretched gas lamps which many of the dancers had already complained about for being too bright and too hot, Vacourbeil would have to either change them or put them in a different place, Monsieur Eiffel and his novelties be damned. He abandoned the backstage room and left Odette with two theater maids in charge of getting her ready. The young ballerina looked at her reflection in the boudoir mirror, her chocolate waves combed in a classic ballerina bun, atop her head was the beautiful crown that glowed now in candlelight with haunting charm; her face and arms were powdered, her neck perfumed and her lips were colored dark plum to contrast the black swan´s sensuality against the white´s purity. But the most beautiful part of her attire was the costume: black feathers cascaded down her legs, all in different lengths and non-starched as per her request so the barbules waved in the wind with mesmerizing motion. Odette thanked the maids and saw them out of the room. \"Mérante hasn´t probably come back yet\" she thought with a bit of disappointment, she hoped the young man could see her debut. She tried and failed to think of a different thing whilst repeating the black swan´s choreography for the hundredth time that night. Unbeknownst to her, the theater´s costume designer Pierre Noirblanc, was just outside the room waiting for the young woman to be alone and once he was sure no one was around, he knocked on the door. -Come in- the mere sound of her voice was enough to have his knees trembling, but he kept his countenance serious and entered the room. She was beautiful as usual, wild and rare like a river out of control. -Yes, Monsieur Noirbl-? He covered her mouth with his palm. -Listen girl, once a ballerina reaches a certain status, she has to give something in exchange, her- Noirblanc couldn´t finish the sentence when Odette fought back, kicking his stomach with her knee. But the man managed to grab her leg and knocked her to the ground and as his hand closed around her throat, she was forced to listen to him while looking at his yellowy glazed pupils, dilated by desire and adrenaline. -As I was saying, every ballerina must give something up in exchange of position, heck even D´Autrelle slept with one or two sponsors. This is the world you´re coming in to so stop looking at me like that girl; I have no wish for your heart, but your maidenhead will do- he said, spitting on the floor and grabbing her hips in a way Odette found completely revolting. -It´s a good thing you sent Mérante away, else I wouldn´t have been able to find a moment and talk about business- he whispered, his voice sibilant and disgusting –See you after the function, don´t bother trying to run or hide. I know where you live, I know where you work. Either you cooperate or I´ll make sure your life as a prima becomes a living nightmare. He left the room while his last word echoed in Odette´s mind She sat on the floor and looked at the door, its polished surface reflecting the black dress. Her mind was blank, if it was because of anger or terror she could not have said. A bitter sensation in her gut told her she was about to throw up; so she got up and drank a cup of the wine the maids had left her to prevent stage fright, but as she lifted her face to look at her eyes in the mirror, she saw the last light in them die out, their purple extinguished leaving nothing in them but gray, gray, gray. -I can´t escape. She said it aloud to either make it real or make it a lie, but it was real… It always was. Her neck, red with the markings of his grasp, was a mute reminder of his words \"This is the world you´re coming in to\" Mérante had never said a thing about anything of the sort, then again Mérante was a man whose lastname was known and respected. What can a man ever know about the trials and wails of a lone woman living in the world? Much less a poor orphan girl. -If I cannot escape, I´ll make him pay. When she was a young sweet summer girl, she remembered longing for the cold winds of autumn. Now that she was no more than a winter rose with a dragon and an agonizing wolf, she longed for… for what? All her life, she tried to be good and dutiful like her parents before her, but they had died anyway just as she was hours away before being abused herself. She was a piece of ice that had been through hell, thinking about it Hugo had once told her: -Never smile at a hearth little one, I fear you when you do that. But in that moment, Odette remembered her childhood fire, the fire where her dragon was born… and she smiled. A smile that was more like a grin, she grabbed then a blue rose from the bouquets and crushed it, squeezing it between her fingers. She had no idea how she was going to make Noirblanc regret this night, but he would… he fulfilled Apolline´s favorite saying to perfection. \"Men are always willing to believe two things about a woman darling. One: that she is weak, and two: that she finds him attractive\" The powerful had always preyed on the powerless, that´s how they got powerful in the first place and yet she refused to victimize herself because, for those who value survival, sentimentality is not an option. Odette powdered her neck to cover the forming bruises, Mérante had once told her she was better off looking into the abyss of change to discover if she could fly. So, she set about to leap. . . . Kerloff muttered some of his best curse words for Vacourbeil until the director was too confronted to pretend everything was fine. -The light is in the most becoming angle for the ballerinas, being yourself a teacher of our next prodigy, you should worry about things like this Kerloff! -The one thing I worry about is that they´ll be in for roasting Vacourbeil! Either you move them or I will. -Calm yourself Kerloff, you will do no such thing, I already ordered maintenance to relocate them to suit the demands you made last week. -You better… -I did, now you old Russian bear, go and enjoy yourself. What they didn´t know was that Vacourbeil´s petition to move the gas lamps had fallen on deaf ears, the men responsible forgot to do it and their negligence costed dear to the whole city. . . . Odette danced as she remembered she should, her fear and anxiety made her moves more passionate, her anger for being a woman that couldn´t overpower a man gave them a graceful bestiality and her longing for Mérante´s company elevated her dance to another world. Her audience could not keep their eyes off her figure nor bring themselves to clap after her first performance out of fear of evaporating the malevolent seducing magic she casted. She had just conquered the prima ballerina crown for herself, she was sure… but still, she could see Noirblanc´s silhouette from the corner of her eye. She pirouetted and turned; the fascination had captured the hearts of the public and the magnificence of the music filled her core until it made her imagine Mérante was dancing with her. In that moment, he was more real to her than the wooden boards of the stage, she could recall his every feature, the color of his eyes and the shape of his nose, how his voice had that heart pulling yearning when he said her name and how his gaze had told her how much she meant for him before he left. How could he have-? He had taken her heart out of her grasp when she had encased it in icy crystal, he had given her a loving queenship over his heart when she had tossed it aside, like that old folktale of a lost starmaiden who had fallen on earth when there were still dragons flying in the skies and mermaids swimming in the rivers. She saw the ladies of the audience looking at her with moonlight in their eyes and spring promises in their lips. \"They are children\" Odette thought \"They all are silly little girls pretending to be women already. They´ve never seen what the world can do, they know nothing\" Their dreams were like glossy silver painting in watercolor, shiny and clear; full of songs and stories just like hers had been before fire had burned her parents to ash and a lusty man turned her only aim into ingenuity. Looking at the girls again, Odette pitied them. Odette envied them. The wolf snarled at the dragon trying to break free of its grasp but the gigantic beast surrounded it with its wings, loving and hating at the same time. Odette saw herself thrown into a fight where either result was equally disastrous. To the people in the audience, she was another dancer, soon to be prima but just another well accomplished ballerina; to Noirblanc, a piece of meat reserved for his pleasure, and to herself… she was…she was… \"I am a wolf\" The tiger and the lion may be more powerful, but the wolf does not perform in a circus. \"I won´t yield to him. Not now, not ever\" When the intermezzo finished she made sure to walk past Noirblanc, busy pretending to adjust the ballerina´s costumes. -I will not let you do it- she announced in front of everyone, the coryphées, the theater attendants, the instructors and some musicians at the back of the stage, -Even if you submit me, the shame will be yours to carry not mine; if you ever come too close to me I´ll make sure you regret it. Everyone stared at Noirblanc whose face became pale and then red. -I have no idea what mademoiselle is talking about. -Strange, you seemed to know extremely well earlier when you snuck up on me. -Mademoiselle, I assure you I- -I have warned you, that´s what I came here for. The young ballerina walked away and he was left to deal with the scandalized looks of the theater folk. \"We´ll see who regrets this first, girl\" he babbled. When the ballerina went on stage that night, his mind was full of anticipation but now it was full of hate. In fact, Noirblanc felt like Odette owed him for exposing him like that, blind as he was by rage he could not think in the long term. He only saw her, dancing in the stage light and imagined how he could assault her on her way home; but something in the way she had looked at him during the argument had reached his brain, it was cold and hard like the stab of a steel blade and as such, he wondered if she hid some sort of dagger beneath her skirts for protection; hot liquid wrath slid through his back making him clench his hands into fists. Noirblanc would make her pay for the humiliation, she´d pay for it dearly and as he studied the wooden structure of the stage, he smiled knowingly… men would believe anything from a knowing smile if you let them, she´d pay for it in fire and sorrow. Slowly, he descended the stairs under the stage, people coming in and out during functions was normal and nobody thought ill of him because no one in there saw the revealing exchange between him and the ballerina dancing on top of them. The tubes and installation of the gas lights was new and the staff made sure everyone knew how dangerous it was to manipulate the valves with no previous authorization. The calcium oxide could flow out too quickly for the glass bulb to handle it, causing the flame inside to outburst and blow up… which was exactly what Noirblanc expected. \"A bit of roasting will warm up your temper girl\" he thought as he used both hands to turn the middle valves completely to the right. Small unforeseen hassle was that the scene on stage was being performed in the midst of a forest, there were dozens of ballerinas by the time Noirblanc came next to the valves and blind to anything that was not revenge, he failed to realize most of the theater props were made of wood, bone dry and perfect for flames to spread. As unforeseeable as it could be for everyone on top, both glass bulbs exploded and the amount of gas flowing blew off the rest, tongues of fire were sent licking at the trees and the wood of the fantasy forest; the starched feathers in the coryphées dresses became magnets for the heat and soon they were set ablaze as well. Some tore off their costume exposing skin and knickers for the world to see, not that the world cared. The walls cracked as the fire intensified since the gas, its source, kept flowing freely. The people in the audience covered their mouth and fled the flames and the smoke. Winter outside welcomed in its white cold arms those who escaped and its snow became a distant memory for those who were slowly realizing they were trapped inside, for the calefaction system in the building had been modernized as well to work on a mixture of hydrogen and the same calcium oxide of the lamps, a highly flammable substance coupled with an enclosing fire advancing a bit too quickly made it impossible for the Opera House to be evacuated in time. In the back, swarms of people ran away from the main stage, their powerful stumps damaged the floor causing oxygen to leak into the broken pipelines… thirty seconds and the whole damned thing would blast off. When she saw the flames, Odette could do little but freeze, her childhood ghost clasped her head as the dragon grinned. She no longer had to go and avoid hell, it was already there. She had known long ago that fire would forever be stamped in her memory, hot and yellow and red and as destroying as a beast out of control, it was little but a cruel jest of fate to trap her in flames where she felt safest, the one place in the world she was most vulnerable and where she had felt the horrors from her girlhood fly away only to be brought back in all force, as brute as if someone had just smashed her skull with a rock. Someone struck her. -Odette!- said a terrified girl, Odette recognized her as the girl that played the white swan, her skin was hot and her hair was half gone, -We have to get out of here! The wolf in Odette´s mind howled, the dragon walking around it in circles fluttering its bat like wings in slow cadency, so much so it looked lazy. A quiet hissing sounded in the underside of the wooden boards. -It´s the gas! -Run! Run! A fireguard grabbed her from the waist and threw her against the back wall just in time before the floor of the stage came crashing down, the air was already so thick and hot her lungs started to feel too big for her chest, there was a gnawing sensation in her right leg but as she went through the wooden wall, it was replaced by a sense of being stabbed. -On your feet woman! Get out of here!- said someone. She tried to stand the way a dying wolf would, but the pain in her side became so sharp it sent her back to the floor; a hot wet substance was forming a pool around her and Odette looked at it absent mindedly. It was blood. She opened her mouth and then closed it, so this was it. She glanced at her body for the first time since the fire had started and was able to evaluate the damages, she studied her injuries being anything but afraid because truth be told she had never been scared of death; she´d fought it many times in her life and came to defeat winter itself, so much and so hard she came to own it, a \"snow maid\" some called her along with other things. Her one true fear was to be alone and that fear also died when she truly was left alone after Orlenna and Philippe, Hugo and Apolline and even Mérante had to leave. The pain in her leg was because her long costume had caught fire at some point and had fused the feathers and her tights into her flesh; the pain in her side came not from a splinter, but more like a sharp chunk of wood had pierced it. \"Must have been when I went through the wall\" she thought as calmly as if she had been reading the news, yet her wolf still found the strength to show its teeth to the dragon. Odette grabbed her skirt and the upper part of her tights and tore them off her, she looked up and screamed as she had never screamed before, the effort causing the wood chunk to penetrate in her side even further, after that she laid there and closed her eyes, trying to rest before attempting to get up again. A burnt smell of plants reached her, so Odette opened her lids once more; blue rose petals flew all around her, raising up against the moon. \"Wait… the moon?\" There was a crack on the dome. -It´s going to collapse! -Run! She examined where she was and realized she´d never make it. She´d die there, if it was because of the dome crushing her body or her body losing too much blood, she´d never know and it seemed stupid to ask herself for the cause of death when she´d be dead anyway. But, when she awoke to the notion of what she´d done to herself by tearing off the cloth from her leg, she cared no longer if she died… In fact, she preferred it. Because she´ll never would be able to dance again. And it was in that moment when all her hopes faded, all her dreams died and the whole thing overthrew her. In that moment the dragon flung itself against the wolf and held it by its spine, lashing its monstrous head from one side to the other so hard Odette knew the wolf was dead. After that, the dragon threw the shaggy corpse to the side as it opened its huge wings, roaring to the winter moon… Odette closed her eyes as the dragon´s bellows from her imagination melted with the breaking of the dome above her; when the gravel started to fall on her, the fire beast took flight and abandoned her only with the lifeless form of the wolf. She relaxed when she felt the cold of death approaching her and she was curiously at peace. In the end, the dragon and the wolf had also left her. Hi there! This chapter is speacially dedicated to YOU. Yes, to you who made it possible through your reviews, your F&F; click, to you who read it from beginning to end and still had hopes for me to retake it.

The faith you gave me to continue where most important, pls never forget that ;) Stellar Lights Thank you haha, probs are it was a mistake coz I was really thinking hard on the converstaion between them to put attention to the other things. I´ll correct it later. It´s a headcanon that I can confirm is a canon hahahaha, I´m so glad it´s something the people reading the story can see and it´s not my imagination, but yesssss Odette is ice and snow because of the fire in her childhood traumatized her. I´m fine with the correcting thing, but I tried it twice before (with different followers) and it din´t really work out because of time diffrences and because we don´t do this for a living so it´s natural the follow up is not that great, and I´d really like that if you plan to copypaste my story somewhere, you´d just let me know and quote my name as an author of the fic. And anyway, I´d like you to still give me your opinion on this one as well ;) Lots, lots of love to everyone![Chapter 14] . Chapter XIV . When a lion loves a wolf . Mérante sat on the chair and looked at him with a questioning look. -How was it? - he asked the young ballet master. -Sad and cold, all memorials are. -Were there people we know? -All the ones that aren´t in here with you, yes. They remained in silence for a bit before Beaumont enquired in such a low voice he thought Mérante hadn´t heard him. -Have you found her yet? Louis´ features tightened as he adopted a distant air and looked at the street through the hospital window, the bell towers from Notre Dame were close by and the Hôtel-Dieu, the oldest hospital in the city, was just one of the many healthcare centers that took in the injured and sick after the fire. -So no, eh? Beaumont studied his old pupil as if he was looking at him for the very first time, he had dark circles under his eyes and somehow, his otherwise handsome face had become harder and more serious making him appear like an adult trapped in the body of a young man. Mérante had told him everything he could remember from that night, from his return to the city after leaving Odette´s town, all the way up to the moment the fireguards had put him down to prevent his bursting in the Opera House. Louis said he awoke late on the next day being discharged by the physicians almost immediately; after that he had devoted himself in finding everyone he knew. He didn´t say it explicitly, but Beaumont knew Mérante had encountered him by accident while looking for the black swan´s ballerina. He was unconscious of course, and it took days for him to wake. Even if both were worried for Odette, Beaumont had to recognize Louis never left him until making sure he was out of danger´s way. After that, all that was left was pain and heartbreak but… the hardest hit was to hear of Connor´s death. If it had been difficult enough for him to keep his composure after reading his name in the newspaper´s lists, he couldn´t imagine how Mérante was feeling. Their friend´s name was just there, printed on paper together with so many others, insensitively and seemingly so far away Beaumont couldn´t speak for a whole minute. But Louis… Louis´ kind of sadness was drowning him, his tears could not even drop and the feelings left him. Like the world had just ended. He couldn´t cry nor see nor hear, he just stayed there and for a second, his heart died. But then he remembered he hadn´t really searched for any Odettes in the list. -Is… Is Odette in the list? – he stuttered, almost choking with the words. He knew how much Mérante cared for her, if he lost her too… -No- he replied, still with his back turned on him. Beaumont released a relieved sigh -Where is she then? -I don´t know -Do you know her last name at least? Did she tell you? -It´s Tavernier, your brother mentioned it during the winter season we spent there. Despite how nonsensical all his certainty sounded to him, he remained in silence. The evening Beaumont woke up, he´d told his young friend the horrific scene he´d witnessed that night before a fallen beam knocked him out. -The stage caught fire, I do not know how; she and other dancers were just beginning the sequence after the intermezzo . The flames swallowed the fantasy props, the velvet curtains and the ballerinas costumes… Louis, the fireguard said not a person that was on stage survived, and many bodies were burnt beyond recognition; it is likely you just didn´t identify her. – he added after finding out Mérante had gone to the morgue to look for her amongst the corpses the fireguard found on the stage platform. -No. -Louis… -Listen Beaumont, I know that choreography because most of its esthetics were my idea. I admit most of the depictions I gave to Vacourbeil and Kerloff were designed so the black swan was always on the upstage center- -But that bloody position was where the fire started! -I know but, counting every dancer including her, there were eight people… and the fireguard found only seven bodies… along with this in the back entrance- he´d retorted while extending his palm and showing him a necklace he knew all too well since Odette carried it everywhere. It had a howling wolf pendant. –No Beaumont, she´s alive somewhere. Ever since, Louis had dedicated his every waking moment in finding her, but to no avail. It was as is earth had engulfed her. That morn the day had dawned with the memorial service held in the Place de la Concorde by the city councilor. Beaumont could not yet leave his sickbed but Mérante said he´d go to tell whomever went to the thing that they were both alive. -Vacourbeil sends his regards- he could see there was more, but waited until he finished, -Kerloff died as well, right at the hospital doors… Vacourbeil said once the Opera was finished in repairs, he wanted to talk to me about the Maître Ballet position since Kerloff is no more. Beaumont wanted to congratulate him, but it was no time to congratulate anybody. They remained in silence for hours after that, Mérante going through notes or old news, sometimes caressing a wilted blue flower he kept in a handkerchief together with the wolf necklace, and Beaumont himself going in between awake and asleep; it was near evening when his old student said out of nowhere: -I swore I´d come back and tell her how I felt. Beaumont gave him a sad smile -You sound ashamed. -I am not ashamed of the possibility of loving her, only of the things I´ve done to hide it. -Well, I wonder what the Pope would have to say about the sanctity of oaths sworn while being half drunk with desire for a woman, chained to her dance and with the sword of her words pressed to your chest. -I´m not- -And… only possibility? I think you´re utterly in love with her, and may I know what are those shameful things you´ve done? -I lied to Connor and never had a chance to tell him I was sorry, I did not ask for her foster parents´ permission to take her out nor did I stayed true when they requested me to bring their daughter to see them as soon as possible. -You never lied to Connor, you just never got a chance to tell him the truth- the world was miserable enough, there was no need for Mérante to embitter it further, -Why can´t you go to the village and make amends? -It´s too late for them… I know it´s too late. And Beaumont was quiet until he left. The next day, Mérante came at twilight. -Repairs are on time and it´s estimated the Opera will be functional in three months. -What will you do in the meantime? -I´m giving private lessons for now. -Besides looking for her. -Yes. The physician approached walking down the huge bed-full hallway and warned Mérante to leave Beaumont soon so he could keep resting and recovering his strength. -Sure, recover it enough so I have the energy to drag my arse from one chair to the other- he said trying to sound lighthearted and make him known he´d be fine even if´d never be able to walk again. But Louis said nothing. Knowing his lion like temper, Beaumont was almost sure Mérante was having a hard time assimilating he was fine and scarless when his friend was crippled, the other was dead and his love had vanished like morning mist in summer heat. -Do you think they´ll sing about us? -he asked. -What? - Mérante retorted as he sat on the chair next to the nightstand. -I mean, not about us, but of what happened that night. -No, this is no the Middle Ages anymore. -You´re boring. -I´m realistic -I suppose so, -said Beaumont changing his mind after reminiscing the epic poems he learned in his youth, -The bards would´ve never said it was in winter, in the songs it´s always summer, every man is a knight and all maids are beautiful. In the songs, the sun is always shining. \"In the songs, they would be together\" he thought -There were songs that aren´t all that happy- Louis retorted -Not the likes that are still remembered today. Mérante thought for a minute and whispered while grabbing his coat. -The was a song in the folktale of the starmaiden -Ah yes, with the flowers on her hair –he replied, - I guess…I kind of thought it was more of a folktale than a song. -There is a song too, I believe. -I´ll see you tomorrow so you can sing it then. Mérante rolled his eyes and left his bed side, Beaumont saw him walk away and prayed to God he´d find the wolfmaid, if not soon, then at least someday. But as always, God took his time in answering for with Odette´s absence, the time of love songs in his pupil´s life ended and a time of obscurity began. He knew very well the pain and grief of losing one´s love could burn down the world; if Odette had indeed died somewhere other than the Opera, it would transform a promising ballet master into a deity of desolation. Just like he had been once. -I don´t care if the fire fried her wits out; I only demand to know if she´ll ever be able to work again- he heard a lady yelling at a young physician on the other side of the wide hallway they were all stuck in, it was the women´s section and while he judged the situation to be inadequate, he knew they were too many injured to worry about separating men and women. The physician rubbed his temple in obvious discomfort. -The healing treatment should help her to move alright, she might need a walking stick… -Excuse me? Are you calling that \"move alright\"? -Sorry to intrude Madame- intervened a second physician much older than the other, his broody face indicated he was in no mood for stupidity, -but you are disturbing the rest of the patients, visiting hours are past time, so I will be asking you to leave. The lady grabbed her long green coat from a chair and said in a contemptuous voice before walking towards the door: -I won´t have her back if she can´t walk. Once she left, Beaumont saw the physicians talk between themselves and then one left as well, not before adding: -Keep 109-B under watch, he may not pass the night Gaston- Gaston nodded and turned towards the patient that had caused all the rampage, lying down with her head and neck all wrapped in bandages. -Very well mademoiselle, any other discomfort? Let me see if those burns are healing properly- he heard him say. Beaumont had no wish to see any more than he was supposed to, so he laid down fully on the bed and grabbed a book Louis had brought him, an old nursemaid came by to give him his dinner portion and wished him goodnight, which Beaumont thanked before closing his eyes. . The shady streets in the early hours of the morning told Mérante it was a bit early to show up at the hospital, so he wondered on the bridge to look at the sunrise, its brightness slowly coloring the river. \"If I made up with my parents, would that fill some of this void?\" He looked at his reflection on the river waters, despite trying to linger in the thought of his father and mother, her face kept appearing in his mind. Her big beautiful oval eyes were sad but held no reproach, her hair cascaded beyond her shoulders and in front of her chest, the temptation was such that Mérante extended his hand to touch her cheek. \"If only you had known I was in love with you\" a tear escaped her eye and when it dropped on his finger, it was cold as frost. \"You´d never had sent me away, and I´d never had lost you\" she replied something but her voice sounded like if something was covering her lips and he could do little but to look at them in rueful wish to touch them with his own. Odette closed her eyes and leaned into his hand, her long eyelashes were full of tears that turned to iceflakes as soon as they fell. Her body transformed into a thousand rose petals, blue as the ocean, as spring berries, as a cloudless sky and as the last winter moon. As blue as Odette could be. -Where are you? - he heard himself say aloud. But, since for now he had no answer, Mérante just straightened his back and headed towards the hospital. . Beaumont woke up to the smell of food, the nursemaid left him a simple portion to break his fast and since he had no special dietary requirements, the food was decent enough. The physician named Gaston approached his assistant from behind and asked her to change the \"special patient\" bandages to check her side wound. -Oh well, am I not your special patient Bess? I am deeply hurt- he pouted childishly. The nursemaid laughed discretely as was her British custom. -You are Armand, but the young lady Monsieur Gaston speaks of is his \"special patient\", not mine- she said cheekily. -My, my, never thought I´d see a physician fall for his patient in here. -Well, who wouldn´t love her? The poor girl lost her wit and her memory because of a head injury and it´s likely she´ll have trouble to walk for the rest of her life- her voice was gloomy and commiserated. -She also has a very bad injury on her side. \"Well, she´ll walk again\" he thought but shook his head and continued. -And who was the loony woman from yesterday? -Ah… the one in the green coat? -The very one -She´s her employer or so she claims to be; owns a restaurant near the river- Bess answered solicitous. –Now, if you´d excuse me, Monsieur. -Of course Bess. Bess smiled while grabbing the bandages´ tray and crossed the hallway to the other bed, Beaumont heard her making kind questions as to how was the \"special patient\" feeling. He wished he had a cup of strong Turkish coffee to go along with his toast. -How is His Grace feeling? – came a playful voice. Beaumont rolled his eyes while Mérante gave him the morning newspaper. -His Grace needs to get out of this bed to buy a good cup of coffee. Mérante smiled but did not sit. -Do you have plans for today? -The list in there is not up to date since yesterday- he replied while taking out a bunch of different things from his pocket which he left on the nightstand until he found a small notebook. –I´ll comb through every hospital today once more. Winter is ending and- -And spring will make transporting easier I know; the newspaper says that night´s snowfall was a true miracle. -Yes, although it all melted near the blasted Opera. He barely said those words when he picked everything up and left without waiting for Beaumont to reply, but it was plain clear to him… Mérante was just permanently on edge. In his hurry, he left an item on the nightstand. When Armand grabbed it he realized it was the wolf pendant. He dangled it in front of his eyes and remembered how wonderful Odette´s performance had been, every movement executed to perfection, the black swan´s carnality had almost made him forget he was twenty years her senior. With his mind in silence, his ears were listening every sound around him -How is your side? -The stitching make it itch a bit, but I am alright I thank you. -Should you need anything, please just ask me or Monsieur Favager. -Gaston? -Yes child, him- retorted Bess amused. -He´s very kind. -He is, is he not? \" Hold your bloody horses!\" Beaumont´s focus sight changed from the pendant to the young woman in bandages because her voice was awfully familiar, because even if she was almost hairless, the beautiful features his old pupil loved were still the same; because the bluish purple in her eyes had somehow returned. And because she was Odette. Beaumont could not speak for almost five minutes, he just kept looking at her. Until she noticed. -May I help you sir? - she asked sweetly, any trace of the wolfmaid´s coldness gone. -BESS! There she was… Mérante´s blasting maid from a blasted faraway star, who was being blasting courted by a blasted physician. -Yes Armand? - asked Bess amiably. He grasped the wolf pendant so hard he cut himself. -Has the girl there said her name? -Hmm, I told you she can´t remember- -I know her. Bess inhaled a puff of air out of sheer surprise -What?! -Odette, her name´s Odette. Hi there! I know what you´re thinking... wow! two chapters in a row? what´s going on? Truth is this and the previous chapter were originally just one chapter... but it was insanely long so I had to split it, and I kind of had to split it Anyway, I´m anxious for your reviews to tell me what you guys think! Lots, lots of love to everyone![Chapter 15] . Chapter XV . Maiden from a faraway star . Armand Beaumont had suffered a great many deal of predicaments in his life that managed to steal his breath away; but not half of them where the punch in his gut this one was. Odette was sitting as comfortably as a queen on her throne, rickety pillows trying too hard to be fluffy held her back in place as Bess checked her wounds. -Next time they itch, please let us now. Hours had passed since he realized the ballerina had been on the other side of the hallway, but they felt as if a hundred years had washed over him; Odette was Odette and yet, she wasn´t. Her manners had none of the coldness he once saw and the tenderness her purple eyes reflected came out of a too smiling mouth. She was a lovely girl, not a fair maid. Her blue light had gone \" She, whose icing fire had once burned so bright \" After the initial astonishment, came the dilemma to tell Mérante or not, should he tell him he was wasting his time searching through all the different hospitals since the girl was already there, not to mention the small inconvenience of her loss of memory? \" A wolf that no longer howls or hunts \" he thought while looking at her near bald head, \" A wolf with no fangs\" her sweet smiles and gentleness was nothing like the old Odette. The one he knew or the one Louis Mérante had fallen in love with. Mérante did not return on that day and Beaumont took advantage of it, later in the evening he summoned Bess and explained her his predicament. -Dear Lord, Armand! - she exclaimed, touched –But, are you absolutely certain it´s her? -Oh yes dear Bess, and my friend must not know until it´s wise for him to. -You are a very good friend to him, I must say Armand- she remarked. –But, won´t he mind your mending? Beaumont kept silent for a bit and then, in an almost inaudible whisper, he said: -He won´t if he cares for her at all. Love can sometimes be like magic, and magic always is just an illusion. Mérante might assume she was gone and get over her as quickly, which would be most desirable if she did not remember either him or the feelings she once held for the youg lion. -Bess, would you mind if I talk to her tomorrow? Bess seemed to think about it for a bit. -I´m afraid I´ll have to ask Monsieur Favager -Her physician? She nodded. -Would you mind to leave the fact my friend is in love with the girl? I´m afraid his decision might be biased if he likes her too. -Don´t you worry, I also need to reserve a wheelchair and maybe some biscuits for you to break your fast- she added winking at him. Beaumont smiled and nodded. He´d like that too, he turned his gaze towards the legs he once had… he´d like that very much. Next morning Mérante came in so early Beaumont had not even opened his eyes. Louis smiled; he had not slept at all being stuck between taverns and drunken theater employees trying to forget the terrors from the night´s fire, asking about the black swan ballerina´s last known location, but all he heard where complains about emperor Napoleon III´s stupid coup d'état on himself to impose monarchy once more and how his mishandle on national affairs with Prussia would drag them all to war. \"Emperor Napoleon can throw himself off the tallest roof in Versailles for all I care\" The young man left shaving tools on the nightstand as a gift and left immediately, he still gave ballet classes in his old coryphées´ homes to make a living and his morning was going to be busy, maybe he´ll visit after noon. When Beaumont woke up, the first thing he saw was the wheeled chair next to the bed and the first thing he heard were Bess night reports to Gaston. After eating the biscuits and fried eggs, he tried to reach and sit on the chair but, like a newborn baby, he failed miserably and fell to the floor, gray and filthy. -I never liked gray things, now I like them even less- he babbled. -Armand! You should´ve called me! -I thought I got it Bess, I´m sorry. They got him up between two physicians. -Your friend came earlier and left you these- Bess said while holding the shaving tools, -We might as well make use of them. You can read the newspaper in the meantime. Beaumont accepted looking like a bear might not be the best way to try and make Odette remember herself, so he relented. As Bess roughly hacked at his facial hair, she kept emitting small sighs whenever Beaumont mentioned the newspaper content until at the end of his shaving, he could not help but ask -Is everything alright dear Bess? You´ve been sighing all the while. Bess was old enough to be his mother, her hair had the color of dry straw and her face was not as comely as any wounded would´ve liked his nursemaid to have, but her eyes sparkled with amiable charm and she had a motherly air somewhere under her triter nursemaid´s toque. -Well Armand, is not like there´s any sort of emergency or anything, but we´re all very worried about what might happen with Prussia if His Majesty insists on trying the Prussian chancellor's patience any further. -It might not come to anything Bess, do not fret too much. -What if it does? War is the trade of kings…and there´s three of those in there, one´s still in the making but I fear… -If every fool had a crown on his head, we´d all be kings Madame. I do not think people´s representatives would allow the emperor to move yonder than he is right now- he said in a tone Bess thought was more likely to convince himself than her, but said nothing and chose to change the subject. -Mademoiselle Odette is waiting for you, we told her a man that once knew her is coming to see her. She´s very excited and I hope that whatever you tell her… well, she´s just such a jolly little woman, we´re all so taken with her it´d be a tragedy you´ll make that version of her leave. But Beaumont said nothing, remembering the real Odette had never been \"a jolly little woman\" and his actual intent was forcing the colder one to come out. Bess left him next to Odette´s bed with his book and the newspaper, the nursemaid´s shift was over and she´d be back the next day. -My partner will come at noon for you, behave Armand- she said warningly. He wondered when had he ever misbehaved being stuck on a bed where he had problems even to use the chamber pot. Opening his newspaper while waiting for the \"jolly little woman\" to wake, he read through the main columns, each one faulting their ruler differently depending on the news it was telling. Annexation of Alsace and Lorraine to Southern Prussia. Leopold, the golden boy king to be in Spain, was in direct opposition to France´s interests. How Prussia wanted to be a Unified State. For all he knew, it was all parrot dribble. \"Why do they take such an interest in smallfolk knowing this?\" Him at the least could not give a couple figs for what the German Kaiser thought of Napoleon. \"Newspaper should have the latest price of fish written on the front page, that´d be more interesting for the cityfolk\" . Rulers of states only kept press interested in their blighted games because if the thing did indeed end in war, it was easier to explain why men had to go and die to keep an oaf´s crown on his head. Odette slept a quiet sleep, her suspires a love song for her dreams. To his thought, the so called emperor was little more than a whiner twat, for starters he had established the second empire, kicking the nuts of all the previous sacrifices the country had made to set up a republican government since Bonaparte. What kind of emperor betrays his people by violating its own pains? The kind of numskull that hides under the crown´s mask Give a man a mask and he´ll show his true face, someone had said long ago. People thought France could not afford more conflict and war, but this so called emperor might still prove them wrong. Politics was a sport where loyalty was a patch, lying was a sworn oath and love was just for stories and quotes. -Monsieur? - said a gentle voice. Beaumont erased the sulking expression from his face and smiled emptily. -Bonjour mademoiselle. I trust you could rest as good as anyone can rest in here. -I did, thank you. -Do you know who I am? -Madame Bess said you had information on who I used to be before this… problem befell me. He had to admit, the new Odette was way nicer than the old one. Her eyes diverted shyly, drawing her glance towards the floor or to her lap. \"There was no way Odette would look at anything other than the eyes whenever she talked to someone\" it didn´t matter he could see the shape of her skull or that most of her body was covered in bandages. -It would be wise to start with me saying I am terribly sorry for this tragedy. -It was not of your making Monsieur, there is no need to apologize. -Nevertheless- he said, both of their smiles fading. –Before I say anything, I must ask mademoiselle… You do not recall a thing of your past life? She seemed to sink in herself before replying in a tone that broke his heart. -Faces and voices haunt me at night sir, fragments of being alone in the dark… but the faces are blurry and the voices are muffled by a sound similar to the roaring of flames. -Well, something is better than nothing \"Nothing isn´t better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing\" -I´m sorry about your legs as well. -I´m even sorrier mademoiselle. But knowing I have the commiseration of a pretty little thing such as yourself is a very sweet balm. She blushed in a swirl of peach, nothing like the pale taffy she once had. -Monsieur Favager said my hair would grow back in some months time. -That is indeed good news. Odette would only care if she´d ever dance again. -What about your memories? She remained in silence. -I have something for you- she looked up again, the morning sunrays lighting her purple eyes up. He gave her the necklace Mérante had left the day before, the silver dangling wolf right in the middle of her palm. -What is this sir? -It belongs to you, a friend of both of us gave it to me after the accident. You wore it everywhere you went; I suppose it had a special meaning for you. -Who? -Louis Mérante. He waited for some kind of reaction, after all; he had had the hunch that Odette liked his old student as much as he liked her, he had seen the young woman wanting Louis to look at the moon in her eyes and listen to the songs in her hands. But Odette´s expression remained the same. He explained who he was, how she´d met him. \"Britain´s Bride\" with its dancing nights and blue crystal lamps; the Irishman that had sought her favor with beer and wine, fruity and rich like the plume of smoke a candle leaves when blown off. Then about her hometown and her last name. The blue roses in the flowershop and the winter outside Hugo´s glassgardens. The frozen lake and ballerinas in the Opera House, the black swan and its night feathers. He told her everything he´d ever known about her, even if she did not recall any of it. By the end, it was all so silly he could´ve cried and since he could not tell her Mérante loved her, Beaumont chose to only say they used to be very close friends. \"I wonder if it would´ve been better to just let her go and start anew. Become someone else and let the ballerina die\" -No good to think of roads not taken- he whispered, but Odette didn´t hear, lost as she was in her thoughts. But then, she seemed to recall something -I do remember a song though -Hmm? -Maybe it´s just a lullaby, but it´s there in my head. Comes to me sometimes at dusk or at dawn, but I don´t recall the words. She hummed it softly and rocketed sideways, like a true \"jolly little woman\". \"Oh dear\" The curious thing with lullabies was that everyone forgets about them, and yet everyone knows them. \"Well, old stories are like old friends, you have to visit them from time to time I guess\" -The words from that song are known by anyone within this kingdom, little wolf. It was the starmaiden´s story. -What are the words? -There are words indeed, but some of them make the song and some more make the story, unfortunately; I can only be of assistance with the song. \"And maybe, not even with that\" Odette´s pupils showed such naïve trust, he almost choked with the first verse. The king´s queen was the fairest by far Her beauty unmarred by time. It was said she was a seastar, Brought to earth by a war. . A dragon chased after her light, But she left the sky at eventide It was said she wove moonflowers in her hair, To lead the dragon back to its lair. . The queenless king gazed at the maid, At night together they laid Come morning they wed, The king slayed the dragon by arrowhead The queen bore many offspring And her heart was as merry as her king But alas came the night, And the king succumbed to time´s bite. . The king´s queen wept and cried, She hurried back to the seaside. Her foot marks the only teller Of her return to where she was once a dweller. . Beaumont looked at the little wolf, she was hazy with a sleepy bliss. Her once frosty cold countenance had a queer warmth, like the prelude of spring. She was lovely and young, and pale, and burnt and lost. -You seem to enjoy it. -I do Monsieur, but it´s so very sad… Do you think it did happen? -No I don´t mademoiselle, but all legends have some true in them. -What is the truth in here? What can I believe when there is nothing to remember about the things I did use to believe in? -You can believe in whatever you want, -he replied. –Look at what happened as a second chance in life Odette. Not many of us can afford to change so utterly much. \"I for instance no longer believe in fairytales, and surely the old you was the same. But now maybe, you can be the innocent little wolf you never were\" And for an instant, Odette´s eyes lost their violet glow as she whispered sadly -I believe in gold coins, steel words and men´s wits Monsieur...and I believe there once were kings and queens, we have their bodies after all. Beaumont was about to reply when he saw the physician approaching from the corner of his eye, looking at the window he saw it was almost noon. -Bonjour, Monsieur Beaumont. -Monsieur Favager- he said as a greeting. Odette blushed once more and Beaumont examined the physican. The man had seen much more winters than she, blonde hair and eyes the color of lemongrass, strong jaw and broad back; the white uniform suited him remarkably well and he looked like of those golden stags old noble families had on their crests; Mérante´s little wolf looked at him the way the maid from the star had gazed at the king in the tale. -How are you feeling mademoiselle? Bess told me your name is actually Odette. -It is Monsieur- she replied shyly. –Odette Tavernier. -It is a beautiful name, I believe it means graceful swan in the old Frankish tongue- he realized Beaumont was glancing at him and added amiably, -It thank you for helping her Monsieur, we were all so very worried about her. Beaumont laughed, but not heartily, just enough to let him know he was watching over the naïve little wolf. The kind of laugh only caution and weariness can hear. But Gaston Favager made no realization gesture. -I heard someone singing earlier and came to see what was it. -Monsieur Beaumont was singing the starmaid song. -I see, but I also came to ask Monsieur to go rest for a bit as I examine mademoiselle Odette´s injures. -I thought that was Bess´ job- said Beaumont heading for his bed on the other side. -It is, unfortunately she is not back yet and the other nursemaid has fallen sick. Beaumont said nothing and managed to reach his bed unassisted for Mérante to find him pretending to be soundly asleep a couple of hours later. -I know you are not sleeping, snap out of it. -And here I was thinking I could become an actor next- he smiled changing to a sitting position, everything would be fine if he could keep his eyes off Odette´s bed where he saw Gaston talking with the \"jolly little woman\" non-stop about who knows what. –What´s the word? -Nothing yet, but I think I´m close. -Oh? -I found one of the theatre attenders that was conscious when the fireguard took him outside; and he said he saw the black swan´s ballerina being taken to the tents. -And how come he told you this? - it was unusual for theatre attendants to willingly spill the beans with no reward as guarantee. -Well, he thought I had seen him steal the prima´s jewels from the main dressing room; and had come to reclaim them, he also stole Odette´s crystal crown. -Hmm… -You do not look overly surprised. \"You have no idea\" -Well you did say you were sure she was alive. -I didn´t think you´d believe me. \"I didn´t until yesterday\" -Mérante-, he said a bit more seriously as he looked at him; he was handsome as always and athletic as a life survivor, there was no comparison with Monsieur Favager, older and seasoned in ways Louis wasn´t. They were too different –I must tell you something, but you have to promise not to react rashly and do something stupid. Louis face straightened as he stared at him, his dark hazel pupils fixed on him. -I have found her. Mérante inhaled sharply. Beaumont actually thought it was adorable… and he admired him for it. If he had fought for his own love like Louis had, with claw, teeth and a lion´s wrath, he might´ve ended up with the woman he had loved for so long. -She´s half bald and injured but out of danger, the physician thinks she´ll need a cane for the rest of her days. But most importantly dear boy is that…- he paused to study his face intently. –She can recall nothing. -About that night? -Nothing at all, who she was or where she came from-, he hesitated but wanted the situation to sink in, -Nothing about you. . . Hours later Beaumont still remembered Louis face, still and motionless as if there was a knife slowly sinking to his ribcage, twisting and ripping. -She´s right across this bed. Do you wish to see her? Mérante took a moment to answer in a faint voice. -Yes, but not yet- he said as he left without looking back. Beaumont had talked later to Odette about Mérante a bit more. He wanted to let her know the young man deeply cared for her and wished for her wellbeing the way a very, very close friend would. She regarded him with a dreamy smile and thanked him once more, before drifting away to sleep. Going back to his own bed, he did the same. But later, when shadows grew long, Beaumont heard a familiar voice that called him slowly into consciousness. -Would you care to tell it tonight? -Are you not tired? -Strangely enough I´m not, but then again I do nothing more than sleep and be seated in here; Monsieur Beaumont can tell you. -Very well. Mérante´s husky tone reached his ears, but he preferred to remain there and see their exchange; Odette was bathed by the twilight light that came in from his window, her eyes so blue their purplish blaze was mesmerizing and for a moment, if she remained quiet and still, one could remember the ice statue she used to be. There was a bouquet of blue roses in a glass vase on her nightstand, their sweet fragrance perfumed the place. Bess was back and attended her patients a few beds on the right and better still, there was no sign of Monsieur Gaston. . . The alluring voice of this young man captured her, there was something magnetic and intriguing about him; whilst she talked to him, the room seemed to disappear. His air of confidence and familiarity made her imagine puddles of gold under her bed and her small forgotten world stood still when he spoke. \"Long ago, when magic still existed in this world and dragons were feared by knights, there lived a beautiful maiden whom folk said came from a star; her long argentine hair glowed with the moonflowers she had woven in it and her blue eyes were like two sapphires with the power to enlighten the darkest night\" \"The maid´s name was not to be pronounced, for it was in the language of light and song\" \"Before time, the maid had fallen from the sky and landed in the sea from where her purity twinkled for a thousand years, the illumination from her hair led sailors back to their homes; woodsfolk sang songs about her beauty and mermaids learned to speak thanks to the maid\" \"Until one day, an evil dragonlord saw her blue light and desired it for him alone. He left his country and flew on the ocean waters in search of the maiden´s starlight\" \"The maid saw this through her dreams and escaped across the ocean until she reached a northern land called Earthsea; where the local prince had just been recently crowned and vowed to protect the beautiful woman, his name is now lost in time but the one he gave to the maid has survived: Ashæla Seastar\" \"She became his lover as well as his queen and it is said he loved her so fiercely that when the dragonlord arrived, he realized he couldn´t break their union, so he fought the king´s army for a hundred years. In the end, the enemy casted a spell that caused sulfur and fire to rain from the heavens, the dragon´s claws pierced through the sky and more than half of the army was obliterated; seeing this was because of her, queen Ashæla wept so much for so long that the rivers went far beyond their channels and the tides of the sea reached the king´s fortress\" \"The fire died out and the ocean waves swallowed the dragonlord and his beast, the formidable event was later called the Fire Tide. After it, queen Ashæla bore the king ten sons and seven daughters who became powerful knight kings and beautiful princesses that ruled over Earthsea for thousands of years, cementing the Seastar dynasty\" \"Legend says that when her husband died, queen Ashæla asked God to turn his heart, which had always been hers, into a jewel so it could be with her forever; God granted her wish giving her a necklace with a blue diamond in it which she called \"Coeur de l´Étoile\", heart of the star. Long after Ashæla died, the necklace kept being part of Earthsea´s national treasure, passed on by generations to learn of a love fallen down from the stars and a sorrow that could gobble and kill a dragon\" . Hello people! Yes!

Thank you sooo much, I am very well btw thank you fors asking as well XD, I really do the best I can and is so rewarding to that lovely people like you appreciate it. Yeah, I know I couldnpt make them dance... but the whole point in this fic at least, is to show theirs is not a fairytale and that nothing in life goes as one wished it would. I have the whole Odette situation already planned, don´t you worry, and I also hope you can still give me your opinion. Thank you again (can´t seem to thank you enough haha) and pls pls let me know your thoughts ;) Lots, lots of love to everyone![Chapter 16] Chapter XVI . Wolf´s Heart . -¡The catastrophe! -The Iron Chanciller will be our doom… -Does Napoleon wishes for war again? -He can go to hell for all I care, he should´ve rotten together with the rest of his family! -Well Mérante…- sighed Beaumont looking at the gathering crowd –You never told me the mood had gotten so… enjoyable as of late. Mérante shrugged, focused as he was to move forward with his old master´s wheelchair across the square back to the hospital, difficult enough with all the cityfolk walking around to buy the evening newspaper and discuss its content, he really hadn´t paid much attention to political news. -One can only marvel that a city that has just witnessed a tragedy is still able to whine about the arrival of a single man and say it´s the worst that has befallen us since the Revolution. -There are plenty of bad things that have happened to France since then- Louis retorted, finally he could see the hospital in the distance. -I agree. But we are only humans, and lowly citizens at that. Kings and princes do not fret over bread price; and one would think Parisians have more important things to worry about than that blondie prick and our ridiculous ruler. Mérante said nothing and kept walking, fully understanding Beaumont hated to speak about war, his grandfather having served and died in the French army during Bonaparte´s Russian failed invasion. But cold hard truth was, he actually believed war times were coming, and as his master said, there was little anyone could do except for those crowned fools, and also he knew not what he´d do if such a catastrophe happened. They reached the hospital in utter silence, Odette was sleeping and Mérante remained at her side for another half hour before departing. Days passed until Odette´s hair started to grow back and Beaumont was finally discharged -Will you come and visit me Monsieur? - she asked when he bid farewell. Beaumont made an effort in his wheelchair to caress her hair, barely a wisp of her old chocolate waves. -Of course little wolf. -And Monsieur Mérante as well? -I am sure he will, but I thought you preferred Monsieur Favager´s attentions Odette blushed prettily and looked at her bandages, her purple eyes betraying her sorrow. -Monsieur Favager is very kind indeed. But… there is something in Monsieur Mérante´s voice that soothes me. Besides…- her voice dropped to a whisper as she saw the cane Bess had gotten, resting next to her nightstand, -I doubt I can allow myself to feel anything for anyone until I figure out how I´ll live my life from now on. I refuse to become a burden. Beaumont knew how that felt, no matter how hard he tried to ignore the grotesque stumps where his legs once were. -How are your memories? -Blurry still- she replied curtly. Yes, they were, and they were fiery as well. Odette knew she used to be a dancer, and for some time she thought maybe it was better she didn´t remember who she was. Ballet was something she could never do again. -And walking? -Not without a cane Monsieur. They were silent for a while before she said, her tone steely under a sweet crust -Are the rumors of war true, Monsieur? -No one knows Bismark´s intentions Odette- he retorted calmly. The old Odette could handle the truth, the new one was delicate and somewhat skittish. –But if His Majesty refuses to find middle ground with the Káiser, I think there will be no other choice. But grieve not, little wolf. Wars are tricky, but their trickery develops at a comfortable distance from pretty ladies like yourself, they won´t come knocking to your doorstep. -Maybe, but that´s what many thought of the Opium War and Napoleon I´s battles until Paris had the tsar capitulating the emperor in the place de la Concorde . Beaumont looked at her, glimpses of the Odette Louis had grown to love shone with that sentence. -Old men should fight with sticks and stones, having the youth fight for their own conflicts is inexcusable- she continued, -by the end of it there are words you can´t stand to hear and only names of places have dignity. \"Glory, Honor, Courage\" become obscene- Odette looked at the window. –After all is done; old men come and take the youth´s victory and remake it to the likeness of the former world they knew. Younglings can win but know not how to keep their victory; and they´re pitifully weak against old folks, they stammer to build a new world with fire and blood and all the old do is thank kindly and make their peace. War is not to show who is right. -Only who is left- he interrupted. –Odette, where did you hear this? She seemed to wake from a daydream, her violet pupils dusky and vague. -Someone said it to me once…maybe my father, I´m not sure. But what I wanted to convey sir, was that if this conflict with Prussia ends how everyone seems to expect it to end, many will leave to fight in it. War is terrible and men must become terrible to wage it, I can only hope our friends are spared from such a fate. -You mean Mérante? -Yes him…mainly-she admitted, -but Bess as well and Monsieur Faveger too. And- -It is no good to worry over things yet to come little wolf, -he cut off, -It might come or it might not. And if it does we´ll concern ourselves with every task at hand without disheartenment. For now, you have to sleep and get better so you get back the life you claim you lost; that is all there is for sure. She nodded and smiled, the melancholy lifting like a black fog her smirk scared away. -I´ll visit as soon as I can hire a manservant to help me. -I´ll be waiting Monsieur, please be careful. -I will Odette. Beaumont kissed her hand and called for Bess, who said his carriage was waiting outside; he reached the street and with the help of his loyal nursemaid and the page-boy, he was able to climb into the hansom cab. Sighing he looked back through the small window and wondered if France was really plummeting, once again, head first into bloodshed. A light rain began to fall, the way Odette´s tears had when Louis told her of her foster parents' demise. -I don´t remember them; but I cry for the idea of not feeling a thing. At least this new and unknown lass was sincere. The carriage jerked off suddenly, most likely a rock sticking out from the smooth stones on the roadway; Beaumont felt a bump swelling from his bruised skull, when he passed his hand over it; a little stinging pain went through his head, but it felt so peculiar that he kept fondling it until they reached his new residence, a good small single-floored house that posed no bonus threats to his crippled condition. No matter what Mérante, Vacourbeil or any other good natured friend said with much unwanted optimism over God knew how many masks of pity, he was crippled and he would never walk again, the rest was horseshit. An old acquaintance recommended him an agency to try and find a couple of servants that would help him in adjusting to his new lifestyle, his friend´s letter explained how the contract law worked and the terms he was supposed to meet in order to hire these people. A new modality arrived to stay thanks to the Bonaparte´s dynasty; Beaumont could feel his annoyance puddling under his hospital bed that day, so Louis had offered to make the interviews and arrangements. -Contract law has also made our lives easier as artists, my friend- he´d said, -we´d be entertaining rich people in the red light district otherwise. He would´ve punched that stupid wise look off his attractive young face as if he´d just talked to a gossiping fishwife. Because the worst thing was he was right. He had lived that way long ago, Louis didn´t know though. But the woman he´d loved for years, and loved still, had been from the red light district. Beaumont was still a teenager, a boy as green as summer grass. And to him, the woman had been the summit of female charms, catquick and bright, ripe as wine grapes. Had a woman so fair ever walked on earth? . He didn´t learn her true name until some time later, but her clients called her Madame Yan. Employees in the pillow houses said she came from a dry land, somewhere in the steppes near China. She could ride a horse as well as any man and it was often this ability that attracted the clients that would gamble on races and sports; and she liked to clothe herself with satin and silks, and headdress her night black hair with big pieces of jewelry or colorful chrysanthemum flowers. It was not long until one night, after most clients were gone, before the break of dawn when he was dead drunk to numb the emptiness in his stomach, that he dropped his sheet music aside and confessed her he loved her. It was then she told him her real name, Ying-Yue, and said he could call her Yue. The morning light gave her amber almond eyes the lushness of a dove´s look and her cheeks were full and so inviting he gave them a chaste kiss she somehow transformed into a day spent in her bed after she told him she had wanted him as much as he had wanted her. They were in love, what could the world care? \" The world might not have cared, but the owner of the pillow house sure did\" A knock on the door drew him out of his memories. He was examining the items in his… sort of solar room, and didn´t realize how long had he been there. -Come in- he said. Two persons came in, one was a pretty olive skinned girl dressed in a maid´s uniform, the other was a tall man, way older than Mérante but a bit younger than Beaumont himself, the latter having a hard time imagining his young pupil interviewing such a bulky man, the oh-so-stubborn Louis with his lion grace, black elegance and good spirit. -Excuse us sir, we are from the agency. My name is Jean and this girl is Solaria. We´ve come to be your new help. Monsieur Mérante instructed us to introduce ourselves as soon as you arrived- said the man with an impossible high pitched voice for someone his size. The girl came from the British Indian colonies; he was sure, yet she seemed good mannered enough to be backed up by an agency. -Yes, I´ve been expecting you. As you see, I am now prevented from the simplest movement of even using the privy on my own. So, I will be needing much of your assistance, especially since I have barely left the hospital. Now then, any doubts regarding your wages? Or your functions as my help? Both shook their heads. -Very well, I will be giving you your first set of instructions. Solaria, as you know, you will deal with everything regarding food and some cleaning, I hope Monsieur Mérante showed you the rooms you´ll be living in at the back?- the girl nodded and made a small curtsy, -and Jean, I´m afraid you´re stuck with me and will also help Solaria with cleaning and shopping. I hear you and your family live not far away from here? -That´s right, sir. -Very well, I´d hate to see you walk long distances in the night or at early morning. Besides we have the benefit that you´ll be nearby if I fall off the bed at midnight and sweet Solaria here can´t help me get on it again. -Of course, sir. -Excellent, now…Please Jean, get all my belongings off the other carriage which should be at the door now and put them in my room and anywhere you see fit, if I don´t like something, I´ll let you know but I trust your common sense. A blonde physician will come at dusk to check on my wounds, and I need you to please show him in. Solaria…I´m sorry my dear, but I´m quite hungry, so please make me some tea as you set the table and bring me anything substantial enough to wait till dinner. Thank you both. That´ll be all for now. Both man and girl retreated in silence, and Beaumont felt he had been too bitter. No japes and no good humored comments had found his way out of his mouth. \"I´ll make it up later, lest they think they´ll be serving Mephistopheles\" he though as he took out of his coat the book he´d been reading during the week to try and forget about the world and the war that was coming. . . . Mérante saw Odette long before she saw him, her gaze lost in space, reacting only when she heard him changing the wilted blue flowers in the vase for new fresh ones. -If war erupts, will you leave? He almost dropped the vase. -I don´t know- he replied sincerely. Her face became pale and her eyes, amplified in size by her lack of hair, were like two gray stormy pools. -I wish I was a man. Mérante did his best to stop himself from replying he wished no such thing -I wish you refrain yourself from feeling pity for others and concentrate on getting better. -I´m as better as I can get, Monsieur. The reason I´m not discharged yet is the fact they know I have nowhere to go. Louis sat on the chair to hide a pang of pain in his face. It would be extremely inappropriate of him to offer her a place to stay, so he focused on trying to find a job suitable for her, but thus far he had met no success, except for maybe…maybe… He gave her a sad knowing smile that she understood very well. It was the smile of a friend who is somewhat hand tied to help, and she held no reproach to him for it. A lone woman in the world faced a tough life but apparently she had managed to live it until then, so she´d just stride on. But for Mérante, it was the smile of a man in love who cannot yet tell his lover about his affections. Her lack of memory annulled her feelings and until she remembered a bit of the ballerina that died in the theater that night, he couldn´t tell her anything for fear of taking advantage, plus the fact this Odette was gentler, probably unable to resist him if he told her about his love and the long hours he spent looking at a phantom future by her side. And then, there was the war. It was coming, and there was no denying it. -Actually, I know of a position which may interest you, it is from your old employer Madame LeHautt. I don´t pretend to be blind to her sour temper, but she´s the only willing to… -Accept me as I am now? Mérante nodded, there was no fooling her. Harsh as it was, he liked to think the world´s crudeness could bring the old Odette back. -I accept it Monsieur, if a war is coming I must do what I can to prepare for it with a stable accommodation and a roof on my head. He didn´t bother to smile, he didn´t have to. But his feelings were in his gaze, he could only hope in time, she´d accept them. Odette grabbed the newspaper and gave it to him, her pale face had a shy smile. Louis looked at the paragraphs, most where about politics, but at the end of the column, it said the Opera House would open its doors soon enough. -At least there are some good news- she mumbled. -Well, they´re still politics news, but I suppose it is good. I´ve been meaning to ask you, would you rather…Excuse me, but the first place where I sought employment for you was the Opera, but I wasn´t sure if you´d be comfortable yet with spending time next to a world… -Where I have no part in anymore? He just held her gray eyes in an effort to imbue in her, if not courage, some acceptance. -I don´t remember a thing about the old ballerina you said I was Monsieur, so I´ll gladly accept anything that puts food on my plate Was it his imagination or had she turned bitter? -Still, I´m afraid the Opera won´t be ready for you to work there anytime soon. So, I guess you could be with Madame Regine and then try part time at the Opera. -Thank you, I believe I shall- she replied amiably, the bitterness gone like morning fog. They remained in silence, Odette looking at the sky through the window and Mérante reading the newspaper whilst secretly drinking in her company. For now, that was enough, no physicians were nearby and most sickbeds had no one on them anymore. The dying sun behind Notre Dame´s belltowers sang the end of the day. -Back to the business with Prussia- she started, some minutes later. -We have no business with them, it´s the king. -I know, but just so it happens his current business is our business as well…when do you think it´ll be? Louis had not been born yet when the last big war in France ended, but he remembered clearly the scars and memories it left in the country; besides of course, if history books had anything to be learnt from them it was the fact men always commit the same stupid mistakes for the same stupid reasons. The stupidest thing being they made other men bleed and die for them. Nevertheless, it was pretty simple to guess the previous to war atmosphere in most societies and France was no different, those uncomfortable nagging sensations at the bottom of everyone´s gut, a feeling of being in constant anxiety with water weights crushing one´s head. -Soon, it´ll be very soon -I knew you´d say that…I just hoped. No, I can only expect now that my \"soon\" is longer than yours. -Odette, if I have to leave…would you… \"Ah! There it is…\" Her eyes changed, right before him, from gray to purple, hypnotizing him in such a way Odette had to ask him to continue. -Would you remember just one thing about me? -There is no chance I remember just one thing about you Monsieur- she hurriedly reply. -Oh? Her countenance became warm and inviting, unknowingly Louis left his chair and sat on the bed. -I remember how you bring me blue flowers every day, and fold the newspaper in the sections you think I´ll find interesting. I remember your voice when you told the starmaid´s legend and I remember your face in the street pamphlets when everyone called you the Ballet Prince, I remember…. Suddenly she gripped his hand, so fiercely and desperately Mérante did not dare to breathe. -I remember you on a wooden stage, spinning so fast I could barely see your face before it turned again, I remember having meals with you, there was a hearth and there was also snow, there were children as well. The lavender evening light gave her skin a bluish luminescence, like the color of the sea at twilight. -Was that a dream? Louis couldn´t help it, he released his hand and touched the side of her face with his palm, a tear fell on his thumb, the obvious intensity of her memories ghosting in her pupils. -No, it was not. Her gaze focused on his face as she softly caressed his hand, her trembling fingers a heart whisper, it made him forget for an instant there were no promises between them, so much so he leaned on her. Her rosesmell had disappeared, but for the first time since he found her again, Louis did not miss it, somehow that brought her closer, more magically wrapped around him, more intimate, less silvery and faraway, more like a woman sitting there, with him. Her hands ran upwards from his elbows and stopped on his shoulders. -Oh my friend- she said, the seducing husky tone in her voice was the one thing that never left her, -Why is it that when my memories seem to come and drown me, yours is the first voice I hear and the color of your eyes the last I see? Mérante could swear he felt the heat invading his core, a cup of brandy after a snowy day trip, inadvertently his hand left her cheek and went down, her throat catching his eye, her arms grabbing him so firmly he could not had let her go easily even if he had wanted to. \" Odette …\" His other hand ran through her arm and gently rested at the back of her neck. They were so close they could feel each other´s warmth, so tempting to take the plunge forward their shivers were like a quiet poem in the storm of emotions. -Because Odette, the first person ever that made me want to keep my own memories to revel in them later, was you. Odette, the sweet little wolf felt something tightening her chest, bright and heart melting, something she thought she should remember since its sparkling volt brought tears to her eyes, tears so cold she thought they weren´t hers and yet so hot, they burned their way down her face. Odette, the other one, the one she knew was buried somewhere, grabbed her wolf necklace and closed her eyes again, slumbering, not wanting to wake to the call of those amber hazelwood pupils. -I think it´s possible you were my first person ever in many ways as well. My heart can´t stop hammering… \"Good God, don´t you ever tire of hammering mine?\" he thought. And then she said: -Louis…-in a low voice, frosted in need and dusted in wanting fiery crystal, her hands knotted at his back. Odette could hardly breathe, his every move and look sending a tremor shooting down her spine. So unfair… so unfair this man had such enticing spell over her while she herself…it was frightening he could so easily vanish into thin air, or war could take him, or… She watched him with half opened eyes and parted lips, her hands shook. Something in her growled, and she challenged him with her eyes. The wave of sensuality hit him in full force, Mérante cupped her chin and ran the tip of his thumb over her lower lip, the softness wracking his nerves. -Odette…-her eyes were glazed and bright, she tangled her fingers in his jet black locks. His hands slid downwards to pull her body up against his, and she released a quiet surprised gasp, he straightened up and lifted her, crushing her body against his. -Please, wait for me…- His arms engulfed her, like chains of desire, tying her soul and yet for Mérante the chains made it all the more reasonable to wait, even if it was forever ... if she couldn´t remember her old self, he could not really say he had her whole heart. -I know you refuse to tell me many things, Monsieur Beaumont mentioned it, you are afraid. He buried his face on the side of her neck, her collarbone touching his lips with every sigh she exhaled, accommodating his arms around her more steadily. If she were still a wild she-wolf, it was likely she would´ve bit his hands off. But this gentle spring girl was beautiful, kind and benevolent as velvety butterfly wings floating in sunny raylight. At that moment, her candor made him love her, since there were no ice walls anymore. It made him miss her, the black swan ballerina sleeping somewhere in that lovely head, the truth of it dripping like light drops over his veins. His heart bled. -I thought you loved me- she said, her voice broken as summer icicles. -I d- he could not let her think that. -Monsieur Mérante! It is past visiting hours, and what are you doing to our jolly little woman? - shouted Bess, the nursemaid, so loudly he swore the whole hospital had heard. Odette sat hastily back in her place, her gown going up a bit more that what was proper and showed him her right thigh muscles, the skin white and smooth. \"Dear Lord, what is wrong with me?\" he debunked himself, she was wounded, her other leg was covered in bandages, her beautiful face shrouded in sadness. -Please Monsieur, I must ask you to leave- exclaimed Bess giving him his coat and shoving him out of the hall. -I´ll see you tomorrow mademoiselle- he said. But Odette didn´t reply. As he was descending the steps leading to the street when he realized her last words to him, but he could not enter the place again. \"I´ll come first thing in the morning\" He went home with the memory of her frame crushed against his heart, her smell on his vest and cravat and the sporadic touch of her neck on his lips. But next morning he could not go back, he could only miserably stare at the hospital structure from the distance. Because next morning, the war of ink, words and letters was over and the Franco-Prussian war began. A/N Don´t hate me for not letting them kiss, I just thought it´s not the time yet...

I wouldn't be surprised if my father wouldn't hear me. \"Yes, it's me.\" My said from the living room. Okay, so maybe he could hear me. I walked out of my room, down the hallway, and into the living room. I stood infront of my father, smiling. I then saluted him, standing with my perfect posture. \"At ease, Raynee.\" He said to me, outting his hand on my shoulder. I couldn't help but to laugh, and I stepped foward and hugged my father. \"Have you eaten yet, Ray?\" Dad asked walking over to their kitchen. \"Yes, sir. I even made Dinner for you.\" I replied, my posture still straight as a board. I knew it wasn't anything new that I had cooked for my father, ever since Mom left it was like a chore. But I was happy to do so. My father took out some papers in files from his breifcase and sat down on the table. \"Ray, come here for a moment. I have something important to tell you.\" He said looking at the papers. \"Yes?\" I asked as I sat down next to him. \"Okay, this may shock you, but I have to go out of town for... quite a while.\" Dad said as he read the first paper. \"Okay, to where?\" I could already feel my stomach churning. If he goes out-of-town I ahve to stay alone in our house for awhile. Not. Good. \"I have to go to Michigan for a meeting. It's going to be like...a buisiness trip. I'm not letting you stay here...you'll be staying with the Thorn family as long as I'm gone.\" I felt the knots loosen, but they returned when I heard 'The Thorns'. \"The Thorns...?\" I trailed off. \"Don't their children go to the Academy across the street from mine?\" \"Yes. They said you could stay with them until I return.\" My father stood up and walked over to the kitchen counter. I remained seated, thinking about the Thorn family. Ah, yes...the Thorns. I had seen their sons when I visited a few moths ago. They seemed like the type of family who would look down on lesser folk. I knew they were pretigious and lived in a much bigger house than mine. I let out a sigh and looked at my father. \"How long will you be gone?\" I asked nervously, hoping it would be only for a few days. \"About seven to thirteen months.\" Oh, no. \"Dad, are you serious? I have to stay with them for that long?\" I said, feeling my chest tighten. Living with two boys, for nearly a year?! My dad had to be kidding! \"Ray, I don't have a choice. At least the Thorns live in a nice house. I'm sure you'll get along with Mark and Damien. They are very nice boys and they are the same age as you.\" \"Damien? I have to live with him?\"I felt my cheeks getting hot. \"Yes, he lives with Richard and Ann. Haven't you seen him at the Academy?\" Of course I have, Dad. Damien and I have even talked to eachother before. I can say that he seems cold, but really nice if you get to know him. \"Well, yes. I've seen Mark as well.\" I said, remembering Damien's cousin Mark. He was almost too nice. \"So, when are you leaving?\"I asked walking back to my room. \"First thing in the morning...so pack your things tonight.\" Wait. This is all happening tomorrow?! I actually felt overwhelmed about the fact that I was going to live with the Thorns fro nearly a year. I knew they wouldn't liek me because my father and I weren't exactly rich, despite my father being in the Military. My heart was pounding at the thought of living with Mark and...Damien. I opened my door and walked into my bedroom. I locked the door behind behind me and sighed. I looked out to my window and ran my fingers through my hair slowly. What the hell is going on? \"So, Richard, I heard Sergeant Neff's daughter will be staying with your family?\" Marion Thorn asked, crossing her arms. \"Yes, that's right. She'll be staying with us while her father is on a buisiness trip.\" Richard replied smiling at his wife, Ann. \"We figured since he is the man who runs the boys' school, it would be fair to help him out.\" Ann said smiling as well. Marion laughed quietly. \"What do you know about her? Is she intellegent? Is she pretty? Is she the same age as Mark?\" Richard chuckled, cutting off her endless questions. \"I'm quite surprised you can't tell what she's like, Marion. She is a Militay Sergeant's daughter. And besides...I met her when she was at the Academy a few weeks ago. She is very sweet and extremlely pretty, just like her mother.\" Ann nodded in agreement. \"Oh, she does look like Michelle doesn't she?\" Marion smiled softly and sighed. \"I see...\" Marion remembered seeing pictures of Daniel Neff's wife, Michelle. She was very beautiful. How sad she had to pass, I hope Mark likes her as much as these two do. Marion thought as she began to walk off. \"Well goodnight. I've heard what I wanted to know, see you in the morning.\" Marion said walking down the hall to her room. \"So that's what Raynee is like!\" Mark said excitedly as he leaned against the balcony's edge. He and Damien were very anxious to meet Raynee in person. \"Quiet Mark! They could hear us!\" Damien said looking at his cousin sharpily. Mark sighed and continued listening to the conversation below them. \"Have you met Raynee in person, Damien?\" Mark asked grinning smugly. \"No, have you?\" \"Yes!\" Mark chripped happily. Damien stared at his cousin. \"Really? What's she like? I've only seen her in pictures around the academy.\" \"Well, she is the sweetest person I think I've ever met. And that's saying quite alot considering we live with Ann.\" \"Oh. I thought you would say that. I think she's the most beautiful person I've ever seen.\" Damien said blushing. Mark laughed. \"You're blushing! You do like her, don't you?\" Damien glared at Mark. \"You like her too!\"[Chapter 2] DAMIEN : OMEN II The Sergeant's Daughter \"Raynee, you have to get up!\" My dad called from the living room. I sat up from my bed slowly, noticing it was dark outside still. I rubbed my eyes and tried to remember what was going on. \"Alright...I'm up...\" I said walking over to her closet. I hesitantly glanced at her clock. 3:07 AM I groaned at the time Dad had woken me up. \"Stupid Military things...\" I muttered as I pulled out my uniform from my closet. Then I remembered what was happening today. \"Oh, God!\" I said aloud, I knew I was awake now. I opened the doors to my closet again and pulled out my shoes. I then ran to the bathroom to take a shower. \"Dear, what time is Raynee supposed to arrive?\" Ann said sitting down. \"Oh, any minute now. Daniel has to be at the airport around four so I immagine he'll drop her off here soon.\" Richard said looking out the windows of the kitchen. \"I'm so excited to meet her! It's going to be like having a daughter!\" \"Yes, she is very refined and well behaved. I wonder what will happen when Mark and Damien meet her...you know how boys are around beautiful girls such as Raynee.\" Ann laughed. \"Oh, yes. I remember being a teenager. They fall in love so fast...those two will be fighting over her, I'm sure.\" \"Who will be fighting?\" Mark said comming from the hallway with Damien. The two were fully dressed in their uniforms. \"Boys! What are doing up so early?\" Ann asked looking at them. She smiled widely. \"You want to impress Sergeant Neff and Raynee, don't you?\" Damien and Mark looked at eachother. \"Well...I-it would be impolite to welcome our guest in our sleepwear. We want to set a good image of the family. Right Mark?\" Mark smiled, thankfull for Damien's quick thinking. \"Yes, that's right.\" Richard assessed their response. \"Alright, well scince you two are up...we might as well eat something.\" Damien and Mark walked over to their parents and sat down. The Thorns sat in the living room waiting for Raynee. Ann and Richard sat on the couch, they were discussing plans for Mark's birthday. Damien and Mark sat on the opposite side of the room. Mark was asleep, probably because of the little sleep he got last night. The two boys were very excited to see Raynee. Whereas Damien looked out the window, sitting up perfectly straight. His bright blue eyes were locked on the driveway. \"What time is it?\" Damien asked. \"It's five-fifteen.\" Ann said looking out the window as well. Damien sighed. He turned back to Mark and hit him on the shoulder. \"Mark! Get up!\" Mark shot up quickly. He looked at his cousin and straightened his hair. Damien shot Mark a glare, Mark just sat there looking proud. They both laughed at eachother. Ann and Richard, who had witnessed the altercation between them, laughed too. The four heard a knock on the main doors. \"Alright, enough of this. We have to welcome Raynee.\" The group all walked over to the main entrance. Richard stepped foward and opened the doors. My dad and I stood at the entrance to the manor. I was mezmirized at how big their house was. I stared at the family infront of me. I caught sight of Mark and Damien and I felt myself blush again. Damien certainly has gotten...better. I continued to stare at The Thorn family. They actually seemed like they had a loving side. I stood there silently for the next few minutes, still staring at Mark and Damien. My dad was off talking Richard, whom I ahve met at the academy as well. I figured I should try and talk to Mark and Damien. \"So, I presume you boys still go to my father's academy?\" I asked, trying miserably to be proper. I didn't want to seem middle-class like I actually was. \"Yes, that's right.\" Mark said looking at me sweetly. Oh yes, I remember you, Mark. I just stared at Damien. \"And I know you go to my father's academy, I see you on campus when I visit.\" Damien smiled. \"I haven't seen you in awhile.\" I blushed even more. \"You remember me?\" I was astonished that this boy actually remembered me. I knew Damien probably met way more girls than just me. \"Of course.\" Damien said, stepping closer to me. Woah, his eyes were beautiful. They were almost suffocating... \"What happened to your hand?\" Mark asked me, breaking my trance. I looked at him, confused, for a moment. I then realised what the question was. I lifted up my hand and stared at the gauze covering my palm \"Oh... this?\" I pointed to the gauze. The boys nodded. I felt my stomach tighten again and I laughed slightly. I couldn't let them know what it was! Think, Raynee...what is a logical answer?! \"I cut my hand on a shard of glass...My mirror broke yesterday.\" I said, obviously lying. I knew that they wouldn't believe me. Damien looked at me surprised. \"Your mirror...shattered?\" RI looked down, avoiding those damned blue eyes \"Yeah... Right dad?\" I looked ovcer to my dad, hoping to get himt o play along. Dad turned around and looked at me. I smiled nervously and glanced at my hand. My dad nodded faintly, I knew he would make them believe me. \"Yes, you cut your hand on glass.\" He said looking at the boys. I smiled and felt a wave of relief over me. Damien stared at me insistantly, I knew something wasn't right. There obviously was no blood on my palm, and I told them I cut it on glass. Damien half-glared at me suspiciously. Damien knew I was hiding something from them.[Chapter 3] DAMIEN : OMEN II The Sergeant's Daughter That night after I unpacked my things, I sat in her new bedroom. I looked around at the large bedroom, it was painted light coral pink. Wierdly, it looked nice with the gold furniture. The room was much different than mine at my house. I sighed and walked over to the vanity sitting beside my bed. My gaze drifted to my hand, still wrapped in the gauze. I unraveled the strip of gauze and stared at the mark on my hand. Dad says I must keep hidden from others. 6 16 I looked at it confused. \"What does it mean?\" I whispereed to myself, running my finger over it. What did it mean? Am I the only one wit my with it? Something broke my concentration, I heard a knock on my bedroom door. Quickly, I wrapped my hand back up in the gauze. \"It's open...\" I said calmly, standing up and walking over to my bed. Just as the door opened, I sat down on the edge of my bed. Damien and Mark stood at my doorway. They smiled at me. I smiled back, my head screaming at me, \" Act proper, don't embarrass yourself !\" \"Hello, Miss Raynee.\" Mark said formally. Oh, Mark...you need to stop trying so hard. Damien smiled at me and the two boys walked into my room. They stood infront of me, and I'm still on my bed. Oh my god...I need to stop fantasizing... \"Hello, Mark. Hello, Damien.\" I said, blushing like mad. \"We're going out to go ride snowmobiles. Want to come with us?\" Damien asked. My god, I was already falling in love. I stood up and looked at the boys infront of me. \"Sure, I'll be out there in a few minutes.\" I smiled The boys looked at eachother, smiled, and walked out of my bedroom. Leaving me alone to change my clothes. \"Mark, she's beautiful!\" Damien said almost blushing. \"I know! I can't believe she's living with us!\" Mark smiled widely at his cousin. \"So...who gets her?\" \"What do you mean?\" Mark asked, he stopped walking. \"I mean, who will get to court her. Like, who gets to be Raynee's...boyfriend?\" Damien hesitated to ask, feeling he would start a conflict. \"Well, that's up to Raynee.\" \"I guess you're right, Mark.\" The two boys began walking again. They sighed and stood at the front door, waiting for Raynee. I walked out of my bedroom, now in my winter clothing. It wasn't much, but it will suffice. I walked down the maze of corridoors and finally into the living room. I came up behind Mark and Damien and looked at them. \"Damien? Mark?\" Damien and Mark turned around and stared at me in amazement. I could see the blush rising to their cheeks. I couldn't help but smile. \"Are we going to ride snowmobiles?\" I asked, playing with her hair and putting it into a crude bun. Damien looked at Mark for a moment, and Mark looked at Damien. I could tell they didn't know what to say. Damien finally spoke up. \"...Yes. We're going to ride them now. Come on, they're out back.\" I stared at the snowmobile infront of me and Damien stood by my side. \"Do you know how to drive it?\" I asked looking at him worriedly. \"Of course...You'll be safe as long as you're with me.\" Damien said starting up the snowmobile. I felt my cheeks getting hot again at Damien saying those words to me. \"Alright.\" I said as I got on the snowmobile behind Damien. I held onto him tighter than I prbably should have. \"Are you nervous?\" Damien asked as we drove off into the forest. \"N-no, I'm okay.\" He could obviously tell I was not okay. I knew how boys were. Damien smiled back at me and went faster, Making me hold onto him tighter. That's when I realized how warm he was. I was amazed that he was that warm in such cold weather. I actually found myself nuzzling against him, and I pulled back quickly. Did I really just do that?! Damien glanced back at me and I heard him laugh to himself. What had I just started?! Eventually they caught up with Mark and Richard on their snowmobiles. Damien looked at Mark, who was looking Damien and I. I could tell he was astonished that Damien had beat Mark to getting me first. Damien smirked and Mark glared back at him. I couldn't help but giggle at this. Richard smiled at Damien and I. \"Oh, look at you two. You got close quick.\" He said grinning. I blushed and smiled through it. Richard sped off back to the house, and Mark followed. He was still glaring at Damien. We followed suit, making sharp turns around the corners. Damien looked back at me. \"You okay?\" He asked me, making another sharp turn and making me hold onto him tighter. \"Yes.\" I said quietly, blushing still and jolding onto Damien tighter. I gave in and put my head on his shoulder. I smiled and thought of Mark's face if he saw this. And I could tell that Damie was thinking that I would be his eventually. Good luck, Damien.[Chapter 4] DAMIEN : OMEN II The Sergeant's Daughter /=-Three Months Later-=/ I sat on my bed, reading a book. Quietly humming a song to myself as I did so. I was lost in msyse \"Raynee!\" I heard Ann call my name and I closed my book, sitting up on my bed. \"Yes?\" I asked, standing up as she walked into my room. \"You're father is on the telephone. He wants to talk to you.\" I followed Ann to the Living Room. I stood at the telephone, and I picked it up hesitantly. \"...Hello?\" I asked, actually afraid of what Dad would say. \"Hi, Ray.\" He said over the telephone. I felt relief again, hearing my father's voice. \"How's the trip?\" I asked as I sat down on the couch. Damien and Mark walked infront of me. They looked at me questioningly, and I smiled up at them. My dad sighed. \"I'm coming back early. It's an emergency that I get back to the Academy as soon as possible.\" \" What ?! Dad, are you okay?\" I said, causing everyone to look at me. \"Raynee, calm down..I'm okay. But I'm comming back early.\" \"Will I be comming back home?\" My chest felt tight again, I honestly didn't want to leave now. I had gotten so close to this family over the past three months. \"No, you need to stay with Damien... I'll explain this all tommorow. Keep your...birthmark covered.\" \"But, Dad, What's the emergency? Is everyhting alright?\" My dad sighed again. \"Raynee, you need to start going to Damien and Mark's school.\" Wait, WHAT!? How could I, I'm a girl! \"Dad, What?! How can I- I mean, I'm a girl!\" I was panicking at this point, my thoughts were racing. Me at an all-boy school, surrounded by teenage boys! I'll be the only girl, and I know for a fact they all the boys will be trying to win me over. I suddered at the though. \"I'll explain this all when you come to Saint Davidson's on Monday. I'll see you then, Ray...\" \"Dad, wait, What if I ge-\" He hung up the telephone before I could finish. I sat dwon the phone and stared down at me feet, notwanting to look up at Damien and Mark. I felt hot tears starting to sting my eyes. Mark, Ann, Richard, and Damien stared at me. I could tell they were just waiting for me to say something. \"Is..Everything alright?\" Richard asked looking at me concerned. I looked up at The Thorns and mangaed to choke out a sentance, holding back my tears. \"He said he's coming home early...and I have to go the boys' school now.\" I said quietly, looking back down to my feet. \"But, it's an all-boy academy...Right?\" Ann asked, sitting next to me and looking at me comfortingly. She seemed like such a good mother. I nodded. \"Yes...I'll be the only girl there.\" I saw Damien and Mark look at eachother, I knew they were shocked that I was going to their all-boys school. Damien stared at me. \"You're...still going to stay with us, aren't you?\" Damien asked me, causing me to look up at him. \"I think so, ...My father said he'd explain this all to me on Monday..\" The room seemed to be filled with a negative feeling now. I had only been here for three months, and things were wierd already. I felt like this was ll my fault. Ann stood up and tried to bring back the normal feeling of the room. \"Well, tommorow is the last day of summer. Raynee, we're all going to stay at the winter estate for the rest of the year.\" \"Okay, I'll get my things packed tonight.\" I said standing up with her and walking over to Mark and Damien. Mark and Damien stared at me, I could tell they were just expecting me to start crying. But, I was much stronger than most girls. \"Are you okay?\" Mark asked me, stepping closer to me as Damien followed him. I smiled weakly. \"Yeah,...I'm okay.\" The next day, Damien and I stood in the gazebo in the manor's courtyard. It was the last day of summer, unfortunately. I stared at the many flower bushes surrounding the gazebo around us. This really was quite a romantic spot for a couple. And I couldn't help but chuckle at the irony of Damien and I being here. \"So, are you excited to go to our school?\" Damien asked me, once again breaking my trance. I really need to stop zoning out so much. I looked at him, falling back under his spell. Damn those wonderful blue eyes of his... \"Yeah, I guess. I'll be the only girl...\" Damien placed his hand on mine gently, causing me to blush like mad. \"Hey, It's alright...I'll be there.\" Oh my god, He's touching me! I just stared at the sight of our hands touching. \"I-I know, but I don't know why my father is acting so strange lately.\" \"You know how Sergeants can be sometimes. They're all wierd.\" Damien laughed slightly. I looked at him, and he smiled innocently to show he was only messing with me. I smiled back. \"Yeah, trust me. I know.\" I laughed and was actually holding my hand now. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh. My. God. This wasn't like me at all, I had never been interested in boys much. But know that Damien had come along, everything I know is now flipped upside down. I was zoning out again, completely lost in myself once more as I though of Damien and I being together. But I knew it would likely never happen. He was the nephew of the owner of a widely known industry buisiness...and me? I was just a Military Sergeant's daughter. I was nothing compared to him. \"Damien! Raynee!\" Mark called from the balcony of the manor. Damien and I both looked towards the sound of his voice. I sighed, I had hoped Damien and I would get to spend more time together. But, we had to leave to go to the academy. \"Coming!\" Damien called back. He grabbed my hand and pulled me along with him as we walked. Damien pulled me up the stairs and we entered the manor's foyer. \"Goodbye, Aunt Marion.\" Damien said as we passed by the old woman quickly. \"Who told you?\" She asked harshly, looking up from her plants and turning around to us. Damien turned around to face her. I followed the action, lookign at the woman confused. \"Told me what?\" Damien asked looking at me, I was know glaring at Marion. \"Politeness isn't one of your strong points, Damien. We all know you didn't come here on your own.\" Marion said sharpily. She crossed her arms and looked at us. \"Nobody told me anything, but I was about to.\" Damien sounded innocent as usual. I smiled, agreeing with his statement. Smart thinking, as always, Damien... Where you really?\" Marion asked. She looked at Damien suspiciously. Damien glared at her before walking off. \"Goodbye, Aunt Marion.\" Damien left me alone with the woman. \"You know, he was trying to be nice!\" I said looking at Marion angrily. I can't believe she just did that to Damien! I should slap this woman, but Dad has raised me better... The woman simply went back to watering the flowers. \"Raynee, I don't know why you aren't attracted to Mark. He's a much better influence.\" \"I haven't choosen who I'm 'attracted to' yet, I love them equally.\" What did she mean by 'influence'? Marion sighed. I couldn't take this anymore, so I walked off and ran up to Richard, Mark, and Damien. \"Oh there you are, Raynee.\" Richard said putting his hand on my shoulder. We walked outide to the car. But Richard stopped us. \"Hold on...Did you all say goodbye to Aunt Marion?\" Richard looked at each of the us. \"I did.\" Damien said almost proudly. I laughed. \"Me too.\" I said after him. Richard looked at Mark. Mark sighed and walked back into the house. Damien and I laughed and got into the car. \"Wait!\" Ann said running up to out car just as Mark came back out. Mark slipped into the car, past his mother. We were all sitting in the backseat of the limousine. Damien and Mark on either side of me, so I was sitting in the middle. Ann walked up to the door of the car and smiled at us. \"Hope you three have a good first day...You two look after Raynee?\" Ann smiled her usual cheerfull smile. I smiled up at her. Mark and Damien smiled back at her. \"We will.\" They said in unison. \"Good luck, Raynee. You know we're here for you if you need anything.\" Ann said as we were just about to drive off. \"Thank you.\" I said, smiling. Richard shut the car door, and we began driving towards the Academy.[Chapter 5] DAMIEN : OMEN II The Sergeant's Daughter Damien sighed and leaned back into the seat. \"She's too much, that Aunt Marion...\" Mark looked at Damien and I. \"Oh my god, she's awful! Why did they invite her?\" \"So she could wave her hand and critisize us, to generally ruin our weekend!\" Damien said shaking his head. \"It's true,\" I began saying. \"She is...harsh. It's like she hates us or something! But what do we know, we're teenagers.\" I shrugged and leaned back father into my seat just like Damien. \"At least we don't have to have dinner with her!\" Damien said looking out the window. \"Oh, god, and what's that smell?\" Mark said, looking at Damien with disgust. \"It was lavender, you fool! All old women douse themselves in it, don't know why.\" \"Now come on guys, it's just because the old woman's getting on-\" Murray said trying to calm us down. \"On our nerves!\" Mark cut Murray off, causing me to burst out laughing along with Mark. \"...Murray's right. The old woman's time is up..\" Damien said, changing the whole atmosphere of the situation. Mark and I looked at him, to see if he was kidding...but he wasn't. \"We shouldn't be making fun of the poor woman.\" Damien's manner was so odd now. Mark and I just sat in silence, staring at Damien. Murray decided to change the subject. \"Have you boys met your new platoon leader yet?\" Mark and Damien nodded. I smiled. \"My Dad is the leader this year...he's filling in for that one Sergeant who...passed away last year.\" I said, not wanting to bring up the subject of death again. \"Did they ever tell you boys about Sergeant Goodrich?\" Murray asked next, looking in the rearview mirror to see our reactions. \"No...why?\" Mark said, looking at Murray. \"They say he commited suicide.\" Murray said, looking at the boys and not me. Mark and Damien just sat there silently. Suicide obviously didn't seem to upset them. I was surprised, Sergeant Goodrich was my father's friend and even I had met him before. The silence remained until Murray broke it...again. \"What do you guys think of the platoon leader?\" \"You mean Neff?\" Mark asked looking at me awkwardly. Oh, god...here we go... Damien stared at me along with Mark, I could tell they didn't want to ridicule my father infront of me. But, I smiled. \"It's okay boys, say what you want to.\" I said, smiling at Damien. \"Neff for 'neffermind'!\" Damien shouted, making me start to laugh. \"Well, Once you've met one platoon leader, you've met them all!\" Damien sat up in his seat and started shouting different military commands. \"Attention! Eyes front, chest out, stomach in!\" He shouted, impersonating my father. \"You know what?\" Mark began saying. \"You're crazy!\" \"Yeah, 'cause I practice!\" Damien smiled at us, laughing innocently. I honestly can't believe I'm going to school with these two... I wondered if my father actuallty intended me to go to school with Damien and Mark all along. Dad always said I needed a suitor before I got much older. I was only thirteen though, and I figured my dad was just being safe. We pulled around a sharp curb abruptly, and I reached out to steady myself by placing my hand to the seat. My hand fell ontop of Damien's, and I pulled back quickly. Blushing, I looked at Damien. \"Sorry...\" I said, putting my hand in my lap. \"Don't be.\" Damien looked at me, smiling, and I looked out the window. I was trying to avoid those blue eyes again. The following morning, I was struggling to wake up. The entire academy was on the parade grounds. We had been assembled for meeting our leaders, and I was the only girl out there. I was surprised the boys hadn't messed with me yet. We were sectioned off platoon by platoon, and I was placed between Mark and Damien in our line of formation. That was an order by my father. I wasn't used to these kinds of commands being given to us by the Colonel, so I just followed what Damien did. It was so confusing and I had no idea how I was going to make it through the year. The cadets all came to a halt and we stood infront of the academy. Infront of me stood the Colonel himself and my father. I honestly wanted to run up to Dad and just be protected by him. But, that wouldn't be welcomed in a place of such...discipline. More orders were barked at the other platoons and they marched off, leaving Just our platoon on the grounds. It was eerily silent for a minute or two before anybody said anything. My Dad and the Colonel finally walked over to us. I tensed up and tried to look strong. Damn my feminine intincts. \"At ease, boys.\" All of the boys shifted as a unit, and I followed behind by a few seconds. Dammit, this was harder than it looked. Dad made it look so easy. The Colonel began introducing my dad to us, and I wish I could've helped him. \"Boys, this is Sergeant Daniel Neff. He's filling in for Sergeant Goodrich, He is very well trained,\" Damn, right he is! \"And I'm sure you all will be the smartest platoon in the academy.\" the Colonel turned to my Dad and attempted a smile. \"I'll leave any further introduction's to you, Sergeant.\" My father saluted him and I couldn't help but smile. The Colonel walked off, and my father assesed our platoon. \"You'll speak to me only when, you're spoken to. And you'll listen to every word I say...because I intend to shine in my new job.\" Dad paused for a moment and stepped over to Mark \"I'll meet all of you personally after breakfast, for now, you're names.\" My father said standing infront of the many rows of boys. I wasn't sure how everyone would react to a girl being amongst them, and personally I don't think I wanted to know. I knew how perverted boys' minds were. \"Your name?\" My father asked Mark. I wasn't sure why my father was asking for Mark's name. Our family knew the Thorns almost as if they were part of our family. I presumed my father was just trying to do his job. \"Mark Thorn.\" He said looking at my father. I knew Mark was thinking the same thing I was. \"I like my rank, Thorn.\" Dad said, raising an eyebrow. Oh, Daddy, you could always be so stern to others. \"Mark Thorn, segeant!\" Mark repeated, and this time much louder. My father smiled at Mark. \"Thorn, huh? I hear your family has great connections with this place...\" Mark just remained silent. \"Well, hasn't it?\" My father asked again. \"Yes, sir. My father and uncle we're cadets here.\" Mark said, I could tell he was very timid around my father. \"Good. But understand that doesn't give you any privileges. We're all the same here.\" My father said looking at all of the boys. \"Yes, sergeant!\" Mark shouted. My father smiled again and walked over to Damien. I felt my heart flutter as I looked at Damien. \"Your name?\" He asked. \"Damien Thorn...sergeant.\" My father looked at Mark, then Damien. \"You two really don't look alike...\" \"We're cousins, sir.\" Damien smiled at my father. My father obviously knew that, but I knew he was trying to introduce everyone to everyone else. Damien glanced at me and risked flashing a beautiful smile. My father shot glances at both of us and remained sharp. \"Alright, but the same goes for you. No privlages.\" Damien nodded. \"Yes, sir.\" My father now was standing infront of me. I felt my stomach churn. Well, this is it. I'm about to totally embarrass myself. \"Name?\" Dad asked me, standing infront of me. This was the first time I actually felt intimidated by my Dad. My insides pooled and my head was screaming at me. Say something, Raynee! \"Raynee Neff, Sergeant.\" I said, looking up at my Dad. I could tell the boys were trying to keep quiet, but a few of them gasped. I glanced at Damien and he snickered. \"Boys, this is my daughter Raynee. She's staying with us until further notice.\" Dad looked at the boys harsher than before and I could tell that he meant buisiness. \"I want you all to treat her like she is one of us...because now she is.\" \"Yes, sir!\" Everyone shouted back at my father. I looked around the parade ground, then my eyes traveled back to my father. I watched him question each of the boys and then I looked back to the academy. I sat on the bench outside of my father's office with Damien. We were both waiting to enter my father's office to 'meet him personally'. \"Are you nervous about actually meeting my Dad?\" I asked Damien hesitantly and looking down at the floor. Damien looked at me. He smiled but I kept my head down. \"No...why? Should I be?\" I tilted my head up and looked up at him. I laughed. \"No, he's actually a pretty nice guy when he wants to be.\" Damien's smile widened. \"Well, obviosuly you'd know that. You are his daughter...\" I was just about to tell Damien something, but something stopped me. I looked up at a boy who was talking to the cadets around us. I was surprised none of them had come up to talk to me. Maybe it was because Damien looked pretty cold for a boy as nice as he actually was. \"That's Damien's father...right there,\" He said as he pointed to a picture and I was about to stand up for Damien, but I had no idea who Damien's father really was. I'm not going to embrarrass myself. I should just keep quiet. \"Robert Thorn was quarter-back, and my father was on the line with him. I guess even back then he was calling all the plays!\" This boy had some nerve, making fun of Damien's father in his own presence. My insides were screaming to stand up for Damien, but I held back still. Mark walked out of Dad's office and into the battleground. \"You're next, Damien.\" He said, not yet noticing the tension. Damien stood up and I did also. \"Your father wants to see you too, Raynee\" Mark said, finally feeling the tension in the air between Damien and this boy. \"Alright.\" I said, begining to walk into my father's office with Damien. But, Damien had other ideas. He turned around and faced the boy who had just ridiculed his father. \"Hey, Teddy.\" Damien said, his voice had...changed. I actually found myself blushing. Oh my... \"Don't you ever,\" Damien was really menacing now, and I actually stepped away from him. \"Talk about my father again. Do you understand?\" \"Can't you take a joke?\" The boy named Teddy said mockingly. Say something, NOW, Raynee! Damn my concious. I looked at this boy straight in the eyes and glared at him. Much like how I glared at Marion. \"Don't mess with him again.\" I said, trying in vain to be tough like Damien or my father. Teddy scoffed at me. \"Oh wow, look at you. Neff's daughter...the only girl in the whole school, trying act tough.\" The cadets laughed. I was just about to bite back again, but Damien grabbed my hand and pulled me away. \"Come on, your Dad needs to see us...\" Damien said as he dragged me into my father's office. We both walked into Dad's office and Damien shut the door, Causing my father to look back at us. \"Hello, Damien.\" My dad said, picking up some files from his desk. He looked up and very faintly smiled at me. \"Hello, Raynee.\" I smiled back. \"Hello, Dad.\" My Dad continued to look for something, shuffling through many files on his desk. He finally found what he was looking for. \"Oh, yes...Damien Thorn. You were born on June sixth...nineteen-sixty-six.\" My father reviewed Damien's information. Strange birthday... I pictured his numerical birthday in my head and realized what the numbers spelled out. 6-6-66 Oh...my... \"That's ten days before my daughter's birthday...\" My father said, smiling up at Damien. I then pictured my birthday in my head. Six...Sixteen...Sixty-Six... I remembered my birthmark and I practically felt my face pale. I had no idea what these numbers meant, but it frightened me greatly. \"Raynee?\" My father spoke my name and it broke me again. \"Yes, sir?\" I answered, my color comming back. \"Why don't you go see how many boys are left for me to see and leave Damien and I to talk?\" My father smiled and I nodded. \"Okay, Dad.\" I turned back towards the door and walked out, looking back at Damien and my father. I smiled and closed the door slowly. When I turned around again, I was met with the sight of the numerous cadets surrounding Mark and Teddy. They were obviosuly fighting. I had turned around just in time to see Teddy punch Mark in the face, hard. \"What the hell?!\" I screeched, making all the cadets whirl around to face me. I stared at Teddy, and he smirked at me and stood up. Mark remained on the floor, and I noticed his face was bloody. \"What the hell is wrong with you?!\" I shouted at Teddy. He just remained silent and smiled. Teddy then abruptly pushed me backwards, causing me to fall on my arm. I heard my bones crack as I fell and I couldn't help but let out a cry, feeling pain run up my arm. I had never had a very high pain-tolerence my whole life. Dad had never even put me in dangerous situations much, so I honestly never really had any severe injuries. I looked up weakly at Teddy, who was already back over to Mark. And he was giving him more punches. I attempted to stand and my wound screamed in protest, but I managed to stand. \"What's the matter, Thorn? You don't like it on your back?\" Teddy mocked Mark, I think everyone knew what he meant by that joke. \"Becasue I heard Raynee and Damien do like it!\" My pain disapeared and was replaced by the feeling of my stomach pooling again. \" WHAT?!\" I screeched again, once again causing everyone to look back at me. I could feel myself blushing madly. The cadets laughed at Teddy's perverted sentance and one said, \"She's blushing! You're right!\" Thoughts started plaguing my mind of what Teddy just said. Me. And Damien. In my room. Me on my back, staring up at Damien. Helpless against those blue eyes- NO! My blush was intensifying at my thoughts and just before I could muster up the strength to speak again, I heard the office door shut behind me. I spun around, only to face Damien. He was blushing as mcuh as I was. Right when I started to feel my blush fade...it returned when I stared into the blue eyes from my thoughts. \"Teddy!\" Damien said with the same voice he used from earlier. It was still terrifying, but I stepped towards him. Seeking his protection desprately. Teddy got up and walked over to Damien, making me shrink back farther towards Damien. \"Another Thorn...\" Teddy was still grining, but the grin faded as he looked into Damien's eyes. Damien seemed to be in a trance, and I couldn't stop watching. Mark got up and stood next to me as I continued to watch Damien. Teddy was then shoved into the wall, and I stepped back. I don't want my arm to be injured anymore than it already is. Teddy started screaming and hitting things that weren't actually there, and I couldn't stop watching. But my gaze drifted to Damien's ice-blue eyes. He looked so...evil. I had to stop this. \"Damien!\" I said his name, but I didn't get a response. \"Damien!\" I repeated, grabbing his arm and managing to break Damien out of his trance. He looked at me and looked normal again. Damien noticed that I was holding my arm and grabbed it. \"Raynee, are you alright?\" Damien asked, looking at my arm. I winced in pain and gasped. \"Yeah...I'm fine. I think it's sprained.\" I looked at Damien and smiled through the pain. I looked at all of the cadets surround Damien and I. I blushed again and remembered my thoughts from earlier. This was going to be one long school year...[Chapter 6] DAMIEN: OMEN II The Sergeant's Daughter I sat on Damien's bed in the dorm I shared with him and Mark. They were currently out with their friends, leaving me alone in the dorm. I had looked out the window and around the academy for them, but with no luck. I knew that I could go visit my Father in his office, but I didn't want to disturb him. I stood up from Damien's bed and walked over to the door. I reached for the handle, but I froze. No, not after what happened today...People will probably mess with me. I turned around and caught sight of my reflection in the mirror. I stared back at myself, barely able to make out my face through the cracks in the glass. I wondered how the mirror got into this shape and actually felt bad for it. I squinted, trying to get a better look at myself. Black hair...sickly pale...brown eyes. I look nothing like my Dad. From what my Father has told me, I look like my mother. I don't remember much of her. I've seen pictures of her and I do look like her in someways. Nothing is really said about her much by neither my father or me. My thoughts about my mother ceased and I walked back over to Damien's bed. I collapsed onto it lazily, burying my face into his pillow. I inhaled his scent and I blushed. It's...sweet? So, Damien Thorn smelled sweet. I giggled to myself and turned over, looking up at the ceiling. Was it creepy that I had just smelled my crush's pillow? I didn't think so, at least at the moment. I suddenly heard the door's handle click and I immediately sat up, swinging my feet over the edge of the bed. Damien entered the room, without Mark for once. I stood up from his bed and smiled at him. Maybe finally we could spend some time alone. \"Hi, Damien.\" I said, walking up to him and hugging him. He wrapped his arms around me in return. \"Hey, Raynee.\" I pulled back from him and sat back down on the bed. \"Has everything calmed down out there?\" I asked, smirking at Damien. He just shrugged. \"I wouldn't know...everyone kind of just avoided me. I'm not surprised.\" He sat down on the edge of the bed next to me. I stared at him as he continued to talk. Damien sighed. \"Everyone is probably terrified of me now...\" I tapped his leg. \"Hey, if they're scared of you, they are all probably scared of me too.\" Damien smiled at me and laughed. \"I don't think that anyone could be scared of you.\" I just smiled at him, trying to think of a way to prove him wrong. I knew that even though I was the daughter of a fearless Military commander, I was about as scary as a rabbit. I laughed at the thought. \"Yeah, I don't think so either...\" I sighed, shaking my head. We both sat in silence for a moment or two, until Damien broke it. He looked at my arm. \"How is your arm?\" I looked at my arm and moved it. \"Oh...I think it's sprained.\" I could hardly move it without pain shooting up to my shoulder. Damien's eyes narrowed as he looked to the door. \"I'm going to kill Teddy...\" I chuckled. \" Well, It was very brave of you to stand up for Mark and I.\" I smiled, and Damien smiled back. \"No one's ever stood up for me before, Damien..\" We locked eyes for a moment but I turned my head away, blushing. They're so pretty... Damien although, continued to stare at me. I glanced over at him and kept my head down. I knew that Damien could see me blushing, and that made me quite uncomfortable. I hate when people see me vulnerable like this. My father raised me to be strong, not like most girls. Yet here I am, blushing over some boy. But he's not just 'some boy'...It's Damien Thorn. I decided to break the awkward silence this time, hoping Damien wouldn't mind. \"It...uh...really hurt when I fell. I'm glad that you there to help me up.\" I smiled awkwardly, looking over at him. Damien stood up and walked infront of the mirror. \"I am too. I'm glad I was there to help.\" I stood up too, following him to the mirror. Damien stood still, looking at his reflection like I was. He smiled when he looked in my direction. I glanced at him discretely, faintly smiling back. We could definitely pass-off as related. Only difference between us is our eyes, his being that gorgeous shade of blue and mine being a dull shade of brownish black. \"You have your mother's eyes, Raynee.\" My father said one night when I was little. It was shortly after my mother had passed, my father was still grieving. I was all he had left. \"I do...?\" I had asked. Being only seven, I didn't understand death very well. I knew she was gone and that I was sad. My mother died. She's dead. \"Raynee.\" Damien said my name and I turned around to look at him. It sent my thoughts of my late mother away. \"Yes, Damien?\" I said, smiling and looking up at him like my thoughts never happened. Damien looked down at his feet, blushing. \"I-...Can I tell you something?\" I smiled at his shyness. I had never seen him act like this, I thought Damien Thorn was a pretty confident boy. Was I an exception? Damien reverted his eyes back to mine hesitantly. I smiled at him reasurringly. Damien grinned, making my blush intensify. \"You look really beautiful Raynee, honest. Even more so with that blush.\" Oh my god! Did he seriously just say that?! Damien Thorn, the most attractive boy I know thinks I'm pretty? Me...Raynee Neff. A creepy, wierd daughter of a rank three Sergeant?! No this can't be right... I smiled despite myself. Maybe he's just lying to me to makr me feel better about today? I suddenly felt Damien's warm arms wrap around my waist. I flinched at his sudden touch, feeling butterflies in my stomach. \"Damien...\" I said, looking up to him. \"Hm?\" Damien said smiling at me sweetly. My heart faltered at his smile. \"I know what you're trying to do.\" I looked back down at my feet. \"You do?\" I caught a glimpse of his smile. I felt myself blush even more. \"I don't believe you when you say I'm beautiful. I mean it's well...me. Please just don't lie to me. I know you're just trying to make me feel better about what was said today.\" There was silence. I heard Damien sigh. \"But I'm not...I really do think you're beautiful, Raynee.\" I laughed to myself. \"Sure.\" Damien removed his hand from around my waist and grabbed both of my hands in his. \"How can I prove it to you?\" Damien smiled at me. I just remained emotionless. \"I'll do anything to make you see it.\" I shook my head. \"Damien, you can't!\" He just looked at me and smirked. I blushed, my eyes widened. Damien leaned in closer to me and put his hand on my cheek. \"Damien what are you-?\" Before I could even finish my sentance, the next thing I knew was that Damien's lips were pressed up against my own.[Chapter 7] DAMIEN : OMEN II The Sergeant's Daughter =/-Two Weeks Later-/= I sat in History class and I was bored out of my mind, which was unsual for me. I just had this feeling something was going to happen. I wwas zoned out for a while, and the next thing I knew is that Damien was standing infront of our teacher answering questions. \"Let's stick with dates , Thorn...\" Our teacher asked questions I couldn't even answer. \"The Emperor's Death?\" He asked, obviously expecting Damien to be clueless. \"Eighteen-Twelve.\" Damien said seriously. I smiled. \"Battle of the Nile?\" \"Seventeen-Eighty-Nine.\" \"Thirty Years War?\" \"Start..or Finish?\" Damien smiled calmly, as if this was nothing. \"Start.\" \"Sixteen-Eighteen.\" I felt somebody kick my leg. I looked over and saw Teddy staring at me. I narrowed my eyes. \"What do you want, Foster?\" I hissed quietly. \"Are you seeing this?\" He asked smiling. \"Well, duh...\" I said turning back to Damien. \"I'm not blind.\" Teddy rolled his eyes and looked back at the front of the classroom with the others. I held my head up with my hands, this was getting boring. \"The excecution of Marie Antoinette?\" Our history teacher asked, knowing all of the boys would get this wrong. I stood up, knowing I was 'Neff's daughter' and pretty much was immortal here. \"October Sixteenth, Seventeen-Ninety-Three in Palace de la Concorde, France!\" I shouted raising my hand. Everybody stared at me awkwardly, and just as our teacher was going to say something...My dad walked in. \"Raynee, Thorn...come with me.\" My dad said sharply. I looked at Damien and he looked at me. I walked towards the front of the class and stood next to Damien. We hesitantly walked towards my dad. I could hear the boys whispering things. I looked at the whole class threatningly, and they fell silent. \"Both of you, outside.\" My dad commanded us. Damien and I walked out with my dad. I wanted to grab Damien's hand, but somethign stopped me. \"What were you doing back there, Thorn?\" My dad asked as we walked down the hall. \"I was just answering questions, Sergeant.\" Damien said looking at the floor. \"You were showing off!\" My dad stopped walking at looked at Damien. Something snapped inside of me. \"He was not , Daddy!\" I said staring up at my dad with rage. I wasn't acting myself at all. My father stared at me, shocked at my change of attitude. He sighed, then put his hand on my shoulder. \"Raynee, go upstairs to my office. We need to talk about...this.\" My dad lifted up my right hand, the bandaged one. I looked at Damien and he smiled. I looked back at my dad and stormed off upstairs. I stared out the window in my dads office, my arms crossed across my chest. I wished I could be sitting underneath one of the many autumn brushed trees in the courtyard, playing my guitar and spending time with Damien. I smiled and hoped that vision would come true one day. My dad walked in and closed the door. \"Raynee, do you know what that mark on your hand means?\" My father said sitting down. I shook my head, unwrapping my hand. \"It's a birthmark right?\" I said hesitantly. My father nodded slowly. \"Yes, but it's much more. Raynee, have you heard of the Antichrist?\" \"Yeah, it's Satan's child.\" I looked at the 616 marked into my palm. \"That's right. Honey, I wanted to wait to tell you this until you met him.\" My dad stood up and walked over to me. I felt my chest become tight. \"Who, dad?\" \"Damien. He is the Antichrist...and Raynee, you're his protector. That mark on your hand is the variant of the Number of the Beast.\" I looked down at the number in my hand once more. I felt tears in my eyes. \"Dad, thats prepsterous. Damien can't be the Devil's son, I've seen pictures of Robert and Katherine.\" \"No, he was adopted by Robert. Listen to me, Ray, you have to protect him. It's you're destiny and neither of you can escape it. I told Damien to read his bible, from this day forward you are his Disciple.\" I walked over to the window and held back my tears. I tried to find the bright side in this situation, and looked back to my father. \"Alright. Where is he?\" My father smiled and walked over to me. \"In his dorm, probably.\" I bolted down the stairs and through the corridoors. My thoughts were racing, I needed to find Mark. I ran to the main entrance and saw Mark talking with some of the boys. I ran up to him. \"Mark, where's Damien?\" I said quickly and out of breath. He stared at me. \"I don't know...why?\" Mark sounded worried. \"I need to talk to him. It's very important.\" All of the boys laughed and looked at eachother, smiling. \"Oh, shut up.\" I hissed sharpily. The boys all fell silent, I guess they knew I meant buisiness. And, as if on cue, Damien ran by us. I looked at him...I could tell he knew. \"What's wrong?\" Mark shouted after him. I felt my chest go tight again and I began to run after Damien as fast as I could.[Chapter 8] DAMIEN : OMEN II The Sergeant's Daughter \"Damien! Wait!\" I shouted as I ran after him. My legs were burning and I could hardly breathe, but I needed to let him know. I ran after him through the forest that surrounded the grounds. I knew this place by heart, so I knew where he was proabably going. The Lake. I used to hang out there all the time with my Dad. Damien looked back at me and began to run faster. I was surprised at how well he was dodging the branches and vines. I had to admit, this forest was beautiful. I loved it during Autumn and I wished this was just an innocent game of tag. But, no, this was Damien and I running towards our destiny. We finally made it to the docks on the shore. Damien made it to the edge and I slowed down my pace, I was now walking slowly. \"Why? Why me?\" Damien screamed out to the water. I walked up behind him. \"He told you, didn't he?\" I called softly. \"Raynee, please just go away. I'm a monster...\" Damien was crying at this point. \"No, no you aren't...\" I walked up behind him. \"I'm the Antichrist! The Devil's son!\" Damien shouted, making me step back. He sat down on the edge off the dock. I sat down next to him. I put my hand on his, but he pulled away. \"Damien, look , I...have it, too. I'm your protector, my lord.\" I said lifting up my hand. Damien looked up at me, his face was damp with tears. I unwrapped the gauze and pointed to the 616 scarred into my hand. Damien looked at it, I could tell he was absolutely shocked. \"But, you-\" Damien grabbed my hand and stared at it. Damien ran his fingers over the mark slowly. \"Now you know why I kept it bandaged.\" I said smiling slightly. Damien began sobbing. I inched closer to him and put my arms around him. He did the same and pulled me closer to him. \"It's okay, everything will be alright. It's my destiny to stay by your side until the end...\" I whispered, trying my best to comfort him. Damien burried his face into my shoulder and sighed. \"Yeah, you're right.\"[Chapter 9] DAMIEN : OMEN II The Sergeant's Daughter It was dusk by the time we had arrived back at the academy. The sun was just beginning to duck underneath the horizon; the sky slowly turning pink. Damien and I had no idea what time it was. We estimated it was a few minutes after curfew, as there was no one really doing much. The lights in most of the dorms were off, but a few cadets were still out on the stairs. They looked at us curiously as we passed. I could understand why, of course. Damien's pants were smeared with mud from all the running he did. My once pure white socks were nearly ripped to shreds and underneath, my legs were cut open and bloodied. I'm sure Damien had noticed the blood and would start asking if I was okay as soon we got back to our room. Once we had entered the room, Mark immediately sprung up from his bed and ran to us. \"Where were you two?!\" He whispered, trying desperately to keep his voice down, despite his confusion and anger. Mark had been worried sick about us being gone for so long. I'm sure he though we disappeared or got into some trouble. Then he noticed the blood on my legs. \"What on earth did you do ?!\" He said, kneeling down and coming closer to get a better look at my wounds. I laughed to myself. \"Mark, don't worry. I tripped and fell into a bush of..thorns...\" I giggled despite myself, glancing at Damien. Damien snickered, looking at me with a knowing smile. \"Raynee saw me run out of the school earlier and you know, rushed after me.\" Mark raised an eyebrow at us, making me smile too. \"Why exactly did you run out looking so panicked, Damien? And what did Neff want with you two?\" He stood, looking at us questioningly. \"...You two didn't get caught doing something gross, were you?\" Damien bursted out laughing, and I blushed fiercely as I just stared at Mark in shock. \"W-what?! No way!\" I stammered, making Damien only laugh harder. I quickly tried to come up with a good excuse. \"My dad only wanted to talk to us about..about our grades.\" Damien began to calm down, looking back at Mark. Damien nodded. \"Mark, you know I'd never do that. Besides, if I did, do you honestly think I'd let myself be caught?\" He smirked, making me nearly collapse flat on my ass. Mark shook his head, beginning to laugh. \"No, I don't think you would. But I know how you feel about Raynee.\" Mark smiled at his cousin, then to me. As Damien and Mark continued to talk, I thought of something in the back of my head. Dad is probably worried...Maybe I should go check in with him.. \"Hey, guys?\" I said abruptly, looking towards the door. Damien and Mark both looked at me and paused. \"I'm going to go try to find my Dad. I need to go tell him something.\" Damien stepped forwards a bit to me and put his hands on my shoulders gently; he looked me in the eyes and smiled. \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Damien had a look in his eyes. I looked into them as he stared at me worriedly as if to say 'I need you to be safe.' I shook my head. \"No, I think I can do it.\" My lips curved into a faint smile and he nodded, leaning down to kiss my forehead gently. \"Alright, love. I'll be here when you get back.\" Damien then kissed me on the lips again and I smiled, then turned away and walked out to the stairs. I knew where my Father's office was, and I was positive he was still in there. Possibly filing paperwork or making drill plans for the next few days. I chuckled to myself at the thought. It must be so boring for him. But, then again, my father loved his job and had been doing it for my whole life. The school was a ghost town. My footsteps echoed through the stairwell as I descended to the second floor. Our dorm was on the third story; my father's office was on the second. The stairwell was rather dark and my heart was pounding as I kept going downward. I tried to think of what my duty was as Damien's protector. Protector's are supposed to be strong and brave, noble and daring. I smiled proudly as a dragged my fingers along the walls of the stairwell before reaching the second story. The somewhat dim lights of the hallway greeted me when I stepped out from the stairwell. I began to walk through the many corridors leading to my dad's office. I felt my heartbeat quicken again as I approached the wooden door to my father's office. Not because I was scared or frightened, but what would I say? What do I do? I peeked into the frosted glass of the door, seeing my father still at his desk. I sighed, relieved, and knocked a few times. My father stood and walked over to the door, opening it and looking down at me. \"Oh, Hello, Raynee.\" He smiled down at me, giving me a bit of comfort. I forced a weak smile, trying to hide the fact that I was ready to burst into tears. \"Hey, Dad.\" I replied, stepping into his office and shutting the door. He took notice of my legs quickly and his eyes widened. \"Raynee! What happened?!\" He shouted in shock, quickly running to get some bandages. I sighed. \"I fell when I was running after Damien. Didn't you see me chasing after him?\" I asked, seeing my father return with the bandages. He motioned for me to come to his desk. I obeyed, walking over and sitting in his chair. \"I did. I was wondering where you two went. How is he?\" He asked, pulling down my socks and beginning to clean my wounds. Dad had always known how to treat my cuts and other injuries. I assumed they taught him how in the Army. I shrugged, feeling the sting of the antiseptic hit my wound. \"He's fine. Well, at least for just now discovering he's the son of the Devil.\" My dad chuckled as he wrapped a bandage, similar to the one on my hand, around my leg. \"I understand, Raynee. How do you feel?\" He asked, moving to the other leg. I paused for a moment, thinking of what to say. \"Dad, honestly, I'm scared. I don't know what's going to happen...And I'm afraid of Damien.\" I never thought I'd hear those words leave my mouth. My father sighed, finishing tending to both of my legs as he pulled my socks back up. \"Raynee, you have absolutely nothing to be afraid of. You should think of this as a blessing.\" My father smiled as he stood up and walked over to his window. I watched him, listening to him talk. \"The prophecy says Damien will be a mighty ruler someday, and it's his duty to protect you as much as it is yours to protect him. You two are going to be great leaders throughout the Second Coming. If Damien has you at his side, he is sure to remain victorious.\" I smiled a bit, standing up and walking over to the window. \"But, I read in the Bible that the son of God defeats the Beast...\" My smile faded quickly; I wondered what will happen if Damien did get defeated. My father shook his head, turning to me. \"No, no, Raynee. That's their version of the story...Nothing but false hope. Damien is unstoppable if he as you. You're his saving grace if anything were to go wrong. You're much more important to him than you think, Raynee. Do you understand?\" I nodded, looking towards the window and seeing how dark it was. My father sighed. \"It's getting late, Ray. Go back to your dorm and be with Damien.\" I smiled at my father, nodding still. \"Yes, sir. Goodnight, Dad.\" I said before turning away and walking out of his office and back to our room. When I returned to our room, the lights were out and Damien and Mark were already ready for bed. Mark had fallen asleep and Damien was sitting on his bed waiting for me. I smiled, seeing his figure move in the darkness. \"Hey...I'm back.\" I whispered, taking off my uniforms jacket and sitting down next to him. Damien kissed my cheek. \"What did your father say?\" He asked; making sure to stay quiet to not wake Mark. I began to take my clothes off, not wanting to sleep in my uniform of course. I unlaced my shoes and peeled off my socks. \"He took care of my cuts and all that. We also talked about 'us'.\" I sighed, unbuttoning my blouse after I slipped off my skirt. \"You mean the prophecy?\" Damien asked quietly, glancing over at Mark. I nodded, now only in my tank top and boy shorts. I didn't really mind Damien seeing me like this. I knew I'd have to get used to it sooner or later anyways. I laid back onto I and Damien's bed, crawling under the covers as he did the same. He wrapped his arms around me and kissed my forehead. \"Are you alright...?\" He asked, holding me close to him lovingly. I nodded again. \"Yeah. I'm just a bit scared.\" Damien chuckled in reply, leaning down yet again to plant another kiss, this time on my cheek. \"Don't be. No matter what happens, I'll be by your side to protect you.\" I smiled at his words, closing my eyes. \"It's late, Raynee. Let's go to sleep...\" Damien then went silent, holding me in his warm embrace as we fell asleep.[Chapter 10] DAMIEN : OMEN II The Sergeant's Daughter I walked up to the Thorn Industries building next to Damien. We were ahead of all the other cadets in our group. Damien was holding my hand, and all of the boys were staring at us. They would whisper things and laugh. I didn't mind though, I just held onto Damien's hand tighter as we walked around. We were all wearing our black trench-coats, and I looked like a completely different person. Another thing is, we had protective gear on, so my hair was in a ponytail with a Navy Blue lace ribbon. \"You look different with your hair like that!\" Mark said smiling at me. \"Really?\" I said playing with the ribbon. Damien turned and looked at Mark and I. \"She looks more beautiful than before, I think.\" \"Oh, you two are too sweet.\" Mark said laughing. We walked by all sorts of pipes, they were different colors, which made me smile. Damien would explain what they did, and tell me what he thought of this place. \"How do you all like it so far?\" Damien asked as we got into the elevator. The cadets laughed, I did too. I held Damien's hand again as we were in the elevator. Of course, Teddy walked over to us and smiled. \"...You two together?\" He asked us smiling. \"Yes, and it concerns you why?\" I said glaring at him, I could tell my black colored eyes were burning his soul. He walked off and started to talk to the other boys about the news of us being together. The elevator stopped and we walked out. I knew from what Damien told me, we were entering the pesticide room. \"This complex operation is run entirely by three men at the controls of a computer. That's why there's nobody here.\" Our guide explained. \"Isn't there a pesticide that works on sex?\" Teddy asked, smirking at me and Damien. I glared at him and mouthed. \" In. Your. Dreams .\" \"Yes, there is. Sex attractants, they lure the opposite sex into a trap. Then the female kills the male.\" \"Try it on Raynee!\" One cadet shouted. The boys laughed. I blushed fiercely. I turned around abruptly and clenched my fists. I sighed heavily and turned back to Damien. He smiled at me and turned around to the boys. \"Boys...she's mine . Don't try anything stupid.\" Damien said seriously, glaring at them much harsher than I ever could. The cadets all fell silent immediatley. I smiled and wrapped my arm around Damien's tightly. \"I would never kill, you. You always stand up for me.\" I whispered smiling. \"Me either. You're too cute to kill.\" Damien laughed. I leaned my head on his shoulder. We walked out onto a platform above a large area with tons of pipes. It was very loud in there, almost deafening. I held onto Damien tighter, I hated heights. Damien and I walked over to the ledge and stared down at the maze of pipes below us. \"This is a shanting device, it's computerized. Programmed to deliver precise mixes and sollutions from storage vats into the main plant.\" Our guide shouted over the noise. The noise made me want to scream and cover my ears. It felt like they were bleeding! \"Now we are going to move on to the main-\" He was cut short by loud banging sound. I instinctively looked down from where the noise came from and held onto Damien tighter. We both looked down and gasped. One of the pipes was blown . I looked over and one of the men had fallen, he was bleeding profusely. I let go of Damien and stepped far back, not wanting to see the man's dead was panicing and screaming, all except for Damien. He seemed to be unaffected by the toxic air. I tried to find Damien again, so I could stay close to him. \"Damien! Damien !\" I shouted, trying to dodge the other boys who were running into me. I couldn't see him anywhere, then I started to panic. My vision suddenly got very blurry, and I could hardly breathe. The toxins had gotten to me! I started to cry, urgent to find Damien. \"Damien, please !\" I choked out as I fell to the ground. I finally saw Damien. He ran towards me and kneeled by me. He seemed to portray no emotion at all, which shocked me. My vision was getting even worse. The last the I felt and saw was Damien picking me up and carrying me to the safe room.[Chapter 11] DAMIEN : OMEN II The Sergeant's Daughter I sat with Damien and Ann in the living room. We were watching a movie, and Damien and I were both curled up with eachother. We had gotten back from the hospital yesterday morning, and the only good thing about the whole experiance was that Damien and I got to share a bed. Damien had his arms around me, I had my head on his chest. Damien was warm and he felt amazing, his skin always looked cold, but he was always very warm. It was nice just getting to be close to him after what happened a few days ago. I mean, he literally saved my life. I closed my eyes and sighed. Damien began to stroke my hair, I purred slightly. When I realized what I just did, I opened my eyes and blushed. Damien looked at me and smiled. \"Did you just... purr ? Like a kitten?\" Damien asked me, still stroking my hair. \"...Yes.\" I said blushing heavily. I couldn't believe I just purred. Damien laughed. \"That was too adorable, Raynee.\" Ann looked at us and smiled. \"You two sure are close.\" She turned back to the movie. When it ended she sighed contentedly. \"Thank god! A happy ending for a change!\" She said getting up. \"It's so boring.\" Damien said as I sat up. \"You're to young to be so cynical...\" Ann said as she walked off. \"Who want's something to eat?\" I rasied my hand as I walked over to the fireplace. \"I do, too.\" Damien said as he walked over to me. I grabbed a piece of firewood and threw it into the fire. Damien put his arm around me and looked up at him. He smiled at me sweetly, just like always. I kissed his cheek. He kissed me back. Then we heard the door-chime. I rolled my eyes, it honestly killed the mood. \"Come on, let's go see who's here.\" Damien held my hand as we walked to the front doors. We stood infront of them. I opened one of the two 'French Doors'. Charles Warren stood infront of us, he looked insane. And I mean literally. I held onto Damien's hand tighter. \"Hello, Doctor Warren.\" Damien said hesitantly. He glared at Doctor Warren. \"Hello, Damien. Raynee.\" He looked at me, almost fearful. \"Good evening, Doctor Warren.\" I said, trying to smile. Truthfully, I was kind of scared of this man as he appeared currently. \"Is your uncle home?\" Charles asked us, looking inside. \"He's in the family room. Why are you here?\" Damien was very reluctant, and I couldn't blame him. \"It's about the new exibit. Can you please tell him I'm here?\" I smiled at Damien. \"I'll tell him.\" I walked quickly into the family room and found Richard. I walked over to him. \"Richard...Doctor Warren is here to see you. It's about the new exibit.\" \"Alright. I'll be right there.\" Richard walked with me back to the entrance to the house. I stood next to Damien and held his hand. \"Can we please go upstairs?\" I whispered. Damien looked over at Doctor Warren and Richard. \"...Yeah. Let's go in my room.\" Damien and I where laying on his bed. He sighed and I put my arms around him. \"What's wrong?\" I asked him, smiling. \"I just realised something.\" Damien said looking at me worriedly. \"What?\" \"What are we going to do about Mark? I mean, he's going to find out sooner or later.\" Damien sat up and looked down at me. I pulled up the blanket and closed my eyes. \"We'll talk it about it tomorrow. It's late...let's just spend time together. Please?\" I opened my eyes and smiled at Damien. He looked at me for a moment, sighed, then smiled. H elaid down next to me and wrapped his arms around me once more. Again, Damien was warm. I was freezing, so this felt wonderful. \"You're always so warm...it's amazing.\" I laughed and held my arms to my chest. Damien held me tighter. \"Really?\" Damien stroked my hair again. \"Yeah. I love it.\" Damien kissed my forehead gently. I looked up at Damien and pressed my lips against his for the second time. I pulled back and closed my eyes. \"I'll see you in the morning.\" I said as I laid my head back down. \"Alright.\" Damien said sweetly. \"...I love you.\" I smiled and and blushed. Damien said that he loved me. I felt like crying...he sounded so beautiful. \"I...love you too, Damien. Very much.\" As soon as my feezing body became warm, I fell asleep in Damien's arms.[Chapter 12] I awoke the next morning in Damien's room, alone. My body was entangled in his blankets: I struggled to get out of them. The clock on the table next to Damien's bed chimed. It was nine-thirty, and I wondered what Damien was doing up this early. When I slept in his room we usually slept until ten or sometimes even until eleven-forty-five. I sighed and got up from his warm bed. Once my feet touched the cold, hardwood floor, I was met with a jolt of pain. I winced and cried out from the cold, obviously not expecting it. I walked down the stairs quickly towards my room and came near the living room. The cold air from the rest of the house was quickly traveling to the rest of me. I heard Richard and Ann talking about Damien, making me stop dead in my tracks. I stopped in the hallway and listened, staying out of sight. \"Damien is what ?\" I heard Ann say. I inched closer and peaked around the corner edge of the hallway, watching her and Richard. Ann was holding a piece of paper in her hands. She sighed. \"This is crazy...You can't believe this...\" Richard turned to her and shook his head, saying, \"I didn't say I believed him, I'm just telling you what he said to me.\" Ann looked back at the paper and then crumpled it up slowly. \"But, you're thinking of going to New York, doesn't that mean-?\" \"This is damn nonsense!\" Richard interrupted her loudly, making me jump. \"The only thing is, is that Robert was shot in the church whilst he was trying to stab Damien.\" I help in a gasp, backing away. I looked down towards my feet, shocked that they were talking about him in this way. Did they know...? I quickly walked out in the open and walked through the living room, hoping to shut them up about Damien. They did. Ann and Richard looked towards me and put on fake smiles and tried their best to act normal. I smiled back and hid my cautious judgement. \"Oh, Hello, Raynee.\" Richard said, looking at me and walking towards Ann. I stopped, pausing to talk to them. \"Good morning. Do you know by any chance where Damien and Mark are?\"\" I asked, making Ann's eyes quickly look to me, she looked frightened. I kept on smiling. She finally spoke. \"They're outside, dear.\" I nodded, beginning to walk towards my room again, trying to remain calm. \"Alright. Thank you!\" I continued to calmly walk to my room, but when I made it out of their sight, I began to run. My mind was racing. Oh, god! They know! What will I tell Damien? We'll need to call my father and tell him an- I slammed the door to my room and immediately went to my closet, stripping off my nightgown. I pulled out my sweater and a skirt, slipping them on as quickly as I could. I remembered to grab my winter tights as well and painstakingly put them on. After I had changed, I ran back out and to the front door; my breathing was heavy and panicked. I walked right by Ann and Richard again and they didn't notice me at all. I sighed with relief. Before walking out of the house, I put on my brown boots. They looked ridiculous on me: but they kept me warm. My fingers became entangled in the laces and I became frustrated. After a few minutes I managed to finally put them on and I ran out the door, beginning my search for Damien. The snow crunched underneath my boots as I walked. It was freezing outside! I was surprised that Damien wanted to be out here in this weather. I pushed my thoughs aside and continued walking. I was sick with fear. Worried about Damien, as always. I shuddered and pulled my sleeves over my hands, hoping to warm them. I stopped for a moment to readjust my sweater, attempting to become warmer, when I heard footsteps ahead of me. My head shot up immediately and looked towards the direction of the sound. A few feet ahead of me was Damien, walking quite fast. I stood up and sighed with relief; I was glad he was okay. \"Damien!\" I said as I ran after him. \"I was so worried!\" Damien looked back at me and said nothing, making me stop again. He just smiled at me and continued walking into the forest. Something wasn't right. I just stared at Damien as he walked away, ignoring me, until I couldn't see him anymore. Does he know something that I don't? I slowly walked forward, following him. I sincerely hoped he knew I was following him. I'm sure he did know, but you can never be too safe. I tried desprately to silence the snow under my feet but nothing worked. We came up to a large, thick-trunked tree. Damien kept walking and made a large circle around it, then came to an abrupt stop. My instincts told me to stay back a few feet, and I backed up behind another tree a few feet away. Damien sighed and then suddenly began talking. \"Why are you running away from me, Mark?\" He sounded very distressed. My eyes widened, realizing he had found Mark. Damien stood in silence for a moment, and I held my breath. I think the whole 'The prophecy says I'm doomed to be with the Antichrist for eternity ' subject was finally hitting me now. I look at Mark; he was breathing heavily from trying to evade Damien. \"I know who you are.\" He said breathlessly, staring at Damien. Damien's pale lips curled into a smile, sending chills down my spine. \"You do?\" He replied with a hint of sarcasm. Mark nodded quickly. \"Doctor Warren knows. I overheard him talking to Dad.\" My mind switched back into reason at the mention of Doctor Warren. I sighed, shaking my head. I knew, I just knew that he was acting strange last night. I can safely assume now that he was the one that told Richard about the truth. But, maybe by some miracle, Richard thought he was just crazy. \"What did he say?\" Damien suddenly asked, making my train of though come to a halt. Mark swallowed hard before answering him. \"H-He said that...the Devil could create his image on earth-\" \"The Devil ?\" Damien chuckled; his eyes widening in fake shock. \"Well, what else did he say?\" Mark just shook his head desperately with a look of horror in his eyes. It made my heart ache, to say the least. I was half tempted to step out and help. Maybe the oncoming confrontation wouldn't be so bad if they knew I was around. I decided against it, not wanting Damien to worry about me. Damien grew tired of Mark not answering him and narrowed his icy blue eyes. \"Say it, Mark.\" The tone of voice he took made my blood run cold. The demand...the anger and the pure hatred that came from his voice shocked me. Mark sighed, continuing to stare at Damien with the same terrified look. \"He said you're the Beast!\" Mark cried out, causing Damien to become more and more furious. \"Oh, come on! What are you talking about?\" Damien spat, his voice filled with spite. Mark continued to shout at Damien loudly. \"I've seen what you can do! Your father tried to kill you...They said he was crazy, but it was because he knew!\" Mark quickly turned around and ran; he ran to another nearby tree a few feet away and clung to it tightly as he shut his eyes. Damien walked towards him, now with a sad look on his face. This was all too much for me to take. I stayed hidden behind the same tree, watching the two boys I loved more than anything fight. \"I love you, Mark!\" Damien called out as Mark clung to the tree. \"You're like my brother...You are my brother! And you mean more to me tha-\" \"The Beast has no brother! Don't call me your brother!\" Mark screamed, making Damien enraged. \"Listen to me, Mark!\" Damien said in an attempt to calm Mark down. Mark just shook his head, now his fear turned to rage just like his cousins. \" NO! Admit it, you killed your mother!\" Mark said accusingly, glaring at Damien. Wait, what?! When did this happen? I knew Damien's parents had died but-...No, no. It can't be right.. Damien looked hurt by Mark's words and he shook his head. \"She wasn't my mother! I was adopted!\" Mark shook his head back and shouted even louder, now becoming filled with hatred. \"A jackal! You were born of a jackal!\" Damien looked at Mark and sighed, trying to calm himself down. \"Yes...born in the image of the greatest power in the world!\" He began saying pridefully, making my stomach sink. \"The desolate one! Desolate, because his image was taken from him and he was cast down!\" Damien smiled a bit before continuing as he stepped towards Mark. \"But he has risen Mark! In me!\" I was in shock...Utter and complete shock. My heart was raing along with my thoughts; wondering what would happen next. I knew that Damien wouldn't hurt Mark like he had hurt Teddy, or the other incidents. He would't...Would he? Mark stood still, staring wide-eyed at his cousin. Damien stood in front of him now; his lips curled into that same comforting smile. \"Come with me, Mark. I can take you with me!\" Damien suggested, his smile turning into a hopeful grin. \"You and me can rule side by side! I can give you anything you want!\" Mark shook his head. \"No, Damien...\" Mark's voice was cracking slightly like mine does when I cry. Damien looked at him, his face showing heartbreak and betrayal. \"Don't make me beg you, Mark!\" He cried, watching as Mark turned and walked away bravely. \"No, Damien!\" Mark shouted, not looking back at his cousin as he walked. Something snapped in Damien. I could feel it. He narrowed his eyes and stood tensely as snow began to fall. I waited for something terrible to happen. But nothing came. \"Raynee agreed to join me.\" Damien suddenly called out to Mark. My heart dropped. Oh, no, no, no... Mark turned around quickly, hearing my name leave Damien's lips. Mark narrowed his eyes hatefully. \"Don't you dare bring her into this!\" He shouted, walking back to Damien. \"You know I care about her as much as you apparently do! You don't deserve a girl like her!\" Tears began to stream down my cheeks. I covered my mouth in an attempt to silence my crying. I had no idea Mark cared for me so much. I knew though, that this was bad. I knew Damien was the jealous and overprotective type, obviously. I was expecting the worse now; my heart aching at the thought of what would become of the three of us. \"You know, she has no choice, Mark. It's her destiny as well as it is mine.\" Damien smiled darkly and it sent chills down my back. \"That bandage on her hand? She has a birthmark just like mine.\" He paused, looking at Mark's horrified face. \"See, the prophecy says I need a bride...someone to have my children. And it just so happens that Raynee is that bride.\" Damien smiled darkly; his eyes filled with malicious delight. \"Raynee belongs to me.\" Mark stared at Damien silently. \"So...I'll ask you once more, Mark. Please, come with me?\" Damien asked, still smiling. Mark shook his head for the last time, his eyes staying locked with Damien's. Something changed in Damien as I watched with tear filled eyes. Damien began glaring at his cousin and Mark's eyes widened as if he were in pain. Something snapped in me this time and I ran, not caring if I got hurt in the process. \"Damien, stop!\" I screamed, looking at Mark as screamed in pain. \"Damien, please!\" I screamed towards him as Mark cried in pain. Damien stood there, ignoring me, and continued to glare at Mark with hatred. I knew what was happening. I wanted to shut my eyes but I couldn't look away. Through my tears, I looked at Damien. I was horrified: scared he'd kill me too. Yet, I couldn't stop watching. I was somewhat astonished by Damien's powers. I couldn't help but wonder...did I have them too? The snow began to be covered in crimson droplets. Mark was bleeding. Blood poured from his eyes, his mouth, and his nose. I tried so hard to look away; but something seemed to hold me in place. Mark was screaming in pain, the sounds drowned out by his blood. I was hysterical, crying loudly and so hard that I was gagging on my own tears. Damien continued staring at Mark until Mark fell to the ground. He emitted a low gurgling sound, his last breath, I assumed. \" MARK! \" Something snapped in me and I ran over to Mark, kneeling by his side. I scooped his lifeless body in my arms and held him, sobbing violently. Damien remained in front of us and I looked at him through my tears. His eyes seemed to be glowing as he stared down at me. His lips slowly curled into a smile. My eyes widened in fear, and I began to tremble as he walked towards us. \"Raynee...\" Damien began, in a calm voice. \"How much did you see?\" I hesitated for a moment, too scared to speak. I managed to cough out a sentance. \"St-stay back! Don't touch me!\" I held Mark's body tighter, tears dripping onto his head and chest. \"You killed him, Damien! I saw everything!\" Damien's smile twisted into a dark glare again. \"Mark wasn't loyal, Raynee, don't you understand?\" \"He was your cousin, Damien! He loved you...and you loved him...\" I choked back a sob and pressed my forehead to Mark's. \"Even I loved him.\" I could tell that set something off in Damien, like a spark to a fire. I heard him sigh heavily as he walked closer towards me. The snow was crunching loudly under his boots. I looked up at him, gritting my teeth in rage and anquish. \"Murderer...you're a MONSTER!\" I stood up, dropping Mark's carcass and lunging towards Damien. \"I TRUSTED YOU!\" My hands went towards Damien's throat and I took hold. He began to cough and gag and I pushed harder against his throat. Tears were streaming down my face and I squeezed my eyes shut; using all of my strength. I then felt something swipe at my face. Then warmth run down against my cheeks. I pulled back from Damien and put a hand up to my face, and was met with a icy stinging feeling. I looked at my hand and saw blood dripping from it. My eyes went to Damien. His eyes were narrow as he walked towards me as I backed up. I saw the blood underneath his fingernails. I whimpered in fear as Damien began to glare at me, just like he had done to Mark. I shook my head slowly. \"N-no...\" I gasped out, beginning to feel something warm and wet rise in the back of my throat. My eyes widened and I coughed and hurled violently, sending large amounts of blood onto the snow-covered ground. \"Please, d-Damien...God, no...Not now...\" My voice was gurgled and drowned out from the blood and vile I was vomiting up. Damien smiled and came close to me, inches away from my face. His hand reached out and cupped my bloodied chin, forcing me to look at him. My vision was becoming blurry...I could hardly breathe. \"Perhaps you're right, Raynee...I am a monster. I guess you really can't trust me.\" My eyes widened as I felt Damien press his lips agaisnt my blood soaked cheek. My vision failed and everything went black at that moment, sending me backwards into the snow as I heard him whisper to me- \" You're mine, Raynee Neff ... No matter what, you will always be mine... \"[Chapter 13] DAMIEN : OMEN II The Sergeant's Daughter I sat in my room that night, terrified of what happened. I couldn't believe it... The boy I'm in love with...is a murderer ! I got up from my bed and walked over to the window. The snow was barely falling, and you could hardly see it in the night sky. I smiled. I hadn't smiled in what felt like months. Everytime I would look at my hand, the memories would come back. I walked over to my door and went outside, I needed to get out of this house. I walked down to the back of the house. I saw Ann was on the phone with somebody, and Richard was sitting on the couch. I couldn't help but think this was all my fault and I walked away quickly to the garden. I stepped into the snow, without any shoes on. It made me jump. I hadn't realised it was that cold. As I walked around the garden, I sighed heavily. I didn't know why I felt relieved, everything was still the same. I'm still an apostate, Damien's still the Antichrist, and Mark's dead. I felt tears form in my eyes again. And to make everything worse, I heard someone behind me. I knew who it was before I even turned around. \"Raynee?\" I turned around and saw Damien standing inches away from me. I screamed slightly and backed away, hitting a tree. \"D-Damien!\" I said as my back hit the tree's trunk. \"How long have you been there?!\" I was afraid for my life, honestly. I knew Damien would never kill me...but he killed Mark. That says almost too much. \"Long enough...\" He walked closer to me and I did what I could only think of . Run. I ran into the house and passed Richard and Ann. \"What's wrong?\" Ann asked me as I ran down the hall. I didn't even answer her, I just needed to get away from Damien. I ran to my room and slammed the door shut, locking it. And, sure enough, Damien ran up to my door and pounded on it. \"Raynee, you can't stay away from me forever...!\" Damien sighed and leaned up against the door. I had my head against the door, listening. \"Yes I can!\" I said, tears starting to fall down my face. \"Ray, please... please, can we just talk? I promise I won't hurt you.\" I stood silent for a minute, wondering if I should open the door. My concious, once again, got the best of me. Istill trusted Damien, or at least a small part of me did. I unlocked the door cautiously, then opened it. I held my breath. I feared Damien would kill me, to say the least. But he didn't. Damien smiled at me and walked into my room. He sat down on my bed and motion for me to sit next to him. I shook my head slowly. Damien sighed. \"Raynee, I'm not going to hurt you, love.\" I looked at him warily. \"...Promise?\" I asked, sounding like a small child. Damien smiled at me sweeter than before and I had to give in. I sat down next to him, still fearful. Damien looked at me and put his hand on my thigh. I finched, but he kept his hand there. \"Raynee...please just listen to me. I know what I did was wrong. I don't know if you'll still believe me when I say this, but I do still love you like my own sister. More than that, truthfully.\" Damien looked down, and I could tell he had tears in his eyes. \"I'm still me , not just 'The Beast'. I'm still Damien Thorn, not just the Devil's son... and I don't care what the bible says...I have a heart, Raynee! I can feel love!\" I felt tears in my eyes, now. They dripped down my face and onto my hands. \"What I'm saying is true... I love you as my own wife !\" Damien abruptly wrapped his arms around me. \" I stil love you... even if you don't I always will.\" I practically felt myself break and shatter into thousands of pieces. I laid my head down on his shoulder and returned the embrace. \"Of course I still love you...\" I sobbed. \"I always will, no matter what. That's what I said the first day we got into this mess.\" Damien held me tighter. \"And I still mean it...\"[Chapter 14] DAMIEN : OMEN II The Sergeant's Daughter Damien and I stood next to eachother at Mark's funeral. I was clinging onto Damien. While the preacher was talking about Jesus and God, I stood there digging my nails into my wrists. What I didn't understand, is how Damien wasn't doing the same thing. I mean, he is the antichrist, right? I drew blood after a few minutes of clawing and gasped at the sudden pain, causing Damien to look at me. He saw the blood on my arm. \"What happened?\" He whispered, taking my arm in his hand. My blood ran onto his finger. \"I'll tell you later...don't worry. It doesn't hurt.\" I said turning back to Mark's casket. The sermon was short, thank god. When it was over I walked over to my father. \"How is everything, Ray?\" He asked me. I could totally understand why my father was worried about me. I was after all a vehicle to Satan's will. \"Fine.\" I said, smiling faintly. \"How is Damien?\" My father asked next. I was confused, wondering why he cared about Damien. \"Is he treating you well?\" \"Of course, dad. Why are you asking me these questions?\" I was actually surprised he hadn't noticed the blood dripping down my arm. \"I'm just wondering if the prophecy is falling into place correctly...\" My dad looked over at the cadets and sighed. \"I'll see you at the ceremony, Ray.\" He kissed my forehead and walked off. I stood there for a few seconds, watching my father walk away. I turned around, only to see Damien standing behind me. I gasped and he smiled. \"What did he say?\" Damien said, still smiling. \"Oh, he just asked me questions regarding you and your 'destiny'...\" I said as we walked to our car. \"Really?\" Damien asked, he grabbed my arm and put it around his waist. \"Wait...you'll get blood on your coat!\" I said pulling my arm away. Too late, the blood was smeared. I sighed. \"Well, it's your blood isn't it?\" Damien said looking at the bloodstain on his coat. I sighed again. \"Yes, but it's your jacket!\" I sounded like a housewife, honestly. \"It's your blood, so I don't care. If anybody asks, I'll tell the truth...you were bleeding and I helped you.\" Damien's smile returned. I laughed. \"Whatever, but blood stains .\" I warned as we got into our car and Damien crawled in next to me. I sat in the car with Damien as we drove to the airport. Richard was going to fly to New York to see Doctor Warren. Charles had gone paranoid fro what I overheard, and I'm glad we all weren't going. I looked out the window at the night sky and then at Damien. He looked over at me and smiled comfortingly. I undid my seatbelt and crawled closer to him. \"Damien, I'm so scared.\" I whipsered, placing my hand on his knee. \"Why?\" He said, pulling me closer to him. \"What's going to become of this family?\" I asked, feeling my voice shake. Damien smiled again and out his arms around me. \"I'm not sure, Ray. As long as I'm here, you'll be safe.\" He kissed my forehead and held me tighter. We arrived at the airport. Richard and Ann got out first. Me next, then Damien. Damien and I stood at the front of the car, watching Ann and Richard. I inched closer to Damien and he out his arm around me. And, again, he was warm. I wasn't paying attention to what Richard and Ann were saying. I just wanted to be with Damien. Ann walked back to the car as Richard's plane departed. She sighed and got in the car. I looked at Damien. As we got into the car, Damien sighed. \"Are you alright?\" He asked, sitting next to me. A bit closer than usual. \"Yeah...I'm fine.\" \"You were acting normal at the funeral. What happened?\" Damien seemed to be genuinely worried about me right now. \"Nothing. I just think that this whole 'destiny' thing is finally making sense to me.\" I whispered. \"Well, at least you get to be with me.\" Damien laughed. \"Yeah.\" I said looking out of the window at the sky again. \"Is there anything you need me to do?\" I looked at Damien, and I saw the Damien I knew. Not just the Antichrist, or the Beast. I looked into his blue eyes, they were so beautiful. They didn't go with his apperance, but they seemed to grab me. \"No. I just want to be in my room, alone. But with you.\" \"What is that supposed to mean?\" Damien smirked. \"Nothing! Don't think like that!\" I said laughing. Damien smiled at me and put his arm around me, pulling me close. \"You don't ask, You never know.\"[Chapter 15] DAMIEN : OMEN II The Sergeant's Daughter I sat in the living room with Ann the next day, helping her sew my dress for the dance tommorow. My father had given it to me at school earlier and it needed another color besides white. We had been sewing for two hours straight, and it was already nearly dark outside. \"Where's Damien? I haven't seen him since school...\" I said sewing the sash to my skirt. Ann looked up and put her needle down. \"Oh, I forgot to tell you. He wants to see you at the lake at seven.\" She continued sewing as she spoke. \"Is it still frozen?\" Ann paused for a moment before answering me. \"...I think so.\" I looked at the clock. It was six-fifty-seven. \"What a coincidence...it's three minutes 'till.\" I said getting up. I walked towards the hall, but turned to Ann. \"Thank you so much for helping me with my dress. It's nice to have a motherly figure around.\" I smiled. Ann smiled back. \"I'd do it anytime, Raynee. And it's lovely having a 'daughter' around.\" She went back to sewing and I walked to my bedroom to get my boots. I entered my room and shut the door. I walked toward the window and looked out to the garden, most of the flowers were dried up and brown. I sighed. My winter boots were laying on my bed, and I'm pretty sure Damien put them there. I smiled and picked them up. I noticed it was nearly dark outside. I wanted to know why Damien was out there at night at night. It may be he was just out there waiting for me, I don't know. I put on my coat and walked out. I went to back of the house, where the lake was. It was actually a few minutes away and I could usually get there in a few minutes if I walked. I opened the back doors and felt the cold air brush up against me. I smiled and walked out near the forest. I began to head into the wooded area that hid the lake. I had to really watch out for hanging branches, and I actually had hit and scraped my arms a few times before. When I got to the lake, finally, I immediately caught sight of Damien sitting on the ice. I walked up to him and put my arms around Damien's neck. He jumped slightly and turned to face me. \"Relax, it's only me...\" I laughed and sat down next to him. \"You wanted to see me?\" \"Hey.\" Damien smiled at me and kissed my cheek. \"Yeah, I wanted to know when you were going back with your father.\" I sighed. \"Oh. I'm not sure, I'm going to ask him tommorow at the dance.\" Damien put his head on my shoulder. \"I'm going to miss you when you leave...\" I could hear the sadness in his voice. \"Well, my dad is the person who told us about our destiny. And he said I have to 'stay by your side and protect you'...I think.\" I smiled at Damien and held his hand. \"It'll be okay.\" Damien stood up and walked toward the lake. \"I hope so.\" I stood up and walked over to him. \"Do you want to practice dancing?\" Damien asked, he looked back at me and smiled. \"Sure.\" I said smiling Damien took my hand and we walked out onto the ice. It could be dangerous, but I really don't see what the differernce is between skating on ice and walking on ice. Damien put his hand on my waist and I had my hand on his neck. And, of course, he was warm as always. Damien held my hand and we started to waltz very slowly. \"You're pretty good at this...\" Damien said. I laughed. \"Well, I'm new to this.\" Damien smiled and I put my head on his shoulder. I sighed contentedly and we continued waltzing on the ice. \"Why does it feel like we're a married couple?\" I asked, smirking. I could just feel Damien smirk back. \"Because in a way, we are ...\"[Chapter 16] DAMIEN : OMEN II The Sergeant's Daughter It was graduation day, finally. I was standing by my father wearing my uniform like the other boys. We were handing out awards to the cadets. And even though I was a student, I wouldn't qualify because I was there for a short time and I was a Sergeant's daughter. \"The award we will be giving out now, goes to the cadet who best exemplifies. the spirit and pride of our academy. This year, the title will be given to Cadet Sergeant Damien Thorn.\" Damien walked up to my father and I. He saluted my father, and my father handed Damien the Officer's Saber. \"Congratulations, Damien.\" He said smiling faintly. I looked at my father and he smiled at me. I took that as I sign that I had permission to hug Damien. I stepped foward to Damien and took him into my arms. I could tell everybody in the entire school was watching us, probably waiting for us to kiss or something. Everybody knew Damien and I were together, after all. I pulled away from after a few seconds Damien and smiled at him. And I did what everybody was expecting. I kissed Damien. Infront of the whole school and my father, to make it worse. \"You're so cute in uniform.\" I whispered as quietly as I could when I broke the short kiss. Damien smiled and looked at my father, he saluted him. My father returned the action and Damien walked back into formation. We began handing out awards to the rest of the cadets. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Ann and Paul talking. Ann stood up and walked out from the building. Damien looked at her, than me. I gave him a look as if to say 'I don't know either'. Damien looked foward again and I continued to stare at him. I could tell Damien was still very confused about the whole 'Antichrist' thing. I'm guessing that's where I come in, even though Paul is an apostle as well. I knew the minute I saw him at Mark's birthday he was one of us. Even so, he's not as important as an apostate, which is what I am. We're both protectors, though. I enjoy considering myself as Damien's companion and in a way, his servant. Damien glanced at me quickly and smiled. His eyes seemed to be sparkling and it made me melt. I smiled back at him and thought about what we'd be doing at the dance in a few hours. I sat on the couch in the academy's parlor at the cotillion. So far, I had seen alot of the girls from my old school. All of the girls just looked at me fearfully as they passed by. I would smile at them and they would walk away, very quickly. They were either scared of me, or they were jealous I was constantly being the center of attention with all the boys. I finally saw Damien walk in from the graduation ceremony and three girls were talking to him. I smiled, almost sarcasticly, and walked over to Damien. The girls immediately looked at me like they claimed Damien for themselves. \"Hello, Damien.\" I said, still smiling. Damien smiled at me and broke away from the hoarde of girls. \"Oh, Hi Raynee.\" The girls looked at Damien, then me. \"You know her?\" The blonde one asked. Damien took my by the arm and pulled me close. \"Of course,\" He kissed my cheek and I blushed. \"She is my girlfriend afterall.\" The girls' faces paled. \"Oh\" The brunette one said next. My smile only grew. They glared at me slightly as I looked up at Damien. \"Let's go dance, I want to be spun around.\" Damien smiled and took my hand in his. \"It was lovely meeting you girls...\" He said as we walked away to the ballroom. I looked back at the group of girls as Damien and I walked away. They were all whispering things and glaring at me, probably saying things like, \"He choose her ?\" or \"Creepy girl, he can do better...\". The only defense I could think of in respone? They have no idea who we really are! I smiled at the group of girls and laughed quietly to myself. Damien looked at me. \"What?\" He asked, his smile returning. I shook my head and sighed. \"Those girls are so jealous...\" Damien laughed. \"You saved me back there. They just came up to me,\" Damien cringed. \"But, you're all I need.\" I kissed his cheek and turned so I was standing infront of him. \"So...are we going to dance?\" \"Just like we practiced...\" Damien pulled me close and put his arms around my waist. I smiled up at him and instinctively put my hands on his shoulders. Even if he was five inches taller than me, we fit perfectly together. \"So how was the rest of the ceremony? I missed the end, I had to put on my dress and shoes.\" I said putting my head on Damien's shoulder. \"It was fine, I got two more awards. Why did Ann just get up and leave?\" Damien sounded hurt. I closed my eyes as I answered him. \"I don't know. Maybe an emergency?\" \"She probably would've come and gotten me. Oh, that reminds me, Are you staying with me or going back to your dad?\" I sighed and looked back up at Damien. \"I'll ask him later...\" Damien smiled at me and I laid my head back down on his shoulder as we continued to dance.[Chapter 17] DAMIEN : OMEN II The Sergeant's Daughter Damien and I sat down after we danced for what felt like forever. I caught sight of my father walking towards us after a few minutes, and I got up. \"I'm going to go talk to my father...I'll be right back.\" I said, smiling. Damien smiled back up at me and laughed. \"Good luck.\" I leaned down and kissed his forehead gently, then walked off to my father. When he saw me he sighed. I sighed and realized what he was going to say. \"Hello, Ray.\" He said quietly. \"Dad, Look, I wanted to talk to you about something...\" I began saying. My father stopped me mid-sentance, he put his hand on my shoulder. \"I know.\" My dad smiled \"Raynee, you know I love you very much...\" I immediately knew what my fate was. \"Yes. Why?\" I sat down on one of the many sofas near us. My father remained standing. \"And you know the prophecy says the follower's daughter, the apostate, must stay near the antichrist to serve and protect him...\" I nodded slowly, fearful. \"I think it would be best if you stayed with Damien. The prophecy is almost complete, just stay the night with him tonight. Trust me, something's going to happen...\" My dad said looking towards Damien. I paused. \"How do you know?\" My dad looked back at me and sighed. \"Prophecy. Says the sacrifice will be made, when the two are made one.\" I looked at Damien now. \"Oh...\" I said, obviously confused. My dad hugged me and kissed my forehead. \"Know matter what happens, I'll be here for you. If anything happens, you come to me. Okay?\" I nodded. \"I love you, Dad\" I said on the edge of tears. \"You too, Raynee.\" He pulled back to look at me, he smiled. \"Go back to Damien...He needs you now more than ever.\" I smiled, as hard as it was. I knew I'd see my father again. I just didn't know when and where. My father walked back over to a group of people and looked back at me lovingly. I waved and walked back to Damien. Damien was still sitting on the sofa, waiting for me. I stood infront of him and he looked up at me. \"What did he say?\" Damien asked me, smiling. \"I think I get to live with you.\" I sat down and held my hands together. I burried my face in Damien's shoulder and he held me close. \"I don't know when I'm going to see him again...\" Damien smiled and held me tighter. \"Well...did he say anything about the prophecy?\" I looked back up and stared at Damien. \"He said a sacrifice will be made when the two become one. I don't know what it means...we're not married..\" I blushed. \" Yet . We're not married yet.\" Damien smirked. My blush intensified. \"Oh..yeah. Right.\" I laughed. Damien inched closer to me. \"What does it mean by 'make a sacrifice'?\" Damien looked at me, worriedly from what I could tell. I shook my head. \"I...don't know.\" I got up and turned to face Damien. \"I guess we could dance some more...when are we getting picked up?\" Damien stood up after me and held both my hands. \"I'm not sure...probably around nine.\" I looked up at him and just remained silent. I'm sure Damien could sense something was wrong with me. \"What is it?\" He asked, pulling me closer to him by my waist. I blinked. \"...Nothing.\" Damien just sighed. \"Try not to think about it, when the time comes we'll deal with it...\" Damien smiled and it gave me comfort and fear. \"Alright...\" I looked up at the clock as Damien and I sat down on the couch once more. \"It's eight-fourty...where is Paul?\" I said sitting next to Damien and putting my head on his shoulder. He laughed and wrapped his arm around my shoulder, pulling me close. \"I don't know.\" He replied smiling. I smiled back and looked at the many boys and girls in the ballroom. I laughed to myself. \"Do you think any of those couples are as close as we are?\" I looked up at Damien. He shook his head. \"Not even close...we're closer to a married couple than just a dating one.\" I could see the blush comming to his face. I grinned. \"You love saying that, don't you Damien?\" Damien blushed harder. \"Saying what?\" \"That we're married!\" I laughed. Damien held my hand and I sighed contentedly. \"Well...I guess you could say that.\" \"I knew it.\" I said smirking. Damien glanced over his shoulder and looked at me. \"I think Paul is here.\" He said letting go of my hand. Damien stood up and I followed suit. We walked over to my father holding hands, of course. My father smiled at us. We smiled back. \"Good...the prophecy is comming true.\" He said, still smiling. Damien and I looked at eachother. Damien stepped closer to me and put his arm around my waist. \"Raynee, you have to stay with Damien at all times. Damien, try to stay close to her...you two need eachother. Protect eachother. Love eachother. Be there for eachother.\" \"We will, Sergeant.\" Damien said holding me tighter. My father smiled and looked at me. \"Raynee, if anything happens you find the nearest phone and call me. Understand?\" I nodded. \"I will.\" \"I told Raynee what was supposed to happen tonight...Damien did she tell you?\" \"Yes, Sergeant. 'A sacrifice will be made when the two are made one.'\" I looked at my dad worriedly. \"But, Dad, it doesn't make sense. Damien and I aren't married yet. We're too young...\" My father looked at both of us and smiled. \"It will happen very soon...sooner than you two think.\" He glanced back at the many cadets at the party. \"I have to get back to the cotillion...I'll see you two next school year. I love you, Raynee.\" My father said as he walked back to the cotillion. \"I love you too, Dad.\" Damien sighed, shaking his head. \"Sooner than we think, huh?\" He grabbed his uniform hat and I grabbed my uniform. I smiled. \"Is that good?\" Damien smiled back. \"Of course it is.\" I looked at my dress, then my uniform. \"Should I change into my uniform before we go?\" Damien paused. \"...I think you should. What if we have to run from something, and you mess up your dress...or fall?\" I laughed. \"Yeah, I probably should...\" I kissed Damien and began to walk to our dorm. \"Do you need anything from the dorm?\" Damien shook his head. \"I think I got everything.\" I smiled. \"Alright, I'll be right back...\"[Chapter 18] DAMIEN : OMEN II The Sergeant's Daughter I walked back out to the cotillion, holding my ballgown and shoes...Only to find Damien staring at me. He smiled as I walked up to him. \"Okay, do we have everything we need?\" I asked looking towards the dorms again. \"I think so.\" Damien put his arm around me and I nuzzled against his neck, smiling. We both walked out onto the school's main entrance and I shuddered heavily. I was freezing outside! Even in my full uniform! Damien looked at me and I shuddered again. \"What's wrong?\" He asked me, holding me close. \"It's f-freezing out here...\" I said holding my arms closer to my chest, trying in vain to warm myself. Damien paused and we both stopped walking. He took off his coat and put it around me. \"Here..you'll get sick..\" Damien smiled at me and we resumed walking down the stairs. Damien and I finally made it to the car and Murray and Paul were waiting for us. \"Did you two have fun?\" Paul asked us as we got in the car's backseat. Damien smiled at him. \"Of course we did...\" He said looking at me. I grinned at Paul. \"We danced for hours...\" I said laying my head in Damien's lap. He looked down at me and stroked my hair gently. I closed my eyes and sighed contendedly, nearly purring again. \"I can't wait to go home and lay in my bed...\" \"Oh, that reminds me...\" Paul began saying, making me sit up. \"Richard wanted to see you Damien. We're going to the museam before we go to the estate.\" I groaned and rolled my eyes, falling back into Damien's lap. He laughed. \"You can stay in the car and sleep if you want to.\" He said as I turned over on my side, becoming more tired as we drove to the museam. \"No, if he wants to see you...he probably wants to see me.\" I opened my eyes and looked into Damien's cobalt blue ones. He just half-smiled at me and I held his jacket around me tighter, closing my eyes. \"Wake me up when we get there.\" I whispered. Damien chuckled and began to stroke my hair again as I fell asleep in his arms. I felt the car stop and Damien hold me in place, to keep from falling out of the seat. \"We're here...\" He said as I sat up, fixing my hair. I blinked a few times and Damien put on his coat. Murray came around and opened our door. Damien got out, then turned to me. \"Stay in here, I'm not letting anything happen to you...\" He said he was begining to walk away. \" No ! I'm comming with you!\" I said getting out and grabbing our hats. Damien turned around and looked at me, concerned. \"Raynee...\" He breathed. I stood up and walked next to Damien. \"Please, Damien. Nothing will happen, I'll stay with you...\" I smiled and Damien smiled back, faintly. I held his hand close to me, his fingertips barely touching my cheek. His smile softened. \"Fine. Just stay near me.\" I took Damien's arm in mine and we walked up the endless steps into the museam, slowly. I looked ahead, thinking. \"What do you think Richard wants to see us about?\" I said, still looking up ahead. Damien thought for a moment. \"I don't know...I'm personally more worried about the whole destiny thing.\" I sighed. \"Sacrifice?\" Damien pulled me up the steps faster, his pace increasing. \"Yes. The 'sacrifice' will be made when we are 'made one'... but I don't get it!\" We stopped halfway at the steps and Damien pulled me over to him. \"We're not married, and we're too young to be engaged...what does it mean?\" I sighed. \"I don't know...maybe we'll just-\" I shook my head, unsure what to say. I began walking up the steps again and Damien followed me. \"Are you scared?\" I asked, genuinely worried now. Damien just nodded and looked at me as if to say 'What if it's you?!'. I understood him perfectly, as usual. \"It won't be me, love. I'm the follower's daughter...I have to give you a child. I can't die, Damien...\" I held his hand again and we walked into the museam. It was way too quiet. Damien looked around and we heard a sound. A pounding sound, and it was loud. I looked at Damien and wrapped my arms around his waist like a small child would do to it's mother. \"Where did that come from?\" I asked, looking towards the sound's direction. \"Basement.\" Damien said, seriously. His attitude totally changed and I was a bit taken back. \"Come on, we're going...\" He pulled me over to one of the exhibits, containing various pottery and alike, and back to the basement windows and doors. I looked into one of the doors and saw Ann standing infront of a desk, blocking it. \"I won't let you.\" I read her lips and I just continued staring at her. \"Raynee!\" I heard Damien call me. I looked up at him and he motioned for me to stand next to him. \"You can hear them over here!\" I walked over to him, quickly and looking towards the small window. Richard came into view and he was holding a crowbar. I gasped and Damien put his arm around me. \"Is he is going to kill her?!\" I said as quietly as I could, despite my utter shock and fear. \"I don't know...\" Damien looked at me and then back to the basement. I followed suit, staring at the once perfect couple. \"I've got to Ann! They're here-\" Richard tried to push her away, but she fought back. \"He's your brother's son! The boy you'ved loved for seven years! And Raynee is someone's child!\" Ann started to have tears running down her face. \"They aren't human, Ann!\" Richard pushed her aside and pried the door open. He tried to grab the daggers, but Ann interfered once more. She pushed the drawer back, closing it. \"They are children !\" \"Ann! Get away from that drawer!\" Richard shouted. \"I'm not going to let you! Think about this Richard!\" I looked away, feeling the tears start to sting my eyes. Realisation hit me. I stared at Damien, clasping my hands over my mouth, trying to drown out my sobs. Damien abruptly pulled me close to him, embracing me. I could feel his tears hitting my shoulders, making me sob harder. \"Shhh...\" He whispered quietly. \"Don't cry...don't cry.\" I just cried harder, and I couldn't stop.[Chapter 19] DAMIEN : OMEN II The Sergeant's Daughter I cried harder and harder. Damien pulled away from me and looked at me. I noticed he was trembling violently. I stared at him and put my hands on his shoulders. \"...Why are you shuddering?\" I managed to choke out between my sobs. Damien smiled very faintly. \"I hate seeing you like this...\" I had to smile when I heard Damien said that. That's when I realized that Damien would never let anything happen to me, he's the Antichrist right? I had stopped crying, but tears still fell down my face. I smiled up at Damien and kissed him. He blushed, as usual. Damien looked down into the basement again, and I just burried my face in his shoulder. I didn't want to start crying again. But, I gave in and had to look. \"Ann,\" Richard said seriously. I had never heard him speak like that before. \"Give-them-to-me...\" He commanded. Ann stared at RIchard for a moment, hesitating. She finally turned to the drawer and pulled out three of the daggers. I watched, keeping my eyes on the daggers. Ann turned back to Richard and hesitated. Richard stared at her. He held out his hands for the cluster of daggers. And with one swift move, she drove the daggers into his chest. Richard screamed and Ann leaned over and whispered in his ear. \" There are you're daggers ...\" Richard just looked at his wife and she smiled. She had changed from what she used to be. \"I have always belonged to him ...\" I screamed. Damien just watched his aunt in total shock and anger. He turned to me and put his arms around me, protectively again. I held onto him, like I was holding on for my life. In a way... I was. I looked back down to the basement, and Ann had driven all seven daggers into Richard at this time. He fell to the floor, blood commming from his mouth. The blades went deeper into his chest as he hit the floor, making a sickening cracking noise. I cringed and closed my eyes, holding onto Damien tighter. I heard Ann scream at the top of her lungs. \"DAMIEN!\" I opened my eyes and stared at the daggers in Richard's chest. I thought for a moment. Damien took notice immediately. He looked at them too. \"What is it?\" He asked me as I pulled away from him and walked over to the doors to the basement. \"Raynee! What are you doing?!\" I looked at Damien, with a smile on my face. \"We need those daggers...\" I opened the doors to the basement, and I heard Damien shouting my name. For once in my life, I ignored him. My instincts told me to get the daggers and run. I took off my shoes before entering the office in the basement, so I was now barefoot. I walked lightly over to Richard's carcass, keeping an eye on Ann. She was far too distracted to notice me, right? Her eyes were open in sometype of demonic trance, staring up at the heavens and still screaming Damien's name over and over again. I kneeled by Richard's carcass and carefully extracted one dagger at a time. Thye were in there deep, and everytime I pulled one out I was met with a cracking noise and a splatter off blood on my hands. I cringed and placed the four daggers beside me. Only three more to go. As I was pulling out the daggers, I heard footsteps. I looked behind me and saw Ann standing over me, her face contorted and evil now. \"Hello, Raynee...\" She spoke trance like. I smiled as believable as I could. \"h-Hello, Ann...\" I said as I placed another dagger beside me. Ann looked at the blood-dripping pile of daggers beside my leg. Then she looked back to me. \"What are you doing?\" She asked me. I glanced at her from over my shoulder, turning back to pull out the two more daggers. \"Getting the daggers...I'm not letting Damien get hurt.\" I extracted one dagger and placed it on my lap, just incase. I heard Ann step closer to me. I tensed up and wrapped my fingers around the last remaining dagger, pulling it out slowly with a disgusting sound. I stood up, my back facing Ann, and I kneeled once more to pick up the daggers. I only counted six. Wait. How is this possible...I counted seven. I pulled out seven! I saw seve- That's when I felt it.[Chapter 20] DAMIEN : OMEN II The Sergeant's Daughter Oh God...this isn't right! How could she-? I felt something being pulled out of my arm with the same sickening sound. I felt my face pale as I let out a shuddered gasp. I looked over to my shoulder, a few tears falling down my face. I put my hand there and sobbed. When I pulled my hand back, it was warm and red. There was a large wound near my shoulder, leaking blood profusely. It's blood. MY blood! The red liquid was seeping through the sleeve of my blouse and uniform jacket. I spun around to face Ann. She had a wicked grin on her face, and was holding one of the daggers. It was dripping with my blood. I looked over to the basement door and wiped the blood off of my hands, grabbing one of the daggers. I stood up and approached Ann, my arm in searing pain. For God's sake...I had just been stabbed! \"You...bitch!\" I said, running towards her and raising the dagger as high as I could. Ann laughed and ran towards me, we were going to fight over Damien. But I was fighting for Damien! Ann and I collided hardly, the force nearly sending me backwards. No matter how much pain I was in, I continued to fight. My dagger clashed with Ann's, blood drops splattering onto my face. I pushed harder on my dagger, making Ann's hands shake violently. I grinned and finally managed to knock the dagger out of her hand. She attempted to pick it up, but I plunged my dagger into her shoulder. Ann screamed, grabbing her wound. I took the chance and grabbed the two daggers at my feet, running to pick up the last five. I cringed in pain everytime I moved. I picked up all seven daggers and walked up the basement stairs as fast as I could. I made it halfway up the stairs and Damien was already running down the staircase to my side. I looked at him emotionlessly. It was really disturbing how calm I was, honestly. \"Raynee?!\" He said as I ran to him. \"Are you okay?\" \"It's not that deep...don't worry, I'm fine.\" I said as I sat the daggers down. I began to unwrap the bandage around my hand. Damien stared at my shoulder and then to the basement window. \"Stand back...\" He said darkly. I stepped back towards the exhibit halls and kneeled down. I took off my uniform jacket and began to wrap my bandage around my shoulder. The blood was seeping through my blouse and running down my arms. I looked over to Damien and saw he was standing by the basement window, staring down at Ann. She was screaming his name over and over again. \"Damien!... Damien ! DAMIEN !\" Ann sounded possesed, or different to who I thought she was. Damien glared down at her, that's when I heard the banging sound. Damien smiled very faintly and turned to face me. He ran over to my side and helped me stand up. \"We have to go.\" Damien said as he pulled me over to him. Damien picked up the daggers and we began to walk to the commons area near the front of the museam. As we walked, Damien and I began to run to the lobby. I could hear Ann still screaming Damien's name at the top of her lungs. Then she stopped. The museam's alarm system had began to sound, and I looked at Damien. \"What did you do?\" I said, yelling over the deafining clanging of the alarms. Damien just remained silent and looked at me. I felt my face pale. I glanced over my shoulder. I saw the flames and I knew Ann was dead. I turned back as we stopped infront of the museam doors. I looked to Damien and I couldn't help but smile at him. \"So, Ann was the sacrifice?\" I shook my head, mockingly. Damien looked at me and smiled back. \"I guess so.\" We both scoffed, but Damien paused. He looked back towards the basement and the stairs. Damien seemed to have sorrow in his eyes, I knew what was wrong. I took notice immediately and put my hand on his cheek. \"It's okay...they're not your real family. I am .\" I smiled warmly and Damien smiled back, he had tears in his eyes. I looked outside to the Chicago streets and put on my jacket. \"We'd better go before it get's worse.\" I said as Damien put his hat on. I held mine in my hand and made sure I didn't have blood visable on my shoulder. I didn't want anybody knowing I was injured. It wasn't even as bad as people would think a stab wound would be. Damien smiled at me and took my hand in his. He opened the doors and we walked out into the night. Stretchted before us was Chicago. The city's lights were still glowing brightly and the sky was clear. I could see the moon and it was perfectly full. Far off from us we heard the fire engines comming to fight the blaze that burned below us. Too late. I looked at Damien emotionlessly. We both looked down at our car, perfectly synched like twins. Murray stepped out and looked up at us standing at the top of the stairs. Damien pulled me close to him and stared at me. I raised an eybrow at him. \"Are you okay?\" He said to me. I smiled. \"I'm fine.\" Damien just held me tighter. He leaned foward and pressed his lips against mine. It was the most wonderful feeling in the world. I felt myself blush despite my condition. When Damien pulled back I glaned down at Murray, and saw that Paul was in the car waiting for us. \"Paul is waiting for us...\" I said, turning to face the city. Damien laughed. \"Ready for destiny to begin?\" I shrugged. \"Depends...\" I smirked and Damien and he held my hand as we began to trot down the stairs. I put my hat on and looked back towards the museam. When we made it to the car, Damien opened the door and we got inside next to Paul. He smiled at us. \"Has it been done?\" He asked. Damien smirked. \"Yes.\" I giggled and laid my head down in Damien's lap. Damien started to stroke my hair like he always does. Paul smiled at the image of us like this. As we began to drive off to our winter home Paul sighed contentedly. He only asked us one question that made me uneasy but gave me hope. \"Are you two ready for the marriage?\" I opened my eyes and laughed. I looked up at Damien. He was staring at the museam behind us, the flames sending eerie reflections on his face. Damien then looked down at me. And he smiled.[Chapter 21] DAMIEN : OMEN II The Sergeant's Daughter I woke up the next morning back in my room at the winter apartment. I knew this because of the bright coral-pink walls I wake up to every morning. I noticed I was wrapped in my fleece blanket tightly, and my arm stung evertime I attempted to move. Altough, I wasn't completely under my bedspread. It was still neatly made and I was just laying ontop of my comforter. I figured I just laid down and went to sleep. Then I remembered the events of last night. I had been stabbed. I looked at the clock on my table and sighed. It was only nine forty-two. I then shifted my gaze to the window, I stared at the snow falling onto the ground. It looked freezing outside, and I was glad I was in here where it's warm. The snow was so beautiful though. It was the same color as Damien's skin. I blinked a few times, turning over on my back. I was met with a burning pain from my wound. When I looked up to my ceiling, I saw Damien was sitting up in my bed looking at me. He was still wearing his uniform, but without his jacket or tie. Had he been watching me this whole time? Damien smiled. \"Good morning, Raynee. Did you sleep well?\" \"What are you doing up so early...?\" I asked him, my voice was strained. Probably from all the crying from last night. Damien just continued to smile at me. \"I stayed up all night.\" I laid my head back down on my pillow and stared up at him. \"Why?\" \"I wanted to make sure you were okay...I was worried.\" Damien put his hand on my head and caressed my hair gently. I inched closer to him, still wrapped tightly in my blanket. He sighed contentedly and I closed my eyes. \"How is your...wound?\" Damien asked next. I could tell he was timid to ask about it. I opened my eyes and looked over to my shoulder, sitting up in bed. \"I don't know.\" When I looked over to my shoulder, I finally noticed I was still in my uniform as well. I guess I was so tired I forgot to change. Everything was hazed...I could hardly remember being stabbed. I wasn't wearing my jacket either, just like Damien. As there was a blood stain on my blouse. I unbuttoned my blouse and pulled it down to look at the wound. Damien blushed seeing me with out a shirt an dI couldn't help but smile at him.. I stared at the bandage tied around my arm, tapping the blood stain slowly. I looked up at Damien, almost pleadingly. \"Damien...I'm scared to look.\" Damien looked at the blood and brought his hands up to it cautiously, holding my shoulder gently in his hands. \"Does it hurt?\" I shook my head. \"Not right now.\" Damien began to untie the once white bandage aorund my arm and the bloody gash was revealed. I looked at it, and Damien was now examining it. \"It's not that bad...\" He said. I scooted over even closer to him. \"It's not even deep. I'm surprised.\" \"It hurts now.\" I said still looking at the many blood trails running down my arms. They looked like tiny crimson rivers. Damien looked up at me and I smiled weakly. He put the gauze on the table that sat beside my bed and turned back to me. \"Leave it unwrapped for a while...it'll help.\" I nodded, then hesitated. \"...I'm afraid to lay back down.\" I felt my cheeks turning pink and I could tell Damien took notice. He grinned that usual grin he gives me. Damien shifted posistions, so that he was kneeling now. \"Here. Lay your head down in my lap..\" I laid down on my back and did as Damien suggested. Now I was staring up at the ceiling...I sighed and Damien, once again, began to stroke my hair. I swear, I'll never cut my hair because of this. Damien loves doing this too much. Not to mention, I love it when he does it. In return I held Damien's other hand. He was so pale...I think even paler than I am. I smiled. I held his hand close to me, sighing and feeling complete. It felt like this was right. Or simply made to be. I closed my eyes and managed to clear my mind of anything bad. Although, what unnerved me was what Paul asked us last night. 'Are you two ready for the marriage?' Marriage? Okay, I knew the prophecy like the back of my hand, thanks to my Dad. I have to get married to Damien, have kids like a usual housewife...except I'm in love with the antichrist. But, I think Damien and I are still too young to be united in such a mature way. Damien is thirteen and a half...I'm thirteen. We're going to be with eachother for the rest of our lives without a choice. So what is a few more years going to effect? I managed to open my eyes and look at Damien. \"Aren't you worried?\" I finally said after a moment of, once again, being mezmirised by his pale skin. Damien just stared back at me. \"About what?\" \"We have to get married pretty soon...doesn't it worry you at all, Damien?\" He just chuckled. \"We're already together as it is...you said that yourself.\" I remembered what I said that night at the lake and at the dance. I blushed again. \"Alright, fine...But what if someone tries to hurt us again?\" I said glancing at my bloody shoulder, the exposed wound showing no signs of healing yet. Damien sighed and looked out my bedroom window for a moment, pausing and watching the snow as it fell. He looked back down at me after a minute or so. He smiled a comforting smile, like the night Mark was killed. Only this time, I wanted to see that smile. No, correction...I needed to see that smile. Damien finally spoke. \"I'm always with you. We're both protectors of eachother.\" He placed his hand gently on my forehead. \"We'll be okay...we have Paul. And your father when he's around.\" \"But what if we have children!\" I said abruptly. I assumed Damien would think I was crazy for asking such a question this early in our relationship. I knew it was too early to even be mentioning even the word 'children' in our relationship. But we are getting married...possibly when we both turn fifteen. Or fourteen if Paul insists we do it sooner. Damien fell silent in response to my question. I could see the blush rising to his cheeks again, I could tell he was without words. Speechless, to be exact. \"Children...?\" Damien repeated. I couldn't help but giggle at his reaction. \"Yes, Damien. I said 'children'.\" I responded, our mood a bit more positive. Damien sighed deeply and I could tell he was realising the seriousness of the situation. After a moment, he finally managed to look at me again. \"How many?\" Damien asked next. He seemed so fascinated about the idea of us raising a family together. I laughed and playfully nudged his cheek. \"How ever many we want...\" Damien smiled me. I smiled back, as always. I sat up in bed again and Damien put his arm around me. I sighed, and laid my head down on his chest and nuzzled against him lovingly. He's still so warm. I can feel his heart beating... I was nearly falling asleep in Damien's arms again until he snapped me back to reality. \"Raynee...\" He spoke my name and I looked up at him. Damien looked me straight in the eyes and blinked. He looked very serious, and it struck me as odd. \"I just realized something...\" Damien said hesitantly under his breath. \"What is it?\" I asked. Damien abruptly pulled me closer to him. I actually found myself gasping because of this action. We both held onto eachother, and Damien and I both locked gazes. I almost knew exactly what he was going to say. I was sure I would feel tears start to sting my eyes, but I didn't. I instead smiled, knowing our lives with eachother were begining now . Damien smiled back at me and I felt hopeful for the future. No matter how much destruction and death is put up agaisnt us, I know Damien will remain faithful to me and the prophecy. \"Raynee, as long as you're with me, we'll be okay. We'll watch over eachother...just like your father said. And as long as you're mine...\" He looked at me, pausing and gazing at me lovingly. After awhile, Damien smiled. And the words he said promised me the world. \"..You and I'll be safe and sound...and I'll never let you go.\" I smiled and looked into Damien's beautiful, colbalt blue eyes. The ones that made me fall in love with him when I saw him for the first time. The eyes that made me melt the day we met, and the eyes belonging to the boy I met in my father's district of the school. Damien Thorn The boy who I love more than anything or anybody, the boy I'm engaged to, and most importantly, The boy who I can call mine. END ","Summary":" \"Dad, is that you?\" I called from the hallway leading to my room after I heard the locks on the d"},{"Movie":"Omen","Title":"Omen V:The Lost Mother","Author":"blackmoodring","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10266367","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter 1 It was September 13th, 1982. Damien Thorn was 17 years old and at his prime. Since he had made the discovery of who he is and who he is going to become four years prior, he'd come a long way. For one thing, he was an awful lot more popular. Every boy on the campus wanted to be him and admired him greatly. It was a great exercise for his charisma. The more you're liked, the farther you'll get. He didn't want to brag, but he wasn't too bad looking either. Granted he didn't look too different, but he'd grown to be 5'11 and was still quite the football player. His hair cut and basic muscle tone was the same, but he was good looking. He had been making perfect grades and every teacher admired him. Everyone who met him knew he'd be a success. Thankfully, the body count in his life hadn't needed to grow too much higher, and he wasn't attacked as often. And as if things couldn't be better, over the summer, a gas leak hit the girl's academy near to the boy's academy and exploded. Now, girls were enrolled in his academy! He was incredibly happy. \"Thanks, Murray.\" Damien said to his chauffeur after being dropped off. \"Have a good year Damien! You'll be great!\" He said as he drove off. It was no shock to him to find out Murray was in on all the satanic activity. Damien went to get his room key. \"Welcome back Mr. Thorn!\" Mr. Harris said handing him his room key. \"Good to be back, sir.\" Damien said respectfully taking the room key. As he walked through the halls, he noticed girls running around with the boys, and quite a few girls who gave him a look of wanting, making Damien feel good. Just as he was about to go to his room he felt his body hit something and saw a lot of blonde hair as he fell down hearing a feminine, gentle, strong, and somewhat loud voice yell \" Ow !\" Damien groaned and sat up to see a girl with medium length wavy blonde hair that fell to her shoulders, tan skin, a round face, a button nose, full rose pink lips, high cheekbones, and different colored eyes, one light blue with a small pupil and hazel green with a large pupil. The girl rubbed her head and stood up looking down at him. \"I'm sorry about that! You need a hand?\" She said holding out her very narrow and feminine hand. He accepted and was helped up. He was a tad annoyed, but decided to discreetly get a better look. She was about 5'6, and pear shaped, but looked almost like she could be hour glass shaped. She wasn't super skinny but she wasn't unattractive, she was a little plump, but it wasn't bad, she looked healthy. She had a rather well-proportioned chest and derrière. She looked really good in her uniform and Damien decided that she was rather cute. \"It's alright; I probably should've looked where I was going.\" Damien said finally responding to her. The girl smiled, and held out her hand straightening her back a little. \"I'm Bella Giles!\" \"I'm Damien Thorn, nice to meet you.\" He said shaking her hand. If he'd have blinked he would've missed Bella's smile fall and go slightly pale for a half second. But he didn't blink. The two pulled back their hands. Damien wondered if this girl was going to be trouble. \"Your accent is different, are you British?\" She asked innocently. \"Well, to be honest I was born in Italy. But I was raised in England until I was about five and a half.\" \"You were born in Italy? That's so cool! I was born in America, but I'm mostly Italian. My Father's Mother's side is Italian, and there's a lot of Italian from my Mother's side of the family. I've always wanted to go to Italy someday!\" \"That's interesting.\" The two stood in an awkward silence for a minute before nodding their goodbyes, gathering their things, and going their own ways. \"The Holy Roman Empire had a powerful impact on the world, in almost the same ways that the Ancient Greeks did.\" Mr. Ruby said as he began the lecture for first period History. Damien was rather bored; he's already known all this already by heart, literally. All of a sudden, his sixth sense kicked in and he tensed, feeling as if he was being watched. The brunette peeked over his shoulder to see Bella, the girl who he ran into before, sitting right behind him. He hadn't even noticed her there. He would've actually accused her of stalking and staring at him, but from what he could see she was writing what seemed to be every word coming out of the teacher's mouth. Damien turned back around and almost instantly felt the sense he was being watched again, he looked for a reflective place, but could find none. Push came to shove, she was in all of his classes and she seemed to be constantly watching him but every time he peeked her way she had her nose in her notebook or a novel. Every time it happened, Damien would lightly sigh and began to think he was losing his mind. Finally it was lunch time, and he pulled the girl aside. \"Oh, hello!\" She said cheerfully. \"Why were you been staring at me in class? Were you staring at me in class?!\" Damien said not even in the mood to be his usual cool self. This new girl made him feel very uneasy, a feeling he didn't like being acquainted with. \"No, why? Did you want me to?\" She said sarcastically leaning back against the wall smiling at him. \"No.\" Damien said feeling very weird in his stomach. \"Well, if your so concerned, I must assume you were checking to see if I was, so technically it should be I who is asking, why were you staring at me? \" She smiled teasingly. Damien's cheeks grew an uncomfortable red, partly from embarrassment, partly from anger. She was smart, a smart ass at the least. Normally he wouldn't think of taking much action against a girl, but at that moment he was very tempted to shut her up good, but he didn't really want that kind of trouble the first day of school; Again. The thought of the incident between himself and Teddy brought back the memory of Mark. His look seemed a little sadder, making Bella frown, and he turned to leave the girl alone. \"Damn it, wait!\" She said stopping him, turning him back to face her. \"Look, I'm sorry. I don't like being teased, either, to be honest. I want to make it up to you, I wasn't well liked when it was just all girls and well, you seem nice, and... I'd like to be your friend.\" Bella smiled warmly and honestly. Damien was a little surprised, but he had to admit... She did seem smart; he figured that he could at least have a few decent conversations with her. It was hard to have that with the people he was normally around, so he led the way and the two walked to the Dining Hall and sat with Teddy and Foster. \"Teddy, Foster, I'd like you to meet my new friend Bella Giles. Bella, this is Teddy and Foster.\" Damien said. \"Hello!\" Bella said warmly. The two boys stared at Damien then each other a minute as if debating if this was a good or bad thing, deciding on good, the two reached out their hands and shook hers. \"It's nice to meet you!\" Foster said smiling. \"Yeah, it's not like Damien to bring a girl home.\" Teddy said winking making a joke. Damien shot him a glare while Bella blushed lightly. \"There you are, Bella!\" A high feminine voice said, they looked to see a short 5'2 girl with long beautiful dark red hair and almond shaped brown eyes. Teddy had to do a double take. \"I thought you said you didn't have friends at the other school?\" Damien said poking Bella's shoulder. \"I don't! But I have a sister. We aren't actually related, but it feels like we were separated at birth.\" Bella smiled wide. \"I'm Rose Heinz, and Bella and I are as close as can be.\" Rose said sitting beside her and linking arms. \"So, do you have any other sisters?\" Foster asked hopefully. \"Nope. Well, I do, but they're all in different states and are between ten and twenty years older than I am. And before you get any ideas about a relationship Mrs. Robinson-style, I don't see them very often anyway.\" Bella responded leaving Foster a tad upset. \"And unfortunately, I'll join that list once this year ends.\" Rose added sadly. \"Why?\" Damien asked confused. \"I'm going to graduate after this year. I know I'm kind of short for my age, but I'm actually turning 18 in twenty-one days.\" She answered. The other boys stared in shock, while Bella and Sierra took a tape player from Bella's inner jacket pocket and listened and sang along lightly to Rick Springfield's \"Jessie's Girl\", as if nothing just happened. Damien noted the girls were good singers, and had a good harmony together. Damien didn't know it yet, but he had just made quite interesting friends.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 It was Friday, October 15th, 1982. As expected, Damien's friends really were interesting. The girls were fun, funny, smart, and kind. Especially Bella, the two had become best friends. He enjoyed her company a lot and often passed notes with her in class. The two never had trouble with school work, so they didn't miss too much in class. He found out a lot about her, too. Her older brother died 6 days after he was born, Her mother died when she was little, she had attended a Christian Academy from preschool to second grade by her Mother's request but had been taken out after her death. Her sisters didn't really acknowledge her much, being busy with their own lives. Her father worked awhile in the Air Force and had gone to the Air Force Academy on a full ride scholarship, so he believed sending Bella to Military School would be a good thing for her, he still worked for the money along with a small company, so he made a decent amount of money, but wasn't rich. He could be caring, but he could be harsh and sometimes mentally abusive towards Bella. Anything she enjoyed in life including friends and family would either leave or die. She'd been bullied almost all her life until a short few years before but still occasionally had an issue, and often times would be hated by people she barely knew for reasons she just didn't know or understand. She loves to read and write and draw and perform, she's incredibly brilliant and wants to be a lawyer someday, and she is a rather caring person. When Damien tells her something, she doesn't care because he's popular or rich... She actually cares about his opinions and what he has to say. Teddy was head over heels for Rose since day one, even if he knew once she graduated he didn't have a chance in Hell, so of course when October Fest rolled around, he asked her and presented a red rose corsage as her birthday present. She accepted happily. Bella's seventeenth birthday was yesterday and even though she never admitted it to anybody... She wanted to go. And Damien knew that. But, no one asked her. So, Damien followed Teddy's lead and surprised her with two tickets to the October Fest Formal and offered to take her \"As friends.\" It was no surprise when Bella accepted and dragged Rose to go dress shopping. So now he waited holding a purple and black wrist corsage outside her dorm, wearing a black suit. After a few minutes, Bella came out wearing a purple dress that had one black shoulder strap and flowed down in layers from her waist to the ground, having what appeared to be black sparkles on It with her hair curled in loose curled and pulled up in a fancy style, and black jewelry. Bella looked beautiful to him at that moment and felt like he could die. It hit him hard and fast as he looked at his friend, every odd feeling she gave him in his stomach intensified as he figured out... He liked her, really liked her. He had a crush on her. He blushed as he slipped on her corsage. \"Shall we go, Damien?\" She said smiling holding up her arm. \"We shall.\" \"Oops wait! Hold on!\" She ran back in her room and came back with a Polaroid camera. \"My dad will want to see.\" She explained as she took a picture of him, and he took a picture of her and they did their best to take a good picture together. After putting the pictures and camera away, the two looped arms and walked to the dance held in the Academy's Ball Room. They purchased a formal photograph of themselves with a pretty border involving Pumpkins and other October-like aspects. \"Did you know I was supposed to be born on Halloween? My mom induced labor on the fourteenth.\" Bella told him as they walked in. \"No, I didn't! Why did she induce labor?\" \"She was scared about me being born on Halloween.\" \"Ah.\" \"It's my favorite Holiday, though. I like scary movies and things! I don't know why, but the thrill of a good scare just gets me!\" \"I like horror movies, too! Have you seen the Wolf man? It scared the bloody hell out of me!\" \"Yeah! And Frankenstein!\" \"And Dracula!\" The two said in unison before smiling at each other. \"Something about a happy ending is just so typical and boring.\" He said. \"I agree, but it's nice to think life doesn't have to suck all the time. But I am doubtful that every little detail ends up perfect.\" \"Good point.\" \"I wonder where our friends are.\" They spotted Rose and Teddy dancing in the corner and Foster on the other side being a wall flower. Damien smiled at Bella. \"Would you like to dance?\" \"Absolutely!\" The two began to dance showing Bella knew her way around a dance floor as she smiled at Damien; he felt his face grow warmer. He couldn't believe this. He had a crush on Bella . He hasn't had a genuine crush on anyone since he was eight. The music slowed down and romantically, showing a slow dance. Damien looked tense. \"We don't have to, its okay, Damien.\" Bella said understandingly. Damien cursed himself, this was supposed to be for her and he was letting his feelings get in his way. He took her hands gently and placed one on his shoulder while he held the other and put his arm around her waist and the two began to dance to the music. He looked deep into her multicolored eyes. He understood why he felt the way he did, she was a wonderful person... But she's been through a lot of pain. She had to learn lessons and grow up as a little kid, dealing with pain and death when she should be learning to ride a bike and playing with other little kids. He found out she read so much because sometimes, she just wanted to escape from her world to a better one. She was actually a lot more similar to him than anyone else he'd ever met. They understood each other in ways only a few people could. She connected with him so deeply, sometimes it was scary, so of course he'd feel this way about her. Before he knew it, the slow dance was over and it was just them smiling at each other. He wanted to kiss her so badly. \"You look beautiful.\" He let slip out. Bella was surprised but smiled as she blushed. As the tempo picked up into a new song their friends came to talk to them and they all went off to dance together and have fun. In the corner they were selling flowers both fake and real and Damien caught Bella staring at them. \"Do you want some?\" Damien asked her as they stopped Dancing as he took out his wallet. \"Yes! I wanted to get some plastic black and purple flowers.\" She answered. He handed her five dollars for the flowers. \"Why plastic?\" He asked curiously. \"Because they never die.\" She answered smiling taking the money as she ran off. He felt a tap on his shoulder and he turned around to face Rose. \"Are you two on a date?\" She asked rather seriously. Damien blushed. \"N-No, we're here as friends.\" He said nervously. \"Well you should be, Bella has a huge crush on you.\" \"She does?!\" \"Yes! She told me last night, herself.\" She then went with her own date to continue dancing. Damien turned to see Bella running back to him and hugged him, thanking him for the flowers. Damien blushed and hugged her back. He certainly had a lot to think about now.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 It was Sunday, November 20th, 1982. Damien was handling his feelings a lot better. He accepted it about himself. He was Damien Thorn, he was 17, he was the Antichrist, and he had a crush on Bella Giles. What he wasn't handling well was that Bella had been avoiding him the past few days. He was concerned about her. He also felt guilty. Every time he came around, she'd found some excuse to leave. Damien felt horrible about it. He sat in his room wearing a button up shirt and slacks thinking. He felt conflicted about what to do. What did he do to upset her? He couldn't find one thing he did wrong. If it was anyone else, he'd be furious and say good riddance. But that's the thing about when you care about someone; you want to just get past it so things can be normal again. It was a shock when there was a small knock on his door. He opened it to see Bella wearing a purple and black plaid skirt with a black blouse and black flats with her headphones around her neck and her tape player in her back pocket. She certainly took advantage of wearing-whatever-you-want-on-the-weekends rule. \"Bella? What are you doing here?\" Damien said both shocked and happy. \"May I come in?\" She said quietly. Normally, Bella wasn't a quiet person. Damien moved aside and let her into his dorm room. Seconds after closing the door, he found himself being hugged by the blonde. He slowly hugged her back. He moved her to sit with him on his bed before moving her chin up so they could face one another. \"Bella, what's been going on these past few days? I've been feeling like a twit who did something wrong to you and have been going bonkers trying to figure out how I offended you.\" Damien said completely concerned. \"It's not you, it's me... I... Damien, I like you. I like you a lot. The way Teddy likes Rose... I like you more and more every day... And I-\" she was cut off as Damien hugged her tighter, this was different though, more caring. Bella hugged him back. \"I feel the same way about you.\" Damien whispered in her ear. \"Damien... Before we do something we could regret I need to tell you something important.\" Damien pulled away and looked at her. \"What is it?\" Bella reached her hand behind his head and his sixth sense gave a red alert and he immediately grabbed her wrist, perhaps a little harder than necessary his eyes widening. \"Bella... You really don't want to do that.\" He warned. \"Because I'll feel the 666 mark on the back of your head?\" Bella said simply. Immediately he grabbed her other wrist and pinned her under him with her wrists above her head and his legs on either side of her body, his face lingering above hers. He felt so upset. He might have to kill another person he cares about, but this was a different kind of caring. He knows he'll have to do whatever he has to do... But he really, really didn't want to. \"What do you know?\" He asked. \"You're the Antichrist. Your mother was a jackal and your father is Satan. You've known this since you were 13, and someday... You'll have a wife and children. With a woman prophesied as the Whore of Babylon, a woman who will help you become the man who will take over the world in the name of your father. And the Whore of Babylon is just a girl with a really bad childhood who just wants to be with you.\" She said crying. Damien let his guard down and let her go and lay beside her and held the blonde girl as she cried. \"You're the Whore of Babylon, aren't you?\" He said rubbing circles into her back. \"Y-yes... In theory, I'm your soul mate.\" She looked at him. He rubbed her tears away and held her close. He knew he could believe her. \"When did you know?\" \"When I was twelve, my father paid a babysitter to take care of me named William Baylock, who revealed why such bad things were happening to me and explained about you and what had happened to his wife... And he taught me things, like what I'm supposed to do and what I need to do. And when we became friends... Damien I'm crazy about you... I-\" \"Bella. Stop talking. I told you, I believe you. And I feel the same. I want to take you on a date.\" \"A-A date?\" Bella said blushing deeply. \"Yes. A date. Anywhere you'd like to go.\" \"Well... There is Winter Fest in Town during our Winter Break. When I was a little girl I'd go with my family every year.\" \"Then I'll take you there.\" He said getting off the bed and getting out a piece of paper and a pen and handing them to her. \"Write your address and phone number on here and I will get details. Until then, can we continue seeing one another every day and do what we've always done? I've missed you.\" He handed her the paper and pen. She wrote her address and number before hugging him again. She kissed his cheek and left the dorm with an \"I missed you, too.\" Damien held his cheek in his hand and smiled wide. He had a date.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 It was Friday December 16th, 1982. Damien certainly hoped this snow wasn't a bad omen. Damien had just picked up Bella in his limo ten minutes before. He snuck a look to his date. The blonde girl was looking out the window, fog slowly forming on it and she turned to Damien. \"Did you ever draw things on windows?\" She asked. Damien thought a minute, he was sure he had at some point but nothing in particular came to his mind. \"Yes, I believe so. Why?\" \"Are you partial to anything? Any shapes?\" \"Nope.\" \"Would you like to help me with mine?\" Damien stared surprised at her. He slowly nodded yes and she took his hand and formed it to where his pointer finger was pointed and she had him draw a football, and then she drew by herself a stick figure in a Jersey, obviously a football player, who had Damien's number on the jersey. \"See? Something that each of us like!\" She smiled. \"You like football?\" \"Sort of. I really like a football player.\" She smiled at him. He slowly smiled back and blushed. \"Was that too cheesy?\" Bella asked giggling. \" Yes . But... You're cheesy. I like it.\" The two began to laugh and kept laughing the whole way to the park. Damien quickly got out of the car and opened the other door for her. She gladly stepped out. \"I've always loved the kind of coats you're wearing.\" Bella commented to him. Damien looked down at himself in his long black winter coat with various buttons that covered his sweater and button up shirt, black and red plaid scarf, slacks, and black snow boots. He looked at her purple plaid wool coat that fell to her mid upper thigh with a thick fuzzy black turtleneck beneath and black jeans with purple plaid snow boots and her purple plaid gloves. He noticed she had her black messenger bag slung over her shoulder. He smiled at her and wondered if she had a clue how cute she is. She sneezed, surprisingly loud as usual, making him jump a little. He noticed her cheeks and nose become a little red. \"Your cold, aren't you?\" He asked knowing the answer. \"No, I'm fine. I actually am always warm. I'm warm in the winters and cold in the summers instead of the reverse. I guess I'm a winter.\" He smiled. He was learning more and more by the second, and he was glad she wasn't just asking constant questions about him and actually had her own opinions. \"Just to be safe, hang onto this for me, please?\" He said removing his scarf and wrapping it around her neck, she looked absolutely adorable. She couldn't help but notice how much the scarf smelled like him, like Lavender fabric softener and Fall air. \"Where should we go first?\" He asked her. \"Hmm... I don't know. But, we could hold hands and walk to find out.\" She smiled and held her hand out to him. Damien accepted and laced their fingers as they began to walk towards the Winter Festivities. \"When I was little, I went every year with my parents and sisters. It was a big deal once upon a time.\" Bella said as she walked around. Damien looked at her eyes and knew that it was still a big deal to her. He was determined to make sure she had a good time. They walked and sat down on a bench between a stand that sold beautiful homemade jewelry and a stand with hot chocolate. They looked up at the snow still falling. \"I love snow... What about you?\" \"It's pretty, but I prefer warmer temperatures. Being... Me.\" \"I see. Hold on a second.\" She quickly went to the hot chocolate stand next to them and bought them two hot chocolates made with milk instead of water, and had marshmallows. She went back to him and handed him his hot chocolate. \"Well that was thoughtful!\" Damien said smiling at her taking a sip. \"I figure since you like it hotter that it would help.\" \"It does, thank you! It's better than any other hot chocolate I've ever had.\" \"When it's made with water it tastes exactly like that. Boiled water, but when it's made with milk, like you can ask for here, it's heaven in a cup.\" \"I can tell! So, what's your favorite thing to do here?\" \"Honestly? Collecting the wristbands the winter characters give out with their character names on them. I know it's for little kids and all, but it's one of the happiest memories of my childhood.\" She said taking a sip. Damien held her free hand and they both stood. \"Well, let's go collect some wristbands then.\" He said smiling at her. Bella's eyes brightened so much as the two picked up their pace to hunt for winter themed characters. Most of them were Santa Clauses from all over the world, which Bella joked to Damien by whispering in his ear, \"I believe Santa is a form of Satan with the fact that his names an anagram for Satan, dressed in red as people stereotype the devil with red skin, and he takes the focus off 'the true meaning of Christmas' by giving kids gifts, increasing their greediness at Christmas, one of the seven deadly sins, and his name is St. Nicholas, St. Nick- like Old Nick, a name for the devil in England.\" \"Wasn't his suit originally green, though?\" \"Yes, but again, that's a representation of Greed. And possibly jealousy, if you think about it. No matter what kids give this man treats and a drink and yet they either are punished or rewarded. The rewarded get greedy and the punished get jealous. All because this one force who always watches them has the power to tell which kids yes and no, but still get the offering of treats anyway, but in the end are all gipped when they find out the truth about Santa Clause, and causes them that push towards cynicism. And technically, Christmas isn't Jesus's actual birthday; he was born in the summer. The Christians decided having it at Winter Solstice was a good idea since everyone who was already here had a celebration, a pagan celebration, by the way.\" Bella said shrugging. Damien stared at her shocked and a little amazed. \"You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?\" \"What? I was eight.\" \"Wait a second you were able to process all that at eight? Even the Devil connection?\" \"Dad made a joke about the anagram, and you have to remember from preschool to seventh grade I was in a private Christian Academy where we were graded on our bible reading and verse remembrance every day. We knew about the solstice thing and weren't allowed to say Santa Clause. Although they never said why, that's how I figured the rest out on my own.\" \"Interesting School you went to.\" He said raising an eyebrow. \"Oh yeah.\" She nodded in agreement about how silly the school she once attended was. The two went around until they collected every single wristband, all with a small different colored Bell. In Bella's messenger bag today was a Polaroid camera, which they used to take pictures with all the characters, and using a marker to say which character it was before placing the pictures in her bag. After that, along with three more cups of hot chocolate each, they stood with a crowd as the parade of characters started. \"When they come near us, shake your wrists so the bells ring.\" Bella said smiling. Damien didn't even question it; he'd been having so much fun he officially named Bella the ambassador of fun. They were the only people who shook their wrists at first, whooping happily as the characters past, but soon other kids and most people with wrist bands followed their lead. Damien turned to this girl next to him, to see tears in her eyes as she smiled. He smiled, too. He made her so happy she was crying tears of joy. He felt his heart burn with happiness for this girl, and a feeling of fondness that made him so happy to be close to her. After the parade, they held hands and continued walking around looking at all the cool things they had, wooden clocks, toys, food, snow globes, jewelry, books, the works. Damien bought Bella a snow globe with a skating rink inside. \"Consider it an early Solstice gift.\" He said smiling at her. The two smelled the wonderful smell known as Chestnuts. \"I'm getting pretty hungry; we've been here a few hours. I didn't like them much when I was little, but maybe now that I'm older I'll like them more!\" Bella said as they bought two small bags and napkins. They sat at the bench they were at before; they popped a chestnut in their mouths and slowly looked at each other, then took out their napkins and spit into them with disgust. \"Nope, still awful.\" Bella commented. \"Bloody awful! Such a shame, because I liked the smell.\" Damien responded. \"Let's get some candy canes to get the taste out of our mouths. Besides, it's getting even darker than before, we could watch the ice skating show.\" Bella suggested. Damien smiled at her. \"Sounds like a plan, love.\" Bella gave him a loving look hearing him give her a pet name. The two did exactly that. As Afternoon became evening the two sat in the bleachers looking at the ice skating show and it was, as always, fantastic, Bella taking a few pictures. Then after the show ended, and anyone was aloud on the ice ring, Damien turned to her. \"Do you want to skate?\" He asked. \"I'd prefer not. I've tried learning a thousand times and have terrible balance on ice, the best I can do is roller skate and even then it takes me an hour or so to ease into it. But you can skate if you want to, I'll take some pictures, even!\" \"No, that's alright. I'd prefer to stay with you. Besides, the last time I was skating... It wasn't a good experience.\" \"Forgive me if this offends you, but was that the incident with Bill Atherton?\" Damien stiffened a moment remembering that horrible day. He wasn't even that dangerous. That death was all to the benefit of Paul. He still felt guilty about that. He turned to her and nodded yes. \"I'm not offended, love. Come, a band is starting to play, we could dance. If you want to, of course.\" Bella nodded yes and the two walked to the small set up stage next to the ice rink with the setup of lights so people could see, where a band began to play and sing a beautiful Irish song, and the couples danced. The two danced gracefully with one another happily. \"Bella, I don't say this often... But today, was a wonderful day.\" \"I agree, Damien.\" \"...Bella?\" \"Yes?\" \"I must be honest... I, really like you. And I have for a long time.\" \"I feel the same. Except...\" \"Yes?\" \"I... I love you Damien.\" She smiled at him. Damien felt a tear roll down his face. Because he knew that she loved him , not the Antichrist and the power and image of him... But the real him. \"Bella, I love you, too.\" And with that, the two kissed, it was a loving chaste short first kiss before the two began dancing again. After a few more dances the couple agreed it was late enough. The two walked to the closest place, a drug store, to use their phone to call Murray to come get them. Once Murray picked them up, he put up the privacy visor to not interrupt the young lovebirds. Bella tapped Damien's shoulder and pointed to the window, showing the snow once again fogged up the window, but this time she traced a heart and wrote DT + BG in the middle, checked out Damien's window to make sure there were no cars nearby them on the road, then took two pictures of her window drawing with her camera. \"This one's for you, Sweetie.\" She said giving him one and when he tucked it away in his inner coat pocket, she held Damien's hand, intertwining their fingers. Damien leaned over and kissed her again, which she was more than happy to return and deepen. All too soon, they were at Bella's home, Damien walked her to the door. She looked so beautiful to him. \"Goodnight, Damien.\" \"I love you. Goodnight.\" \"I love you, too.\" After one quicker kiss Damien returned to his limo, shocked that the window was already fogged up again. He took out the picture and stared at it with a smile the whole way home.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 It was Sunday January 1st, 1983. Damien had adjusted his tie for the eighth time since leaving from his phone. \"Damien, calm down, if you're going to become a politician someday, I think you can handle your girlfriend's father.\" Paul said. \"Yeah Damien, everything will be fine.\" Murray remarked from the front seat. \"I've never done this sort of thing before. The few dates I've had we're for show an all I did was flash a smile and small talk with their fathers I actually care about Bella and want to impress her father.\" \"I'm sure Bella wants to impress me, as well. Damien. I promise you'll be fine.\" Paul said patting his shoulder. As expected, after everything that had happened to Damien when he was 13, Paul Buher became his legal guardian, and when he didn't live at the academy, he lived in a mansion with him. After a few more minutes they arrived at the small house. It was small, but very nice and elegant. The two left the car, Murray driving off to do what he pleased until he had to pick them up. The two walked up to the front door and knocked. Bella answered the door wearing a knee length satin purple dress with a simple belt around her waist and matching flats, her hair had been straightened. She smiled at both of them. \"Welcome! Dinner will be ready in a moment.\" She said letting them in. The two came face to face with a tall man with thinning blonde hair and green eyes and looking like a masculine Bella except with thinner lips and odder shaped ears. \"Hello, welcome to our home!\" He said smiling. \"Nice to meet you, I'm Paul Buher.\" Paul said holding out his hand. \"I'm Peter Giles.\" Peter said shaking Paul's hand. \"Hello, Sir. I am Damien Thorn.\" Damien said with a charismatic smile holding out his hand. Peter shook Damien's hand warmly. \"Ah yes, my daughter's new boyfriend . Straight back, good handshake, cleat cut, attends a military academy, a good background, calling me Sir, you young lad have officially impressed me, so far.\" Peter said fondly. \"Dinner's ready!\" Bella said smiling with her hands behind her back. \"Sounds great! It's nice to meet you Bella, I'm Paul Buher.\" Paul said shaking her hand. \"It's nice to make your acquaintance, Sir.\" She responded smiling. While the Giles' went to the dining room, Paul mentioned in Damien's ear, \"She's very cute.\" Which made the seventeen year old boy blush. The dining room was simple and lovely. The entire home looked clean and fancy, without a doubt, Bella's family wasn't poor. The blonde girl served red wine for the adults and virgin piña coladas for herself and her boyfriend. \"So, what's for dinner?\" Peter asked his daughter taking a sip of wine. \"Pasta Puttanesca, cheese garlic bread, and side Caesar salads.\" The girl responded. The room became shockingly quiet as Peters glass slipped from his hand and smashed to the floor and his hand hit the dining table making the plates and silver wear jump. \"DAMN IT BELLA. Did I or did I NOT tell you this morning we are going to have CHICKEN CAESER SALADS as our meal?! I WASTED GOOD MONEY ON THAT CHICKEN, GOD YOU ARE SO INCOMPETENT! I know why you wanted pasta, because you'd rather eat STARCHY CRAP rather then something that WON'T clog your arteries and KILL YOU before your twenty as if you weren't FAT enough, it's amazing you tricked ANYONE into thinking you'd be a good choice as a girlfriend, HELL! WHY CAN'T YOU BE GOOD AND DO WHAT YOUR TOLD?!\" Peter screamed at his daughter. Bella's eyes filled with tears and Paul literally had to grip Damien's arm hard to keep him from attacking. \"We didn't have enough lettuce to use as three separate meals, Daddy. And with the left over pasta from last week, I thought it'd be a good idea. I'm sorry, I should have told you.\" Bella said tears escaping against her will. \"Yes, YOU SHOULD'VE. Now CLEAN this mess up IMMEDIATELY! We'll wait to eat until you've finished. And stop crying! You're not doing the Peter-And-Bella show tonight, you screwed up, get over it.\" He said coldly, Bella wiped her eyes, and left to the kitchen. Paul sat uncomfortably along with Peter at the dining room table, and even though Damien could've sat with them and made small talk impressing his girlfriend's father, he knew a far more important place he needed to be. \"Excuse me, sir, where's your bathroom?\" Damien asked politely. \"Go down the hall and to the left.\" Damien went down the hall and made a right instead, into the kitchen, where the blonde stood by the sink hanging her head taking deep breaths obviously trying to not cry. Damien underestimated her. Bella might be the strongest person he's ever met. He walked behind her before hugging her from behind. \"I-I'm fine! I'm fine. Don't worry, honestly. I've dealt with it for over half my life, I'll be oka-\" \"Bella?\" \"Yes?\" \"If we're going to be in a relationship, let alone married with children someday, we need to be honest with one another. That's what you tell everyone else in the world because you were forced to grow up as a seven year old girl and deal with the man who is your father because you literally have no other choice BUT to handle it maturely and as if you are fine. You're still a seventeen year old girl, and after that kind of treatment from your only surviving parent, a person by nature you HAVE to love unconditionally there's just no bloody way in Hell that you are okay .\" \"I'm not okay...\" Bella admitted sadly. Damien held her face in his hands and she began crying again. He wiped her tears away and kissed her forehead, nose, and lips. \"I love you, Bella.\" \"I love you too. And I'm not okay, but I can handle it. Go join them; I'll come clean up the mess.\" And so the young couple walked back together holding hands and Bella did as she was told with a smile and once she was done she joined the others at the table. Thankfully, the rest of the night was pleasant, the food was good, and Bella's father very much approved of Damien. At the end of the night, things were still very tense considering Peter's outburst towards his daughter. But Damien hugged her closely. \"I'll see you at school in two days. I love you.\" Damien whispered to her. He wanted to take her with him and away from her father... But he knew he couldn't and although he'd never admit it, he was angry at himself for it. \"I love you, too.\" And with that Bella kissed him and the two parted ways for the night.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 It was Monday, February 14th, 1983. Love was in the air at the Academy. Being the first Valentine's Day with girls actually there, everyone was much happier and a lot more nervous. Thankfully, Damien was always calm and collected. So no one bat an eye as he proudly gave his girlfriend a stuffed puppy holding four dozen plastic roses and a diamond necklace around its neck. Bella smiled lightly at him. \"Are you trying to upstage me?\" She joked accepting the puppy. \"Oh bugger, you don't like it?\" Damien frowned a little making her laugh before kissing him. \"I love it. My gift isn't as extravagant, but I hope you like it anyway.\" Bella gave him a large homemade valentine card and a small present. Damien opened it to see a mix tape and a tape player with head phones. He looked closer at the mix tape to see \"Damien and Bella Tunes\" written on it. He also saw a small book about some of the best politicians of the country and some of their military tactics. He smiled at Bella before hugging her and kissing her forehead. \"Thank you, love.\" \"Damien, Bella, please keep your hands to yourself. I know it's Valentine's Day, but it's not appropriate.\" Sargent Neff said as he passed the two. Damien stared at Neff a minute. He hadn't seen a lot of Neff through the school year so far, which was actually very odd. Then again, there had been rumors that his daughter was here now and so he often spent his time with her. Damien had to think a minute before remembering the girl's name was Kylee. Kylee had creepy dark eyes and long black hair with very light skin and was very skinny. A few of the boys thought she was gorgeous, but not Damien. He thought that having somebody so creepy looking at his side was a very bad idea. Besides, extremely skinny girls like her looked like boys. Damien wanted a girl who looked like a girl. Besides, it didn't hurt to have something to grab onto when making out with his girlfriend. Across the hall a happy shriek was heard as Sierra jumped into Teddy's arms kissing him, probably for the first time. Apparently, he had given her a mood ring with the stone shaped like a rose and a necklace to match, not to mention the typical box of chocolates and a card. \"Good for him.\" Damien mumbled before turning to his girlfriend. \"After school, I want you to meet me by the west entrance. I'm going to take you someplace special.\" Damien kissed her nose then left, leaving Bella smiling and blushing like a mad woman. Bella had waited happily for her boyfriend. Suddenly, the young Antichrist had appeared holding a picnic basket. \"You made us dinner?\" Bella said smiling. \"Yes I did. Now, how about we go for a walk?\" Damien said using his free hand to hold Bella's. \"Valentine's Day is one of my favorite days of the year. I'm a total cliché.\" \"Yes you are. I love that about you.\" Damien said smiling while intertwining their fingers. Bella always felt like every time Damien said he loved her that it was like her soul was a bell that had just been rung and her heart began to fly. The two stopped by a lake next to the academy and walked to almost the end of the dock and Damien laid out a blanket before sitting on it with Bella. Pulling out a BLT for each of them along with a bag of Nacho Cheese flavored Doritos and chocolate chip cookies. He also pulled out a lantern and he lit it. The couple ate together as they watched the sun set. \"I thought I should take you here.\" Damien said smiling at her. \"Why?\" \"This was the first place I went... After I found out I was the Antichrist.\" \"Really?\" \"It was horrible, finding this mark on the back of my head. I was so terrified I ran all the way here. Granted, a lot of bad things happened by me being the Antichrist, but it truly was horrible when I found out. That's why I brought you here.\" \"I don't understand, sweetie.\" \"You are the first, and you may be the only, actual good thing about me being the Antichrist.\" He smiled at her and took her hand. Bella felt so full of love she immediately began kissing him. The two couldn't have asked for a better Valentine's Day. Elsewhere, a black haired dark eyed girl looked through binoculars through a window at the couple with hatred and jealousy. \"When can we finally make our move?! I want Damien in my arms instead of that damned blonde's!\" \"We must be patient. I promise you, in due time, when the opportunity presents itself, we will make our move.\"[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 It was Saturday March 26th, 1983. Damien had made sure to go to Bella's home early. He straightened up his suit a little as he knocked. Bella answered looking pretty in a black dress falling to her knees and long sleeved with silver sequences at the neck of the dress, black leggings, and black flats. \"Hey, what's the matter? Why're we wearing black?\" Bella asked worried about her boyfriend. It wasn't like him to just not tell her things, the phone call the night before telling her to wear all black scared her enough. \"You'll know later. Is your father home?\" \"No, he went to work. Come on in.\" Bella smiled letting him in. \"So, anything new, love?\" Damien asked. \"Nope, my goofy boyfriend asked me last night to dress all in black and then refused to tell me why. But I made him breakfast, anyway.\" Bella said leading him to the kitchen showing him a plate of scrambled eggs, bacon, strawberries, and orange juice. \"Thank you, love. How'd you know I'd skip breakfast at my house?\" Damien said sitting down. \"Because I know you, Damien. I also know there's a serious reason we're dressed as we are.\" \"And how do you know that?\" \"I told you. I know you, Damien.\" The two smiled at one another before Damien began eating his breakfast. Suddenly, the phone rings and Bella goes to answer it. \"Hello, Giles residence, Bella Giles speaking whom am I speaking with?\" Damien looked to his girlfriend as she spoke. \"Yes, as a matter of fact he is, who is asking for him?\" Bella said puzzled, after the response on the other end her eyes grew wide and her face lost color and the phone fumbled in her hand a minute. \"I am sorry could you repeat that once more? I think I heard you incorrectly... I could've sworn you just told me you were Ronald Rea- Oh, I didn't mishear you.\" Bella looked to Damien as the fork in his hand fell against his plate. Ronald Reagan, the President of the United States had just called his girlfriend. \"Damien, our president would like to speak with you.\" Bella said holding the phone to him. Damien couldn't get out of his seat fast enough to answer. \"H-Hello Mister President! How are you, Sir?\" \"I am good, Mister Thorn. I had just spoke with Paul Buher about the Internship program we're going to try here at the White House for certain teenagers who want to be Politicians that we think could be beneficiary to the future, given your record at St. Francis Academy and your background with Political figures, and since you lived in the White House awhile with President Nixon when you were younger, and well, I think it'd be a great opportunity for you. What do you say, lad, would you like to take the Internship after you graduate from the Academy?\" \"Say yes! This is exactly what you need, say yes!\" Bella said quietly to Damien, hearing the president from the other end. \"May I have some time to think on it, Sir? Obviously there must be many details to talk about, but I will more than likely accept.\" \"Absolutely, we'll talk again soon, young man. Have a good day, Mister Thorn.\" \"You, too, Sir.\" \"Goodbye.\" \"Goodbye.\" After handing up the phone he turned to Bella who looked at him shocked. \"The President of the United States just offered you an internship and you didn't automatically say yes?! What the Hell, Damien?! It's my job to make sure you do your job and help you, I cannot believe you didn't accept tha-\" she was cut off by him kissing her. After the two finished their kiss she gave him a slight glare. \"Don't use my feelings against me. So why didn't you automatically accept?\" \"Oh I don't doubt that I'll accept. I know who I'll be. And I will be the man I'm born to be, but for the moment, I just want to be a seventeen year old boy who enjoys being a boyfriend to a pretty seventeen year old girl. To feel as normal as I will more than likely ever be. But I swear to you, I will accept his offer.\" Damien said holding her close. \"Alright.\" Bella responded smiling lightly kissing him. He went to go finish his breakfast. \"After I've finished, I'm going to take you to meet the most important person in my life, excluding you, of course.\" \"I've met Paul, though.\" Bella said confused. \"Paul may be somewhat important in my life but he is nowhere close to the most important person in my life.\" \"Then... Who is?\" Mark Thorn displayed on the tombstone in front of the young couple. They studied the dates of Mark's birth and death, and the description of the sort of person he was. Bella had been holding the plastic pink tulips and looked to Damien who stared sadly at the tombstone. \"Before you came into my life, Mark was my best friend. He was the brother I never had. I really wish you could've met him. He would've liked you. Every day I think of something to tell him, or something I wish he'd been there for. I've had a lot of bad things happen, and have done a lot of bad things because I am who I am. But killing Mark... Is still the worst thing I've ever done. Killing him was necessary, he found me out... And refused to stand by me. He became a threat and was going to expose me, I begged him to stand by me, to not go against me. But he didn't want to join me... And I had to kill him because of it. I don't care that it was necessary... I wish I could take it back.\" tears filled Damien's eyes as Bella placed the tulips on the grave and hugged her boyfriend. After the two went to Damien's home they instantly heard some odd noises. \"What the Hell could that be?\" Bella asked cautiously as the two listened hard to hear where it had come from, the two slowly came to the hallway closet. Damien opened the door to have a crow fly out, making the teenagers duck for cover and watch in shock as the crow flew to the living room appearing to have dropped something. Bella didn't realize when they stood up again that she flipped on a ceiling fan. \"HOLY SHIT TURN THE FAN OFF WE DON'T NEED BLOOD ALL OVER THE HOUSE!\" Damien yelled running to open windows and doors for the crow to fly out if while Bella turned off the fan and helped him. The two calmed down after the crow flew out the front door. But they did notice as something sparkled on the living room floor. Bella bent down and picked up a ring, more than likely what the crow had dropped earlier. The white gold ring had a large blue oval shaped sapphire while small round diamonds surrounding it. She slipped it on her finger, it fit perfectly. Damien smirked at his girlfriend. \"What?\" Bella asked. \"I think we should consider this my father's way of officially approving you.\" Damien laughed as he held her closer. \"How about you and I go see a movie, hmm?\" \"What did you have in mind?\" \"This is the last weekend they're going to have The Entity at the Theater... We could go.\" \"The Antichrist wants to see a horror movie?\" Bella said smiling. \"As I remember, that's the Whore of Babylon's favorite movie genre too, correct?\" \"Yes, you are correct, sir.\" \"So do you want to go?\" \"Hell yes I want to go. I can go show off my new ring.\" Bella said admiring it laughing as the two held hands and left the house.[Chapter 8] Chapter 8 It was Saturday, April 9th, 1983. Damien had been having a nice dream about himself at a Toto concert and being crowd surfed while Africa was playing loudly until he heard footsteps in his room. The boy immediately grabbed the knife kept under his pillow and went into attack position. \"Holy Crap! What did I do?!\" Bella said jumping into defense mode seeing Damien holding the knife. \"Goodness, I'm so sorry! You startled me!\" \"Me?! You look like you're about to stab me!\" Bella said in disbelief. Her boyfriend sighed and placed the knife back under his pillow and looked to her with a raised eyebrow. \"So, what are you doing here anyway, love?\" \"Paul has a surprise for you downstairs if you'd like to come and see!\" Bella said skipping out of the room. Damien got out of bed and followed the blonde girl downstairs to see his guardian holding a set of car keys. \"I know your birthday is a few months away... But I thought you deserve this.\" Paul said tossing the keys to the seventeen year old boy. \"A Car? You mean I have my own car? I don't always have to have Murray drive me everywhere?!\" Damien said shocked. \"That's right. I figured since you've had your own license and since you've never had any issues driving when you borrowed my car, maybe you shouldn't be completely dependent on Murray for a ride. Look outside.\" Damien ran excitedly to the closest window to see a Black 1982 Porsche 911, licensed and all. \"It's wonderful!\" Damien said excitedly. \"I'm glad you like it, Damien. Maybe you could take your girlfriend for a ride. I have towels, a first aid kit, and some emergency money in the trunk.\" Paul said leaving the room. Bella smiled and walked to Damien. \"Admit it, you're a happy Antichrist.\" She said poking his cheek. \"A very happy one at that. Get ready; we're going for a ride!\" Damien said to her running back upstairs. \"But the weatherman said it was going to rain, and the clouds are already gray!\" Bella called after him. \"As long as we aren't going to church, it doesn't matter much to me, pet!\" He responded. Bella accepted this and gathered her things and stood to wait by the door. She overlooked herself, she chose a black pull over sweater with purple stars and triangles on it with a purple Tee-shirt underneath and boot cut jeans with purple sequined flats. As she tapped her foot her silver colored large jewelry made noise. Damien ran down in his only pair of jeans, a dark green short sleeved button up shirt with a brown jacket over it and brown shoes and smiled to his girlfriend. \"Are you ready, love?\" \"Yes I am!\" She responded. The two ran to his new car. \"Are you going to give the car a name?\" Bella asked. \"Probably not. I always found it absurd. It's a car.\" Damien answered simply getting in the driver's seat. Bella nodded agreeing with him sitting in the passenger seat. The two had been driving around for a while when the rain started and started hard. \"When I was little I hated rain, but lately I've come to love the sound of the rain. Especially in the summer, I open my window but not my screen and just listen to the rain.\" Bella shared with her boyfriend. \"I'm a more warm weather person... But then again, everyone in Hell wants ice water; even the Antichrist doesn't mind water once in a while. Want to listen to the radio?\" \"Sure!\" Damien turned it on to the very beginning of \"Africa\" by Toto. \"Oh I love this song!\" Bella said as she started humming to it. \"Me, too!\" Damien responded as he turned and parked by the local park. \"May I have this dance?\" Damien asked his girlfriend. \"In the rain?!\" \"Sure, why not? It's just water... Besides... Why can't I bless the rains of Chicago?\" Damien winked and turned the volume louder got out of the car and into the grass, still clearly hearing the song. Bella quickly joined him and the two began to happily dance together as the song played. They even began to sing along. \"It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you... There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do... I bless the rains down in Africa... Gonna take some time to do the things we never had...\" The two smiled and kissed as Damien lifted her up in the air and spun her around before setting her back on the ground. Bella's hair was soaking wet and her eyes shone brighter in the rain. She looked beautiful, to him. \"I love you!\" He yelled with a smile over the song. \"I love you, too!\" \"Would you consider Chicago rains blessed?\" \"Not enough ye- oh my god!\" Bella said the last part in a scream as she slipped in the mud. \"Bella! Are you alrigh- oh goodness.\" Damien's face grew bright red as he saw nearly half her body now clad in mud. \"Don't. You. Dare. Laugh. Or a hundred men REALLY can't drag me away from you.\" Bella said slowly and seriously. The last line broke it; Damien fell against the hood of the car laughing so hard he was crying. \"Oh you think this is funny?\" Bella said trying not to laugh herself. \"Yes, I do!\" \"Take me home! I need a bath! Hurry boy, there's a tub waiting for me!\" Bella said laughing hard as Damien laughing harder as he barely made it to the trunk to quickly take out the towels and move them to cover the passenger seat. \"Hurry, I'll get you home.\" Damien said smiling. Bella did sitting on the towels and realized one of her shoes was missing. \"Aw, for Africa's sake!\" Bella said placing her head in her hands as Damien got in the driver's seat starting the car. As Toto's Africa began to fade, Damien decided to turn the radio off. \"You know... You sort of look like Cinderella.\" Damien commented to her. Bella looked down at herself and then to Damien as if he was on drugs. \"Excuse me?\" \"Well not when she was at the ball, but after midnight. You have dirt on you and your missing one shoe. Hmm… CinderBella!\" His face broke into an adorable goofy grin that made Bella feel lighter. \"I prefer you calling me love over that.\" Bella said smirking. \"We'll see.\" As the two arrived back to Damien's home, he turned off the car and ran around the passenger side and took her bridal style, towels and all, inside and to Damien's bathroom before placing her gently on the tile floor. \"I'll let you take a bath in my tub and use my bathrobe until we get you some clothes and shoes, alright CinderBella?\" \"its love, damn it!\" Bella scolded. Damien just smirked in a teasing manner making Bella blush. \"Alright.\" Bella finally said standing as Damien left the bathroom closing the door. As Bella sat in the bath tub she looked to the closed door. \"Damien, are you there?\" \"Yes I am. Did you need something?\" \"No. Just wanted to talk is all.\" \"Alright. It's lucky for us that you had a backup set of clothes here just in case. Maybe you should keep some stuff here anyway, we could give you a key, your own room and bathroom...\" Damien suggested. \"Ha! Isn't that an idea?\" Bella responded. The two were quiet for a minute before Damien started singing more of Africa by Toto, Bella joining him. \"It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you... There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do... I bless the rains down in Africa... Gonna take some time to do the things we never had... The wild dogs cry out in the night, as they grow restless longing for some solitary company. I know that I must do what's right, sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti... I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become...\" Once Bella was clean and in a pair of black shorts and a neon green long sleeved shirt with one shoulder hanging off with \"I Heart Cindi Lauper\" in neon pink on it, she felt much better. \"Damien... I still don't have shoes.\" Bella said nervously. \"Hold on, I'll go talk to Paul.\" As the teenaged boy left his bedroom he tripped over a pair of cork flip flops with black flowers on them neither of the two had seen before in their lives. \"What the Hell- Where did these come from?!\" Damien said shocked as Bella stared at the shoes. \"They're petty.\" She said lightly. Then Damien noticed the black flowers were sequined and realized the irony, even though at first they seem plain... They really had something special about them. Like Bella. Damien then realized where the shoes came from and laughed as he picked up the shoes and slipped them on his girlfriend's feet as if she were Cinderella. \"Apparently, my father supports the idea of you being CinderBella.\" Damien Said smiling at her. \"I really don't like that nick name... But I love these shoes.\" Bella said leaning down to kiss her Dark Prince Charming. \"Does that mean I can call you that?\" He asked as she helped him up. \"Absolutely not.\" \"Alright, love.\" \"See? It's not that hard!\" \"As easy as blessing the rains in Africa.\" Damien responded winking as he picked her up to carry her to make her a late lunch.[Chapter 9] Chapter 9 It was Friday, May 27th 1983. Bella had been walking through the Academy with Rose, the two girls incredibly sad. It was their last day of school. Bella looked around; this academy was where she met Damien where they fell in love. It was painful thinking of leaving even for the summer. \"I'm sorry again I haven't spent too much time with you lately, Rose.\" \"Stop apologizing! It's a good thing for you and Damien. Are you excited about tonight?\" \"Yes I am! But I still feel guilty, you are my best friend and you're leaving now!\" \"That's why letters exist, Bella. When I get the money, I'll come and visit you and it will be like I've never even left.\" The two girls hugged crying lightly. \"Bella.\" Foster said tapping the blonde girl's shoulder. \"Yes?\" \"Um... Mr. Ruby said he wanted to see you.\" \"Oh, alright.\" Bella said smiling lightly before walking to the classroom. It was empty, dark, and the blinds and curtains had been drawn. \"Oh, Hello Bella... Close the door.\" Mr. Ruby said giving her a strange look. \"Um... Sir? Are you okay?\" Bella said uneasily closing the door. \"Have I told you... That while I was a teenager that I found God?\" \"God, Sir?\" \"Yeah... Our father who art in Heaven. Hallowed be thy name? Come here... Pray with me...\" \"I'm sorry Sir; I don't share your faith.\" Bella said stepping away from him. \"Of course you don't... Do you know anything about Russia?\" \"Sir, pardon my manners, but you are walking and speaking strangely. Have you been drinking something? Should I get you some crackers or coffee?\" \"Answer the question. I asked you first, young lady.\" \"Yes sir, I know a lot about Russia's culture. What exactly did you have in mind?\" \"Russian Roulette.\" Mr. Ruby said grabbing a gun in the drawer. Bella immediately readied herself to move and fight. \"Sir... What are you doing...\" \"Let's play.\" And with that he immediately shot at her and she moved a desk to shield herself. The two began circling each other. \"What the Hell is wrong with you?!\" Bella hissed. \"Damien... He's the little horn, isn't he? Anyone who tries to stop him dies... But the other day I considered, what if... He killed himself? Nothing hurts like losing your first love. Like how he took mine.\" He tried shooting her again, it smashed through the window behind her and screams could be heard as the sound of a body from outside hit the ground. \"Sir... I think you've had too much to drink...\" \"Oh save it! A few years ago... The love of my young life, Joan Hart, died on a deserted high way. She declined my marriage proposal to go study archeology... And last night, a group of men... Priests... Told me Joan didn't die by accident. That Damien Thorn killed her, because he's the Antichrist. Obviously, I didn't believe it at first... But then... It all sort of clicked. He killed the woman I love... Now I kill the woman he loves.\" \"Sir, if you know what is best for yourself, you will put that gun away.\" \"Not a chance. I want revenge.\" \"You poor damn fool.\" \"Excuse me?!\" \"You. Poor. Damn. Fool.\" Bella repeated slowly stepping towards him. The wind around them blew harshly through the smashed window moving papers and desks. The drunken teacher seemed to be forgetting Bella had a force from beyond who obviously wanted her alive. \"Ruby! Frank Ruby what the Hell is going on?!\" Sargent Neff yelled from outside the closed door along with other yelling teenagers trying to kick inside, the teacher's desk that had now been moved by the wind blocking the doorway along with papers blocking the door's window. \"What are you?!\" He yelled as he was forced against the wall by the wind, the gun falling from his hand. \"I'm just a girl, Sir.\" She said the last word with hiss and a wicked grin as she moved fast sliding to a corner in the far end of the classroom while the other of the large windows smashed by the force of the wind and the glass flew powerfully into the body of Mr. Ruby, killing him. As the wind slowed Sergeant Neff and four cadets finally broke down the door and moved the desk and moved carefully into the room. \"Oh, my god!\" Neff said observing the mess before him. \"Let us through!\" Rose and Damien yelled finally reaching the room and hurried carefully to the corner where Bella had been huddled. \"You two, take Miss Giles to the nurse's office immediately!\" Neff barked. Damien picked Bella up bridal style and he and Rose carefully moved out of the room. As the three passed the hall, a black haired girl passed quickly saying, \"Some weather, huh, Bella?\" Bella looked back but no one girl was in sight, she narrowed her eyes feeling the pain and blood pouring on her arm, she was not in the mood for a smart remark. \"Thank God you're alive! Even if you had quite a few pieces of glass in your arm, they removed it and now you're okay!\" Rose said weeping as she held Bella's hand while she lay on her hospital bed in the nurse's office. Bella had indeed taken six small pieces of glass to the back of her lower arm that she had used to shield her face. Thankfully, the glass didn't go too deep and it was easily removed and bandaged up. Damien's shirt had been drenched in Bella's blood so, to the blonde girl's delight, Damien had been standing by the sink in the Nurse's office trying to clean his shirt as much as he could. \"I-I just can't believe one of my teachers tried to shoot me! Speaking of which, who DID he shoot outside?!\" Bella asked in tears. She noticed Damien and Sierra tense up. \"Oh my goodness... WHO was shot ?!\" Bella said straightening up. \"Unfortunately... It was Foster.\" \"What?! Is he okay?! Where is he?!\" The blonde was very scared now about her friend. The shirtless boy immediately took her other hand causing her face to heat up. \"Please don't get excited, love. You've just been through a trauma; I don't think that all of this in one day would be healthy for you.\" \"Stop patronizing me and answer me, already, Damien!\" Bella said narrowing her eyes. This completely shocked the two, it was a rare thing for her to lash out at the boy, but one of her four friends in the world had just been shot and she was in no mood to play games or fuss around, not even with him. Damien got the hint and let her hand go. \"He's in the Emergency Room at Saint Gerard's Hospital as far as I know, no one's heard about his condition but he wasn't pronounced Dead on Arrival, so hopefully he'll pull through.\" Damien answered honestly. Bella looked over to Rose. \"How's Teddy handling this?\" Bella asked. It was a good question, after all, Teddy and Foster were best friends in the way that Bella and Rose were. If Rose had been shot, Bella wouldn't know what she'd do. \"He called a taxi to leave as soon as he could to go see him at the hospital the last time I checked, I don't know if he's left yet or what. He said he'd be back by the graduation ceremony tonight.\" Rose answered. \"Are they even having a graduating ceremony at this point?\" Damien asked with a raised eyebrow. \"It's a good question, Mister Thorn. After all, we have a student in the Emergency Room, one who was the victim of a near-homicide, a dead teacher, and on top of that, a horrible mess of glass and blood. There's a guarantee of press conferences, police investigations, the works. Thankfully, I convinced the police officers to investigate tomorrow, so yes, the ceremony will still proceed- but for the moment, I've made it optional to anyone too affected by today's events, and the same goes for the Cotillion.\" Sergeant Neff answered walking into the room. \"Rose, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like you to please tell the other cadets this news. Thank you.\" \"Yes Sir.\" Rose answered squeezing her best friend's hand before leaving the room. Once she did, Neff closed and locked the door and turned to the two teenagers. \"Damien. Why are you not wearing a shirt?\" Damien and Bella blushed furiously at the question. \"B-Bella's blood was staining it so I had been trying to wash out what I could while I had the chance in the sink, Sir.\" The platoon leader's eyes quickly flashed what almost appeared to be anger. \"I see. Young lady, would you explain why Frank Ruby just tried to kill you? One would think that being the Whore of Babylon, the Woman behind the Man Damien will one day become; you'd be a little more careful about your identities... I didn't spend my life helping Damien's Father's plan just to let one little slip destroy it all.\" Neff seemed to say rather hatefully. Damien looked uneasily at Bella, she had been bitter towards the person she loved more than anyone, who knows how she'd respond to what the Sergeant just said. Bella took a deep breath. \"He didn't know who I was, Sir. A group of priests had apparently told him who Damien was, and that he killed Joan Hart, who was Mr. Ruby's first love. He was drunk and wanted revenge, so he thought killing me, Damien's first love, would strike Damien with the same grief and would cause him to commit suicide instead of Mr. Ruby having to try to kill Damien himself. He didn't know who I was; he simply knew I was Damien's girlfriend.\" Bella said simply. \"I see, and what exactly do you plan to say to the police?\" \"That he was drunk and tried to seduce me, when I refused and threatened to tell, he pulled out a gun and the rest... Well, I suppose I'll call it a miracle. That it was an act of God protecting me from that horrible perverted man. Thankfully, I was able to move to a corner where I couldn't be fatally harmed. Everyone will consider me such a brave young Lady... And when Damien campaigns and had such a Hero for a wife... That will really look good.\" Bella's face grew into a smirk as she explained her story. Damien smiled at her, he admitted, THAT was a fantastic idea. He knew how much Bella loved irony, and at the moment, he understood why. He could laugh about it, the \"Act Of God\" that saved the Whore of Babylon. What a laugh. \"I see. Well, with that, I suppose I will see you later tonight. Oh, and Damien, before I forget, there's someone I want you to meet tonight.\" \"I'm sorry, Sir, but since it's optional, I think it'd be best for Bella and I to be with Foster in the Hospital.\" Damien responded. The older man cringed slightly before nodding. \"Well, I understand that. Give my regards to the boy, if possible.\" \"We will, Sir.\" Bella said smiling brightly at him. Neff didn't even glance towards her as he left the room. Bella's smile dropped. \"Something's not right with him.\" She stated simply. \"I wouldn't say that, sure he's... Odd... But, he did protect me for years.\" \"Alright... I trust you. I'm sorry I was rude to you before.\" \"I understand why you were. I'm just happy you're alright, love.\" Damien said leaning down and kissing the girl. Bella, Rose, and Damien walked into the Hospital together. Teddy had not returned for the graduation ceremony, which, thankfully for him he would soon find out wouldn't count against him anyway. The girls decided to wear their white dresses anyway. Rose was in a floor length white dress with short flowing sleeves that had roses embroidered on the end of the sleeves, the neck, waist, and bottom of the dress accompanied by rose red jewelry. Bella had been in a floor length white dress with a sweetheart neck line and very thick straps and lavender colored jewelry, a matching lavender corsage on her hand, holding her Polaroid camera and Damien obviously in his special fancier Navy Blue uniform. \"Right this way.\" A red headed nurse said leading them into a room where a very fragile looking Foster laid in his bed and a pale Teddy sitting beside him. The nurse left quietly. \"Well don't you three girls look pretty?\" Foster joked weakly smiling at the trio that joined the room. \"Very funny.\" Damien said sarcastically smiling. In that instance the boy realized that Foster, Teddy, and Rose were indeed his true friends... The instance afterwards, he realized that one day that would change, but there was time to think about that later. Rose immediately ran to Teddy's side. \"I had a corsage for you, Rosie; I know I said I'd be back but... I didn't want to leave him.\" Teddy said. \"I understand.\" Rose said kissing his cheek. \"Man, I love you, Rosie.\" That certainly shut the room up. It was the first time Teddy actually admitted it. Rose's face broke into a wide grin. \"I love you, too!\" She said holding him closer. \"Oh and about the graduation ceremony, it's optional, so us not being there is not a big deal given what happened today.\" The girl added. \"What happened to you?\" Foster asked Bella referring to her bandaged arm. \"Mr. Ruby... He tried to shoot-\" \"So that's who shot me...\" The injured boy said lightly thinking. \"And, a miracle happened, a storm hit and the wind blew the windows apart and the glass stopped him... Although, my arm did get injured.\" \"Why was he trying to shoot you?\" \"He was drunk and trying to seduce me, I threatened to leave and tell Sergeant Neff...\" Bella said tearing up a little. \"Please don't cry... Please? Hey, if it saved your life, I'm glad I could take the bullet. Come on, come here.\" Foster said. Bella obeyed and Foster used all his strength to move his arms and the two hugged. Damien took a picture of the hug with the camera and smiled at them. \"Speaking of which... Um...\" Rose said awkwardly. \"The bullet went clean right through me, didn't hit any serious organs or anything, which made no sense because it hurt like Hell. The doctor says I'll be just fine, I'll just be in pain for quite a while is all.\" Foster responded. \"Well, we're happy that you're alive.\" Damien said smiling. The group continued to have a good time, well, as much as they could with their circumstances. They turned on the radio in the room and the two couples danced a few times and the others, Teddy and Damien would stand aside while their girlfriends \"Danced\" with Foster. Dance of course meaning the girls danced beside him while he smiled largely and holding one of their hands each and occasionally moving when he had the strength to. The whole night being constantly photographed, but unfortunately, they did have to leave eventually. Rose and Teddy went in a taxi together while Murray drove Bella and Damien. \"That could've been you.\" Damien mumbled to her. \"But it wasn't.\" \"You know I love you, right, sweetheart?\" \"I know. I love you two.\" \"Hold on, let me roll up the privacy visor before you kids start getting too romantic.\" Murray teased before doing exactly that. The Antichrist looked to his girlfriend and immediately began to tackle her with kisses, careful of her arm.[Chapter 10] Chapter 10 Bella quietly snuck into Damien's bedroom, it was 10:45 in the morning, Monday, June 6th 1983. Damien's eighteenth birthday. Bella was dressed in a black tank top and a purple and black plaid skirt, with black flats. She held a beautifully wrapped box in her hands and set it in a chair by Damien's bed before leaving the room. After a few minutes, she returned, holding a tray of eggs, began, sausage, pancakes, and strawberries accompanied by a glass of milk. Damien opened one eye hearing her steps and smiles at her. \"What's the occasion?\" Damien joked sitting up in bed. Bella rolled her eyes and chuckled giving him his breakfast in bed, catching him taking a glance down her tank top as she leaned over when she handed it to him. \"Damien! Peeking down my top! Naughty boy, and here I thought you were a gentleman.\" Bella teased. Damien smirked and took a sip of his milk. \"It's not like it's something I haven't seen before, love. And I am a gentleman, that doesn't mean I don't think of those... Activities .\" He smirked wider as he took a bite from his pancake and leaving Bella blushing like crazy. It was true, the two had gone past second base more than once, and even an occasional third base every once in a while, never a home run though. The thought made Bella blush even harder. \"So, what is your and Paul's plan for me for today?\" He winked at her. \"Paul is taking a vacation for today and tomorrow and I, being proudly the Ambassador of Fun as of December 1982, have decided to throw you a party. Not a kid's party but a far out, completely fly party with all our friends from the Academy. No adults aloud. But first, you are going to make a call to the president about that internship, then relax and watch TV, read a book, or whatever you want to do with your free time. Sound good?\" \"Sounds great, love. Wait, is that a present by my bed?\" Damien smiled largely looking at the gift. Bella smiled, picked it up and brought it to him. \"Can I open it now?\" Damien asked with hopeful eyes. \"Of course, silly!\" Damien ripped open the gift and lifted the lid of the box and pulled out a Satanic Bible, a new fancy watch, a blue and red diagonal striped tie, a green and yellow diagonal striped tie, a bag of candy, a green and purple hacky sack, and a sketch drawn by Bella showing a logo with 'Disciples of the Watch' on it. Damien looked to his girlfriend with a curious eyebrow. \"Disciples of the Watch?\" He asked. \"Well, you have so many satanic helpers, and there's bound to be more, why not give them a formal name?\" \"Well, I like the concept. I'm not sure if Disciples of the Watch fit it, but it's a nice start, love. I love your gifts though! Thank you.\" He smiled at her. She smiled and kissed him lightly. \"I'll go decorate; you eat your breakfast and call the president.\" Bella said as she turned to leave the room. \"Bella?\" \"Yeah?\" \"I love you.\" \"I love you, too.\" Bella said smiling as she finally left the room. Damien ate his breakfast happily, skimming through his new bible. And he did talk to the president more about the internship, as promised. But, he still wanted some more time to think on accepting it. At 5 p.m. Damien went downstairs in jeans and a short sleeved white button up shirt and his green sneakers, probably the most casual outfit he owned, his hair still wet from the shower he had just taken. The house looked pretty damn good for only having one person do the work, he noticed the few tables that had been brought in covered with bowls and plates of various snack foods, candy, burgers, hot dogs, and chicken wings, and of course a few boxes of pizza. \"Bella? Are you here, my darling?\" And right on time, she walked in from the other hallway where her room and bathroom and was wearing a blue skirt with a back belt, blue boots, a black tank top, and a blue short sleeved jacket, accompanied by blue fishnet gloves and black jewelry. \"Well, you certainly look pretty.\" Damien said as he leaned down and gave her a quick kiss. \"Thank you, you look good, too. Ready for a fun birthday?\" \"Wouldn't be too horrible.\" And the party was fun; Damien got to see his friends, a recovering Foster, Teddy, and not to mention Rose. Rose was leaving for an art school in New York City in two days so was also getting ready to say goodbye to all her friends. Unfortunately, she and Teddy knew they wouldn't last long distance, but Teddy was in love with Rose and more than happy to sneak off with her to somewhere else in the house for undoubtedly very private activities. There were also plenty of presents, although one brunette girl with a mass of freckles in a floral patterned dress with her hair up in a scrunchie, named Zoey, kept trying to come into him and suck him into a game of spin the bottle which a group of kids had started. \"Alright birthday boy, you get to spin first!\" Her high pitched voice said. Damien rolled his eyes and simply pointed the ketchup bottle at Bella and kissed her deeply. \"Consider yourself lucky, Blondie.\" Zoey whispered to Bella when she thought Damien couldn't hear. Bella's jealousy flashed and she elbowed the other girl hard in the rib. Everyone seemed to have a great time will talking, Dancing, eating, or playing games. Damien noted happily how... Normal he felt. He knew deep down he and his girlfriend still weren't actually normal, but... This was rather close, and well, Damien enjoyed it. After the guests had all left and the mess had been cleaned up, the couple fell onto the couch next to the fireplace, the fire still roaring. \"Now... How about some wine, as a personal celebration?\" Bella suggested. \"Sure. Let me get a bottle and two glasses.\" Damien returned in a moment with the wine and glasses, and Bella raised her glass, \"A toast, to Damien Thorn.\" \"A toast, to the love of my life.\" The two clinked their glasses and drank their wine as they discussed the party. After their fourth round of wine, Bella and Damien went and found the ketchup bottle from earlier. Bella smiled and imitated Zoey's voice, \"Alright birthday boy, you get to spin first!\" \"Gladly, love.\" Damien smirked spinning it on the coffee table, it shooting to some random direction in the darkness, Bella smiled. \"Looks like you're stuck with Blondie!\" Bella said still in her Zoey voice. \"Please stop talking that way.\" \"Alright.\" Bella said in her normal voice before climbing into Damien's lap beginning to kiss him deeply. The kissing obviously led to kissing A LOT, and it seemed timeless as the two kept going through bases... But it was different this time. Things were getting very hot, very hazy, and very intense. \"Damien?\" Bella whimpered in her boyfriend's ear. \"Y-yes?\" \"I have one more present for you...\" She looked him in the eye and smirked. Damien's eyes widened a moment in realization before quickly pulling her off the couch still kissing her as the young couple struggled to get to Damien's bedroom. It seemed like way too long before Damien had Bella pinned against his bedroom door kissing her more passionately than ever before. Damien was losing his self-control. His and Bella's kissing were getting hungrier while they ran their fingers through each other's hair, their tongues seeming to dance as Damien fumbled behind Bella's back to open the door to his bedroom. After finally opening it, he lifted his girlfriend up and she wrapped her legs around his waist as their frantic kissing continued. After a few steps into his room, Damien being sure to reach behind him closing the door and locking it, before going to his large soft navy blue bed and laying the woman he loves down on it. He observed her, her eyes were half lidded begging him to continue, her cheeks so bright and pink, her lips slightly swollen and he noticed her lightly trembling with anticipation. \"You sure about this?\" Damien asked leaning down towards her. \"Yes. I'm positive. P-please, Damien... I love you...\" \"I love you too... Alright, Happy birthday to me.\" He said lightly biting her neck as he began undressing themselves, proceeding to the sweetest, most passionate, and most beautiful experience of their lives. The two gave each other their virginities.[Chapter 11] Chapter 11 It was July 8th, 1983. Four days before on the Fourth of July, Damien Thorn and Bella Giles hosted another party, although a lot less people then their party a month before showed up. Mostly for the fact that a lot of the people they knew had been Rose's friends and like Rose, had already moved on to bigger and better places. Thankfully Teddy and Foster didn't abandon the couple and even though Teddy had been sad that Rose was no longer his girlfriend, everyone had a great time eating barbecued food and watching the Thorn firework show. A lot of Paul Buhers friends were there too, including Ronald Reagan, the president of the United States. Damien and he spent quite a lot of time talking more about the internship position, with the support of Bella, of course. The two felt completely honored when the President told them that he thought they looked good together. After only the teenagers were left at the party, they lit all the sparklers and swam in the lake nearby and had a great time. Now four days later, they had finally cleaned everything up and were in the kitchen dancing together to \"Beat It\" by Michael Jackson singing and laughing when Bella failed to do the newest move by him, the \"Moon Walk\" as people were calling it, slipping and falling to the floor on one of her purple leg warmers landing on her bottom. The girl had been spending quite a lot of time with Damien ever since they started spending the night together. In fact, the blonde girl had even been given a key to the house and was allowed to keep some clothes, bathroom products, her back up Polaroid camera, tape player, and some music tapes in her own personal room and bathroom in the house. The blonde multicolored eyed girl laid down on her back laughing as her boyfriend made sure she was okay. \"You alright, love?\" He asked lying beside her as \"Beat It\" became \"Every Breath You Take\" by the Police. The brunette boy quickly got their very large order of the new attraction, Chicken McNuggets, from McDonalds they had bought earlier off of the counter and they fed them to each other. \"Yeah, I'm fine. I just hate these damned leg warmers; I don't know why everyone thinks they're so cool.\" Bella laughed removing her leg warmers revealing the bottom half of her aquamarine colored leggings, leaving her purple tank top tunic shirt falling to her upper thighs, her aquamarine jewelry clinking as she threw the leg warmers across the room carelessly, eating another McNugget, then feeding another one to her boyfriend laughing harder as Damien pulled her closer kissing an nibbling that special ticklish spot on her ear lobe. \"I love you.\" Bella said to her boyfriend feeding him once more. \"I love you more.\" Damien teased kissing her nose and feeding her one again as well. \"Lies! You can't possibly love me more!\" Bella laughed before swallowing. \"How about... We love each other equally?\" Damien tried rising an eyebrow smiling feeding himself one. \"Sure.\" Bella said getting up and as she ate the last McNugget, took a few steps away she looked behind her, \"I love you more!\" Bella yelled. \"You little...\" Damien said getting up smiling. \"No!\" Bella laughed as she began to be chased by the Antichrist. After a few minutes of Cat and Mouse, Damien finally caught up to her in one of the storage rooms and the two slipped and fell tangled in one another laughing despite knowing they'll probably have a few bruises. \"Hey, what's that?\" Bella said as she crawled over to a big box of empty jars noticing the reflection off one of them. \"Oh, just a load of jars we never use. Paul thought we'd fill them with this jam he introduced to Thorn Industries a few years ago, and we signed a contract with this jar making company to use our jams in, and so they gave us the gift of one big bloody box of glass jars. We never use these ones, though.\" Damien explained as he crawled and sat next to his girlfriend. \"You know what we could do?\" Bella said smiling. \"What?\" \"Get a wagon and two pairs of wood shop goggles and my Polaroid Camera, and meet me at the front door in ten minutes. You and I, mister Thorn, are going on a field trip.\" Bella said dragging the box of jars out of the room an evil grin on her face. \"What in the name of Satan are you up to, this time?\" Damien said crossing his arms smirking. \"You'll see! Trust me; I'm the Ambassador of Fun!\" Bella responded winking as she disappeared. \"Are you sure this is safe, Bella? Glass could get in our eyes or something.\" Damien commented as he dragged the wagon full of the empty jars down to the Brick built tool shed a little ways behind the house. \"That's why we're wearing wood shop goggles. We'll be fine, Damien. I promise.\" Bella said smiling at him. She walked to the wagon and pulled out an empty glass jar and stared at the brick wall before them. \"Take a picture while I do this, and then join me. Just grab one... Think of something that's made you frustrated or angry, then... You let it out. For example. This... Is for my mother's death.\" Bella said before throwing the jar overhand as hard as she could relishing the feeling when the jar hit the wall with a loud smash as Damien took the picture. \"I won't lie; it might make me crazy... But it does help. Try it.\" Bella said handing him another jar. Damien put down the picture and camera and accepted the jar and thought a moment as Bella grabbed the camera. There were so many things to pick from, Damien thought to himself. But the first was easiest. \"This is for me having to kill my best friend.\" Damien muttered before throwing the jar with all his might. As he watched the jar smash into tiny pieces and heard Bella take the picture, he felt... strangely, A little bit better. \"For my grandfather.\" Bella said putting the camera and picture down and smashing another jar. \"For having a Jackal as a mother.\" Another smash. \"For not having a real friend or even a friend of any kind until I was in sixth grade.\" Another smash. \"For the man who raised me trying to stab me.\" Another smash. \"For a father who hates me.\" Another smash. \"For having to be in fear of my own life at five years old.\" Smash. \"For the death of a brother I'll never know.\" Smash. \"For never getting to keep family.\" Smash. \"For having to grow up at seven years old.\" Smash. \"For not getting the choice to be what I want when I grow up!\" Smash. \"For always being hated... No matter whom I met or what I did.\" Smash. \"For never getting a chance at heaven.\" Smash. \"For being ridiculed and tortured almost every single goddamned day!\" Smash. \"For everyone trying to kill me!\" Smash. \"For a family who never wants to see me!\" Smash. \"For friends who only want me for my money.\" Smash. \"For being forced to walk through my life alone.\" Smash. \"For never getting a chance to be normal!\" The two Said in unison smashing a jar together. Damien grabbed the rest of the jars and yelled, beginning to cry, \"For being!\" Smash. \"The god damned!\" Smash. \"Satan incarnate!\" Smash. \"Prince of evil!\" Smash. \"ANTICHRIST!\" At the last word he threw two jars. As they smashed he fell to the ground throwing off his goggles and places his head to his knees and began to sob a little. Bella took off her goggles and began crying as well. She walked to her boyfriend and sat beside him, hugging him and kissing the top of his head rubbing circles into his back. \"I accept who I'm supposed to be... I plan to follow through. But I don't know why everyone thinks that means I'm bloody happy about it... Who would be happy with this life?\" Damien said quietly. \"I know it's harder for you than me, but... I do know how you feel...\" Bella whispered to him. \"I know... I know you do.\" Damien responded weakly hugging her back and breathing her in. She always smelled good. And after a while, he stopped crying and calmed down and met his girlfriend for a loving kiss. \"We should probably clean this entire mess up, huh?\" Bella commented noting all the broken glass. \"Hold on, I've been meaning to try my telekinetic abilities.\" Damien said as he concentrated on the broken pieces as they lifted from the ground and moved back into the wagon. After a second, the ground had been cleaned up and Bella gave Damien an impressed look. \"I'll take you home, love.\" Damien said quietly helping her up. \"I'd like that.\" Bella said smiling as she intertwined their fingers, grabbed the wagon, and began to walk back. \"Bye Damien!\" Bella yelled to the car driving away as she walked into her home, she turned to see her father talking with someone in the living room, she sat up a little straighter and smoothed out her outfit to greet them with a smile. She walked to the living room and slowly her smile fell. A priest had been sitting in the chair across from her father drinking a cup of tea. What the Hell was he doing there?! Her father was the most Anti-religious person she knew, what on earth was he thinking letting a priest into their home?! \"Oh, Father Abel, this is my daughter, Bella.\" Peter said to the priest. He looked like he was in his early 40's, matted dark hair, and a kind face. A kind face that became very unkind when he looked into Bella's eyes. His eyes widened in shocked horror at her for quite a while, his tea falling and smashing against the floor. \"God, are you having a stroke!? Bella, call 9-1-1!\" Peter demanded. \"Whore!\" Father Abel spat at the blonde girl, Bella's eyes widened. This was not good. \"What did you just call my daughter?!\" Peter asked angrily. Bella had a bad feeling in her stomach. \"You harlot of Hell! Leave this place!\" The priest said standing, Bella's father stood as well. \"Now you listen here, that is my daughter you're speaking to and I think it's time you get you're Jesus-nit wittedness and get the Hell out of my house!\" Peter yelled at the priest leading the man by his shoulder out of the house. The priest shouted in tongues at the girl over his shoulder as he was kicked out of the house and had the door slammed in his face and having it locked on him. Peter took a deep breath before turning around and walking back to Bella. \"He had wanted to talk to us about his church and God, and me, being stupid, decided to let him in since we haven't had too much interaction with the community since we've moved to Chicago. I knew he was nuts. I'm sorry that he said those things to you. And I know I can be harsh sometimes, but I hope you know it's because I love you. I love you, so much, Bella.\" Her father said pulling her in a hug. Bella wanted to believe him. And on one level she did. But she still believed there was a part of her father that hated her, as well. She lived with her dad too long to fool herself. He will never completely love his daughter, but he sometimes made her feel as if he did. Bella hugged her dad back and savored it. She couldn't help it. Damien had made a good point in January, her Dad could be a real jerk, but he was still her only parent left and the only living family member who wanted anything to do with her. She cringed at the last part, knowing that wasn't even completely true. When she was nine, Bella lived with her aunt, uncle and cousins for a month, and almost permanently because her dad no longer wanted to raise her as a widowed man, preferring the bachelor lifestyle. But her aunt and uncle wanted more money per month than what he was willing to pay for, so he continued to raise her himself instead, after which, her aunt and uncle never bothered to speak to her again. \"I love you, too, Daddy. Is it alright if I call Damien?\" Bella asked her father innocently. \"Of course. But not too long, don't forget what I told you about the damn phone bill. I'm going to town to grocery shop, do you need anything?\" \"No, I'm fine. Maybe some salad?\" \"Alright.\" He said smiling before kissing the top of her head and grabbing his coat to leave. Bella waited until he left and frowned gravely and ran to the closest phone and dialed Damien's number. \"Thorn residence, who may I ask is calling?\" She heard her boyfriend's adorable slight English accent on the other line. She scolded herself, as much as she loved Damien, now wasn't the time to admire him. \"Damien, its Bella. We have a situation.\" \"What happened?\" \"My father let in a priest and the second he saw me, he went insane and started calling me a whore and screaming in tongues at me!\" \"Damn! Is your father suspicious? What's this priest's name?! I'll have him killed!\" \"My Dad isn't suspicious and Damien, you are not going to kill him! At least not yet, if he dies immediately after this that WILL make my father suspicious. Unless he attacks first, Do not kill him, just watch him.\" \"Alright, I'll keep an eye on him... But I'm still uneasy.\" \"I'll be alright, there was a time I didn't have you in my life. I know how to survive, baby.\" \"Alright... I put my trust in you. I love you, Bella, goodnight.\" \"Goodnight Damien, I love you, too.\" The two hung up for the night.[Chapter 12] Chapter 12 It was Friday, August 17th, 1983. Bella had been sitting at home watching the new Disney Channel, they were showing Cinderella on the television and considering the Cinderella-Themed gift a few months before, Bella wanted to watch it. She sat in her Purple one piece swimsuit, a very colorful towel material skirt, her goggles around her neck, and her Cinderella flip flops on. Bella's never felt too proud about her stomach and has always done her best to keep it covered, so a Bikini was by no means an option. Damien was taking her, Teddy, and Foster to the pool today because since it was summer, everyone wanted to swim. \"Bella, I'll be back late tonight so could you make dinner for me? I need to see someone for an important meeting.\" Peter Giles said leaning down and kissing his daughter's cheek. \"Okay, dad. Have a good day at work. I love you, daddy!\" Bella said smiling at her father. \"I love you too, Doll.\" He responded leaving. Bella didn't pay much mind, then slowly her eyes widened and she turned towards the door. Something was wrong, she knew it. He only calls her Doll when something's up. Bella was about to run after him to find out if he was okay but when she opened the door she saw a smiling trio of boys her age in Tee-shirts and swim trunks. \"D-Did you see my dad?\" Bella asked trying to look past her friends. \"Yeah, he just left. Are you okay, Bella?\" Teddy said raising an eyebrow. Bella shook her head and smiled. She'd deal with her father later. \"Yeah, I'm fine. I'll grab a towel, sunscreen, some money and we're out of here!\" She said going to do that, letting the boys into the house. By the time she returned to the living room all three boys were watching, with a surprising amount of intensity, Cinderella. \"Why do you think her step mother is such a bitch?\" Foster asked. \"Because she's old and pissed she couldn't bag a prince.\" Teddy assured. \"You know what sucks for her? If she had just been nice to Cinderella, when she married the prince, the Step-Mother would be taken care of for the rest of her life, money and all. But because she was so bloody awful, her and her daughters have to suffer.\" Damien commented back. \"Serves her right, then!\" Foster commented. \"Umm... Boys? Pool?\" Bella said raising an eyebrow obviously holding back laughter. The three boys jumped and shut off her Television. \"Umm... Let's go and pretend that didn't happen.\" Teddy said quickly leaving the house. They all climbed into Teddy's bright blue pickup truck. Foster and Teddy were in the actual seats while Bella and Damien rode in the back of the truck. \"It's not that far, Teddy, we could walk to the pool.\" Bella commented. \"No! I love my car and I'm showing it off.\" \"Okay...\" \"Let's play a game.\" She said to her boyfriend as they were on their way. \"What?\" \"Every time we pass a car we scream a word. Any word.\" \"Alright.\" Damien said smiling. They passed a Volkswagen Bug and Damien screamed as loud as he could, \"BANANA!\" Bella laughed hard and saw a van and yelled \"TUGBOAT!\" Causing them both to lose it and just laugh crazily. Foster yelled to them. \"Quiet you two!\" Although, he was only half serious. The couple instead watched the clouds and made stories up as they watched them make different shapes. Bella heard \"Physical\" by Olivia Newton John play on the radio inside the vehicle and Bella yelled with joy. \"Turn it up! Turn it up!\" To which Foster did. Damien pulled his girlfriend closer and started whispering in her ear, singing quietly along with the song. \"I took you to an intimate restaurant... Then to a suggestive movie... There's nothing left to talk about, unless it's horizontally...\" He kissed that special spot on her neck and she couldn't help but giggle. Teddy immediately turned the station to \"Eye of the Tiger.\" \"You two are high if you think for one second I'm going to let you fornicate in the back of my beautiful new truck. No love, damn it!\" Teddy scolded them. \"Sorry!\" Bella yelled back just holding Damien's hand for the moment. It was rather true that the two now have a problem keeping their hands to themselves since they started such activities. But they were in love. Once they arrived at the pool they all jumped out and went off to swim. Teddy and Damien gladly swam around in their pool happy as could be while Bella and Foster relaxed by themselves in the hot tub. Well, actually, since the hot tub was built into the ground, Foster was sitting on the side with his feet sticking in. Because of his still healing bullet wound, he was told not to swim. \"Come on you dork, swim with us!\" Teddy teased Bella. \"I. Like. My. Hot tub.\" She responded simply. \"She really loves that Hot tub; you're going to need to let it go.\" Damien said laughing at his friend. \"If you don't come here I will get you.\" Teddy stated simply. \"Like Hell you are.\" The blonde replied. \"Oh yeah?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Yeah!\" She snapped. Teddy climbed out of the pool. \"Oh I wouldn't do that, if I were you.\" Damien warned him. \"I'm not going to do what I did to Mark way back when; I'm just going to get her to join us.\" Teddy said as he walked to his girlfriend picking her up and lifting her out of the hot tub. She managed to pull her goggles onto her face while she kicked and yelled. \"Damn you, Teddy, put me down!\" She practically screamed. \"Whatever you say!\" He responded throwing her into the deep end of the cold pool. Damien smirked waiting for what he knew what would happen next. Bella's hands shot out of the water and grabbed Teddy's Leg and she pulled him into the pool before he could even think and then proceeded to jump onto his back and dunk him. \"I loved that hot tub, you ass hole!\" She yelled pushing him under the water again, keeping Foster and Damien very amused. It made them even more amused when this continued for another full twenty minutes before Bella swam into the arms of her love. \"It was just a joke.\" Teddy said coughing. Bella stuck her tongue out at him. \"Did I tell you how I met Teddy?\" Damien asked her. She shook her head no. \"He made a joke about my father, and then he got in a fist fight with Mark.\" \"Sorry again about that, by the way.\" Teddy commented. \"I know you are.\" Damien responded. \"So how did you end up being friends?\" Bella asked. \"Well, after Mark passed away, Teddy apologized to me. Then the next school year he and Foster asked me to sit with them at lunch, we got to talking, and we've been friends ever since.\" \"Cool!\" Bella said smiling. \"So Foster how's your wound?\" Teddy asked. \"It's not nearly as bad as it was, but it still will probably be awhile before it's officially healed.\" Foster responded. Bella looked at the clock on the bathroom shack and frowned. \"You guys, I've got to go home and make dinner for my dad. But I had a lot of fun! And Damien, I will see you later.\" She said kissing him deeply. She smirked proudly. \"Alright love...\" He said before kissing her cheek as she giggled and climbed out of the pool, Damien undressed her with his eyes as she walked away to dry herself off and actually bit his lip having a lust filled gaze as she finished drying herself off and leaving to walk home. \"Can you guys actually come join me since I can't get in the pool?\" Foster asked. The boys agreed and joined him in the hot tub. \"So... Damien.\" Teddy said his face lightly blushing. \"Yes?\" He responded raising an eyebrow. \"Oh Hell, I'll ask. Damien, have you and Bella um... Have you been...?\" Foster said trying to word it his face growing red. \"Physical?\" Teddy finally said referencing to the song earlier. Damien smirked at the two. \"A gentleman never kisses and tells.\" He answers simply. \"Oh come on! Spill already! You keep staring at each other like animals in heat, just spill already! I mean Teddy's even admitted that he and Rose-\" Foster asked. \"You finish that sentence about my Rosie and I will drown you.\" Teddy warned. \"Well, I guess she's not MY Rosie anymore, but my point stands.\" He added a little sad. \"That's how I feel about Bella. I don't want to disrespect her. I love her. And if you have eyes, see. You think we are, we might be. That's our business.\" Damien said seriously. \"You did it.\" Foster stated simply. \"Definitely.\" Teddy added. Damien slowly pinched the bridge of his nose. His friends could be so ridiculous. \"So Damien... What are you going to do after graduation?\" Foster asked. \"I'm going to intern for the president while majoring in Political Science minoring in International affairs at University District of Columbia where I'll get a PH.D in Political Science and hopefully by then I'll have connections to start my political career.\" Damien explained. The two nodded. \"So... Do you think you'll add getting a wife anywhere in there?\" Foster asked. Damien blushed. \"You mean am I going to marry Bella?\" \"Well, yes. It's a good question.\" \"Honestly... I think I will someday. I can see her as my wife.\" He admitted almost to himself. He realized that someday, she would be his wife. And that couldn't have made him happier. Damien heard a loud ringing in his room. He looked to the clock, it was almost 2 A.M. He forced himself out of bed hoping whatever this was; it was worth getting out of bed. \"H-Hello?\" He said tired. \"Yes, is this Damien Thorn?\" An adult male said. \"Yes it is, whom may I ask is calling?\" \"I'm detective Brown. Do you know a Miss Bella Giles?\" \"Yes, she's my girlfriend... Why?\" \"She's currently with us at Saint Gerard's hospital. I'm afraid that she's been assaulted. She requested that you come here.\" \"I'll be there as soon as I can, sir.\" Damien responded hanging up and rushing to put on some clothes and leave. He ran into the hospital room and almost vomited at the sight of his poor love. Bella's blue eye had been blackened, there was a bruise on her forehead, a few on her arms and his heart broke as he saw bandages on her... And knew they were there because someone had stabbed her. Damien felt such a wave of vengeance and anger he could've screamed. Instead he looked to Bella and managed to hiss out, \"Who did this to you?\" Bella started crying and turned away. Damien was really angry now, he knew Bella's cries. Her fake ones that seemed real, and the genuinely real ones. She was really crying. Whoever did this was going to die. \"My dad...\" She managed out. Damien's fists were so tight the knuckles were white. \"Where is he?\" \"The morgue, I'd suspect.\" His anger faded for a second into shock at the answer. \"He's dead?\" \"He fell off our balcony and landed on his neck while trying to murder me...\" She sobbed out. Damien's eyes filled with tears too, he knew all too well the feeling of the man you call your father try to... He shook himself from that memory before he went too far. This wasn't about him. Damien walked to her side and held her hand and lightly kissed the top of her head. \"How bad is the damage, love?\" \"It hurts, but he didn't stab very deep, I'll be fine... At least, physically.\" She turned to him and looked so fragile Damien just wanted to cradle her and take her home with him and protect her. \"Mister Thorn?\" An early-thirties looking bald African-American man asked walking into the room. \"Yes, Sir?\" \"We've already questioned miss Giles, everything checks out. Miss Giles said earlier that for the time being, since she'll be a legal adult in about two months, she'd like to live with you and Paul Buher. Is that alright with you?\" \"It's better than alright.\" Damien answered with a light smile. \"Alright, I've spoken with the Doctors, Bella, you may check out. Try to get some sleep you two.\" And with that, Detective Brown left the room. Bella was lying beside Damien and the two were staring at his bedroom ceiling. \"Are you going to tell me what really happened? You don't have to if you're not ready, love...\" He said turning to her. She turned back to him. \"The priest? Father Abel? From last month? Dad had a meeting with him... To, I don't know, clear the air. And the priest told him when he saw me... He was given a vision of me. I was riding you... As in the sexual sense. That my hair was made of gold and my eyes were different colored jewels and that it seemed that I was sweating scarlet and purple... And that I was laughing like a drunk. He told my dad I was the Whore of Babylon, and that you were the Antichrist. And daddy believed him. I guess he realized how much it explained everything, and... He came home and told me... He knew, and that he loved me. But after everything I've done... Damien, he blamed me for my mom's death... And told me he had to kill me. He chased me onto the ledge trying to stab me. Obviously, he succeeded a few times. I fell and kicked the knife out of his hand and he punched me a few times. He told me once he finishes me, he's kill you. And I couldn't let him do that, so I kicked him as hard as I could in the chest, and he fell over the edge and hit his head snapping his neck on the way down. Damien... I killed my daddy.\" \"In self-defense! He would've murdered you, sweetheart; you did what you had to...\" \"I still loved him. I did love my daddy... and now, I'm orphaned.\" she started crying. \"It's alright, love. I am too... And, I'm here for you.\" He held her close as she cried harder wrapping herself in his arms weeping into his chest. \"I know it hurts... I know... You'll be okay, everything will be okay... I promise.\" He whispered comfortingly to her, kissing her tears away and holding her close to him. Bella really hoped he was right.[Chapter 13] Chapter 13 It was Friday September 16th, 1983. Damien had been holding Bella's hand as the two walked out of the court house, Paul following behind. After the first Friday of the teenager's senior year, they had to attend the hearing of Peter Giles's affairs and found out the life insurance policy and inheritance that had been set for Bella leaving her with quite a large sum of money. Paul was more than happy to let her live with himself and Damien until the two graduated. \"Don't forget, Six Thirty.\" Paul reminded them as they all climbed into the back of the car as Murray drove. Tonight was a Celebratory party in honor of Bella being officially welcomed into the Thorn home. Bella took out her powder compact and checked herself; she had thankfully healed well, the bruises and black eye gone. The scars on her abdomen were barely noticeable which was fine by her. Damien held her hand as if to assure her she looked fine. She smiled and put the compact away and cuddled closer to Damien. \"Are you alright, love?\" Damien asked concerned. Bella smiled, without answering. She knew in her mind that no, she wasn't fine. She missed her father. But she hated knowing he died hating her. And she hated knowing that she had caused his death, but if she hasn't. She wouldn't be there. But she dare not say it aloud. Besides, she knew Damien already knew it. He only asked to see if she herself wanted to talk about it. But the two simply cuddled and pretended for a little while that all that night was is simply just a fun party. Damien straightened the tie of his tuxedo. He thought he looked good and smiled in the mirror, and began imagining himself on the cover of magazines and newspapers. Without a doubt, thanks to the President, he knew this would soon be a reality. He heard the clicking of heels and turned to see something that could've driven him insane and stop his heart. Bella's hair had looked silkier and curlier then earlier and was wearing a black velvet dress with black lace trim on the bottom and short sleeves made of satin, the same satin trimming the top across the dress, wearing Black high heels to match, a diamond necklace and bracelets and a diamond barrette in her hair. Damien slowly walked to her and became very close to her. She smiled and kissed him lightly before running past him to observe the decorations. Damien felt his knees weaken and stared at her as she moved. Many people attended the party, happily, and everyone was having a great time. Especially Bella and Damien, who were dancing together. \"So, how have you been enjoying school?\" The blonde asked her lover. \"Not very much. Just think, school will end after this year, and then we will all be happy together with a bright future ahead.\" He winked at her and held her closer. \"And what exactly happens in this future, Mister Thorn?\" She smiled. \"A career in politics, wife and kids...\" \"And who may this wife be?\" As Damien opened his mouth to answer, a strong hand gripped his shoulder stopping him from dancing with the girl. He looked over to Sergeant Neff. \"Oh Hello, Sir, I didn't know you'd be here.\" Damien said stepping away from his beloved. \"I bet. Actually, Damien, I need to see you alone a few minutes to introduce you to someone.\" Damien turned to Bella and asked her with his eyes, she smiled and nodded, giving him permission. \"I'll be back in a minute.\" He promised as he walked with Sergeant Neff. Bella walked to Teddy and Foster so she wouldn't become bored. \"So sir... Who am I being introduced to?\" \"Me, actually.\" A female voice said as she stepped into his view. She was wearing a New Wave Royal Blue Taffeta Lace Cocktail Dress that fell to her knees, royal blue high heels with black lines on them and black fingerless lace gloves. She had her black hair pinned up to keep view of her pale skin and almost black eyes. Damien immediately recognized her from school. \"Kylee?\" He asked. \"Hello, Damien. It's such an honor to meet you, officially.\" She smiled wide and held her hand out to him, expecting him to kiss it. A few people were staring; Damien quickly complied and kissed her gloved hand, upholding the Thorn's world known manners. \"Kylee also wants to become a political figure, I'm sure you two will get along swell. Kylee, I will see you in a few hours.\" Neff said smirking to his daughter knowingly before walking away from the teenagers. \"So Damien, how are you enjoying life at the academy so far?\" The girl asked. \"It's alright I suppose, and you?\" \"Great. Especially my History and Economics classes, I hope to someday be a female politician.\" \"Really? How interesting, I plan on going into the Politics field, myself.\" \"You don't say...\" Damien didn't feel comfortable around this girl. The contrast of her skin eyes and hair almost made her look like some form of eerie ghost. It was hard to believe her father was Sergeant Neff. Damien couldn't ever quite understand why people thought the contrast of white and black was so appealing. It was at moments like these he truly was thankful for Bella who had blonde hair, tan skin, and two different colored eyes. She looked exotic whereas the girl in front of him just looked... Well... depressing. \"...in the other room?\" He finally heard her say, only then did he realize he hadn't actually been paying attention to her, but he kept his cool and smiled and nodded lightly yes. The girl smiled and took his hand and began to drag him along. Meanwhile with Bella, who had been having a nice conversation with her friends, suddenly heard. \"Oh Miss Giles?\" She tried not to growl. It was the Sergeant again. Ever since the classroom window fiasco, she never did quite feel safe or alright around him. She always got a more selfish vibe from him, in a bad way. But, for Damien's sake, she smiled brightly and turned to him. \"Yes, sir?\" \"Bella, I've noticed a few different drinking options around but it's seems that the Scotch is gone. It's to my understanding that you've lived here awhile, do you know where it is? If so, would you mind getting me some?\" Bella slowly forced a smile and nodded yes and began to walk away to get a bottle of scotch. Across the room, Bella missed a knowing look between the Sergeant and his daughter. Bella went into the billiard room and quickly located the bottle of scotch near the pool table. She took two steps towards it when she heard the sound of voices. One was Damien, and another was a girl's. Bella trusted her boyfriend, without a doubt, but she was filled with an impending urge to hide, she quickly stepped into the closet and closed the door. She knew by now that the urge she felt was a warning from beyond, she remained as quiet as she could. She knew by now that the urge she felt was one from beyond natural forces. She heard the two walk into the room and one of them closed the door. \"I like it more in here.\" Kylee spoke. Bella's eyes narrowed with jealousy. She knew where she had heard that voice. She heard it while being carried to the nurse's office last year. \"Some weather, huh, Bella?\" Kylee had said to her. Bella's eyes widened. Kylee knew... \"Well, was there any particular field you wished to discuss?\" Damien asked her. \"Not really... I was thinking we could play a game.\" Bella's jealousy flared, she almost fought against her better judgment and ran out to tackle that girl to the ground. Almost. \"A game? You mean like Pool? I suppose I could find some cues around-\" \"Not that sort of game, Damien.\" Kylee said in a way that could've made Bella vomit. She heard a noise. She imagined it was Damien's back against the pool table. \"I say! Get off of me!\" Damien said angrily. \"Why, because I'm not that blonde ditz? Damien, can't you see it? Look in the mirror, our eyes, our faces, our skin, our hair, we could be twins! I'm the daughter of the man who brought you to your destiny! We go to the same Academy! I'm being taught the ways of Satanism, and you are my Lord's son. Don't you see it Damien? You and I are meant to be together... Take me, let us be one and form a rein of pure darkness.\" \"You forget one thing, though.\" \"What's that, my sweet?\" Bella then heard a slight girlish yelp as someone had been pushed away and she didn't doubt in the least bit that it was her boyfriend whose feet hit the ground as he stood up off the pool table. \"You are not the one I love. It doesn't matter that her hair is blonde, or that her skin is tan, or that her eyes are different colors. It doesn't matter when her birthday is or who her father was! When I'm with her, she brightens up the world in a new light I've never seen. She's magic in human form to me. She doesn't want to be some princess of the night; she just wants to be with me. For me ! And most importantly, I am in love with her, and only her . And I would've loved her no matter what a book from thousands of years ago says. Now if you excuse me, I'm going back to the girl I love . Goodnight, Miss Neff.\" And then the sound of strong footsteps and the closing of a door were heard. Bella smirked to herself and held her head up high. She opened the closet door and stepped out. She saw Kylee sitting on the floor with her black hair messier then it had been, one of her shoes misplaced. The dark haired girl's charcoal eyes turned to mismatched green and blue ones. Kylee's rage showed strong on her face as she kicked off her other shoe and stood up. \"Well, look who decided to stop by and listen in!\" Kylee hissed at the blonde. \"It tends to be what people do when there's something to listen to.\" Bella replied strongly. \"Why are you doing this to me?! You know Damien belongs with me! Why can't you just let him be happy with me! He'd be better off with someone like him instead of some blonde bimbo clone!\" \"I'm more like Damien then you'll ever be.\" \"That's ridiculous! You're little miss perfect blonde with a thousand friends! I bet you think your better than everyone -\" she was shut up by a slap to her face, delivered by Bella. The black haired girl looked to her, her eyes filling with tears, but Kylee wouldn't dare let them escape. As far as she was concerned, she didn't think that the blonde girl in front of her was worth it. She didn't want to seem weak in front of her, as much as the Sergeant's Daughter was concerned; the fight for Damien was still on. Unfortunately for her, Bella knew without a doubt that the fight was over before it began. It was no competition. Damien said it himself, he loved Bella. \"You know nothing about me. So before you go and put a label on me because of my hair color, I would suggest you leave with your father as soon as possible. Damien and I will no longer tolerate either of your behaviors, and for the record... Damien likes blondes.\" With that, Bella left the room confidently and back to the festivities. Damien went to her and hugged her. \"Where'd you disappear off to?\" He asked, kissing her forehead. Bella looked to see a shameful Kylee, now holding her shoes leaving with a very angry Sergeant following behind her. Neff turned and looked Bella in the eye with a glare. Bella simply smiled and kissed Damien deeply. Neff cursed under his breath and left. \"We can talk about that later. Let's dance. They're playing our song.\" Bella smiled as she pulled him to the dance floor. The song that had been playing during their first kiss, indeed, was being played. Damien didn't argue. After the party, and everyone had gone home, Bella and Damien walked hand in hand to Damien's bedroom and Bella took off her heels as she went and sat on his bed. \"So where did you disappear to earlier?\" Damien asked removing his tux coat and tie. \"The billiard room.\" \"Oh really? When?\" \"While that floozy was trying to tempt you Proverbs chapter seven style.\" \"Bella I didn't-\" \"I know you didn't. I heard everything you said. I was in the closet.\" \"Why on earth were you in the closet?\" \"I panicked and hid. I think Neff and Kylee are conspiring to get you to be with her instead of me.\" \"It would explain some things.\" Damien agreed before taking off his shoes and shirt and sitting beside her and holding her hand. \"You know... I'm a little surprised you didn't fall for her charms.\" \"Doubting my loyalty?\" \"Not exactly. I guess I still have insecurities. And I suppose she is rather pretty. And she's a military man's daughter.\" \"You are much more beautiful and you're also a military man's daughter. Besides, she doesn't peak my interests. She's not the one for me. Plain and simple.\" \"Oh? And who is?\" Bella said smiling. Damien returned the smile and held her close. \"You are the only girl I will ever love. Ever .\" And she knew it was true. He kissed her, and then continued, and once again, the two made love, almost as passionately as the first time.[Chapter 14] Chapter 14 It was Friday, October 14th, 1983 It was the night of the October Fest dance and Bella's 18th birthday. In her bathroom the birthday girl was panicking. Positive . The test was positive . She was going to have a baby. Damien Thorn's baby . Bella walked to her closet and took out her spaghetti strap dark purple V-neck A-line dress with neon green trim on the bottom, neon green sash around the waist and a neon green corset crisscross ribbon across the front with neon green shoes and neon green jewelry. She didn't know what to tell Damien. How would he react? All these questions swarmed her head. This was not how she expected her birthday to go. She sighed and went to go shower and put on her outfit thinking of the baby she was carrying. Damien waited outside of Bella's dorm with a purple corsage he straightened his neon green tie and took a deep breath. When Bella came out, she looked beautiful as always, except, something was noticeably different... Like she was glowing, almost even more womanly than ever. Damien felt his breath catch in his throat. Bella smiled at him. \"Are you okay?\" \"Damn you're beautiful.\" \"Me, nah... I gained like ten pounds.\" Bella didn't add the reason why. \"Nonsense! You're gorgeous.\" He responded slipping the corsage into her wrist. Like the year before, the two took pictures together to send to Rose. Then they went together to the dance. Foster actually had a date this time with a girl named Candace. She had brunette wavy hair that fell to the middle of her back with blonde high lights, Hazel eyes, tan skin, and was rather skinny. She was in a green halter top styled dress that had a darker sparkly green poufy skirt that fell to right above her knees. Teddy was with a short haired orange red haired girl with freckles in a red straight line dress, he didn't seem to be having that much fun though. Damien and Bella pitied him, they knew he missed Rose. They danced a lot, even if Bella excused herself every once in a while to use the bathroom, or rather, to vomit in the bathroom. After a while, Damien led her out of the dance and into the hall. \"We need to talk.\" Damien said seriously. \"Yes, my love, what is it?\" \"Something's wrong.\" \"I-\" \"I don't know how many times I need to say this Bella. I can tell when you're lying to me, or trying. You're going to be my wife; I need you to be honest with me. I understand some things are hard to reveal or talk about... But I need us to confide in one another.\" \"I know Damien... But I'm so scared...\" \"Then let me try to help you.\" He held her close and kissed her. \"Damien... You're goi... I'm goi... We are going to be parents.\" \"What?\" \"I'm pregnant.\" Damien's eyes widened larger then she had ever saw them. Damien slowly slid and sat on the ground trying to grasp what he was just told. Damien Thorn was going to be a father. Bella started crying and fell to her knees in apologies. \"Bella, Stop it, right now .\" \"What?\" She managed through sniffles. Damien wiped away her tears and smiled. \"That is the best news I have ever heard in my life, Bella.\" \"W-what? But we're only eighteen; you aren't angry or ups-\" \"Bella, most eighteen year olds would... But these last eighteen years all I've ever done was cause death. For the first time in my life... I'm going to cause a life, instead. A life made from our love... Bella, how could I be upset when I'm so damn happy?\" Damien was crying tears of joy with a huge smile and kissing her beautiful face and lightly rubbing her stomach. Later that night, Damien and Bella were crowned Harvest King and Queen. The two smiled and looked happier than ever in the pictures. But no one knew it had nothing to do with the crowns on their heads. As the two danced the rest of the night, nobody noticed Damien lightly rubbing her stomach with his thumbs, or the sweet tender kisses the two shared. They were so deeply in love with one another it was, at least for the moment, perfect. In that particular moment, the rest of the world was gone. Damien wasn't the Antichrist, she wasn't the Whore of Babylon, and they were two people deeply in love about to start a family. Neither one had felt such peace like that before.[Chapter 15] Chapter 15 It was Thursday, November 24th, 1983 Damien and Bella decided to welcome Thanksgiving privately, on a camping trip. Neither one had any family, or at least any family they cared to share the time with, and the last thing either of them needed was some uncle three-times-removed to lecture them on Bella's pregnancy and about \"waiting until marriage.\" Paul had gone with his own family, letting the couple celebrate in private. They decided on a going to a small clearing in the woods close to Pierre Marquette, a woodsy beautiful place on the other side of the state. The two had taken a road trip there two days before, taking turns driving, singing to radio music and talking about anything except their baby. When they arrived to their camp site, they smiled at its beauty. The tree's leaves were in gorgeous colors and the wind was nice and cooling, and to Bella's delight, she could see a spring and creek close by. It was a romantic little spot, and the two spent the day setting up their tent and sleeping bags and other things. It was close to sun down when they finally finished setting up for camp. They agreed to be here the whole weekend, enjoying themselves. \"Love, would you please go light a fire?\" Damien asked smiling to his girlfriend. Bella nodded yes, smiling in return, as she went to collect firewood. Damien's mind had been heavy for quite a while... he was going to be a father. Damien and Bella were having a baby. He is excited, of course, loving the mother of his child to death... But he's still terrified. His true father, he's blindly worshiped... but has never laid his eyes on, and the father who raised him tried to stab him to death on the altar of a church when he was five. His uncle had planned to do the same, and Paul was more about finishing raising Damien so he can be a great political figure, and it takes more than that to make a father. Then again, what did he know about fathers, considering his past, which worried him even further. How was he going to be a good father? How could he possibly guide and help a child when he sometimes still felt lost and stuck within his own life. To be honest, if not for Bella, he would've probably gone insane by now. \"Sweetheart? The fire is lit.\" Bella said touching his shoulder. Damien smiled and touched her hand. \"Thank you, love. Shall we begin our feast?\" He asked winking. She smiled, grabbed the backpack she had laid in the tent, and the two walked to the fire. She first pulled out a container of cut white turkey meat from the bird they had cooked together earlier that week. Both of them only liked the white meat. They watched the sun set as they each chewed their meat. Damien thought once again about their unborn child, was it a boy? A girl? Was it healthy? \"Sweetheart? Are you alright?\" Bella asked with her beautiful eyes full of concern. Damien smiled at her and didn't answer; he didn't like lying to her. Bella looked thoughtful a moment before smiling and singing O-bla-di-bla-da by the Beatles, one of her and Damien's favorite songs. It only took two lyrics before Damien joined her singing and she pulled him up to his feet and the two began to dance together smiling like little kids occasionally kicking and throwing the multicolored leaves around. Before either of them knew it, the sun had completely set and Damien looked into Bella's eyes as they finished singing. Her face was glowing in the fire's light. But it seemed to be glowing with other things as well, love, courage, wisdom, and motherhood... Then Damien held her close and said the only four words to destroy this moment. \"Let's keep our baby.\" Bella's eyes widened and she had a small frown. \"Damien... We need to talk.\" \"I'm serious Bella-\" \"So am I... Look, you know I want a baby with you more than anything-\" \"Then let's keep the one we're having! I have the money to support it.\" \"Yes, but Damien, I need to put your needs before my wants.\" \"I need my family.\" Damien said with pleading eyes. Bella's filled with tears as she looked into Damien's eyes. They both have lost so much family... They had the chance to start their own. If he weren't the Antichrist, that is. \"Damien... I'm so sorry. But you have elections, campaigning, a teenaged father running in office... The conservatives will flip their lids and the press will have a field day slandering your name. It'll ruin your father's plan. Not to mention... If the wrong people found out, they could hurt our child or use it against you. You know I want nothing more than this child and you... But my darling, we have to give it up for adoption... For our safety, and for its own safety.\" Damien stared hard at Bella as she spoke. He wanted to argue and convince her... He had remembered many legends saying that the Devil had a silver tongue and quick wit and was good at convincing. Damien did as well, but this girl... A blonde girl he had once thought was so odd could now convince him of almost anything. He knew Bella was right, but he wasn't happy about it. No, Damien wasn't happy at all. \"May we please keep our options open, Bella, until we are closer to having this child...? I love you both very much. I know your right, and although to a degree I will try to accept your wishes, but... Who knows? Maybe we can make it work... At least let us have the time to put it into very careful thought. Will you grant me that one wish, my love?\" Damien arched her back very slightly with his hand as he held her closer to him. He saw her eyes twinkle a crystal blue and hazel green as she smiled, her features softening. Who knew? Apparently, Damien could still be quite convincing himself. \"Alright, Damien. Though I still stick with adoption, I will keep our options open... For now.\" Bella wrapped her arms around him and kissed him. The two felt the sparks in their blood as they always did when they kissed, they leaned into each other and they knew the fire beside them was beginning to flicker and roar more as the two slowly slipped onto the ground continuing to kiss. Soon, clothes were removed as if their inner demons called out to each other and the two made love once again, the fire roaring and raging as furiously as the passions within them. When they were together this way, there was no God, no Devil, no Antichrist, or anything else. For the moment it was just them, their passion and love burning more than the fires of Hell themselves.[Chapter 16] Chapter 16 It was Saturday, December 16th, 1983. Bella opened her eyes and found herself wrapped in the arms of Damien Thorn. She smiled. This was her future husband and the father of her child. She watched him sleep, just for a moment. His grip around her was tight and firm, his brown hair was slightly messy, as if needing to be combed and he snored only slightly, his nostrils moving in a surprisingly funny way as he inhaled and his lips seemed almost more plump and kissable. His skin was simply beautiful. Bella kissed his upper brow before slipping out of the bed; she was dressed in a purple satin nightgown and walked downstairs. She pushed her hair behind her ears as she walked into the piano room down stairs. She couldn't play exactly, but she liked to listen to the sounds and make up her own little tunes at will, and her grandmother did teach her how to read notes and to know which keys were which. It always soothed her. The class and romance with the sound of a piano sent her mind to ease. As she played, she knew her child felt the same way as she did since she felt twice as calm. Bella continued to play as she began to hum and smile to herself. She heard footsteps and knew by barely the echo of them that they were Damien's. Bella stopped and turned to him with a smile. \"No, keep playing. Please.\" Damien said smiling back as he lied down on a couch by the piano and smiled at her. So Bella obeyed. She continued playing and Damien watched her with such a fierce admiration and fascination that it pierced her soul. But that was common with Damien; he always reached Bella in way she couldn't ever explain. It was only then that Bella noticed light snow falling outside, which only added to the beauty of the moment. Soon, Bella finished, and Damien walked to her and kissed her gently. \"Good morning, my love... Happy Anniversary.\" \"Good morning. Happy Anniversary. Shall we have some hot chocolate with bacon and scrambled eggs?\" Bella smiled as she asked. Scrambled eggs were a craving she often had in the mornings. \"Yes, we shall.\" He said as he held her hand and they walked to the kitchen and started making breakfast together. Bella was good at making Bacon; in fact she made very damn good bacon. Scrambled eggs though, for some reason, she never could cook well. Throughout her life they never ever cooked the way they were supposed to, and they'd end up burnt and she'd have to throw them away and work her hardest to clean the pan. She was a good cook, but those scrambled eggs really did not approve of her. But of course, it was fine because Damien happened to be good with making scrambled eggs. Bella also made better hot cocoa, for one simple reason. She used milk instead of water. When she used water, it tasted disgusting to her because she was drinking hot water, but milk... With milk it was very delicious. Soon the couple was sitting at the table with their breakfasts and clinked their mugs of hot cocoa. \"One year today.\" Bella noted. \"Can you believe it? It seems like it's been so much longer. We've been through so much in such a short period of time. Of course, I wouldn't have it any other way.\" \"I know exactly what you mean, Damien. It seems so amazing... It feels like years and years ago since that day we crashed into each other in the hall way.\" \"Speaking of old times… how's Rose doing?\" \"She sent a post card the other day, she misses us, but she's happy. She invited us up in New York for New Year's Eve. I haven't gotten much bigger, so I think we could pull it off. I want to see her one more time before my baby belly turns into a blimp and then have to worry about her killing you. Also, I would like to go to New York anyway, maybe see a Broadway show? What do you think?\" \"Sounds like a splendid idea! I'm a fan of New York as well. And I agree that we should visit her, while we still can.\" Damien smiled at Bella as he squeezed her hand from across the table. \"So how's Teddy? I know Foster went to Colorado for Holiday break, but I don't know about Teddy.\" \"Well, you know Teddy, ever since Rose graduated he's been depressed, and his mother constantly trying to match him with new girls... I wouldn't doubt if he was still at the Academy.\" \"Poor Teddy... I feel so awful for him.\" The two stayed silent for a while after that, so they ate, and then went and got ready for the day. Bella didn't need to ask Damien where they were going, she knew. Damien dressed in pleated slacks, a red button down shirt, a nice cashmere sweater, and his long black coat. Bella was in a black long sleeved shirt and jeans with a purple pullover sweater with \"Pink Floyd\" in black letters on it, black snow boots, and a black upper thigh length coat nearly identical to the one Damien was wearing. She went into the kitchen and grabbed a batch if moist Brandy cookie balls that she and Damien had made a few days before, a yearly tradition for Bella. She was sad that she couldn't eat them though; it would've been bad for the baby. Then the two went into Damien's car and started off towards the Academy. They knocked on Teddy's door and waited patiently as the boy opened the door looking tired. But, as his tires eyes lit up, he did seem happy to see his friends. For the next couple of hours they visited with each other and enjoyed each other's company. It made Bella feel good to visit her friend. Teddy and Foster didn't know of Bella's pregnancy, so there was only a matter of time before she'd be too big to be able to be around them, anymore. They left the rest of the brandy balls with Teddy as they left to go to Winter Fest. Bella drew on the windows again and Damien was singing along to the radio with a bright smile on his face. They were there in what felt like almost no time, and they did the same things they had done before... Except, when they sat in the bench this time, Damien beamed. \"What is it, sweetie?\" Bella asked him. \"You're sitting on your anniversary gift.\" He answered. \"I'm what?\" \"I had this bench named in your honor, as a small thank you for giving my life meaning, in the name of love. I hope you like it.\" \"I love it, Damien.\" She said wrapping him in her arms and kissing her. She looks to him and then grabs his hand and pulls him towards a booth. It was full of different kinds of cameras and photo albums, and right then and there, Bella bough Damien his own Polaroid camera, and photo album. Damien smiled and insisted she go back to the bench. Bella obeyed and he knew what he wanted to do. She held her barely noticeable baby bump and smiled largely as Damien took the first of many pictures. \"Beautiful!\" He said smiling. \"Happy early Solstice!\" \"Happy early Solstice, Bella.\" The two smiled and kissed again. Damien looked down to her and his eyes softened. \"Maybe we should keep the baby...\" She looked sadly back to him. \"I want to. But it's not up to either of us... You can't have something like this ruin your future.\" \"You are my future.\" Damien responded. \"We've talked about this, Damien...\" \"You know what? Never mind it. This is a happy day. Let's just have fun.\" He really meant it, he smiled and kissed her again and then the two went off to continue their day, hand in hand, simply happy. And so they were, throughout the time they shared together they were in pure bliss, but now it was almost eleven o'clock at night and Damien and Bella were making homemade popcorn, Bella loved making homemade popcorn as a little girl with her sisters before they moved out and seemed to practically have fallen off the face of the earth, and she had been greatly craving it lately, so she decided to teach Damien how to make the popcorn. They were preparing for the next showing of Michael Jackson's new video, Thriller. The couple was surprised by how much they enjoyed the way the video poked fun at horror movies they loved so much. \"Are you alright, Bella? I know you used to do this with your sisters… What exactly happened to them again?\" Damien asked as he got the butter out, getting ready to have it melted. \"Well, my oldest sister, Heather, didn't really acknowledge us much growing up, my earliest memories when I was a toddler she had already been a senior so I never saw her much anyway. My second oldest sister who is a few years younger than Heather is Alice, who I used to hang out with a lot, she was the one who made popcorn and cookies and watched movies and read stories with me, but she couldn't stand our father after mom passed away. They fought all the time, and one day he said if she couldn't be good and follow his rules then she could just leave, so… she left. She told me it had nothing to do with me and that she will always love me and believes I'll be great and one day I will be from him, too, then gave me her lucky bracelet, and left. I haven't heard from her since. Then there's Isabel, only two years younger than Alice, ran away and join the Peace Corps and is still there.\" Damien nodded in understanding as they finished making their bowl of popcorn with melted butter poured on top. They hurried to the living room, turning on the television to the MTV channel, turned off the lights, cuddled together and prepared for the music video. \"After it's over, I bet you twenty dollars I can do the dance better than you.\" Bella said smiling. \"You're pregnant, you can't move like Michael.\" \"Twenty Bucks; take it or leave it.\" \"I decline your offer on the grounds of I would feel guilty taking money from my pregnant girlfriend.\" Damien and Bella then burst out laughing as they continued to watch the music video.[Chapter 17] Chapter 17 It was Sunday, January 8th, 1984. It was a shock what time could do, Bella was too big now. She couldn't hide it or pass it off as some weight gain. It was clearly a baby bump. Rose had been suspicious of Bella while they had visited in New York and barely got away with it, but of course Rose was still suspicious. \"Damien, we need to talk.\" She said walking into the library in a maternity dress. \"Yes, my love?\" He said looking up from his book and smiling to his pregnant girlfriend. \"Damien, I can't go back to the Academy. It's too obvious. And not to mention the Press you'd have to deal with, sweetie.\" Bella told him as she came and held his hand. Damien looked to her sadly, they both knew that Bella was right and this would eventually happen, but Damien didn't like the idea of being away from Bella or their baby. \"Alright, I'll talk to Paul about un-enrolling you.\" He said kissing her hand. As if summoned, Paul walked into the library and smiled at the young couple, his eyes focused on Bella's stomach, and wondered about what the grandchild of Satan would be like. \"How is the lovely bundle?\" He asked them. \"I wouldn't know because we haven't been able to see a doctor and we don't have medical equipment.\" Bella responded trying to hide the sass in her voice, knowing its only pregnancy hormones. \"You're quite right, miss Giles. Well, I have good news. I've gotten in touch with the organization, and there's a doctor and nurses willing to sneak you in and make sure you'll be alright. We're going for a sonogram tonight at eleven thirty.\" \"That's great news!\" Damien smiled and squeezed Bella's hand. \"So what did you need to speak to me about?\" \"Paul, My baby bump is simply too big to ignore anymore. It's obviously not fat now, which means I'll have to stay here and homeschool myself, read.\" Bella said rubbing her stomach. \"I'll make sure to un-enroll you after I leave the plant today. Damien, I need you to run into town and get some groceries, Bella, I'm sure you know that you can't join him on account of the attention you'll draw... will you be fine staying in today?\" Bella nodded her answer and Paul left. An hour and a half later, Damien was putting on his coat, ready to leave. \"I'll be back soon, my love. Will you do well here on your own?\" He asked her again for what felt like the millionth time. \"Yes, I'll be fine. Just don't forget to pick me up a copy of Bark at the Moon, okay?\" \"You've got it.\" And with that, he kissed his beloved and was on his way. Damien entered the Vinyl store and smelled the air, it had been a few months since he'd been there, on occasion he'd go and look through the albums and even convinced the owner, Harrison, to play one just to see if it was worth the money and the two would criticize the music. This was a Bella-free zone, even though he knew she loved music, they had an unspoken agreement that thy both needed at least one thing to themselves. It didn't mean their relationship was bad, it was actually one if the best things about their relationship, they both needed at least one place where they could escape and get reacquainted with themselves, and then they could come home to each other happy. \"You're insane, Harry. Toto are the next Rolling Stones, they'll be around forever, and can't you hear how Africa speaks to the soul?\" A black haired girl said as Damien and Bella's song played throughout the store. Damien's eyebrow rose. Who was this girl taking the one thing he loved most? Then, Kylee Neff turned to him and broke out in a grin. \"Damien! Hi!\" She turned back to Harrison, \"I'll prove it, Damien have you ever heard this song, if so, what do you think of it?\" She said looking back to Damien with big hopeful eyes. \"Well, it's one of the greatest and most influential songs that have ever come into the industry, in my personal opinion.\" He responded. \"HA! I told you, Harry! Toto is and always will be Dynamite!\" Kylee said sticking her tongue out at the store owner. He responded with an eye roll. Damien quickly moved to an aisle and averted his eyes from the girl. He frowned as he remembered the way she tried to seduce him in September. The next thing he knew, she was beside him with a smile and sparkling eyes. \"What are you looking for?\" She asked a little too sweetly. \"It doesn't matter, I thought you were discussing music with Harrison.\" \"I was, but once customers come in I've got to get myself back to work.\" She said matter-of- factly. \"You work here?\" \"Yes I do! Isn't it so cool? So what exactly is it you want?\" Her eyes became half lidded as she asked in a voice that made him want to leave. \"I happen to know exactly what I want. Bark at the Moon, by Ozzy Osborne.\" He said in a colder tone. The dark haired girl pouted. \"Okay, but you know, this is a music store... It's okay if you listen to some other songs on the side...\" She winked at him. \"Thanks for the offer, but as I said before, I know exactly what I want and am very happy with that choice.\" He said picking up the album and turning to the cash register. \"Okay... But that offer is always open, and by the way, thanks for siding with me a out Toto, now every time they play Africa on the radio... I'll think of you. I hope you'll think of me.\" She winked and smiled again before walking off and Damien finally paid for the album and walking out back to his car, angry that he now couldn't even go to his favorite music store. He heard footsteps behind him and turned to see Kylee run after him. \"I thought you had to work?\" Damien asked. \"I do, but Harry can last five minutes without me. I'm tired of playing coy... I love you, Damien Thorn. And I want to be with you, instead of her. I am yours. Be mine so I shall be yours. Can't you see it? You beat my heart black and blue, but I'm still the one here for you. She'll only let you down.\" And with that, she kissed Damien. Damien never felt so vile, although the kiss may have been somewhat nice, the thought of Bella's face if she saw or heard of this brought logic to him, and he pushed Kylee off and he wiped his mouth. Kylee started crying as she looked up to him. \"Does she really mean more to you then I do?\" She asked beginning to sob. \"She means more to me then you ever could, Kylee. Stay away from Bella and I. I don't love you. I never will. Someday, I'm going to marry her. Besides, I can't love someone who can't love herself.\" He motioned to the burns that she inflicted upon her own arms. Kylee glared at him. \"These burns were for you... These exist to show that I love and will sacrifice for you!\" She hissed. \"No, they were for you. Because you know I can't love you, and you think punishing yourself will somehow change that. But it won't. And that's what you hate most... Isn't it?\" It wasn't a question, Damien finally got in his car and as Kylee screamed at him how he would regret saying those things to her, he drove away not even looking back at her. It was Eleven forty-five at night as Bella snuck into a doctor's office with a doctor and a few nurses, and they performed the Ultrasound. Their doctor was named Louis Hastings, a fellow Satanist and more than happy to partake in the helping of Damien and Bella's baby. \"Mr. Thorn?\" One nurse said. \"Yes?\" He asked anxious about how his child was. \"You're having twins.\" Those three words brought happy tears to his eyes and he looked to Bella who looked broken hearted. \"What's wrong, Bella?\" He asked holding her hand. \"I have two beautiful and perfect babies that will come from our love... But, we... We can't keep them...\" And she began sobbing and Damien frowned and rubbed her back. She did have a point. Damien sighed and turned back to the doctor. \"Are they healthy?\" He asked. \"Yes, both babies appear to be quite healthy.\" He responded. Damien kissed Bella's tears away. \"You know... We could keep them. We could, love...\" \"But-\" \"No buts, we'll talk more about it later, but for now, we can at least pretend that they can and truly are ours. Okay?\" His eyes begged her. And she couldn't say no. \"Alright, for now... They're ours.\" She kissed him. \"Thank you, Bella...\" He said. \"Thanks for what?\" She asked laughing. \"For coming into my life.\" He answered kissing her eyebrow.[Chapter 18] Chapter 18 It was Tuesday, February 14th, 1984. Bella was walking around the Thorn mansion breathing easy and singing aloud to Fleetwood Mac as the vinyl record played throughout the beautiful home. The blonde mother-to-be walked barefoot and slightly swayed and danced, wearing a black swoop neck maternity dress that fell to slightly longer than her knees with long poufy lace sleeves with gold and black embroidery on them. Suddenly she heard the stop and shuffling of someone changing the record and turned to Damien Thorn, handsome as ever, changing it to Bella's Cindi Lauper album and hearing the familiar beginning of \"Time after Time\" play as he walked to her and took her hands as they moved closer and lightly hummed the song as they swayed in circles smiling at one another. \"Really?\" She asked laughing. \"Well, it's no Africa... But I thought it was appropriate.\" Damien responded with a light laugh as he spun her around. Then, Bella yanked her hand away from him and her face paled lightly. \"What's wrong?\" Her loving boyfriend asked worried that he had done something wrong. \"T-They're kicking. I know it. Oh my God, feel them...\" She insisted moving Damien's hand to her stomach. His face had never looked the way it had when he felt his children for the first time. She could see years of joy fill his eyes and his lower lip lightly trembled and the corners of his mouth twitched lightly up into a smile. Bella and Damien held each other for a long time after that. They continued to move lightly delighted every time their children moved with them. \"Happy Valentine's Day, you two.\" Paul said stepping into view of the young couple. They stepped away almost forgetting entirely, finding something much more important to this day. Like their babies. \"Oh that's right! I have a gift for you.\" Bella promised Damien, running off to fetch it, coming back with two rectangular objects wrapped in shiny red paper with a pink ribbon tying them together, smiling proudly as Damien took his present. He patiently and slowly untied the bow, driving his girlfriend with anticipation for his reaction of the gifts then removed the paper from the larger rectangle to reveal a Book. \"Mommie Dearest, by Christina Crawford!\" His face broke into a smile. Paul raised an eyebrow suspiciously at Damien, silently asking for an explanation about why on earth he would be excited about that. \"I've always had an extreme distaste for Joan Crawford, ever since I was a child. This book was written by her adoptive daughter, and showed how much of an insane and egotistical monster she truly was. I can't explain why, but I've always enjoyed how someone finally had the nerve to really stick it to her, that weird eye browed dog looking woman!\" Damien explained with a wide and slightly wicked smile as he flipped through the book. \"There's still one more, left.\" Bella said smiling at Damien's joy. He quickly tore off the paper to reveal a VHS movie version of Mommie Dearest. \"Bella, thank you so much, this is great.\" He smiled so big, kissing her lightly. \"We may have enough time to watch it before we leave.\" He said lightly, curling a piece of her blonde hair around his finger. Bella frowned in return. \"L-leave?\" \"Calm down, sweetheart, it's just for a vacation. I've taken a week off at the academy. In a few hours, we'll head to the airport to board the Thorn Private Jet and head to Rome.\" He said resting his forehead against hers. \"You mean Rome, as in Italy?\" She said smiling wide, her eyes sparkling with joy. \"That's right, my love, a whole week in Rome together. Since it's where I was born, you're Italian, and you've wanted to go for years I thought it was best fitting. I won't lie though, I may have to wear sunglasses and a hat while you wear sunglasses and a scarf on the street just in case of the press, but I feel awful for keeping you cooped up here by yourself... So let's get ready, and I'll read to you on the plane, happy Valentine's Day!\" \"Happy Valentine's Day, Damien!\" She grabbed his hand and the young couple rushed past Paul up to their rooms to pack Bella's things, Damien's bags already packed. A few hours later, Bella wearing a white dress with yellow roses on it with an empire waist, a thin white belt right below her bust, while the skirt itself flared out and fell to her knees, happy that it made her pregnancy look slightly less obvious, white sunglasses, a white scarf wrapped around her head, a pair of white gloves, a pearl necklace and bracelet set and white low heel shoes while Damien wore a semi-formal suit with a pair of black sunglasses and a black fedora, his arm wrapped around his beloved. \"I'll have Murray drive us, Paul; will you be alright on your own?\" Damien asked. \"I'm sure I'll find something to fill my time, have fun you two. Send me a post card.\" Paul responded with a slight nod as he shook Damien's hand and let the happy couple go on their way. One week later, Tuesday February 21st, 1984 The happy couple walked into the door, holding hands and finally pulling off their disguises ready to tell Paul of the beautiful sights they've observed in the past week, Bella in an almost ankle length colorful floral on black pattern button up dress with a solid black belt right under her bust and black sandals, while Damien was in a Pink Floyd's The Wall T-shirt and khakis with tennis shoes, the couple had one kiss before they heard a gun cock and saw Sergeant Neff holding a pistol to the back of Damien's head. \"Glad to see you two are back... Miss Giles, why don't you close the door?\" He slowly said. \"How did you-\" Bella started. \"Close the goddamn door or I'll shoot him.\" She didn't need to be told again, as she quickly closed the front door, trying to keep control of her breath. She would've done anything to keep Damien safe. \"Now both of you turn slowly and face forward.\" Neff demanded. The two did as asked, seeing no other immediate way out of the situation for the moment. \"Kylee! Bring him in here!\" He called out, then, the dark haired girl dragged in a hungry looking tied up Paul. \"Why haven't you killed him? Surely you've been here awhile.\" Damien asked. \"Kylee wanted to save all her bullets for another cause, besides, once she takes her place as your protector and lover, we'll need all the support we can get, Paul included.\" Neff responded with a light smirk. \"My protector ? I'm sorry to be the one to tell this to you, but considering my life, something tells me I really don't need more protection.\" \"You're very confident to be making sarcastic remarks to someone holding a gun against your head.\" \"Well, I'm not a scared child anymore. I'm an eighteen year old man, and I'm a father.\" \"That's right... We still need to deal with the subject at hand. Kylee.\" He said as she roughly dropped the tied up Paul against the floor and walked with her head held high over to Bella and forcefully pulled her away from Damien, cocking her Gun and holding it against her pregnant belly. \"No, oh no, please...\" Bella managed to get out holding back sobs, fearing more for her children then for herself. Sergeant Neff resumed Kylee's position, by quickly walking to Paul, yanking his head up by his hair and holding his own gun against Paul's temple. \"Damien... I have served you and your purpose my entire life; I have dedicated my whole life to you! It is only right that you pick my daughter! Serving you led me to my beloved Angela, and to Kylee's birth. It got us through her passing. I've given my life to you! Damn it, I'm not going to let some blonde tramp take away Kylee's and my future and happiness! So this is what's going to happen. Damien, we're going to kill Bella, and then you and Kylee will rule side by side. So help me Damien Thorn, if killing a pregnant woman and becoming your father-in-law is what it takes to keep my life's work and my daughter's future intact, then so be it. Look at it this way, Kylee will be m h better for you than some blonde floozy who couldn't even stop herself from getting knocked up.\" Neff yelled at him before turning to his daughter. \"Get off of me, Kylee. You aren't your father; you can back away right now, if you ever want to see the light of day again... You will get off.\" Bella was more confident now once again feeling a familiar sense of security deep inside her, letting her know she'd be safe. Kylee narrowed her dark eyes. \"Not a chance, Blondie. He and I were meant to be together, right from the start. Deal with it .\" She hissed hatefully. \"She's right, Bella. We are.\" Damien said in a way Bella knew he was only acting, so, she played along, putting on a fairly convincing horrified and heartbroken face. That's why the others didn't question when Damien walked to Kylee. \"I knew you'd see things our way.\" Neff said smirking. Then, Damien looked deep into Kylee's eyes while leaning forward as if he were going to kiss her, then, Kylee's eyes widened and started to lightly gasp. Bella smiled, knowing that she was choking. Kylee let Bella go and dropped her gun as she reached for her neck, trying to claw at hands that's weren't there. \"Kylee!\" Neff yelled as he held up his gun and began to shoot all his bullets, quickly Bella knocked Damien away and fell to her knees, leaving almost all of the bullets to hit Kylee. \"Oh God no...\" Neff gasped out dropping the gun as he rushed to his daughter while she fell. \"Da-addy... D-Damien... I l-lo-ove you...\" And with that, she closed her eyes, and her head fell backward. Neff screamed out in pain and rage, not noticing Bella crawl and grab Kylee's long forgotten gun. \"Get the Hell up, Neff.\" She demanded. \"You... You will always be a whore. And your children will never get to be yours. You'll have to give them up. Unless, of course, you want to ruin Damien's life completely. My daughter may be dead, but your children will always be bastards and Damien will always be the idiot who knocked you up.\" He hissed at her. Then, Bella's eyes narrowed and she shot at him. Two bullets to his chest, three to his head, and one that missed completely, Bella then proceeded to throw the empty pistol at his dead head. \"YOU MONSTERS !\" She screamed at the corpses closing her hands into fists as tears ran down her face and her shoulders trembled. Slowly, Damien walked to her and held her as she cried before the two finally walked and untied Paul. \"I'll call for a cleanup immediately from some of the other Satanists. Right after I have a drink...\" Paul said when he was finally able to stand before stumbling to another room. \"Come love. We need to shower and get rid of these clothes. They have blood on them.\" Damien said, helping his girlfriend upstairs to a luxurious shower. \"I'm sorry...\" Damien breathed into her wet hair as he was helping her wash off. \"You have nothing to be sorry for.\" \"I'm sorry that you didn't get to live your own life. One without horror and blood and pain... Even if it meant that I would've never met you. You deserve a wonderful life.\" \"That's exactly what I have with you, Wonderful. Damien, I want a life with you or not at all.\" She said back. \"I love you, Bella.\" He said kissing her forehead. \"I love you too.\" She answered, completely kissing him, feeling very much better about the day. It was a relief when they came back out redressed and clean to see the whole mess gone, as if it never even existed in the first place. The couple then walked and cuddled on the couch, playing Mommie Dearest on the television. \"How do you cope?\" Bella asked lightly. \"By... Keep going with life; accept that even if there's regret to what happened... What's done is done. Bella they were going to kill us, Paul, and the babies. We did what we had to do. YOU did what you had to do.\" He answered, rubbing circles into her back. \"Then I'll keep moving on with my life. Thank you.\" \"No problem.\" He kissed her brow and intertwined their fingers as they continued watching their movie.[Chapter 19] Chapter 19 It was Saturday, March 17th, 1984. Damien walked into the Platoon Leader's office at 9:30 AM, in full uniform on Saturday morning. Since the tragic murder/suicide of Kylee and Sergeant Neff as heard about in the local papers, shocking the students, they had replaced him affective immediately with Sergeant Bakersfield. Sergeant Bakersfield was tall, built, blonde, and a very strong yet understanding personality. And, what Damien considered the best part, Sergeant Bakersfield had only sons. \"Sir, you wanted to see me?\" Damien asked standing at attention. \"Yes, Mr. Thorn. At ease, lad.\" To that, Damien relaxed his shoulders slightly. \"I see from your previous records that you've had fantastic grades ever since you first came here, were on the football team, a part of the computer club, student government, Student U.N., the annual fox hunt, and are interested in government and politics. Correct?\" \"Yes sir.\" \"And judging from all this information I have no doubt that's exactly the field you'll go into, given your family history. But there's something you should know...\" \"Yes, sir?\" \"Well... It's about your grades. With the extra morning and afternoon classes you took in your ninth and tenth grade year, you have more credits then needed to graduate. In fact, you've had enough last year to graduate early, did you know that?\" Sergeant Bakersfield looked to Damien with question in his eyes. Damien remembered with fondness about those extra classes, the studying managed to distract him from his pain, especially after it really hit him hard how he no longer had Mark, his brother in spirit, all because he got scared and went to a drastic measure. He stopped those classes for his eleventh grade year, so he would have more time. it was also the year he met Bella. \"No sir, I didn't know that.\" \"I don't understand why the previous Platoon leader didn't tell you, but I have some forms here. If you wish to stay and finish this year, then you may, but if you'd like to accept your diploma and move on, I have the paperwork.\" Sergeant Bakersfield smiled at Damien; Damien gave a respectful nod and slight smile in return. Damien knew exactly why Neff didn't tell him about his grades. Because he knew Damien would've absolutely left early, and that meant more distance between Kylee and him. \"Sir, I will take those papers and graduate early. But for the record, I do believe you are a great improvement from the last platoon Leader and will be wonderful for this school, sir.\" Damien meant it, too. Just not for the reason Sergeant Bakersfield thought. \"You shouldn't speak ill of the dead, but thank you, young man. Here you are. You may leave, now.\" He handed Damien the forms and then watched as Damien left the office. Damien was able to drive to a port where he had ran to when he found out he was the Antichrist, he and Bella also used to go on dates there. He turned off the car, and filled the papers out determined without stopping and was able to get them back to Sergeant Bakersfield's office before 5 PM. \"Damien Thorn, I believe this is yours.\" Sergeant Bakersfield smiled and handed Damien his diploma. \"Thank you, Sir.\" Damien said accepting it. \"You're also allowed to still attend the ceremony and the after party at the end of the school year, if you'd like.\" \"Thank you, sir. I'll keep that in mind.\" Damien shook the man's hand, and left the academy. When he returned home to his beautiful girl, she smiled and rushed to hug him, careful of her baby bump. Damien was always happy to have this hug, so he hugged back tightly kissing the top of her head. \"I've graduated! Now we can spend the whole day together!\" He whispered excited into her ear. Bella's eyes widened and she smiled wide. \"But it's only March! You graduated?\" Damien sat her down and explained the entire story to her eager ears. She smiled and kissed him. \"I'm so proud of you!\" Bella gushed. \"I know! Now we can be a family.\" Damien said the words before he could stop himself and Bella's smile dropped. \"Damien... We need to talk.\" \"Okay...\" \"Sweetie, we can't keep the babies. We just can't. The president called today to reconfirm your internship, and I reconfirmed it for you, but you can't work for the president if you're feeding two babies and changing diapers.\" \"I can if you'd let me!\" He stood up; they both knew this fight was coming... It couldn't be put off any longer. \"Damien, you're eighteen years old-\" \"That is exactly my point! I'm an adult, a man! I deserve to raise the children I helped make! The twins are mine, too, Bella. I deserve to be with them.\" \"I never said you didn't deserve to, but that's not the point, Damien! No one is going to vote for you if they think that you're irresponsible and when they see you got a teenage girl pregnant!\" \"Maybe I don't care as much about votes! All I care about is you, and you're being completely unreasonable about the whole situation! Bella, I love you SO much and this life I've made with you is a personification of that love! I want to keep the children!\" \"God damn it, Damien, don't you think I want that?! This isn't about what we want! ...we need to do what's best for you. Being a teenage father just is not what's right for you. This isn't about what we want... It's about what has to be done.\" \"...They're my family our family. I don't know if I could survive losing more family.\" \"...I'm sorry. But they're going up for adoption.\" \"I know... I just wish they didn't have to.\" And with that, Damien held her close and the couple stayed like that for a good long while \"Ah! Damien! Damien! Wake up!\" Bella yelled at about two in the morning, Damien was up in a second. \"Bella, what's wro-\" his voice was lost when he felt the blood in the bed. He quickly got up, threw on his clothes and yelled to Paul who had also woken up from Bella's cries. \"Call the Doctor to meet us at the hospital, it's an emergency!\" Damien yelled. \"I'm on it!\" Paul said rushing to the nearest phone while Damien picked Bella up, hurrying her to the car as fast as possible. Two hours later, Damien waited patiently with Bella in the hospital room, pacing back and forth when Louis Hastings, the Doctor who had been helping them with their pregnancy so far, finally came back in. \"Well?\" Damien asked after a moment of awkward silence. \"I'm sorry but...\" The doctor could no longer look into Damien's eyes. Damien's eyes darkened as he walked determined to him and grabbed him by the shoulders. \"What the hell happened, speak to me, man?!\" He demanded with venom in his voice. \"One of the twins... One of them has seemed to disappear from sight entirely.\" He finally managed to say. Bella let out a breath. She felt her heart break into a million pieces. She knew what he was saying... One of her children was dead and gone. She quickly grabbed the trash can next to her bed and vomited into it. \"W-why did this happen!?\" Damien yelled. \"Well, first let me explain the rest. Our working theory is that the other twin, the current one, may have absorbed the other one inside of itself... and the current twin has continued to grow healthy, no extra anything, which leads us to suspect that the current twin may be a female that's absorbed her twin. This is a rare case; it's called Fetus Papyraceus or Vanishing Twin Syndrome.\" The doctor explained, completely thrown off when Damien slapped him. \"So help me, answer my question, I DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED, I WANT TO KNOW WHY!\" Jars filled with cotton balls, gauze, and throat check sticks smashed, the glass falling to the floor. \"Well, that's the oddest thing about this... As I said, it's rare. There are many theories, of course, but the cause is truly unknown. If I had to personally guess, maybe a severe trauma? Possibly coming from a source of stress? Is there anything that could've caused stress recently?\" The doctor said obviously trying to stay calm in front of the angry Anti-Christ. Damien's eyes flashed with understanding and his angry red face paled as he looked towards Bella. \"Kylee and Neff...\" She managed to say, thinking of how even before she was pregnant all the trouble they had caused and all the stress it caused Bella. She then proceeded to cry, never hating Kylee more than ever at that moment. From beyond the grave, that black haired monster managed to destroy Bella in a way that was beyond what anyone could understand. She could practically hear Kylee's laughter echo in the room. \"H-how long do you think it's been? Since the other twin...\" Damien couldn't even finish the sentence. \"Seeing as it's this far into the pregnancy and the other baby has no problems at all, probably months and months ago.\" Damien felt awful, and surprisingly, the face that appeared in his head was Robert Thorn's, being the only person he knew who could possibly understand this feeling Damien had knowing that he had lost a child. Even if Robert Thorn wasn't his biological father, even if he tried to kill him, even though Damien loved his true biological father... The little boy inside who had been raised by Robert Thorn for five years, the Damien who was Robert's son... still felt remorse for his death. And not for the first time, Damien felt guilty that his real son had to be murdered just so he could get ahead. But now was different... He now knew that pain, to lose a baby he never got to meet. He thought of how if Robert were alive... If he could be alive, still love Damien as his own son, what he would say to Damien. The words he could lend him about this tragedy. Then he felt his heart harden a little more again. Robert wasn't his father, and if Robert had lived, Damien sure as Hell wouldn't have. He wasn't five, he was eighteen, and he had more important things to deal with then to mope on a past that just could not be changed. \"Is Bella okay?\" Damien finally managed to ask. \"Yes, surprisingly it wasn't related to what had happened, tonight was just spotting. It seemed that the twin must have stopped developing before it could develop as much as your daughter. Bella and the current baby are fine.\" The doctor responded. Damien's eyes softened at the word, Daughter . \"A-are you sure it's a girl?\" He asked lightly. \"Well, I'm not at liberty to say for sure, but given the circumstances I would bet money on Yes.\" The doctor managed a small sympathetic smile. Damien nodded lightly, letting himself feel at least a little bit of joy over the news... about his daughter. That really stuck with him. She wasn't just an 'It.' No longer just 'the baby'. She was his Daughter . \"Can you give my love and I a minute alone, please?\" The doctor did as Damien asked, and the boy walked to Bella, who had set the now smelly trash can away, tears going down her face. \"I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...\" Bella said. \"Shhh... You have nothing to be sorry for. You're okay. That's what really matters, my love...\" He said holding her as much as he could, giving a kiss to the top of her head while she sobbed into his shirt. Damien kept soothing his poor lover while he tried to imagine what his little girl would look like, be like, and as he did so, a scary thought that hadn't crossed his mind until then... whether or not this could be some sneaky trick his true father was up to... And what it could mean.[Chapter 20] Chapter 20 It was Wednesday, April 18th, 1984. Bella and Damien had been happily dreaming in their beds, Bella lying on her back, as instructed by her doctor, and even though the girl normally twisted and turned in her sleep, tonight she was still. Normally there was only one man who couldn't get Bella out of his head... that man was the one who loved her, the one lying next to her. But another man, one who feared her greatly, who haunted his nightmares, was a priest, Father Abel. He had been keeping up with them, how Bella defeated her father, how Neff and Kylee had been found in a murder/suicide, everything. But what he didn't know was that the Whore of Babylon who haunted his nightmares was pregnant. That is, until a few months ago. Father Abel had gone into hiding after the article about Bella and her Father went to the newspapers. His first instinct of where to go was of course, the Vatican in Rome. He remembered walking the street of Rome in the shadows, he didn't like being spotted, and he loved the sights of Rome. February sixteenth, he saw them, Damien and Bella. The reason he knew it was them was because, even with sunglasses and a scarf, he knew her nose and lips anywhere... Her face while killing him in his nightmares was now something he could sketch if asked. He stared in utter shock at her stomach, even if it was obviously not a mature pregnancy, it was noticeable. Father Abel hurried back to the Vatican as fast as he could. He thought with utter horror as he prayed... \"They're having a child!\" He spent months plotting; it was no mistake what he saw. It was an act of God, He wanted father Abel to kill this abomination, and as he vowed, when God called upon him, he would answer. He flew to Chicago April 17th, ready to do the ultimate act of kindness upon mankind, second to Jesus's crucifixion. He was able to sneak into the church in which he used to preach, having the key still with him. He managed to go into the third cushioned pew on the right; part of the padded seat was broken. He always kept a knife in there in case of Damien or Bella decided to have their rein of vengeance over him. Father Able smiled when he found the familiar tool. He waited until two in the morning to go to the Thorn mansion, he gripped the knife tightly, he didn't care what Damien did to him, if he could get that bastard child and its evil mother... It would be an accomplishment of heavenly proportions. He picked the lock and snuck into the house silently, and the second he stepped in, he could feel the darkness in the air. He found the strength to keep moving, very quietly. He managed to find Damien and Bella's room easily; he noticed with distaste, that her stomach was even bigger... She looked at least eight months. He took a silent breath, walked to the bed, closed his eyes and held the knife up, ready to strike... Then he felt it, the grip on his wrist and neck tighter then thought possible, when he reopened his eyes, he was looking into the dark hazel eyes of the Beast. Damien was standing in front of him, his hands raised in concentration. \"I wouldn't do that... You might wake my lover... And then where would we be?\" Damien whispered, tightening his grip. \"H-h-how?\" Abel managed to ask. \"Let's say I learned how to be a very light sleeper at an early age.\" Damien hissed, he moved his head lightly and the door reopened. \"Let's go talk more about this downstairs... perhaps in the basement... My love already lost one of our beautiful children under stress by scum like you, and I'll die before I let anyone take my other child.\" And with that, he focused harder and managed to get the priest to float, and as Damien walked, the priest moved in the air, still being choked, while Bella still slept peacefully. When the two finally reached the cold and bare basement, Damien tilted his head slightly to the left. \"You're the priest who convinced Bella's father to try to kill her... Aren't you?\" Damien asked calmly. The priest could only continue to gasp as he grabbed his own throat. \"Yes you are... You know, we would've had twins. But stress from all of this caused us to lose one. And then here you come ready to kill my child and love... I suppose you were going to cut it out of her... Spit her open like a knife with a fruit? You know, you should respect pregnant women. They've got enough problems without you. My family has enough problems without you... How would you like it if someone cut you open like that? And I thought you were supposed to act in honor of a merciful god... Honestly, what would Jesus say, with you cutting a poor girl apart?\" Damien began to laugh. Then, when he stopped, his eyes seemed to go a few shades darker as he moved his hand, moving Abel's knife closer to the bottom of his own stomach. \"Do you have any last words?\" Damien asked slightly releasing his grip on the priest's throat. \"I hope... In the name of God, Himself, I hope you and your Whore will never hold that Abomination, Beast!\" He managed I gasp out hatefully. Damien looked even more furious as he moved his other hand, making father Abel cut himself vertically wide open, the grip on his neck too tight once again for him to scream as his organs and blood spewed out of his carcass, then, Damien forced the corpse's hand to cut himself horizontally, making an open cross on his dead chest. Finally, Damien released the body completely and letting it fall hearing a few bones breaking when the body hit the ground. Damien took a calm breath and glared at the body. \"She's not a Whore. Bella's my Queen, my wif-\" Damien stopped, realizing that talking to a dead body wasn't going to do much good, and that technically, Bella wasn't his wife yet. He straightened up realizing with shock just how much he really wanted to marry her, and how much he didn't want to wait to marry her. He heard slow clapping and turned to Paul, standing on the stairs leading to the basement in a blue bathrobe. \"Well done. Shall I call for a cleanup?\" Paul asked stepping closer to Damien. \"Yes. Absolutely...\" \"...Something wrong?\" \"Paul... I... I need to protect Bella.\" \"You do.\" \"I know, but I... I can't believe it took me so long to realize this, but...\" \"Yes Damien? What is it?\" Damien looked to Paul, the third father figure in his life, swallowed, and told him simply. \"I want to marry Bella. Now, maybe not this second, but soon.\" Paul nodded his head slightly before meeting Damien's eyes again and smiling lightly. \"Then do so. You're both adults, you're having a baby, you really don't need permission and you have no family standing in the way, as far as I'm concerned, you have more than every right to ask her and to marry her... So do so.\" With that, Paul turned back upstairs to find a phone. Damien followed up the stairs and returned to his warm bed, where his love awaited. When he climbed in, she slightly stirred. \"Damien? W-What's wrong? Is everything okay?\" She asked yawning. \"Yes love, everything's great. I just needed to take care of a problem. Let's go back to sleep.\" Damien said holding her hand intertwining their fingers. Bella smiled in return. \"I'm never letting this hand go.\" Damien promised her. \"And I'm never going to stop loving your eyes.\" She promised back. \"I love you, Bella.\" \"I love you, too, Damien. Goodnight.\" \"Goodnight.\" And with one last kiss, they went peacefully back to sleep.[Chapter 21] Chapter 21 It was Tuesday, May 1st, 1984. It is one in the morning; Bella had been wrapped in the arms of her lover and father to her child. She'd been dreaming of their daughter growing up, she was beautiful and very smart, she'd been showing a man and woman, her adoptive parents Bella guessed sadly- a drawing she made of a family tree, but it appeared to be of the founding fathers. The adoptive mother appears to have made a snarky remark to her daughter upsetting her. Then time seemed to shift and blur. The next thing she knew she was in her daughter's bedroom and she sat on her bed coloring. \"Hello, darling.\" Bella said to her. \"Mommy!\" The girl shouted as she ran and hugged her. \"Oh I'm so happy I get to see you.\" \"Me, too. I don't like Karen. She wants to hurt my real Daddy and Alexander.\" \"Who's Alexander?\" Bella asked raising an eyebrow. \"Your son.\" The young girl said smiling. \"Sweetie... What is your name?\" Bella asked. \"What you name me... You're my real mommy.\" \"Amelia.\" Bella said not even having to think twice. \"That's right, mommy.\" Amelia said taking her mother's hand and leading her into a colorful nursery. The two walked to a crib. Inside it was the most beautiful little boy. Bella loved him instantly. \"But the doctor said he-\" \"Was inside me? He was, on pause waiting to be implanted, and he was, in Karen. She believes she's his mommy, but she's only a surrogate. He's your son, mommy, and you can name him if you want just like you named me. Karen calls him Alexander.\" Amelia said. \"What does Karen call you?\" Bella asked. Her daughter tensed uncomfortably. \"I dare not say the false name she gave to me. I am Amelia. That's who I am.\" Bella nodded understanding before picking up her son and holding him. She saw the 666 mark on his tiny hand and made her decision. \"Jesse. Jesse Mark Thorn, just as you are Amelia Sue Thorn.\" Amelia turned her head hearing a door slam and some yelling. \"Mommy, give me Jesse! You need to leave!\" \"What? Amelia what's happening?!\" \"Please just do it! You have to go!\" Bella handed her son down to her daughter and the two heard a gunshot making Jesse fuss slightly. \"I can't just leave you two now!\" Bella said. \"Goodbye mommy, we love you.\" Amelia said sadly kissing her mother's cheek. The next thing she knew, Bella awoken and sat up in bed screaming in pain, awakening Damien with worry. \"Bella, what's wrong?!\" \"The baby... The baby is coming!\" \"What?!\" Damien said his eyes widening Bella screamed in pain again. \"I said the baby is coming, WE NEED TO GO!\" Damien quickly helped her out of bed, threw a pair of slacks and a green shirt and some shoes on and helped her to the car running around to the driver's side and driving fast. The two made it to the hospital and rushed inside. \"This woman's in labor!\" Damien shouted for help, before he even knew it, the nurses who had helped the couple the past nine months had her sit in a wheelchair and moved her away holding Damien back. \"Bloody hell; Let me see her, that's MY baby she's giving birth to!\" Damien shouted angrily. \"We're sorry Mr. Thorn... There are certain special things needed to be done for this birth, you cannot be present.\" It then clicked in his head. The mentioning of some birthing ritual had been brought up in his mind some time ago. Disappointingly, he agreed and left. On the bright side, he did have a few stops to make. \"Right in here, Mr. Thorn.\" a nurse with short curly black hair said opening the door for him. \"Thank you Miss...?\" \"Roselli. Lisa Roselli. I'll lead you to meet your daughter. A beautiful baby girl, born at May first at 6 A.M. Weighing 6.66 pounds!\" \"Thank you.\" \"Oh! And don't worry about a cross hanging in that room, it's obviously a little more special than the others.\" Lisa said winking at him. Damien smiled a little brighter. Good to know there were a few people there on his side. Damien walked into the hospital room, holding two dozen purple and black plastic roses, remembering that they are Bella's favorite along with a huge stuffed Rottweiler. He looked to the mother of his child, she looked like she always did, except more tired. She held a bundle of pink in her arms before gathering the strength to look up into the eyes of her love. Damien stared at her loving her as much as ever. He walked to her and pulled up a chair next to her bed and sat beside them. Bella looked at the flowers and stuffed animal and smiled gratefully to her boyfriend, loving both items completely. \"M-may I see her?\" Damien asked. Bella smiled and revealed her tiny face. Damien instantly loved this baby completely and unconditionally. Damien reached his finger out to the baby, and she grabbed it. She was tiny, but she had dark brown hair like his, and she slowly opened her eyes. Hazel. \"She looks just like you, my love.\" Bella said to Damien. Damien smiled at his daughter. This was the moment. He knew it. \"Bella... We don't have to give her away, we could keep her, and... And be a family. City Hall isn't too far from here; you and I could get married right now... And we can be a true family.\" Damien said looking into his love's eyes. Bella smiled weakly. \"We know we can't. ...it's a shame, too... If we could keep her... I'd name her Amelia. Amelia Sue Thorn.\" \"I like that... It's a pretty name. Amelia it is.\" \"Damien... We can't keep her. No matter how much we want to.\" \"Why not? Why can't we, Bella?\" \"You know exactly why. If you honestly believe I don't want or love Amelia, you're wrong. I want and love her just as much as you do Damien. She's my daughter too. But we're eighteen years old, we can't raise a baby.\" Damien didn't want to admit it, but once again, he knew she was right. So he sighed, showing his defeat. \"But... I would love to marry you.\" Bella said. \"Really?\" \"Yes, Damien Thorn. I'll marry you.\" \"Good... Because I was worried for a second I'd have to return this.\" Damien said holding out to her a white gold with a large square diamond and small round diamonds surrounding it giving the image of a large round set. Bella's eyes almost popped out of her skull. \"Oh my! Damien, this ring is amazing!\" Damien slipped it on her finger smiling. \"Only gravel compared to you.\" he smiled. Lisa came back in, her face pale. \"Mr. Thorn, Ms. Giles... We have... Some very horrible news...\" She looked like she could cry. Damien and Bella were terrified. \"I thought you said the baby was fine?!\" Bella said angrily holding her daughter. \"She is... It, it isn't your daughter...\" \"Then what is it?!\" Damien demanded. \"...It's Bella. During labor... Things got moved around, and... I... Miss Giles will have maybe the rest of the day, maybe sooner before she...\" Lisa couldn't look the couple in the eye. Damien knew what she was going to say. Die. Bella was dying. The love of his life was dying. He turned to her and Bella looked to him smiling sadly. Lisa left the room. \"Marry me today.\" Damien pleaded. \"Sweetie, I-\" \"Just say yes! Please say yes, love this might be your last day!\" \"I don't have the strength to make it to City Hall... Let's get married here, in this room. We don't need a piece of paper to prove our love... Damien, I take you as my husband, today and even when I'm gone until you can join me, because you give my life purpose. You give me joy and passion and things only you could give me... You're the only person I could ever be with completely. I love you, and am proud to die as your wife.\" Bella said smiling. Damien looked at her, and tried not to cry. \"Bella, you are a woman one finds once in my life. Never again will I find another you. Never again will I take a wife. I vow to you on Amelia's life, that I will care and hold you. For you are the most precious thing in this world to me... And you are the best thing that came of me being the Antichrist. I am honored to be your husband.\" And with that, he leaned down and kissed his wife deeply. Bella heard Amelia laugh, happy to be the witness of the marriage. \"I know this is impossible, but I hope you will always think of me as your true mother, and... I hope you'll remember me.\" Bella said to her baby. Her daughter looked right at her as if she completely understood what Bella just said. \"And don't forget about me. Please remember that I'm your father, sweetie...\" Damien cooed to his daughter holding out a finger, she grabbed it and giggled. The nurses came back in and took Amelia from them and Damien held his wife's hand. They spent the day talking, occasionally kissing, but mostly talking, reminiscing. Before they knew it, it was five minutes to midnight. \"Damien?\" \"Yes?\" \"I remember when we first became friends. I couldn't get over how handsome you were, and how lucky I felt. How lucky I am... I'm so proud of you, baby. I always will be... I know you'll do the right thing. I love you.\" \"I love you, too, Bella.\" \"And Damien?\" She said a tear rolling down her face. \"Yes?\" \"Remember the first day we met? And how we had class together?\" \"Yes.\" \"I was staring at you...\" She smiled crying lightly and closed her eyes while holding his hand... And then, she was gone. Damien felt so numb. He stood up, told the doctors and nurses what had happened, and once everything was in order, he took his daughter home with him.[Chapter 22] Chapter 22 Damien stared down at Amelia. He thought of her mother. The two had just come from Bella's Funeral, he was happy to see her wear the engagement ring he gave her in the hospital. Rose had come back from New York City for it. Bella's death had been explained as how she had been very sick and well; it got the best of her. Technically, it was true. Lisa Roselli, the nurse from the hospital, had held and cared for Amelia during the funeral, making everyone think it was her baby. Surprise surprise, Teddy immediately fell for Rose all over again and swore to return to New York with her believing Bella's death was the universe's way of showing him how short life is and he didn't want her being the one that got away. It made Damien sick to his stomach. Foster was there as well and at one point came and patted Damien's shoulder knowing how hurt he must've been and whispering a \"If I could, I'd take that bullet for her again. She loved you more than anything.\" to him. Damien knew he was trying to help, but he wanted to punch him. No one but he and Bella knew how much the two meant to one another. It had been a week since Bella died and not one tear escaped him, everyone assumed he just cried behind closed doors but... No... He was still in so much shock and pain... He didn't cry. Bella had said Amelia looked exactly like him. But, he saw Bella in Amelia's face, too. She had her mother's chin, and eyebrows, and button nose. And even though she was only a newborn, Amelia has Bella's wavy hair. Damien couldn't make his feet move. This baby in his arms was the last piece of Bella he had left. And he didn't want to give her up. She opened her eyes, big and dark hazel, looking up at him. She made a little noise, she sounded like Bella, too. And then, Damien Thorn, finally cried for his lost love. He held his daughter close to him and didn't want to give her away. He looked down at her one more time… and then he knew he had to. No matter what he wanted, he had a job to do... And he wanted to be someone that Bella and Amelia could be proud of. He kissed the top of her head. \"I love you, Amelia. I know it's impossible... But I hope you remember who your parents are...\" He said to her. She looked up at him again and he gave her forehead one more kiss before stepping into the building of St. Francis Orphanage. He stayed down low as much as he could until he got to the main office, where two nuns were. One, about in her 20's looked at him and her eyes opened wide and looked as if she were about to kill him. Damien held his daughter closer as she began to cry. The other nun, much older, noticed the baby and came to their rescue. \"Sister Yvonne! Calm down! This... Beast wouldn't be here, unless he had a good reason for it. Unfortunately, he is too smart for it.\" \"Y-yes... I have this child... Ame- She... needs a good home. Please?\" Damien managed to say, rubbing circles into her little back, still holding her. Sister Yvonne was going crazy. \"Y-you take that, that DEVIL SPAWN AND LEAVE THIS PLACE! That baby should be MURDERED, you SICK monster!\" \"Sister Yvonne! That is quite enough! It's been too late since birth, for the boy- but this baby shouldn't be punished for the sins of the father. She's an infant. And as a woman of God, it's my duty to give her a better home and life... Than one that she could have with her biological father...\" Damien didn't look the nun in the eyes. He only could look at his baby, studying every detail he could before mustering out sadly, \"S-so... You'll take her then?\" \"Yes. We will.\" The nun said holding her arms out. Damien whispered three last words, full of love, to his baby. \"Remember your mother...\" And then he handed her to the nun while Sister Yvonne could only stare in horror. \"Sister Yvonne, instead of gawking, you may call the York couple from Virginia and make a few fake documents, immediately.\" \"What?!\" \"Do it!\" Sister Yvonne stood and glared at Damien and slowly left the room. \"You may leave, now.\" The other nun said with a cold stare to him. Damien left quickly and quietly, hearing his daughter cry, knowing that she was crying out to him. When he walked outside he took a deep breath and began to cry again. Only this time he cried harder, and he fell to his knees and held his face in his hands and wept. \"Oh, Bella... Bella...\" He breathed out, his heart feeling so cold and broken. The one person who always made him feel better, more alive, and sometimes even as close to normal as he'll ever be... And she was gone. A car pulled up for him and slowly he stood up, wiped his tears and entered the back seat, rain began to start, making fog on the window, and slowly he vowed to himself... He would never love anyone, only lust for their bodies. He would never marry anyone, for in his heart, he would forever be married to Bella. He looked at the fog on the window, remembering their first date. Slowly, he made a heart, and wrote in it, D.T. plus B.G. and below it, he added, forever. \"Where would you like to go next, sir?\" Murray said to him from the driver's seat. \"To the airport, please. I'm going to Washington D.C. to see the president about that internship.\" \"Right away, sir.\" He reached beside him to a photo album that belonged to Bella. It was of almost every picture she had taken since they met. He opened it and pulled out a Polaroid photo, it was of himself and Bella, he was kissing her cheek and she was smiling blushing like crazy. Her different colored eyes shown bright and beautifully. Green always showed her fierceness and determination while her blue one always showed gentleness and kindness. Her wavy blonde hair framed her round cheeks so adorably, and god that beautiful smile. A smile he would never see again. But what he loved most... Were the warmth and love and loyalty in her face, and it always came unconditionally. Damien stared at the window again. Bella and Amelia showed him that it was time to stop messing around, and to become someone who they will be proud of… who he was meant to be.[Chapter 23] It was Monday, September 4th, 1989 Delia York, the adopted daughter of Katherine and Gene York was having her very first day of school in Kindergarten. Katherine had bought her a white Tee-shirt dress that fell to her upper thighs with a red school house on it and little yellow school busses on the bottom all the way around, and red shorts underneath that went to her knees, a red bow barrette in her hair, and red tennis shoes with white socks and a nice new back pack from the mall. When Gene and Katherine explained to Delia what school would be like, it sounded very fun. Finger painting, nap time, snack time, toys, and a whole group of new little boys and girls she can be friends with. Delia honestly couldn't think of anything that sounded better! But the problem was Kindergarten didn't quite go the way her adoptive parents had promised. As soon as Katherine left and Delia had gone to sit at the table with a few other little kids, one little girl with pitch black hair and cold eyes pushed her out, causing Delia to land on her arm. Even though it hurt a little, Delia didn't cry or even yell or scream, she had a natural high tolerance for pain she herself never understood. She stood back up to see a few other kids laughing at her, Delia's cheeks burned with embarrassment, but she didn't really care. Delia was a lot smarter then people gave her credit for. \"I was sitting here first.\" Delia said politely, the way her adoptive mother taught her to be. \"NO. I was.\" The girl said with her eyes narrowed. Delia very much wanted to hit this girl, and even started to move her hand, but then Katherine's words from earlier echoed in her mind. If anyone bullies you, you just be the bigger person and walk away. Don't get in a fight, Delia. Remember, he who runs away gets to fight another day. Delia sighed under her breath, picked up her back pack and went to a table that was empty as the teacher began the lesson. The teacher, Miss Norris, was teaching about the letters of the alphabet and how to count to twenty. Delia tried as hard as she could to not roll her eyes. Katherine had helped her learn all of this already, before kindergarten she was already reading at a second grade level and could do simple multiplication and division. When Miss Norris wasn't looking, a chubby boy with a dark rust colored hair and freckles kept throwing things at Delia's head. Delia turned around and said very angrily and quietly so only the boy would hear, \"Stop it you weenie! And your breath smells bad! Why are you being so rude? I don't even know you!\" \"I'm Jerome. And you're a poop nose!\" Jerome stuck his tongue out at her; she stuck hers out back and turned back to the front of the class room bored. She decided she was going to remember again. Her adoptive father, Gene, said it was called Day Dreaming and it was just her imagination when she's bored, but I didn't feel like she was imagining anything. She remembers a young man with dark hair and eyes that she could never decide what color they were, blue, green, or brown. But even more vividly then that she remembered a beautiful blonde girl with round cute chubby cheeks, different colored eyes, a smile that made Delia feel safe, and a voice of an angel. Delia could remember this woman calling her \"Baby\" or \"Amelia\" and remembered her singing a song… something about blessing rains. She also remembered the two saying words full of love to each other and a kiss, and Delia never got tired of seeing that over and over in her head. Just as she was about to completely slip into the wonders of said memories, she felt something wrong happening to the back of her head and turned around where Jerome had gotten much closer to, and Delia touched the back of her head. She felt a wet stickiness and when she saw the gum wrappers at Jerome's table and felt her eyes get big with fear. He had just stuck gum in her hair… Delia began to scream and cry as Miss Norris ran to see the situation, demanding Jerome sit in the corner until after recess as she tried to help a crying Delia remove the gum from her wavy dark locks. Delia didn't look the teacher in the eye as she forced herself to calm down. To be honest, she didn't feel that this was right at all. She had gum in her hair, and all Jerome had to do was sit in a corner. That hardly seemed like justice. Miss Norris managed to get some gum removed from Delia's hair before it was time for recess. \"I'm sorry, Delia, but I'm afraid that's the best I can do. Maybe your parents can take you to a nice barber and get a pretty new hair cut! Would you like to go play, now?\" Miss Norris asked the younger girl. \"Yes, please…\" Delia said quietly before rushing outside. As expected, the other kids did in fact did not want to play with her. So she went and sat by herself in the grass by the fence and cried into her hands about this awful day. Delia didn't notice that a few yards away from her, stood a young man, in a black coat and a pair of sunglasses, aged 23 years old. He was about 6'2, had a mature face and wise eyes that would never decide what color they really were, and a name so infamous that it made the angels shudder… Damien Thorn. He had finally managed to master almost all of his supernatural abilities, and he liked to practice a lot in private. Damien had kept a very small eye on his daughter, he knew who adopted her, where she lived, what her adopted name was, and where she went to school, but that was about all he could find out. For five long years greatly mourning the loss of his most beloved, and still in recovery, there was still another girl he couldn't get off his mind, Amelia Sue Thorn, or rather, as she was now called, Delia York. After five long years of doing what he could to stay away, he made a very big step backwards in the healing process. In the previous December, on his and Bella's anniversary, he bought the biggest bouquet of fake orange, red, and yellow flowers and went to her grave. As he wept he realized just exactly how much the hole in his heart was still open, and ever since then he couldn't stop thinking of the last living part of Bella still walking around on the earth… Amelia. He didn't even know what she looked like anymore. He didn't know if she was happy, he didn't know if she was okay, and he felt insane guilt and remorse over giving the last piece of his love away. Damien knew if he tried to get too involved it would only confuse and scare his daughter. But surely there was no real harm in simply meeting her, just to see that she's okay. Damien looked over the playground at the kids playing, but none of them stroked that parental instinct in him… Then he saw a boy, a chubby one with auburn hair who had a few other boys with him walk towards a crying girl, Damien used his superhuman hearing to listen. \"You're a Crybaby! Come on, cry again!\" The boy spat at the crying girl, who he now noticed had a large wad of gum in her hair. \"Jerome, Miss Norris said you weren't allowed to get out of the corner until after recess…\" The girl said, not looking up at him, this scene seemed to strike a feeling a familiarity in the back of Damien's mind. \"I said I'd say I was sorry. So, I'm sorry that I didn't get to do this sooner…\" and with that, he kicked her in the stomach and as her face rose up she said an \" OW! \" Damien had only heard once before… when he ran into the little girl's mother the first time he met her. He could see Bella's cheek bones and the familiar plump lips that once were on Bella's face, and oddly enough, Amelia had her mother's forehead. Oh yeah, Damien could see his beloved's face in her. He felt rage course through his veins and he quickly rushed and pulled the boy off of her. He looked each one of the boys in the eyes and used simple mind control. \" You never saw me, and you are going to go away, or so help me I will become the monsters under your bed and in your closets, you little shits!\" The boys quickly ran away to a four square game across the playground, not even remembering what had just happened a second before, but still stayed away from Delia. Damien took a deep breath before turning to his daughter and holding out his hand to help her up. Delia could only stare up at him, her eyes slightly filling with tears of joy. He may have been older, but she knew his face. She took his hand and stood up, and for that split second that they touched, they both had felt something they hadn't felt in a very long time… a feeling of true family. They were almost sad to separate their hands once she was up. \"Is it really you, Daddy?\" She managed to say. Damien took a deep breath before nodding yes. She smiled and ran and hugged him tightly. Miss Norris began to walk towards them, her eyes very concerned. Damien stared into her eyes and slowly, the teacher turned around and walked inside. Damien smiled appreciating how good mind control can be. He and Delia sat down together and began to talk. \"So… is this your first day of school?\" Damien asked, feeling awkward. \"Yes.\" Delia answered. \"How is it?\" \" Awful! \" Delia's eyes filled with tears and Damien felt a slight panic. He didn't know how to handle a little girl crying. \"Well… I knew a girl once who had a really bad first day of school as well, she had never really interacted with other children, so when she was told that she was going to start going to school, and she got very scared. So she was so nervous, she didn't talk at all the whole day. Even though the teacher would talk to her, she was just too scared to talk, so then she got put in time out and cried her little eyes out before the teacher felt horrible and let her come out of time out. What happened to you?\" The story he had learned about Bella wasn't much, but it got Delia to not cry. \"…I was pushed out of my seat; people threw things at me… I was bored… and my hair…\" \"Did that boy put the gum in your hair?\" Damien asked feeling his anger towards the boy growing. \"Yes… it's stuck. I'll probably have to get it cut out.\" \"I'll show you how to have it removed. Remember, you're a very special kid, you can do things other kids can't do… and you can't show them what you can do. Put your hand behind your head and focus… imagine the gum forcing itself apart and away from your head and slowly moving into your hand.\" Damien instructed. Delia did as she was asked… and it worked. There were still small parts in her hair, but after a few showers, she would be fine. She smiled gratefully and threw the gum away. \"…My mom, the one who adopted me, said that I shouldn't fight back. That the ones who run away get to fight another day.\" Delia told her father. \"Well, if your biological mother were here, she would tell you that isn't quite the way. She had to deal with a bully most of her life, and tried to just be the better person and ignore it. The problem with the he who runs away gets to fight another day is that he never actually fights, and you can't and shouldn't run from your problems. Now don't go try to pick fights with other kids, but if they bully you, if he hits you, you bite him hard. If he steals your lunch or your money, you don't just let it go… because then he'll never stop. You're better than that, so don't let people walk all over you or anyone you love. If some jerk if beating up your best friend, you get him off. But, do not, I repeat, do not be stupid about it. Unless in a situation where it's necessary to simply go straight to hitting and screaming, find a… creative way to teach certain people a lesson. Use a fear they have against them.\" Damien was explaining in a way that felt much darker coming out of his mouth then it had in his head, and his five year old daughter was beaming as she observed every word as if it were worth a million dollars. \"How do I find out their fears?\" She asked. \"You can read their minds… search their thoughts, memories, emotions, and maybe one day even controls them. Take that kid for instance, Jordan, was it?\" \"Jerome.\" \"Jerome, right. Just stare into his eyes, and imagine two doors in his pupils opening up, then just push your mind into his and look around… It took me forever before I got it right, but try it.\" Delia did as her father told her… and got it on the first try, not daring to fail. Her lips curled into a smile almost too much like her father's as she found a piece of information she could use well. Jerome is afraid of heights… \"Well? How was it?\" Damien asked cocking an eyebrow. \"I got it the first time.\" Damien's eyes widened hearing the words escape his daughter's lips. After a moment, he smiled, knowing Delia inherited Bella's determination. \"Very good… Did you find any information?\" \"He's scared of heights… and I already have an idea.\" \"Remember, I told you not to start anything. If he does more things like this to you, then you resort to this. Okay, Amelia?\" Delia remained silent a minute. Damien hadn't meant to call her that name, it had slipped out. \"…Is that my name?\" she asked after a long moment of silence. \"Well, it's what your mother and I had named you…\" \"Where is my real mom?\" \"…She's waiting for us, on the other side. She passed away, sweet heart.\" Then, Delia remembered everything . Every last detail of her life from the moment she was born, her mother being told she was going to die, her parents getting married right in front of her infant self, and she realized something scary… that was very right. \"You said I'm not like other kids. That I can do things they can't. You didn't say why…\" Delia looked to her father with much clearer eyes. \"Sweet heart… Where are you going with this?\" \"It's because I'm His Granddaughter… isn't it?\" \"How on earth could you possibly know tha-\" \"You told me yourself you wanted me to remember my mother. It's weird, but… I can feel it in my veins, too. Now that I know it's there… the power… I want to learn, daddy please teach me!\" Delia's eyes lit up at her father and his breath caught in his throat. Things were getting too far. \"Sweet heart, you know I can't. I mean, I can give you a few pointers, but… Gene and Katherine would never allow me to actually know you… But that doesn't mean that I don't love you, Amelia. I mean, Delia.\" \"No… I like Amelia better. What's my full name?\" \"…Amelia Sue Thorn was what your mother had wanted.\" Damien admitted seeing her puppy dog pout, also a trait she no doubt inherited from her mother. \"It has a much better sound then Delia York. Call me Amelia… And I understand. But I'll miss you, daddy… But I'm sure I'll figure out how to use my power. I'm glad you're here.\" Delia smiled Bella's smile at her father and he felt like he might cry. He hugged her lightly. He knew their time was short. \"If you do get into a fight, make sure you have physical marks, like bruises, cuts, whatever. If you can show signs it was self-defense, you'll be okay. Be a light sleeper; always be aware of your surroundings. If anyone catches on too much, take care of it. Don't let anyone hurt you, avoid psychics and priests, stay far away from crosses and churches. Always remember if all else fails, your grandfather and mother will protect you from beyond. Get into politics, that's where you will be most useful for your type of skills, Rottweilers, German Shepherds, jackals, and crows are always your friends. If you're lucky enough to find someone like us who you fall in love with and is on our side, protect and love them with all your heart. Try to stay on your adoptive parent's good side. I've done my research on them, Gene loves you as if you were his own daughter, but Katherine on the other hand… you will want to keep an eye on her. Stay safe, stay smart. Also, lastly, never forget you have people in the world who love you greatly, and if you find time to yourself on your own and you miss me or your mother or just feel alone… make an upside down cross, out of sticks, rocks, anything, and I promise you will have something that will let you know in your heart you aren't alone. Okay?\" Damien felt almost out of breath from talking as much as he had. \"I understand, daddy.\" The bell rang, letting everyone know that recess was officially over. \"…Bye, daddy.\" Delia said sadly looking towards her father. \"Bye, Amelia…\" He managed to say with a very sad smile. Delia stayed quiet a minute before removing her red bow barrette and giving it to him. He smiled appreciatively before slipping a necklace, a small silver heart pendant on a silver chain into her hand. \"It belonged to Bella, your mother.\" He said. Delia smiled wide as she put it on and slipped it under her shirt. \"I'll wear it under all of my clothes!\" she promised before giving her father one last hug. Damien kissed her forehead twice, once for himself and another for Bella. Then the two stood up and Damien waved his hand, wiping the minds of anyone aside from his daughter who may have seen him or wondered why an adult was talking and hugging Delia. They shared one last look before Damien watched his daughter rush off to class. Damien felt oddly a lot better. He knew they both knew that he wouldn't see Delia again for a long time, but it was okay because he knew she was going to be just fine. He could practically feel Bella smiling beside him. And for the first time, something almost scary happened to him… He felt a small breeze on his cheek, as if he were kissed by a ghost. He smiled sadly once again as he slid his sunglasses back on and walked away from the school. Inside, Delia had told her brainwashed teacher she spent all of recess removing the gum from her hair and went to sit at the table she had sat at the first time earlier that day, and sure enough the same girl from before approached her. \"Hey! This is my seat!\" She tried to push Delia, but she grabbed her wrists and stared hard into the other girl's eyes and forced herself into her mind and searched like a kid in a candy store. Her name is Madison Anderson… she's scared of the dark and worms. \"I'll tell you what. You leave me alone, and I might not put a whole cup of worms in your pants as soon as you fall asleep in night time. And don't tattle… unless you wouldn't mind letting every boy in this room who loved to dig know that you're terrified of worms…\" Delia whispered quietly. The other girl tensed up, before apologizing to Delia and moving to a different table. Delia smiled to herself. Her first day turned out to be better then she had thought.[Chapter 24] EPILOGUE. Many years later... \"You Bastard!\" That was the last thing Damien Thorn heard after feeling a worse pain then he could've ever imagined in his entire Thirty Two years of life. A Dagger of Meggido. He knew for sure that it was one of those stupid knives... He screamed out a million screams. He thought back to the day when he and Bella smashed glass jars together and yelled their anger. It felt almost the same, except in this situation, he was the jar. He knew getting involved with Kate wasn't a good idea. The only reason he did was because her blonde hair and occasional Witt reminded him of the girl his heart still wanted, the girl who could still make him feel. That's why in bed he had been horrible and rough and tortured her, because Kate was an imposter, nothing more than a toy. His love and devotion and gentleness, the most intimate parts of him, were reserved strictly for someone else. He didn't love Kate, or even really like her, he swore off such emotion a very long time ago, reserving it for one girl. The girl he was about to see again. He wondered if Bella's death was this painful. He stumbled weakly and had a flashback of his entire life as if a movie before his eyes, mostly, he saw visions of Bella. Her beautiful different colored eyes and blonde hair, the smile that made the Antichrist feel love... Once again, they'd be together. Damien saw Jesus Christ before him and Damien slowly approached him, if he weren't in so much pain, he would've laughed. Jesus has nothing to gloat about... Damien was about to be sent with the only person he'd loved and deeply missed. That was something not even God could take away from him. Damien then understood why Bella died, so he could die happy, knowing he'd see her. And besides, his father wasn't defeated yet... He had a daughter, somewhere in the world. She would continue his Legacy. \"Nazarene... You have won... nothing !\" Damien breathed out before falling to the ground. Slowly, he saw an adult Bella, with the same wavy blonde hair and concerned different colored eyes. She had been wearing a gypsy like ball gown made of the finest red and purple velvet, jewelry, and chains covering her body clad with gold and jewels and coins, the top of the dress had been strapless and a sweetheart neckline and there had been an almost hip high slit in the side of the bottom. He noticed a chalice attached to a gold belt around her waist. She had never been more beautiful as she held his hand. Damien managed to smile slightly at her. \"Come join me, husband of my soul... Everything will be fine. In Hell, we will finally be together for the rest of eternity...\" The dead Whore of Babylon said lightly to him. Damien squeezed her hand with his last ounce of strength and she kissed him lightly as Damien closed his eyes. Then, Damien Thorn officially died; his last thought was how he had once told Bella that he thought happy endings were boring… and now, thanks to Bella, maybe somewhat happy endings weren't so bad, after all...
