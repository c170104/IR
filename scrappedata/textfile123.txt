[{"Movie":"Last Witch Hunter","Title":"Dark Horizons","Author":"John Sparta","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11857689","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Long grasses swayed in the breeze: a pale and weak reflection of the gale that must have been racing on the bellies of the clouds overhead, that which birthed ripples and waves to propagate across the sky. \"Looking at it from this far away, you'd think it was pretty calm up there.\" A well-dressed elderly gentleman sat next to an obviously more youthful man, both overlooking the rolling field that ran away from the small house in which they had found themselves residing these past few weeks. The elder man wore the typical signs of a priest: white collar, sash, and holy symbol; though not one of a typical faith or doctrine. The younger of the pair possessed very ordinary attire, slacks and a white buttoned shirt, though made remarkable by his physique and general air of calm assurance. It was the latter who had broken the peaceful silence as their last companion busied herself within the country home. \"Looks are deceiving though,\" he continued, \"from here it looks like a peaceful rocking. Gentle and inviting, like you could fall asleep on those clouds. If you get in the middle of it though, get close, you realize that it's just unlivable. Howling wind, bone chilling cold, and wet.\" The younger man shifted in his chair, reclining so as to rest his shaven head onto the soft cushion there. The older stayed silent for many moments, watching the ripples pass along the ground: the only visible signs that there was a breeze to be felt. Eventually he looked to his friend of many years; not shifting his attention, just his gaze. \"I've never known you in fifty years to be poetic, Kaulder. I've never heard you try to dance around a subject. What's on your mind?\" Kaulder kept his eyes fixed on some far away point but replied, \"I'm just wondering how much of the world is actually as I know it. Wondering how much I just took at face value instead of asking questions.\" \"Questions such as?\" \"Such as where witches come from.\" At this, the seeming elder of the two appeared caught off guard. \"The world has a few tendencies, Dolan. It tends to make things as they are needed, it tends to make things better at what they do over time, but it never, and I do mean never , makes unique things.\" Kaulder's eyes flicked over to his longtime confidant before returning to the distance. \"Witches use magic. It's something they're born with: intrinsic. Like your or my ability to see. But other things besides people see. Where are the other things that can use magic?\" Dolan took a few moments to respond: \"We can use some magic; runic inscriptions, basic alchemical principals, even ignore some enchantments by using our willpower. So it's there, they just access it better.\" Kaulder shook his head at this, chuckling with the sound of gravel rolling over itself. \"A dog can open a door, Dolan. A monkey can use a mouse. But it's different. We only touch magic through gloves, only incidentally. Like a cat learning what a dolphin knows instinctively only when something goes very wrong for the cat: hold your breath. They,\" and he nodded toward the door that stood to their side and to their companion beyond, \" live magic. They breathe it, they smell it, they can almost taste it. It's like trying to describe a color to a blind person, like a blind person trying to paint a copy of a Rembrandt, only more so.\" Dolan looked back out to the overcast sky; silently listening as he had done since he had taken the title of Dolan. \"We don't use magic, we just arrange for some things to happen naturally. We don't control it like they do. But nature hates unique things, hates singularities. A person is unique, but nothing about a person is. So I'm starting to wonder where they all are. All of the other things that must be able to use it like they can.\" \"What's brought this on? I've read your history, you never expressed any such questions before now. What changed?\" Kaulder sighed then. \"A few things. The memory of killing the Queen the first time. Do you know what she said to me?\" Dolan shook his head. \"She said that we humans were invaders in their world. That they were far older than us, and they had seen us develop; that we huddled around fires and hid in caves out of fear. I never thought about it again, not until she killed the traitor.\" Dolan's face darkened with distaste at the mention of his temporary successor. \"She told him that she couldn't 'turn clay to gold,' and that as he was born human, human he would always be, and thus was worthless. He was human, Dolan. Born to witches.\" The elder of the pair frowned, uncomprehending. \"Nature hates unique things, Dolan. It also hates things that are similar for no reason. Witches came first. We were born to them, without magic; probably. Basically lepers. But why are witches the only things that can use magic?\" Kaulder never shifted his eyes from the distance, toward the beginnings of a curtain of rain at the foot of the nearest mountainsides. \"I think they did something. If you think about it, witches rely on an awful lot of complex constructs to do the impressive stuff. Rune stones to control the weather. Large concerts to manipulate or crush large objects, or to create the plague curse. Potions to do a multitude of things. They need time, they need planning, and they need magical tools to do the impressive stuff. Just like we need tools to do our impressive things.\" The thirty-sixth Dolan to Kaulder, now aged a paltry seventy-six years to his charge's eight hundred, sat in continued silence as understanding slowly began to take root, though yet unnoticed. \"Now look at what they can do without those tools, what the Queen could do. They can hide behind illusions and they take on the traits of their homes. They hit hardest in your dreams, where they have the advantage of surprise and strength beyond what they have out here. They can shapeshift, if they're strong enough. They're flighty, Dolan. They were made to run from things, not fight them. They were made to hide.\" Dolan began to shake his head in dawning distress. \"No, Kaulder. I don't, I don't like what you're implying. It's beyond even my nightmares.\" \"But not beyond theirs, I'd bet. Dolan, I think that they got rid of the other things that could use magic somehow. I think that they were the least impressive thing around before we were even thought of. I think that they might have done something to starve the other things out. Have you noticed, through my chronicles, that the witches seem to have gotten weaker as time has gone by? Not much, not drastically, but noticeably? I have. I think they limited magic somehow, bound it like they bind lightning or fire to stones. And if my hunch is right, I think they did it because they only needed a little and their predators needed a lot.\" Dolan's eyes had grown wide, his skin pale, at the thought that the foe his entire order had been created to fight was, by this horrifying new supposition, the weakling remnant of a far darker past than he had presumed the world to have. That all of humanity lived after the truly impressive things, and only by the grace of their absence. This had not all sunk in before Kaulder continued with his ever more horrible line of deduction. \"I've also noticed that, in nature, when something comes under massive danger or stress it usually disappears. It goes away. But a lot of the time it comes back after the danger has passed, the thing was just in hiding or sleeping away the wait.\" And then Kaulder looked down from the mountains toward the darkened tree line, separating their field of grasses from the forest; the forest now deeply shadowed by the ever darker rain clouds overhead. \"I can't help now but remember the old stories my parents used to tell me and my siblings; stories about more than just witches to scare us into behaving. I can't help but remember that nothing is unique, that everything gets reused, everything is remembered by nature. And that humans aren't really all that inventive.\" The wind began to pick up, now laying the grasses almost flat in gusts, the hissing and rustling of ten thousand-thousand blades reaching the two in the gaps between the wind. \"Tell me Dolan, in the months since Her resurrection, have you noticed something about the witches we've been hunting for using dark magic?\" A deafening roar lashed out from the darkness overhead, chasing the heels of a lance of jagged light that burst into existence between clouds; loud enough to shake the bones of the dead, Dolan was sure. And in that brief illumination, that brief but potent light, Kaulder's nearly supernatural sight did some small kindness to his efforts to convince himself that the odd shadow in the forest that he had been tracking was just a shadow. \"Have you noticed them getting stronger?\" ","Summary":" Long grasses swayed in the breeze: a pale and weak reflection of the gale that must have been racin"},{"Movie":"Last Witch Hunter","Title":"Welcome Home","Author":"Smart Kira","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12004324","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Welcome Home Uh what a day Kaulder said to himself as he arrived back after a trip somewhere to retrieve some important artifact for the Axe and the Cross. After retrieving the artifact all Kaulder wanted to do was to get back home to New York and go home to be with a certain someone. Who would have thought that years after being immortal he yearned for something more and that something is a witch named Chloe. Getting out of the taxi and thanking and paying the taxi driver. Walking into his building and up the stairs Kaulder was trying to decide what to do put the artifact away now or later on the first option he could do it now and get it over with; or he could leave it till later like he originally planned because he really didn't want to wake Chloe who sometime stayed at his place while he was away. True to his own word Chloe was exactly where he said she would be; in his bed with her arms wrapped around his pillow. Breathing in his scent to reassure herself that he was there even though he wasn't. \"Not yet anyway\" Kaulder said to himself. Still smirking slightly to himself he decided to put away the artifact now so nothing would happen to it. Using his Axe and the Cross ring to open up \"his safe\" where he kept his weapons and the other artifacts just as Kaulder just about finished putting the artifact away he heard a sleepy voice say behind him \"Kaulder is that you?\" A smiling dawning his face turning around and walking over to her and putting his hands over her shoulders. \"Go back to bed Chloe\" Kaulder told her lightly. \"But now I can't sleep without you since your home now\" Chloe said while rubbing her still sleepy eyes. Kaulder then closed up the vault and made sure everything was secure. \"Come on you\" Kaulder said still smiling he then tipped Chloe's head back and caught her behind her knees and carried her bridal style back to his bedroom. \"I am glad your home Kaulder \" Chloe said sleepily into the crock of his neck. Placing Chloe gently back on the bed and placing the bed covers partially over her. Kaulder then went into the bathroom and stripped into his old sweat pants and sweat shirt; he then went to rejoin Chloe in bed. With a smile on his face and remembering Chloe's earlier statement \"I am glad to be home as well Chloe.\" Gathering Chloe into his arms placing her head on his chest Kaulder then being too lightly run his fingers through her red hair. Which caused Chloe to instinctively wrap her arms tighter around him smiling himself once again Kaulder couldn't believe where his life had taken him fighting the Witch Queen in the Middle Ages and almost successfully killing her forever and she almost cursed him but that evil witch queen cursed him with her immortality forever and the only way for Kaulder to join his deceased wife and daughter was to destroy the heart for good. But his Chloe stopped him and told him he had something to live for and care about and that was her Kaulder's hand drifted towards Chloe's stomach where the other person who told him to keep on living was living for now. Grazing his hand over the tiny baby bump you little monster and your mother keep me alive why would I want to die when I have possibly the most fantastic afterlife ever. \"Don't call him that\" a sleepy voice said. Kaulder then settled down with his head on top of Chloe's head. One hand tangled with in her long red hair and the other idling stroking her stomach and the little being within her. \"Goodnight again you little monster\" Kaulder said. \"Kaulder don't call him that again\" Chloe told her boyfriend menacingly through her tired eyes perched on one elbow. But by this time Kaulder was already asleep. As Chloe looked at Kaulder through her tired eyes. \"Uh men\" Chloe said to herself rolling her eyes placing a hand on her barely visible baby let's just hope you'll be more like me and less like your father. Finally falling back asleep on Kaulder's chest. The last thing Chloe heard Kaulder say that was likely never going to happen. Chloe just grunted in reply.

At that moment he was just cuddling with his lovely sassy red haired witch girlfriend and unborn son. Chloe was certainly in heaven at the moment she could have some alone time with her boyfriend Kaulder. At least she choose a proper second in command to run her newly renovated bar. To Chloe at this moment in time she was on cloud nine sitting here in Kaulder's lap her head under his chin sighing contently enjoying their alone time together knowing it will be a long time till they get something like this again. Chloe sighed again in contemptment as Kaulder stroked her large baby bump. Kaulder stopped mid stroke and rested his hand on Chloe's baby bump. \"Hey you little monster hope you're not causing any trouble for your mother her\" Kaulder just grinned to himself as Chole slapped his hand away. Chole then felt the baby kick all over the place wildly causing Chloe to feel a little pain. Bending over with slight pain Chloe said \"Knock it off Kaulder how many times I have told you don't call my baby or rather our baby a monster?\" \"Too many times\" Kaulder said as a matter of factly. Getting over the pain the baby wouldn't stop kicking look at what you Kaulder did you hurt the baby's feelings. Rubbing her baby bump gently and whispering comforting words as any mother would; a small smile appeared on Chloe's face which only grew as the baby calmed down and the kicking ceased. Using her hands to her best ability to cover her pregnant stomach Chloe glared at Kaulder and said \"If I ever hear you ever call our baby a monster again there will be trouble.\" Smirking like what kind of trouble would be talking about Kaulder asked. Returning his smirk Chloe said funny you should ask your punishment would be having to sleep on the couch for a week or possibly a month. \"You don't mean it do you\" Kaulder asked his live in girlfriend; all Chloe did was just nod her head. While all of this was going on underneath Chloe's hand she felt a hard kick. Which Chloe gave a small smile to. \"Traitor\" was all Kaulder simply said. \"Mommy's little boy yes you are\" Chloe said as she rubbed her stomach; then she added \"siding with your mommy and not your daddy.\" ","Summary":" Little Monster After months of fighting witches Kaulder was just glad now to spend some time with h"},{"Movie":"Last Witch Hunter","Title":"Like Father Like Son","Author":"Smart Kira","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12004333","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Like Father Like Son Brandon James time for bed Chloe yelled to her four year old son who was currently still playing in his room. Little Brandon acted like he never heard his mother telling him to go and get ready for bed. He was playing the warrior hero with his action figures Brandon thought his dad was so cool and he really looked up to him. Then suddenly a somewhat dark shadow came over him and his action figures. \"Hey! I wasn't finish playing yet\" Brandon then crossed his arms across his chest and pouted cutely as a four year old would; all the while looking up at his mother. \"Oh yes you were young man! Did I not tell you to get ready for bed already?\" Chloe asked her young son with hands on her hips and an eyebrow raised. Bowing his head in shame of disobeying his mother Brandon said \" Yes mother you told me to get ready for bed already I'll go get ready now.\" \"That's what I thought I'll be back to check on you in a few minutes to tuck you in; so I expect you to have your teeth brushed and be dressed in your PJ's when I get back ok and also your toys put back in your toy box ok\" Chloe told her son. \"Yes mother\" was all Brandon said as he started to get ready for bed. True to his word when Chloe returned Brandon had his toys put away, his teeth brushed and face washed and his PJ's on already for bed; already for him to be tucked in and possibly get a bedtime story as well as the usual goodnight kiss from his mommy who he loved secondly to his dad. Carrying Brandon over to his pirate themed bed to tuck him in; \"Mommy?\" little Brandon asked \"Yes sweetie?\" was all Chloe replied back to her son as she tucked him into bed. \"Why doesn't daddy spend time with me anymore?\" Brandon asked his mother sadly. It broke Chloe's heart to see her son so sad but truth be told Kaulder wasn't spending anytime with either of them. Instead of cuddling together in bed at night he didn't come to bed until the early morning hours and quite frankly Chloe was getting tired of it. \"Hey sweetie\" Chloe said getting her sons attention again I miss that he isn't spending time with us anymore too. So tell you what after I tuck you in how about I talk to your father about how you and I feel about his absence in the household. \"Really mommy\" Brandon's head snapped up and looked at his mother with pleading eyes. \"Yes really sweetie now what about that bedtime story\" was all Chloe said. So after reading her son his bedtime story and giving him a kiss goodnight she went in search of her elusive husband the last witch hunter around Chloe went in search of her Kaulder. She found Kaulder in the same part of the apartment completely ignoring her as usual doing something that she wouldn't tell her since she could clearly see that he had a pile of wood shavings at his feet and more to come. \"Kaulder Kaulder KAULDER!\" Chloe shouted lightly so not to wake her son. Stopping what he was doing Kaulder turned around to face his wife Chloe who had her arms across her chest slightly glaring at him. All Kaulder could think of saying and doing is the word \"What!\" \"Don't what me mister!\" said Chloe as forcibly as she could. Walking over to Kaulder and kneeling down Chloe said \"why are you ignoring me and your son? I miss cuddling with you in bed at night and spending alone time with you. You don't come to bed till late at night no let me correct that Chloe suddenly said you don't come to bed till the early morning. Not to mention your son misses having alone time with you hell Kaulder he looks up to you he idolizes you. \"\"What are you doing Kaulder that you can't spend any time with me and Brandon?\" Chloe asked behind Kaulder she could see the sword he used to impale the witch queen's body to the tree and almost used it to destroy the queen's beating heart so he could join his deceased wife and daughter in the afterlife so now Kaulder at the time he could be free of this immortality once and for all and his mind and body be at peace. But Chloe was glad she stopped him in time because she had begun to have feelings for him which turned into love; now she was his wife with their love blossoming everyday they were very affective to each other which was enough to make her son gagged in their presence. That causes both her and Kaulder to laugh they laugh even more when their four year old son loudly proclaims that he will never fall in love with a girl because their gross. Chloe pretended to be offended by her sons comment as Kaulder bent down to his son's level and said \"Are you sure about that son?\" Little Brandon vigorously nodded his head up and down \"Yep daddy!\" \"Well little man\" Kaulder said ruffling his sons hair \"since I am cursed with immortality forever\" \"All thanks to that evil witch right dad\" Brandon interrupted. \"Yes son the evil with was the one that cursed me with immortality forever she wouldn't let me die and peace. I couldn't be with my deceased wife and daughter. \"But you have mommy here now daddy!\" Brandon interrupted again. Sighing and closing his eyes and rubbing them Kaulder says \"Will you let me finish speaking Brandon.\" Not wanting to make his daddy angry Brandon quickly said \"Sorry daddy!\" \"Yes mommy was the one who told me I had something to live for somebody that cared about me; and that somebody was her we fell in love, dated, I asked her to marry me and when she said yes she made me a very happy man that day, and then she told me she was pregnant with you and I was over joyed no words could describe it. Now I wouldn't change my life now I am very happy with the two of you around. \"And I with you daddy!\" Brandon said wrapping his arms tightly around Kaulder's neck and me too Chloe said \"I am very fortunate to have you in my life as well\" at that moment the family of three did a group hug. \"I am not ignoring you or Brandon\" Kaulder said he watched as Chloe raised an eyebrow at this. Kaulder then thought out carefully what he was going to say next \" I am not ignoring you intentually if that's what you're thinking it's just that Brandon's birthday is coming up soon and I was craving an exact replica of the sword I used to kill the witch queen so he can be more like me. That in itself alone was enough to make the last witch hunter cry. Chloe just smiled and said it looks like you have it almost done motioning to the wooden sword in Kaulder's hands. \"Yeah\" was all Kaulder said still looking down well finish it sweetheart Chloe said giving Kaulder a pat on the back make our son happy. A big smile grazed Kaulder's face as he had a new burst of energy to finish the sword for his son and see the same exact big smile on his face.

It also peaked through the window of the apartment of Chloe Oliver. Sleeping in her bed Chloe's face held a huge smile across her lips. Deep within her dream she was roaming through a large wheat field with her brother by her side. She young was a child back home with her mother watching them both from the porch. The whiskers of the wheat tickled her skin as she laid down in the field watching the fluffy white clouds sail across the sky. The air was clean the world was still peaceful she felt so much better when she was here. With a content sigh she flapped her arms around up and down in attempt to make a wheat angel, she knew it was weird but she didn't care it was her dream. Closing her eyes she could still hear her brother making plane noise as he ran around her. Soon the wind changed and the once gentle breeze became cold and rough, it sent goosebumps up and down her body. Chloe's eyes snapped open to reveal a pale gray cloudless sky. The once vibrant yellow wheat field was now a dry desolate wasteland. Looking at down at her hands she noticed they were larger and her once cheerful white shirt and blue jeans were now a black silk shirt with a pair of matching pants. She was an adult her peace had been take from her she was someplace now but where. Her answer came in the form of footsteps moving closer and closer towards her. As she rose to her feet she was face to face with a masculine being in a black hooded cloak with his eyes hidden from view. \"You and I are the same.\" The voice echoed. \"….I don't understand, who are you?\" Chloe asked. \"You will find out soon enough…but now it's time to wake up.\" The voice replied. Chloe's eyes flew open it took them a moment to adjust but she found herself looking up at the pale white ceiling of her apartment. This had been going on for about a month, no matter where she traveled in her dreams no how much she reinforced them he would always find her. There sessions seemed to go on longer than before, but why? Who was this person? A loud buzzing noise snapped her back to reality Chloe grab her cell phone and held it up to her ear. \"Hello?\" Chloe answered. \"Good Morning.\" A familiar voice replied. \"Good morning Kaulder, I take it we have a lead on something?\" Chloe asked. \" Something like that.\" Kaulder replied \"Sure I'll see you in an hour.\" Chloe replied. Sitting her cell phone back on the end table and whipping back the covers, Chloe swing her legs over the side of the bed. After a loud yawn followed by a long stretch Chloe was up and heading to the bathroom. Hopefully a nice warm bath could wash away this weird dream. Sitting at the desk in the in Kaulder's apartment the 36th Dolan could only wait for Chloe to arrive. He was glad Kaulder found someone else to share his adventures with it made life more eventful. But the stern look Kaulder gave him this morning meant the worse is yet to come. Kaulder was on the couch staring at the folder on his table. He turned to the door when a light knock interrupted his thoughts. Within moments he walked over and open the door, there stood Chloe. He immediately noticed the bags under her eyes but she still managed to smile. \"Good Morning.\" Kaulder said. \"Good Morning.\" Chloe replied. Chloe walked in, she met eyes with Dolan who merely held a smile upon his lips. While he couldn't explain it something seemed off about their new friend. Maybe it was the bags under her eyes or that her skin looked paler than usual. Whatever it was something just didn't seem right about her today. Chloe sat down on the couch with Kaulder sitting right beside her. \"Good Morning my dear.\" Dolan said. \"Morning…Dolan.\" Chloe said cheerfully A yawn escaped her lips as she forced her eyes to stay open but, Chloe still managed to smile she had to make it look like everything was okay but she was in fact very tired. \"So what is this about?\" Chloe asked. \"Seems we have another Dream Walker in our midst.\" Kaulder replied. Chloe could do nothing but stare she looked to Dolan who merely nodded \"I am afraid he's right.\" Dolan said. Kaulder moved the folder over to Chloe; she didn't hesitate as she flipped through it. Scanning over each piece of paper her eyes soon fell upon a variety of drawings of the person in question, but her eyes widen at the picture of masculine figure wearing a black cloak. \"There have been reports of witches and humans disappearing from their covens and homes; that picture was taken from a photographer before he ended up in the river.\" Kaulder said. \"Many say he only appears for just a moment leaving behind nothing but chaos in his wake.\" Dolan added. Chloe's eyes were still glued to the picture she couldn't believe it, all this time she thought he was just a figment of her imagination. You and I are the same The answer to her question caused her to close the folder she was wide awake now. Rising to her feet she looked to Kaulder who seemed a bit alarmed by her behavior. \"So where do we go from here?\" Chloe asked nervously. \"While Dolan researchers more into the matter you and I will go to where he last appeared maybe he left behind a clue.\" Kaulder replied. Chloe nodded she could feel her heart racing she just wanted to get out of here. Dolan could only watch as Chloe moved toward the door with Kaulder fighting to keep up. He was right something was wrong. The moment the door shut behind them he pulled the phone in front of him and quickly dialed a number within moments he held the receiver up to his ear. \"Ah hello yes it good to hear your voice too look ….I need a favor.\"[Chapter 2] The Last Witch Hunter Rise of the Dream Walker King Chapter Two Zooming down the street in a navy blue Aston Martin, Kaulder kept his eyes on the road. Silence erupted between them Ever sense they entered the car. Something was on Chloe's mind and he only hope she would tell him. In the passenger seat Chloe rolled down the window letting the wind smack her in the face. Yet it was no use for not even the forces of nature could stop her from thinking about the man in the picture. She wasn't sure if she should tell Kaulder that he also appeared in her dreams. Before now she felt as if she could tell him anything, but now she was scared. The car finally came to a stop; Chloe stepped out as her eyes wandered over the Ivory white two story building before her. An eerie feeling washed over her but she merely chalked it up to nerves. Soon Kaulder was by her side and the two of them walked carefully up the steps. Chloe tilted her head the moment she saw the symbol of the crane branded on the door. \"Where are we? Chloe asked. \"The coven of the Crane they are relative powerful witches that use ice magic. They mostly keep to themselves only coming out once or twice a year during the winter months.\" Kaulder explained. \"I think I have one seen them once in my life time when I was a girl, so what happened?\" Chloe asked. \"One night their whole coven vanished.\" Kaulder said. \"You think it was him.\" Chloe said. Kaulder responded by opening the door and stepping inside Chloe merely followed behind him. \"That's what we are here to find out.\" Kaulder replied. The moment they entered a fowl smell welcomed them. Neither of them could place it, pushing forward they continued to look around. The pale white walls now seemed to be plagued with streaks of a strange black residue. Many of the rooms held no chairs or tables if they did they were either broken or badly stained. No matter which room they checked the smell only seemed to get worst. It got to the point where Chloe had to stop because the odor was just too much to bare. \"What is that smell?\" Chloe finally asked. Kaulder's eyes wandered all over the main room but his eyes some became fixated on the floor; They narrowed at the strange piles of debris on the floor. The moment he got closer he could only stare for a piles few moments more before looking away. Flipping on the lights Chloe stood there her widen as she placed her hand over her mouth. For the piles on the floor were not debris they were the charred remains of multiple bodies. Kaulder's head snapped back near the door when some kind of shadow whisk by Chloe knocking her off guard. Without missing a beat Kaulder took off after it Chloe wanted to follow but she lost sight of him. \"Kaulder!\" Chloe yelled. \"Stay there!\" he yelled back. Standing among the remains as Chloe's ears picked up whispers and hissing. The more she tried to tune it out the louder it became. Soon tears clouded her vision as she dropped to knees with her hands claps over her ears. \"Stop please….\" Chloe pleaded. Laying curled up on the floor in the fetal position to the floor Chloe clenched her eyes shut as the sound grew louder. Soon a chant escaped her lips, the louder she said it the faster the noise around her faded away. After a while it was gone, but the moment she opened her eyes she was no longer in the Crane establishment. She was back at the barren wheat field and there looming above her was the man in the black hooded cloak. \"Hello again.\" The man said. Chloe rose to her feet she was only inches away from his face. Balling up her fist she stared at him how could he be so calm. \"Those witches….you did that didn't you?\" Chloe asked. \"Yes those who do not accept my order shall be an example of.\" The man replied. \"What order?!\" Chloe snapped back. \"That of us the Dream Walkers!\" The man announced. Overwhelmed by his response Chloe took a step back which only made the man take one step forward. \"…I don't even know your name.\" Chloe finally said. The man merely nodded so he removed his hood revealing a young spiky black hair man with piercing jasmine green eyes. \"My name is Demetrius Carton I am a pure Dream Walker and so are you.\" Demetrius replied. Chloe's eyes widen for she didn't know what to say, while she was aware of her gift she didn't know much more about it. She turned her head away from his eyes while she tried to put all of this together. But he merely took a hold of her hand resulting in her looking right back at him. \"What do you want from me?\" Chloe asked. \"While I know my methods of handling things seem unappealing together we could do so much more…\" Demetrius replied. Those words shook Chloe to the core while she was glad to encounter another person like herself he was tainted with darkness. At times like this she wish Kaulder was here he would know what to do.[Chapter 3] The Last Witch Hunter Rise of the Dream Walker King Chapter Three Following the shadow upstairs Kaulder entered a room filled with more charred remains. But something was different as he turned to the corner of the room he kept his eyes peeled as he slowly moved to the remains in the back. That's when his hears picked up a crunching sound. As Kaulder tired to be on his guard the shadow jumped up from the remains and slammed Kaulder against the wall with its hand clenched around his neck. Struggling to get free Kaulder noticed the shadows eyes held an icy tint along with his hand feeling a bit cold as well. \"An ice witch?\" Kaulder said aloud. \"For my King.\" The ice witch hissed. Kaulder wasn't sure who or what he was talking about but as the Ice witch clenched its hand even tighter around his neck he knew this was going to take longer than he planned. Downstairs lying on the floor still in the dream realm Chloe merely stood there as Demetrius held her hand and dropped down on one knee. \"Will you join me and rule by my side?\" Demetrius asked. Chloe closed her eyes she inhaled deeply and exhaled just as fast. Snatching her hand away from Demetrius she clenched her fists. The moment she opened her eyes her decision had been made. \"No…what you're doing is wrong and if I can't stop you I know Kaulder will.\" Chloe said. Rising to his feet Demetrius eyes narrowed Chloe backed away once more prompting him to stomp forward. \"You have let that…that witch hunter confuse we are…\" he trailed off \"You heard her she said no.\" A voice said a voice from behind him. Gritting his teeth Demetrius turned around with his fist balled up as a dark aura formed around them. \"No one asked you!\" he shouted Before Demetrius had a chance to strike he found himself blast back by a huge wave of light that sent him flying back into the darkness. Chloe smiled as she watched him disappear. \"There that should keep him busy.\" The voice said. Chloe turned to see a woman with long light brown hair with calm sea blue eyes wearing a pale yellow shirt with tight black pants and matching shoes. The lass looked to Chloe with a smile. \"Thanks.\" Chloe said. \"No problem by the way my name is Evelyn Maze and you must be Chloe Oliver.\" Evelyn said. \"Yeah but how did you know my name?\" Chloe asked. \"..Hen..um I mean Dolan gave me a call he said he needed a favor and he I am.\" Evelyn replied. \"Are you a dream walker too.\" Chloe asked. No I got here by other means. Evelyn replied. Chloe was glad for the help she would have to thank Dolan later. But she noticed that Evelyn's eyes held a sense of confusion within them. \"Where are you in the real world?\" Evelyn asked with worry in her voice. \"At the pale crane coven's building they are charred remains everywhere. Kaulder ran after a shadow that rose up from one of the bodies leaving me in the main room. Within in a seconds her new found ally took a hold of Chloe's hand and looked deep within her green eyes. \"I know there are many things you want to ask me, but you need to wake up right now.\" Evelyn said seriously. \"Not until you tell me why.\" Chloe asked. \"Not all of those witches are dead now go!\" Evelyn encouraged. Chloe's eyes shot up as she rose to her feet. This hissing was still in the room and now she knew why. For standing on each corner of the room were four ice witches staring her. \"Well this will be interesting.\" Chloe said aloud. Pulling out her sliver dagger from its holder Chloe's eyes narrowed as she took a deep breath. \"Come on then….who wants to go first?\" ","Summary":" The Last Witch Hunter Rise of the Dream Walker King Chapter One The sun was in the morning sky over"},{"Movie":"Last Witch Hunter","Title":"The Darkening","Author":"a-simple-gay","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858879","Passage":"[Chapter 1] p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 24px; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 18px; padding: 0px; color: #555555;\" data-p-id=\"e92f6d32c844d2f6e4ae70409733970e\"A long time of peace in the Land of Eight is coming to an end and Nínimel the elven Queen of the Forest Realm can sense it. Bandit raids have been slowly increasing, the animals are growing more aggressive and plants wilt and wither faster than before, but Nínimel isn't the only one sensing a change. Edlin Seadweller brave knight of the water realm can sense an unrest in the deep. Creatures who slept for so long are being awoken.

I felt a sudden intrusion at our eastern border. Bolted up in my seat. \"Contact the eastern scouts!\" I commanded. One of the servants went running away. \"What is it, your Majesty?\" On of the council members asked. \"It is a wind Nymph. An Aurea.\" I said. \"An Aurea? How unusual.\" My advisor Simony said. \"Yes.\" I muttered. \"Meeting dismissed!\" I called out leaving the discussion hall. I walked to the front gate. \"Your Majesty.\" The guards said bowing.

I saw that she was not alone. With her was a black haired man who floated just above the ground. A long white flowing robe trailing behind him as if blown by a gentle breeze. I stood as they approached me. \"Your Greatness.\" The Aurea said bowing. The scout bowed also. When they stood straight up once more I asked, \"What brings you to the forest floating one?\" \"There is trouble brewing on the edge of the wind realm.\" He answered. \"What kind of trouble?\" I asked. \"The metal realm has made plans to invade. We come to you for assistance.\" I frowned, the metal realm hadn't caused any trouble since the Realm Wars. \"The metal realm has been at peace with almost every realm, why have they decided this now?\" I asked aloud. \"I do not know.\" The Aurea said. Before I could say anymore a messenger came running up to me. \"Your Majesty! There is trouble near the south border! Creatures from the shadow realm are trying to get in! We do not know how much longer we can hold our ground.\" I gasped running away my silver hair flowing behind me./p p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 24px; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 18px; padding: 0px; color: #555555;\" data-p-id=\"91c0aef013d4f64cb50191aa53aa91e3\"I arrived in the war room. \"Update on the southern troubles!

Why in the name of Gorger would they leave their mountain caves?\" I asked. No one could answer my question. \"Quickly a carriage!\" I shouted. \"One is already prepared.\" Simony said.

One of the wraiths answered. \"A dark cloud of sickness has appeared on the border coming from the uncharted lands.\" \"Sickness you say? What kind?\" I ask. \"One unknown to us. It kills fast once the boils appear on the skin.\" Answered a goblin. \"How does it spread?\" I ask. \"Though touching and biting.\" Said another goblin. \"How many of you have come in contact with this sickness?\" I asked. Over half of them had. \"Keep every citizen out of this area! No one gets in without permission from me!\" I shout.

What!\" I shouted answering the bubble. I blocked one of the siren's claws. \"Madam Edlin a werewolf here to see you and she says it is important.\" Said the bubble's recorded voice. I stabbed one of the sirens through the chest. The other let out an enraged shriek. She started singing. I swim toward her in a fake daze. She smiled a sharp tooth grin. When I was within striking distance I lunged. My sword went through her stomach. \"Sorry, sweetheart I'm a woman,\" I said yanking my sword back. I let my sword return to the water. I an air bubble out of my mouth and caught it in my hands. \"On my way,\" I said into the bubble. \"Send to the original message sender,\" I said letting the bubble go.

I scoffed, \"Typical.\" I swam up to the surface where all trade deals were made. I climbed onto the platform and waited for my legs to appear. They appeared along with a pair of dark purple traveling pants. I hurried to the center of the platform where a small hut was. I walked inside and sitting there playing with a knife was the werewolf. She was dressed in all black with a blood red cloak. I could see her glowing yellow eyes even in the shadow of the hood. \"Who are you?\" I asked. \"Neta. I'm an assassin belonging to no realm and no one.\" The werewolf said. \"What brings you to the water realm Neta,\" I asked. \"A prophecy,\" Neta said. \"A prophecy? Not that prophecy?\" I asked worriedly. \"Yes, the Darkening is upon us,\" Neta said. I sighed, I had known for a long time that I was the knight of the water the prophecy had signaled out. \"Who else must we find?\" I asked. \"The Elven Queen Nínimel and the cloud dancer Allzeh,\" Neta said. \"An elf and an Aurea? Great! Why don't we throw a pixie into the mix!\" I shouted frustrated. \"You are missing the important details. The elf is a queen and the Aurea is a famous dancer with plenty of connections to the wind realm's government. \" Neta said. I just shook my head. \"The elves are peaceful beings, great when their own needs are threatened and excellent allies, but not ones for quests. The aurei are very laid back and are more concerned with parties and celebrations than with battles and adventures.\" Neta nodded, \"That is why we need them. People will trust them!\" \"You're right, I don't think people will be very friendly to a werewolf or a mermaid on land,\" I said nodding in agreement. \"Good, pack your things we leave tomorrow for the Forest Castle.\" The werewolf said. \"What time?\" I asked. \"Noon.\"/p[Chapter 3] p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 24px; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 18px; padding: 0px; color: #555555;\"Each realm has creatures and gods that match the being of the realm.

A woman emerged from the crowd, she a green cloak on the hood was up I could not see her face. I put her hood down and I gasped. \"I am Nínimel the elven Queen!\" The woman shouted. Almost immediately everyone in the square dropped to their knees in a bow, including me. Queen Nínimel laughed, \"Stand up! I do not care for such formalities and besides here I do not rule.\" I stood up and jumped off the stage. \"Come, your highness, I have a room rented at a local inn,\" I said. \"Lead the way and Nínimel will do just fine.\" Queen Nínimel said./p p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 24px; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 18px; padding: 0px; color: #555555;\"\"Have a seat,\" I said pulling a chair out for Nínimel. \"Thank you Allzeh,\" Nínimel said. \"Why have you graced me with your presence?\" I asked. \"Yesterday I received a message from a knight of the water, it said to bring you to my castle and wait until the Knight known as Edlin came to speak with us,\" Nínimel explained.

I heard a strange noise come from the front of the carriage. I walked up to see what caused it. I saw huge beasts with giant antlers and birch wood colored fur. \"Beautiful aren't they?\" Nínimel asked. She put her forehead to the forehead of one of the great beasts. She smile and the animal snorted. She backed away. \"What are they?\" I asked. \"Grand Elks. They are the royalty of the forest creatures.\" Nínimel bowed to the elk she had smiled at and the elk bowed back. She walked climbed inside the carriage and I followed /p p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 24px; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 18px; padding: 0px; color: #555555;\"Only 30 minutes had passed and we were already in the forest realm. \"Whoa! We were in the center of the Wind realm! That's like at least a days journey.\" I said. \"The Grand Elk like to travel fast,\" Nínimel said with a small smirk. The carriage stopped suddenly. I watched as Nínimel's ears twitched. \"Ruffians.\" She whispered. \"Ruffians?\" I asked. \"Yes, they are outcasts not allowed in any villages or within 3 miles (about 4.8 Kilometers) of the Castle. Usually, they are criminals with more than 5 infractions.\" Nínimel said. \"How can you tell the Ruffians from the Citizens?\" I asked. \"They have the tips of their ears cut off.\" She said. I gasped. Elves took a great deal of pride in their ears. It showed that they were greater than the humans and the tips of their ears are extremely sensitive to changes in magic among other things. They were probably the most important thing to an elf. \"Guards! I need my dagger!\" Nínimel shouted. \"Yes, your Highness!\" Someone shouted back. Nínimel opened the doors and jumped out gracefully. A guard threw her a purple sheath and from that sheath, she pulled out an elegant looking dagger with a purple hilt. I look out the window of the carriage. A bashed up looking face popped up and I jumped back screaming. The ruffian had a face that looked like mashed squash and where the tips of his ears should be are pieces of cloth. I heard The Queen chanting something I could not make out. The next thing I know a group of pixies is in the face of the ruffian by the window. I hid in the corner of the carriage far away from any window. I heard the sounds of a fight. The clashing of metal on metal. The anguished cries of the wounded. The shouting of commands./p p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 24px; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 18px; padding: 0px; color: #555555;\" Finally, it all died down until it became completely silent. The carriage door opened and I quickly did a twirl knocking the intruder back with a gust of wind. I heard a feminine grunt and knew I had just attacked Queen Nínimel. I quickly got out of the carriage and saw the guards helping her up. I dropped to my knees and bowed. \"I am so sorry! I was not thinking your Highness!\" I said in hopes that she might lessen my punishment. I just heard laughing. I sat up to see Queen Nínimel clutching her stomach laughing. I sat there utterly confused. \"Do not be sorry! That was probably one of the greatest surprises I ever got from opening that door.\" She said still laughing. The guards look just as confused. \"I don't get many unexpected surprises so that was a nice change.\" She explained. I started to laugh with her./p ","Summary":" p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 24px; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', 'Helvetica "},{"Movie":"Igor","Title":"Mad For You (Scamper x Mad Hare)","Author":"1prittypony1","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11828378","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Scamper once again through himself off of the old, wooden bridge. He felt the water meet him. \"Damn it.\"he said as he climbed out onto the bank wet and dripping and walked back to where he started to try to kill himself again. Eeyore walked up to him. \"Why ya tri'n to kill yourself?\" he asked with concern. \"Well...You see...\" he said as he treed to catch his breath from the long hike up. \"Igor made me immortal.\" \"And?\" Eeyore pushed. \"Well I don't see what the point of life is about if i'm gonna be around forever.\" \"Ya got your friends.\" Eeyore said as he motioned to the large group of animals that were sitting in a circle laughing and chatting with one another. \"Ya, but...\" \"But what?\" \"Well ya see, everybody got somebody but me.\" \"Everyone?\" \"Ya.\" \"What about The Mad Hare.\" \"You know about -\" \"Yep.\" \"Well. He's part of Rabbit and Rabbit's with Tigger.\" \"But he has his own body and he's not just a voice in Rabbit's head. In fact he's over there.\" Eeyore pointed to a tree were The Mad Hare was standing and trying to pick bark off tree he was standing next to. \"Ya, but.\" \"Your both suicidal. And since you can't die he can kill you as many times as he want's.\" \"I.\" \"Go over an' talk to 'im.\" \"Fine.\" Scamper dragged himself to where The Mad Hare stood. \"Hey, um Mad Hare.\" \"Yes.\" The Mad Hare turned around. \"Do you know who i am?\" \"Rabbit says that your depressed.\" \"Ya-\" \"And suicidal.\" \"Ya, that too.\" \"So can i kill you?\" \"Sure.\" Scamper shrugged as The Mad Hare took a knife out of his pocket and threw it at him. It landed where his heart was. Scamper pulled the knife out and the flesh mended itself back together. They did this for an hour and each time the Mad Hare tried something different every time. \"This is kinda getting boring.\" Scamper said. \"All right. What do you want to do next?\" The Mad Hare looked at him with anticipation. \"Well what do you want to do?\" \"Kill someone.\" \"Other than that.\" Scamper rolled his eyes. \"I am a little hungry.\" \"Hopefully not for rabbit stew.\" He joked. The Mad Hare smiled and laughed. \"No. I don't eat rabbit.\" \"Because he's over there.\" Scamper pointed to where Rabbit and Tigger were sitting chatting away with Alice and The Mad Hatter. He laughed. \"Very funny. But seriously. I don't hate him anymore.\" \"Why?\" \"You've never heard the story of us.\" \"No, but if it's boring, I don't want to hear it.\" \"Oh, don't worry. I think it will be most interesting to you. As in the words of the Mad Hatter 'Start at the beginning and when you get to the end, stop'\" \"So your friends with the Mad Hatter.\" \"Actually i see myself as another Mad Hatter.\" \"Oh, really? So are you going to start to look like him, And start wearing that ridiculous green hat and orange jacket and be addicted to tea?\" \"Well not dress like him. Unless you want me too?\" \"Oh, no, please don't. I don't want to see double.\" Scamper thought. \"But, you can't look like Rabbit because i can't tell if it's you\" Scamper said. \"So you want me to wear something. Because you hate me naked\" He smirked. \"No! I didn't say that.\" The Mad Hare looked at him in a 'Right?' look. \"Stop looking at me like that. Stop flirting with me.\" \"Do you like it when i flirt with you?\" \"Maybe. Yes. No. I don't know! Just tell me the story!\" \"Ok.\" So The Mad Hare started with the story and when he got the end he stopped. \"But how did you get your body back if you where back in Rabbit's head.\" \"I got enough evil power back to get the body I once had before back.\" \"Your not going to go back into Rabbit's head, are you?\" \"No, I like having my own thoughts for once. Although I can hear his thoughts and his emotions, but I've learned to ignore them.\" \"Well lucky for you I'm a fashion designer.\" \"Well I make hats.\" \"Well maybe I can teach you how to make clothes.\" \"I like that idea.\" \"Do you have an idea of what you'd want?\" \"Well... I did make some doodles.\" \"You did?\" \"Yep.\" The Mad Hare dug in his pocket in his fur. \"Found it!\" He yelled as he pulled two pieces of paper and handed them to Scamper. Scamper opened the first one. It was a picture of a blue long sleeved shirt with a collar and and a white vest over it and around the collar it had a black bow. \"So your copying Alice are you?\" \"Do you like it?\" \"Well it matches your eyes.\" \"Is that a compliment?\" \"Yes.\" \"So your flirting with me now.\" \"Uh.\" Scamper rolled his eyes. \"What's the other one.\" The other piece of paper had a white long sleeved shirt with a blue vest and over that was a black jacket and a black bow around the collar and white gloves. \"So which one do you like?\" Scamper asked The Mad Hare. \"Well, which one do you like?\" \"Well... why do you want to ask me? I'm gonna make it for you?\" \"And your going to see me wear it all the time.\" \"The second one.\" \"OK.\" \"Do you want me to start it now?\" \"Well, maybe in the morning.\" Scamper now looked to the sky and found that the moon had come up and that seemed to make the Mad Hare more calm and collected than in the daytime. His eyes focused only Scamper and the way he just stared at him with just this overwhelming emotion and Scamper couldn't tell if it was love of lust. Ether way it was making him nervous. \"Well,\" Said Scamper breaking the uncomfortable silence. \"I think we should go and get some sleep.\" \"Good idea.\" \"I'll see you tomorrow.\" And with that he winked at Scamper and walked to the campsite that they had set up the night before. \"G-goodnight.\" Scamper swallowed. 'What's going on with me' he asked himself. 'Why do I not like his flirting and like it at the same time. Maybe I should rest and think about it over breakfast. So Scamper went to the large tent that was behind the campfire that had been put out earlier. He walked into the tent and found his sleeping bag. He got under it and that's when he noticed that it was right next to the Mad Hare's sleeping bag. And to his left The Mad Hatter. 'Great. Just Great. How am I supposed to sleep with the obnoxious snoring Hatter and the flirty Hare next to me.' Eventually sleep claimed him and he began to dream. About the Hare and him. Kissing. Sex. He woke up from the dream breathing hard and sweaty. He won't get to sleep now. But luckily the sun had already risen and everyone else was up. He walked out of the tent groggy and tired and angry and he had to shut his eyes until he adjusted to the light. He found that the Hatter and Alice were drinking tea and everyone else had a cup too. 'How big were the Hatter's pockets' he wondered but he ignored the question as he reach for the eggs that had been cooked earlier. He tasted them. 'Great. Cold. Well that's what I get for sleeping late.' He took what was left in the pan and looked for a spoon. He found one in the dirt. He cleaned it off with his tongue. 'Yuck. Sand.' Scamper stuck his tongue out in disgust. Then he looked to find a place to sit. All the log spaces were talked except the one next to- 'Oh great. Just what I need. A flirty hare.' He walked over to where The Mad Hare was and sat down dramatically. His action had upset the fork on the Hare's plate and the Hare had to catch the entire plate from falling on the ground. \"Hey, watch it.\" \"Good morning to you too!\" Scamper grumbled. \"Dramatic much are we?\" \"I had a interesting drem if you actually want to know.\" \"What about?\" \"Well...you and me.\" \"What were you and I doing?\" he smirked. \"Where you the one who caused me to dream that?\" \"No!\" He shook his head. \"I can't control others dreams. I can only control mine.\" \"You can control your dreams? You can think them out while your asleep?\" \"Well, no but I can start them. All I have to do is close my eyes and think.\" \"About what?\" \"Anything.\" \"Like tea?\" \"Well, it's not ALWAYS tea. Anyway what did we do in your dream?\" \"Well you kissed me and we had sex.\" \"That is a very strange dream. Wonder what it means.\" He smiled. \"Stop smiling.\" He frowned. Scamper rolled his eyes. \"Well, you told me to stop smiling.\" \"You know what I meant.\" The Mad Hare made a blank face. \"Better.\" \"Do you want to throw that away for you?\" he asked. Scamper had eaten all his eggs and now his plate was empty. Scamper was uncertain. \"Why do you want to be nice to me suddenly?\" \"It's nice to help someone.\" \"Yes, but you just don't do it suddenly.\" \"Fine, go and throw it away yourself. I was just trying to help.\" The Mad Hare frowned again and gave him a puppy dog look. \"Stop that.\" After a few more seconds Scamper caved. \"Fine.\" In one full swoop the Mad Hare had thrown away the plate and came back to sit next to Scamper, except he was sitting so that there hindquarters touched. This made Scamper uncomfortable so he moved over. The Mad Hare moved with him. This continued until Scamper had reached the end of the log and had fallen into the mud. The Mad Hare laughed. \"It's not funny.\" The Mad Hare gave him his hand to help Scamper up. \"Thanks\" Scamper grumbled. \"No problem.\" After a few minutes of uncomfortable silence Scamper changed the subject. \"So, do you want me to start on the outfit now?\" \"Yea, if you want too\" the Mad Hare replied as he got his sketch out that they had looked at the day before. Scamper worked three days straight. He didn't stop for rest or food until it was done. The Mad Hare looked at himself in the mirror. \"I love it\" he said admiring himself in the mirror. \"You welcome\" said a tired and hungry Scamper. The Mad Hare turned around and noticed how tired and unhealthy he looked. \"I think you need to lie down, Scamper and maybe eat something too\" the Mad Hare said concerned. \"No i'm fine\" Scamper yawned. \"I don't need any sleep or food. I feel great.\" At that point he started to fall backwards and the Mad Hare almost didn't catch him. \"You need sleep\" The Mad Hare ordered. \"But really Mad Hare I'm fine.\" \"No buts. You are going to rest and that is final.\" The Mad Hare carried him bridle style to Rabbits bedroom. Scamper had no complaints. The Mad Hare looked at Scamper and Scamper looked up into his beautiful blue eyes. 'Wait, what am I thinking.' The Mad Hare lay him down and tucked him in. \"You know I can get into bed myself\" Scamper argued. \"I really like it. I do. You did a wonderful job.\" \"Your welcome\" Scamper said tiredly as sleep overtook him. The Mad Hare kissed his forehead and he pulled up a chair and watched as Scamper slept to try to protect him from any bad dreams that might come. Scamper was running. He could feel his heart beating and his breaths came in short bursts. He looked behind him. He didn't know what he was running from, he only knew that it would catch him if he didn't keep running. He felt his legs getting tired and soon he had to stop. He fell on his knees trying to catch his breath. The shadow was coming. He could see it getting closer, yellow eyes in the darkness getting closer. They were attached to a dragon, a black and purple dragon that weirdly reminded him of maleficent as a dragon. It started getting closer and closer and he could see the hate in her yellow eyes and just when he thought all hope was lost something jumped onto the dragons back and it started bucking like a bull to get whatever it was off. They stabbed it in the eye. The dragon bucked hard and whoever it was lost his grip on it's scaly back and was thrown into the wall hard. They got back up. The dragon turned to meet the disturbance of her dinner, rage, revenge and hatred in her eyes. The dragon gained on 'Wait, it that The Mad Hare. Yes. It is the Mad Hare.' The Mad Hare charged at the dragon and stabbed his sward into the giants belly. It cried with pain and clawed at him. It clawed his shirt vest and jacket which left three claw marks in the clothing. Blood poured out of his wounds. He climbed onto the monsters back again and he kept his grip tight this time. \"Off with your head\" he shouted. He lifted the sword that was stained red by the dragon and in one full motion cut the dragons head clean off. It fell to the ground with a thud and rolled and finally stopped at Scampers feet. The Mad Hare looked at Scamper. \"Are you all right? It almost got you\" he said concerned. Scamper nodded. He walked the rest of the way until he was at arms length. He looked him over with concern. Are you sure your all right?\" he asked again. Scamper nodded. \"What about you.\" \"Oh this\" he motioned to the claw marks. \"This is just a scratch.\" \"But it'll get infected if you don't bandage it up.\" \"I'll be fine. I'll manage.\" \"No, I won't let you do this to yourself.\" Suddenly a wrap appeared and landed right next to Scamper. \"Come here\" Scamper ordered. The Mad Hare shook his head. \"Fine then I'll come to you\" he said as he walked three steps so that he was face to face with The Mad Hare. \"Turn around and sit down.\" The Mad Hare obeyed. Scamper removed the clothing carefully. Then he wrapped his abdomen with the white linen cloth. He finished and just as he finished wrapping the white linen and securing it with a safety pin that had also fallen magically from the sky he pat the bandage as he said, \"Well, that should do it.\" The Mad Hare winced in pain and Scamper said, \"I'm sorry.\" as he looked up into those beautiful sky blue eyes. Deep as the ocean and overflowing with the sweetest emotion Scamper had ever seen. Love. Pure Love and not lust. The Mad Hare looked for something in Scampers chocolate brown eyes. He seemed to get his answer as he leaned in he checked once more for an understanding. Scamper nodded and there lips meet in an overwhelming complete bliss. That's when he woke up. The Mad Hare stared down at him and smiled softly. \"Goodnight\" he said. Scamper was confused but he looked outside the window as it was growing dark outside. \"You slept the whole day.\" The Mad Hare said. \"And you stayed with me the whole day?\" \"I didn't want any nightmares to attack you.\" \"Did you kiss me?\" Scamper asked. \"No, why?\" The Mad Hare said questioningly. \"Well I had a dream that you protected me from a black and purple dragon and then you got hurt so i had to patch you up and then I looked into your eyes and you kissed me. It felt so real.\" \"Do you want it to be real?\" The Mad Hare asked. \"Well. Um. No\"Scamper said coming back to his senses. \"No\" he said defensively. The Mad Hare's ears sagged and the smile turned into a frown. \"I understand\" he said sadly. He tuned around and walked out the door leaving a guilty and shocked Scamper behind. The next morning nether of them spoke to each other. The entire day they avoided each other. Eeyore finally had enough. \"OK, Scamper. What's going on.\" \"Nothing. Why?\" \"Oh, come on. Like you don't know. What happened between you and The Mad Hare.\" \"Why are you asking?\" Scamper said nonchalantly. Suddenly Rabbit came barging in. His hands like fists at his sides and he wiggled his nose in annoyance as he puffed himself up. \"What did you do to The Mad Hare!\" he yelled. \"Why is everyone so curious about what happened?!\" Scamper yelled. \"Because, if you haven't noticed, The Mad Hare is my other half of me. I care about him. What did you say to him. He hasn't been himself all morning. He didn't do anything destructive so far and I'm getting worried.\" \"Well...\" said guilty. \"What happened\" Rabbit put a hand on Scamper shoulder. \"Well, I don't know Rabbit. It's so confusing. Love is so confusing. He started looking at me with this strange emotion like a mix between love and lust. And then last night he said indirectly that he loved me. I don't know if he loves me or likes the idea of me. I don't know what to do.\" Scamper started to sob. \"Hey, It's OK. I know love is a hard emotion to understand\" Rabbit rubbed his back in a comforting gesture. Scamper still sobbed. \"But i'll tell you what.\" \"What\" Scamper said sniffling. \"I've known The Mad Hare longer than you have and I've never seen his act like this toward anyone. Your special to him.\" \"But does he really love me, or is he just using me.\" \"He's told me himself that he loves you.\" \"Really?\" Scamper said unbelieving. \"If you don't believe me, ask him yourself.\" \"OK.\" Scamper wiped his tears. \"Mad Hare\" he said as he walked up to him. The Mad Hare turned around. His ears drooped. His eyes had lost the evil glint in them and he was a depressed Hare. He also had been crying because Scamper could tell from his puffy red eyes. \"Don't talk to me, please\" he pleaded. \"Look, I'm sorry for last night\" Scamper apologized. \"You said that you didn't loved me. You rejected me!\" The Mad Hare glared at Scamper. \"I only rejected you because I wasn't sure that you loved me.\" \"I do\" said The Mad Hare truthfully \"So you won't use me and leave my heart on the floor in a milion pieces.\" \"I vow that I will be loyal to you for all time.\" Scamper smiled. \"Then theirs something that I want to do to show you how much I love you.\" \"What's that.\" Scamper tuged at his black bow and they there lips met in hevenly bliss. In the background there was a resounding round of claps and wissels and shouts. \"Did we just kiss in front of everyone?\" Scamper asked. \"Why, is there a problem?\" \"No problem at all\" Scamper said as he kissed his Hare again.

I was going for comedy and didn't quite make it. I'm not sure whether the story will develop further, but for now, here's a...thing I made. Completely unbeta'd so far. Ch.1 So this was show business. He still preferred to think of it as unleashing his creation on an unsuspecting populace. He'd managed to convince Eva that he wouldn't make a good manager, but it seemed she had also decided he was her boyfriend. And he...well, he was okay with that, though a little breathless at being dragged along. He moved closer to the TV screen where Eva was being interviewed by some author for her show. \"So true\" she was saying \"war is neither good for the living nor the undead\". She looked directly into the camera and when she smiled, it seemed to be directed entirely towards him. That's how she always was with people. She talked and the world became a better, simpler place for a while. You could forget that she'd been born yesterday. She had something on a rack in the hallway. A suit. That bright yellow suit again. Igor frowned as he tried it on. I must look like a speed bump in this. Or a really weird banana. \"Oh, that suit.\" Eva remarked. \"Yellow is such a happy color! she said shyly \"It made me think of you.\" Well, for that reaction I'd put up with a lot more. \"You really think it's me ?\" Eva nodded. \"I do, really. And Igor?\" \"Yes?\" \"I know I should exercise my boundaries and not let things get to me and while it's incumbent upon me as an actress to present a good role model and to model self-confidence as well as a positive body image-\" She could go on for weeks like this. \"Yes?\" Igor asked. \"Do you think they'll like me?\" she asked in a tiny voice. Igor blinked. \"They all watch your show. Of course they will. Come on.\" She let him lead her out to the coach. The reception was crowded and noisy, full of people. Igor endured photos, disturbing questions about his underwear preferences (from TV host Crystal Clear), and a sprinkling of good natured stepladder jokes. Eva went off to talk with some director or other so Igor made his way past a large poster ad that read \"Malaria: A Sunny Nation of Farmers!\" and an advertisement for Eva's new book. \"Ah, the man of the hour!\" A dark skinned man in a beige suit raised his glass at Igor and smiled benevolently. \"Mr. Durmott?\" Igor knew the man was one of the cabinet but he'd never met him personally. \"So you're the man behind the groundbreaking \"sunny nation of farmers\" campaign. Work of genius. Most people approve of farming as long as they're not the ones doing it.\" \"um. Right, and-\" \"I'm sure that will be sufficient to convince the other nations we've attacked to leave us alone. It's also good to know that we just happen to have a recently unemployed section of the populace standing ready to handle the tractors.\" \"What?\" \"Merely congratulating you on your good work, Mr. Igor.\" His expression became less amused, more urgent. \"Of course, your Eva will make it to the world hunger charity event? Malaria needs her-\" His voice was cut off by a waiter. \"Phone call, Mister. It's from someone called Scamper.\" An extremely haggard rabbit appeared on the screen. \" Igor . Someone gave Brain a drum.\" \"Just a moment.\" Igor turned back to some of the company who were watching with interest. \"That's Scamper, and Brain's a brain in a jar\" he explained. \"I guess you could call them my brainchildren. Ha.\" The hare stared at him for a moment. \"That was bad and you should feel terrible. Do you realize someone gave Brain a drum ?\" He stared at Igor with pleading bloodshot eyes and for a moment almost sounded as if he wanted to cry. \"I can't sleep. I can't think \". His voice returned to his usual flat, sardonic tone. \"I want to put my head in a vice and end it all, but I can't even do that . Plus I think he leaked on your bed.\" \"Ugh.\" Igor put his palm to his face. \"Just...put in some earplugs and tell Brain I'll deal with him when I get home.\" Then a loud electronic screech came from the stage. Igor couldn't see over the crowd, but he immediately recognized the voice even though it was slurring. \"So here we are, not being evil. Well, you lot of upstanding citizens aren't. What did I do? I might have told a few lies, stolen some ideas. So what? Information wants to be free. At least I never burdened an animal with intelligence and immortality and forced it to work for me. I never covered up the suspicious death of an esteemed scientist, I never dated a creature I created myself.\" The crowd in front of Igor stepped back a little, giving him a view of the stage for the first time. Schadenfreude caught his eye and smiled confidentially to Igor: \"What does that make her, your daughter? And she's how old? Two months? Three? Well done there . But just between you and me even evil should have standards . \"I'm going, I'm going\" Shadenfreude waved one hand imperiously at the security guards advancing on him. \"No, really, how much do they pay you guys?\" He had started backing away by this time, but it did no good. By the time Schadenfreude had been wrestled to the ground, Igor had already gone looking for Eva. He finally caught up with her outside the entrance, where she was seated on the ground, deep in conversation with a number of people. At least she'd missed the speech. Good . \"Look, I need to leave. It's Scamper, Brain's, uh...doing Brain things again.\" \"I'll come with you.\" \"No, that's okay...really, that's okay.\" He protested as Eva climbed to her feet, moving far more lightly than an engine of mass destruction should. \"But we haven't seen each other very much at all lately. I've been so busy with my book, and the ads and the new movie... Oh my gosh, did I tell you I'm going to be in a movie!? Right here in Malaria.\" \"That's great\" he said weakly. \"I'm sure the people representing the orphanage won't mind if I talk to them later, will you? Call me!\" \"Yeah, let's get going\" he resisted the temptation to look back at the door. There were almost certainly no angry mobs behind him. Next day, far away in a pickle packing plant a man slouched despondently over his desk. He was wearing a flamboyant lime green shirt, one that could only be worn by the extremely handsome and acutely confident. He was both, but today even his collar drooped in misery. \"Pucklemacker!\" A shrill voice called outside his door. Oh. Her. A short hunchbacked woman with red pigtails burst into the room. He didn't look up until he'd counted to ten. When he finally did, she was standing with her arms folded, fuming. Perfect. \"Why Jacqueline,\" he said smoothly, \"or Heidi? Igorina? Or whatever you're calling yourself these days. How was the date with that Igor? Bit low, dating the help\" he chuckled. Ugh. All that time with Jacqueline, I was with this creature. She only snorted derisively. He considered that any woman with such a turned up nose shouldn't snort. \"You should know. How's business Pucklemacker ?\" She gave a shark's grin. He folded his arms, sniffed haughtily and looked away. \"Terrible, eh? It's not fair, you know. That idiot of an Igor gets to go to parties while I'm punished for believing in a loser like you. I've got something to make it all better, though.\" \"Nonsense.\" He said, then far too intensely, \"I'm done. I'm through. It's over.\" She raised an eyebrow at that. \"Who's the leech now? But I've got something that will get me into baby seal boots again...\" Schadenfreude winced at the sound of Jacqueline's voice coming from an Igorina's mouth. Stupid, selfish, greedy woman. But she did have her uses.

I noticed a couple other fics about Scamper being angsty so I decided to do it in my own style. Basically, this short fic is about Scamper having a talk with Eva after Brain passes away. Enjoy! Scamper sat alone on the balcony, gazing deep into the black night sky above. In his paws, he clutched a label that said \"Brain\" on it. The zombified rabbit breathed a heavy sigh as he ran his fingers across the label. Just then, he felt a presence behind him and he slowly turned around to see Eva standing before him, \"Scamper...is everything all right?\" \"Talk about a wake up call.\" The rabbit smirked, \"Everything's just hunky dory when you factor in that I'm immortal and will watch everyone else die...\" \"Scamper, I'm sorry...\" Scamper sighed and closed his eyes, \"Yeah, well sorry won't bring that idiot back.\" Eva walked over to the depressed rabbit and sat down next to him, gently stroking his ears, \"We all miss him, you know.\" \"So what? I'll miss all you guys when you're all six feet under and I'm still alive and kicking.\" Scamper grumbled, crossing his arms. \"Igor made me indestructible, remember?\" Eva replied with a smile. \"Being indestructible and being immortal are two completely different things, you know.\" Scamper corrected Eva, \"Just give it time, you'll slow down and eventually stop like the rest of them.\" Eva sighed. She knew Scamper was right. There was nothing but dead silence between the two before a choked sob came out of the zombie bunny. Scamper squeezed his eyes shut, a salty tear rolling down his muzzle and coming to a rest on the end of his nose. It hung there for a few seconds before another tear joined it and it fell from the rim of his nostril, hitting the metal floor of the balcony, \"I...I don't want to be alone...\" \"Scamper...\" \"It's no wonder I wanted to die so badly.\" Scamper sniffled, wiping his nose with the back of his paw, \"Such a miserable existence...an endless cycle of friends coming and going...so many funerals to attend, so little time...\" \"You always have your evergreen, you know.\" Eva comforted the rabbit. Scamper blinked a few times but then rolled his eyes, \"So? Is Igor going to bring it to life? Plants generally have lower IQs than Brain and that's saying something.\" \"I just want you to consider it as an option, in case you ever feel lonely.\" Eva replied, stroking Scamper's long ears again. \"My tears are all the company I'll need once you guys croak.\" The rabbit replied sarcastically, \"Last time I checked, salt water doesn't talk back to you or give you migranes.\" \"I just want you to be happy, that's all.\" Eva replied gently as she continued petting him. \"Easier said than done, Eva.

Besides, I'm feeling a bit rusty and kind of down. I don't know. Anyway, ya go. Disclaimer: Igor and all other thingies in reference to belongs to its respected people the Exodus Film and whatnot. ------------------------------------------- Once Upon a Time In a Kingdom called Malaria, there lived a benefaction King who overthrew the king before him. Several days ago, in fact, the peaceful denizens of the kingdom thought the old king was a benefaction king as well, but as it turned out he had lied to his people. They didn't have to be evil to survive. He was the one who created the clouds the swathed their land in never ending darkness. The new King had stopped the weather machine that caused Malaria to be covered in a thicket of clouds and become the hero of Malaria's darkest chapter. And all the farmers could farm again, and the gardeners garden. And everyone was happy. Well, almost everyone. All the evil scientists, who during the old King Malbert's reign had rent free castles in the wicked woods, were now obsolete. Old King Malbert. That was the old King's name, of course. He was a squat, up-to-no-good-looking man, who made you think 'Gosh, is that man a cockroach or a cowboy?' when you saw him. All the inventions intent for wickedness were left to rust or put to better use, such as flower pots or out houses. And the evil scientists who were obsolete went back to doing what their families did before the clouds. During the Cloudening many strange and unusual people came and opened shop but the clouds were gone and they changed their evil themed fairs to something that the new King preferred. Acting. All of this made several people upset, one of which was freshly graduated evil scientist named Ivo, who had gone to the university for robotics and general evil arts and sciences. She had just received her castle in the woods the week before the old reign was old. Yes, for people like Ivo, this new way of life was awful. Almost evil, even. She had just finished setting up her evil lab, finding the perfect outlet, and plugging in her small T.V when the Evil Scientist competition was interrupted by this- this upstart. She dreamed of having a big T.V, one that would make the King himself drool when that hunchy little Igor ruined everything. And Ivo in her frail frame was completely utterly crushed. What was more awful, the fact that they had sunlight again or that evil was no longer fashionable? Maybe it won't be so bad, she thought, as she busily closed her blinds. The sunlight hurt her colourless skin. The sunlight hurt her poor red eyes. Darn him, that little hunchy back. The reality of the matter was that things did not get better. No one in Malaria with a single cent in their pocket wanted to pay for evil these days, and she had student loans to pay. So, she sat there, in her old second-hand shop red chair that sat in an obsolete lab that had obsolete degrees on the wall and state-of-the-art obsolete equipment. She was wearing that same black dress that enveloped her whole being, so it looked as though her pale angular head was balanced on a black toothpick. Once well kept, it was covered in bits of things. Her thin white hair fell over her eyes, frazzled. They looked dead up at the ceiling, the T.V. was on. Just for background noise. \"Maybe I should kill myself?\" She asked inquiringly to no one in particular, even though there was only one other person-thing in the room with her. A green fishy sort of man-dog, who her family had kept, bought as a pet when it was just a guppy. Instead of staying small and fish like he just kept growing until he was the size of a Doberman, who now lying in front in front of her on the mink skin carpet. The green fishy man snorted, and flipped a page of the magazine he was reading lazily, \"But your parents sent you squash today.\" \"I'm allergic to squash,\" Ivo replied. Which was rather ironic. For you see, after the sun was blocked by Malbert's clouds, the Squasholds changed their names to Strangleholds to fit with the 'need to be evil' thing. But now that the sun was back so were the squashes. It was a pity that Ivo was allergic to them. It was also a pity she was allergic to grass, rag weed, marigold, wheat, hay, barley, most pollens, dairy, bees, peanuts, nuts, all animal dandruff, other squash like plants, and most lentils. In fact, there were few things she wasn't allergic too, \"Besides, what has squash to do with the present problem?\" \"What's the problem again?\" The fishy man asked, languidly flipping another page as he moved his tailfin from the up position to down. It made a thud against the old wooden floor. \"The problem!\" She said, her voice starting to get loud. Ivo made a notable attempt to get out of the chair, but she failed miserable and suck back in deeper than before, \"The problem is that- Is that, argh, why are you so stupid, anyway! Don't be so stupid! I should have replaced you with an igor when I had the chance.\" Ivo thrusted herself up and out with disgust, stumbling over her fishy friend-pet, who was scratching himself in horrible places, \"Igor! That awful Igor- thinks he can just act like a normal person and do things! She brushed down her black dress as though it had insulted her by puffing out more then normal as she stalked across the room on her nimbly legs. Ivo gave her fishy friend a hard glare, \"And I'll show them, that they can't just change the way things work- you know why Claud?\" Claud's murky eyes looked up and met hers for a moment, \"Because you're an evil master mind and everyone in Malaria will tremble at your feet?\" He said this dryly, as though he had heard it time and time again. \"That's right!\" Ivo stormed out of the room, shaking her fist in the air as though angry at some unknown deity of bad fortune. Bad fortune and hunchbacks. From the other room, she continued her rating, about how people will cringe when her name was spoken, and children would weep when she came by. Her breath uneven, rigid, and raspy. But the fishy man had stopped listening. He, Claud, looked up at the T.V. The new King was on again. It was such a beautiful day outside. He turned another page in the magazine. ","Summary":" Ivo Author's note: I recently saw Igor, and thought, what the heck.

It had been about two years since Eva's Evil Bone had deactivated in the sun and how Igor revealed the king's big secret to the entire kingdom. The once dead and dark land covered in thunderstorm clouds now showed bright blue skies, green grasses and fresh healthy trees. Igor and Eva were getting along fine. To poor Scamper and Brain they felt like third wheels. Well, at least Scamper did. He was the third wheel and Brain was the little guy who might as well have been a child with his low brain activity, if there even was any. Scamper sighed and pulled his hand through his long yellow-tan ears. He stared down over the kingdom. Everyone seemed so much happier now that the sun had returned and that the clouds were gone, probably for forever. The only exception regarding the clouds was the occasional one or two thunderstorms that showed up during the summer. The sun set slowly and Scamper wondered faintly if Eva and Igor were even thinking about showing back home tonight. There was every now and then that they didn't come back because they decided to go on some little adventure or spend the night alone together without having to worry about being interrupted by Brain (because Brain and Brain alone was dense and stupid enough to empty a closet or empty bedroom door when he didn't know where Igor or Eva was). The sound of Brain's squeaky wheels came to Scamper's long ears and he turned to face Brain. He turned on the balcony where he sat to face his friend. Brain seemed a little less enthusiastic than usual, his usual hyper-ness evaporated. \"Hey Brain,\" Scamper said in a monotone voice. \"Hey Scamper,\" Brain responded in an almost melancholy voice. His metal arm trailed on the ground and he came to press himself against the pillars that helped support the railing on the balcony. Scamper turned and faced the setting sun as well. It was orange now, and he marveled in the brilliance of it. There were particles of yellow golden in the soft hints of clouds high above, and later there would probably be a gentle pink tone. It was beautiful. The usual hopelessness filled Scamper again. Of course, this beautiful sunset would be gone soon. \"So are Igor and Eva back yet?\" Scamper asked, making his tone so that he might as well have been talking about the weather. He didn't want to think about sunsets. \"No,\" Brain seemed to sigh. \"I don't think they'll be coming back tonight.\" Scamper sighed with his friend and rolled his shoulders, his joints popping gently. Then he turned and he started to walk back inside the castle when Brain's voice stopped him. \"Do you think they'll ever come back?\" \"Of course,\" Scamper replied instantly, turning to face his friend. \"Igor wouldn't just leave his greatest inventions here to rot would he?\" \"We're not his greatest ones,\" Brain muttered. \"Eva is. She's life. He created life. And what are we? Nothing.\" Scamper stared at his friend with sad eyes. Letting out another sigh he walked over to his friend, stopping before him and placing a kind hand on Brain's jar that was his head. He smirked when he read it scribbled ' Brian' in Sharpie. Then he looked in Brain's mechanical eyes. He knew his friend was right. Brain was just a machine that could think for himself. He didn't have a beating heart or blood rushing through veins. He was a machine, just about as alive as a basic computer. As for Scamper, well, technically he was alive (well, they both were), but at the same time he was immortal. The fact he was immortal is what made him not really alive. If you can't die, you can't have been alive in the first place. If Igor hadn't injected him with his last Immortal formula then Scamper would have been Igor's first invention that was alive, and not Eva. Then there was also the point of the beating heart, the rushing blood and the working lungs. Scamper would never feel the need to breathe if he didn't have so much to say to everyone. . . Scamper felt a little twinge of jealousy when he thought this, of the great Eva, and he pushed the thought of her aside, along with his envious feelings. He turned back to Brain. \"Brain. Eva may be Igor's first love and first invention to receive life, but we're his first friends. He's not going to just leave us hanging. He'd come to get me, and, well, he might come and get you.\" Brain's eyebrows went down in fake anger. \"No he'd come to get both of us,\" he said. \"Well we're never have to worry about that though; Igor will never leave us, not for long at least.\" Brain finally allowed himself to smile and he started to roll back in to the castle, not saying anything else, but definitely in a better mood than when he first showed up. Scamper watched for a moment, then followed his friend slowly with a little slouch in his walk. He rolled his eyes and started going to the kitchen to begin making a past dinner snack. He didn't need to eat. He was never hungry, but he enjoyed eating. At least he never had to worry about loosing weight or gaining any. He walked back in to the living room and jumped on to the couch, flipping on the TV. Brain's laugh sounded in the castle from somewhere and Scamper allowed himself to again roll his eyes. Brain's active naïve-ness always caused a small smirk of amusement to flash up his face. Scamper ate his dinner and fell asleep to the slow hum of the TV.

For an 'evil scientist' Igor's not a bad guy, but like many people who aren't 'bad guys' he's managed to do some pretty terrible things in his life. I'm one of them. See, he once invented this serum and decided it would be a pretty neat idea to test it on a lab rabbit. If Igor was someone else, he might have paused to wonder whether he should burden an innocent little bunny with sentience and immortality, but no. Instead, as he tells it, he struggled with his conscience tormented over whether or not he was 'evil' enough to hurt a rabbit by giving it a shot. Now, Igor's a smart guy, almost definitely a genius, but he just doesn't think. Brain probably has more philosophical depth. The way he tells it, he finally decided to make the serum ingest able and stick it into a carrot. Imagine what it was like for me. One moment the world was a fog, then suddenly I felt like my head was going to split open. Then I realized I'd just had a thought. \"Ow, my head.\" I was thinking about myself. I had a self. And suddenly I was all alone, separate from the rest of the world because of the self thing. Oh, alright, alone except for the big, dumb looking guy staring down at me. And a brain on wheels that made noises. Man he turned out to be annoying. My litter mates, the rabbits that used to live in cages across from me, the ones I could always hear and smell disappeared one day. They were just gone. Igor told me that his master had gotten rid of them. I wanted to follow them, but they had gone where I couldn't follow. As time went on I learned that eventually everyone would go the same place. The idiot Brain, my creator, everyone except me. Once while Igor wasn't looking I chewed up his notes about the serum. He still doesn't know what really happened to them. Brain and I spent most of our days hiding from Igor's master. This Dr. Glickenstein had a library of books he never touched. I've never seen Igor go near anything that wasn't a technical manual either, but as soon as I learned to read, I started using books to fill up the long hours while Igor worked. Because I'm a rabbit, my sight isn't the best, but I kept trying, holding my face very close to the page. Some books I didn't understand, but some like Watership Down and Animal Farm made me feel a little like I wasn't so alone in the world. They also made me horribly depressed, but so does everything else so that's nothing new. In addition to those, I read philosophy, the encyclopedia, anything I could get my nose into. Always, at the end of the day we were there to meet Igor. He'd sit at his desk trying to draw up blueprints for hours before he fell asleep. Sometimes he'd just talk to us. He told us all about what he'd do when he was a famous Evil Scientist. Crushing the world, subjugating the masses, that kind of thing. To tell the truth I don't think he had any kind of real plan for it. Just 'Step one, make machines. Step three, rule the world.' Okaaay, genius. Anyhow, on that day out on the balcony Dr. Glickenstein suddenly pushed the door open. Igor barely had time to shove Brain and I behind a lawn chair. \" Gee Brain, why don't you move your claw a little lower? My kidneys aren't completely crushed yet .\" I whispered. \"Ow! That was sarcasm!\" Luckily there was a sheet hanging out to dry on the balcony. From behind it I could see Igor as he grabbed a convenient broom and pretended he'd been sweeping all along. If Dr. Glickenstein spotted us, we would probably all die. Well at least, he was welcome to try it with me, but I have a soft spot for the other guys. \"Aha!\" Schadenfreude's voice rang out from the speakerphone. \"Why hello there, Doctor Glickenstein.\" Dr. Glickenstein's voice was grumpy as usual. I could just see him frowning, shaggy gray eyebrows knit together. \"What is the meaning of this? I'm doing important things and I cannot. be. interrupted!\" He punctuated his statement by pounding the wall. Igor winced, momentarily stopping his sweeping to glance nervously at the man. Glickenstein, thankfully didn't seem to be paying him any attention. \" I know your secret .\" I could picture Schadenfreude leaning closer \"Your adorable secret with the big floppy ears and the cute little twitchy nose.\" \"What?\" \"Your secret with the white...fluffy...tail...?\" Schadenfreude's voice was dripping with smugness. \"I don't know what you're saying.\" Dr. Glickenstein was confused now. \"Yes you do.\" \"No, I don't!\" \"Look, can we have done with this charade? Can you just get to the part where you admit you know what I'm talking about?\" \"Listen, you preposterous man if you think-\" Igor was watching Dr. Glickenstein very carefully. Maybe he was confused, but I began to have a horrible suspicion. \" Brain, listen, this is bad .\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"They know about you.\" Igor was pacing up and down the floor, nervously running his hands through his hair. \"Okay, this is bad, but maybe, maybe Schadenfreude will be impressed and let me work for him?\" \"He's not talking about me, he said 'adorable'\" Igor threw up his hands. \"What else would he be talking about?\" \"Well, Igor.\" I nervously tapped the floor with a foot. \"Supposedly sentient beings like us, you know how we do that thing where we say things that aren't true so we can imagine things we can't have in real life?\" Igor just looked at me. \"Stories, I mean.\" Cripes, this was embarrassing. \"Hey, is this about you using Dr. Glickenstein's computer?\" Brain squeaked his wheel. \"Igor, I kind of used Dr. Glickenstein's computer to publish some fiction.\" I blurted, glaring at Brain. \"Yeah, totally, they were all like: 'Agent of N.I.M.H.' and 'One Bad Rabbit: Flopsy, Mopsy AND Cottontail (weird tilted line thingy), Peter.'\" Igor's face had started looking pretty interesting by this point. Something between rage and utter confusion. Confusion won. \"So I should be worried?\" He sighed. \"Er...\" \"That's a yes, then.\" \"Maaaybe.\" ","Summary":" \"What could be worse than being an Igor forever?\" Igor sighed, leaning on the balcony. \"I don't "},{"Movie":"Igor","Title":"The Next Step","Author":"Bladequeen2000","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7461346","Passage":"[Chapter 1] (My first Igor story! I saw the movie and I liked how adorable it was! I hope you enjoy this!) The Next Step After weeks of strenuous planning and gathering materials for what he considered his next big project, Igor gently placed the white tarp neatly over the small body occupying the table. Eva waited and watched from across the room with an eager anticipation. They had talked about taking this kind of leap in their relationship and they both agreed; they were ready. Since then it was picking the gender, the features, the age and the right brain that would harbor the right personality they were looking for. They agreed on most of what they wanted; a girl, somewhere between six and ten, and a sweet and bubbly disposition yet full of energy. The only hitch was what features to give her. Igor wanted her to look more like Eva, but Eva wanted her to look more like Igor, so they compromised on giving her features of both. After everything, all that was left was simply pulling the switch and bringing her to life. Their dog, Sandy (whom Eva named after the dog from her favorite musical Annie), seemed to be waiting just as eagerly as Eva from her side, his tail wagging anxiously. Scamper waited for Igor's say by the switch with Brain right next to him. Igor turned and looked at Eva. \"You ready for this?\" Eva replied with a grin and a nod and even Sandy gave an affirmative bark. Igor then turned to Scamper. \"Alright, Scamper, pull the switch!\" \"Oh, couldn't I pull the switch, please?\" Brain begged. \"Do I need to remind you what happened the last time you tried to pull the switch?\" Scamper asked, rhetorically. \"That was an accident! Just gimme a second chance, please?\" Brian tried again, cutting in front of Scamper. \"That was your second chance!\" Scamper retorted going around Brian and placing his paw on the switch. \"Oh, please! Please let me pull the switch!\" \"No!\" Igor had facepalmed somewhere between the arguement. \"Would you guys just pull the switch already?\" With that, Scamper pulled the switch down and the table rose up to the inner sanctum of the new Tesla tower that Igor had built to replace the lightning that almost never struck Malaria now that Dr. Malbert's machine was permanently shut down. At first, Brian pouted at not being able to pull the switch, but was soon distracted by the bright flash that signified the new life joining them. Igor signaled Scamper to pull the switch back and the table slowly made its way back down. Everyone eagerly waited for the arrival of this newcomer, but when the table came to a stop, they only saw the white tarp, disturbed and bunched up a little. Igor approached the table, a bit confused. Where was she? She couldn't still be in the Tesla tower, could she? That would be very bad... \"Igor?\" came Eva's voice. Her tone asked the question everyone else was probably thinking: did it work? Sandy trotted over and started sniffing the tarp. Just as Igor started lifting one end of the tarp, the whole thing was suddenly lifted upwards and out of the sudden motion came a small, but sweet voice. \"BOO!\" As the group jumped a little, the little voice giggled, still slightly covered by the tarp. \"There you are,\" Igor gave a nervous chuckle as he pulled the tarp off her head, \"you had us going there for a minute.\" Eva's colored eyes stared back at him through a shoulder-length curtain of his colored hair. When she pushed it behind Eva's shaped ears, he could see smaller versions of his nose and mouth on a little head shaped slightly like his. They were very lucky to find other parts that were proportional to the rest of her body. Eva had made her way over to the table next to Igor. \"Oh! Igor! She's so adorable!\" She exclaimed picking her up, tarp and all, and holding her, \"Just the sweetest little thing!\" \"Hi! Thank you!\" The little bundle greeted. Everyone gathered around Eva to get a better look. \"We have to think of a name for you.\" Eva said matter-of-factly, earning a grin and a nod from their little girl in the tarp, \"How about Annie?\" \"Annie?\" Igor asked. Yet another name picked from that musical? Well, if it made Eva happy, then he was happy. \"Do you like that name?\" Eva asked her, \"Annie?\" \"Uh-huh!\" Annie replied. \"Annie! I'm Annie!\" \"Alright then,\" Igor started, \"welcome home, Annie.\" Fin. (Disclaimer: I don't own Igor or the other movie characters, but I do own little Annie.) ","Summary":" (My first Igor story!

The "},{"Movie":"Igor","Title":"Guinea Pig","Author":"RedHatMeg","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6934067","Passage":"[Chapter 1] My first fic to Igor . Sorry that Scamper and Brain gets a bit OOC in few parts, but I believe that it would be their reaction on the fact that Igor was testing things on himself. And one more thing - I didn't like that Igor became Malaria's new leader (it was really too much, they should stop on him being a respected scientist and considering making a puppy for Eva), so in this story he's an ex-mayor, devoted to his science. Guinea Pig Igor tackled his sleeve and took the syringe with transparent liquid. He quickly found the vain and slowly closed the needle to his skin, dipping it into blue line on his arm. First there was only a small pain in the place where he injected himself. He put the syringe on the table, tackled down his sleeve and waited. And waited… And waited… And waited… He expected to feel some kind of reaction of his immunological system on foreign objects inside his blood, but he was feeling perfectly fine. No stomachaches, no fever, no dizziness, nothing. Maybe he was too impatient, after all the first symptoms could appear some time after contagion. After two minutes the waiting started to annoy him, nevertheless he sat at his desk and write down in his journal: The subject was injected with half-ounce of serum at 4 pm. He put the pen beside journal, closed the book and sat comfortably in his armchair, sighing deeply. He hoped that he will be able to find something interesting. He was aware of the fact that his friends would be worried about him or even angry with him if they found out what he had just done to himself. But Igor knew he had to do it. For science, for Malaria's citizens, for the world… There was just no other way. Lots of painful memories from times when Glickerstein was still alive, flashed in his mind. Igor closed his eyes. \"Stay still, you dumb hunchback!\" \"But master…\" \"No buts! We need to finish this!\" Suddenly Igor heard knocking to the door and his eyes snapped open. He rapidly stood up, threw the syringe to the drawer and without further waste of time ran down the \"secret stairs\" to open the door. Scamper, Brain and Eva entered the hall, holding the grocery. Igor watched as they walked in and all together turned to him. Scamper was gloomy as always, Brain put down the bugs he had in hands and drove to the living room, and Eva gave Igor soft smile and leaned upon him to kiss his forehead. He smiled too. Eva directed to the kitchen. Igor took Brain's bugs and fallowed her, but all of sudden he felt a bit dizzy. Nevertheless he decided to move along. \"How was your day, Eva?\" He asked. \"Very nice, thank you.\" She replied, already in the kitchen. They've both put the groceries on the table and Eva added: \"We managed to prepare the prospects, but we still need someone to play Guido's mother. And how about you, darling?\" For a few seconds Igor was hesitating what to say. He couldn't tell her the truth, that was clear, but he didn't want to lie to her. He finally decided to say something that wasn't a lie, but wasn't revealing much, either. \"I was doing some research. I hope I'll succeed.\" And right after he said it the dizziness attacked again. This time so hard that Igor swayed a bit and had to lean on the kitchen table to keep his balance. So it begins… – passed through his mind. Unfortunately there was no clock to check the time, but it wasn't the biggest problem of his. He had to return to his laboratory before something ill-timed will happen. Something which will certainly complicate the whole situation. \"Igor, are you alright?\" \"Yes, yes.\" He waved his right hand and moved towards the opened door. \"I'm only tired a bit, that's all.\" \"Go to bed and have some rest.\" She requested. \"I probably will.\" He said as he was leaving the kitchen. He was going to return to the lab through the more civilized way – by stairs in the hall – but dizziness was more disturbing with every passing second and when Igor put his foot on the first level of the long stairs, he not only had problems with standing straight and see clearly his surroundings, but also was panting like after long jogging. Nevertheless, he took another steps in attempt of climbing up the stairs. He regretted it when his body was too weak that he was standing still only because his hands was clenched on the rail. But they started to weaken too and he couldn't help but let his body fall on the stair levels before him. He was able to register that someone's hands caught him in the midway and that person helped him stand up. The hands were too small and too thin to be Eva's or Brain's, so Igor assumed it was Scamper. \"Let me guess: you've experimented with some suspicious herbs again, am I right, genius?\" The rabbit said, but began to lead him up the stairs. \"I was just working too much that's all. By the way: what time is it?\" \"Time for you to buy the watch.\" \"Please, Scamper, I have to know.\" \"Fine, fine. We've returned at 4:03 and when I saw you climbing the stairs it was 4:07, so now it should be 4:08.\" So the first effects of my serum appeared at 4:05… For a few seconds Igor wondered if he did the right thing experimenting with his own body, but he his train of thought had been cut when he collapsed on Scamper and everything went black… The first thing he noticed, when he came to his senses, was the intense feeling of heat. His blurry vision started to clear up and after few seconds he realized that he was lying in his bed. A moment later Igor remembered the dizziness, the stairs, Scamper and himself asking rabbit about the time. He felt horrible. What if he won't survive this experiment? Or if he will become blind, or crazy or will be degraded into vegetable? But there was no turning back. Now, when he was injected, he had no choice, but observe his own body, eventually trying to find the cure for his own invention. And all this had to be kept in secret from Scamper, Brain, Eva and public relations. Igor slowly, with much effort, sat up in his bed. He had to write down all the observations in his journal, but first he had to check if he will be able to walk at all. Fortunately his lab was in his bedroom, so he didn't have to go to some far room just to take few notes. He moved the cover and carefully put his feet on the floor. Then he slowly, clutching to the bolds of bed, stood up. He still felt dizzy, but it was nothing like a dizziness from earlier, he could stand it. He released the bolds from his grip and kept moving. He took few steps, sat at the desk and opened the journal. He grabbed the pen. For a few seconds he was gathering in one piece all the information he received during these few hours. Finally, he wrote down a note: 4:05 – first signs of dizziness recognizable in subject. The symptoms started to increase. Subject had problems with climbing the stairs, its vision became blurry and it was panting. Around 4:08 the subject lost its consciousness and came back to its senses at… Igor looked at the small clock on his desk and checked the time. It was half past five. He raised his eyebrow and whistled. He was sleeping really long. …at 5:30. He closed the journal and suddenly realized that he didn't know what to do next. He leaned his elbows on the armrests and made a pyramid from his fingers, deepening in the reflection. He could feel the heat inside his body, which was reminding him that he had to check the fever. He stood up from the armchair. Somewhere here should be a thermometer. After all he was using it last time. After few minutes of walking around his room he finally found it lying under his desk. But it needed to be cleaned. Igor came out from his bedroom and directed to the bathroom, however, in the midway to his destination, he had been stopped by Brain, who drove out from the \"directing room\" and quickly approached the hunchback. \"What are you doing?\" He screamed and stopped almost inches from Igor. \"You have a fever, so you have to stay in your bed and rest!\" \"Don't worry, Brain, I will, but first I have to clean this thermometer.\" The inventor showed the tool to Brian and smiled. \"Give me that!\" Brain quickly grabbed the thermometer and turned into bathroom's direction. \"I will clean it. You go to bed!\" \"Fine, fine.\" And Igor – just like that – returned to his room and to his bed. Brain came to him a minute later and violently put the thermometer into Igor's mouth. The temperature was 200 degrees in Fahrenheit's scale. \"Dude, what were you doing when we were out? Walking on Sahara in your thickest coat?\" \"Leave me alone, Brain. I have a headache.\" He hadn't, but he wanted to note another observation in his journal and Brain's presence was really disturbing. But before he could say something else, his stomach groaned loudly and Igor felt strange bitter taste in his mouth. He was hot and this time it wasn't because of fever but because of the feeling of upcoming event. He rapidly stood up, covering his mouth with hand. \"What's that, Igor?\" Brain looked at him with concern. \"You're pale. Is something wrong?\" \"I need to go to bathroom.\" He replied with much effort, trying to hold on. \"I'm going to throw up.\" Brain was shocked for a moment, but then he quickly opened the door. They both ran to the bathroom and the hunchback could easily hear abrupt steps of Scamper. Igor throw himself to the toilet and finally vomited. Half minute later the throwing up stopped. Igor was now leaning upon the toilet, panting. Brain was silent, but Scamper couldn't suppress the urge of mocking remark. \"Oh, Iggy, I hope you didn't eat the leftovers of Evil Lasagna.\" \"No, Scamper. I'm pregnant.\" Was Igor's reply. He sighed deeply, moved away from the toilet and lied flat on the cold floor, still breathing heavily. \"You know, Igor.\" Brain began with wide grin. \"Funny thing, but it reminds me the times when Glickerstein was testing his chemicals on you.\" Igor's eyes snapped open and he quickly looked at them. For a brief moment he was worried that they know something, but then he appeased himself. After all it was Brain we are talking about… \"Yeah.\" Scamper added. \"The guy was cruel in the basic level of relations, but when it came to experiments on humans…\" For a moment Igor was only staring at the ceiling in silence. Another wave of unpleasant memories attacked his mind. A new needle stroke in into the same place of Igor's arm as the previous four. This time Glickerstein had to hold the limb harder, because Igor was shaking. He would struggle more if he wasn't tied into operation table. He was sick of this all. Now he only wanted the experiment to stop, so he could go to his room, fix his wounds and just try to fall asleep despite the pain in his stomach. \"Don't be such a baby, Igor.\" The voice of Glickerstein said. \"After all, if he didn't struggle during previous four tries, I wouldn't have to repeat the experiment…\" Igor didn't know how he managed to survive this all without permanent scars on his psychic. Maybe it was thanks to Scamper and Brain, who were good friends and helped him go through it. Or maybe it was the fact that these experiments were extremely rare, because Glickerstein was more into technology than into biology or chemistry. \"Come on, Igor.\" Scamper's voice brought him back to present. Igor looked at him. The rabbit took his hand. \"You have to come back to bed.\" With his help the hunchback stood up. He let Scamper and Brain lead him to his room, but his own mind was absent for a moment. He felt like he was repeating the scheme, but this time it wasn't Glickerstein who was putting him into this situation. This time Igor was doing it all on his own. He was hurting himself just like Glickerstein. Scamper and Brain put Igor to his bed. The hunchback turned his back on them as they were leaving. However, Scamper saw the journal, lying in the middle of Igor's desk. Something wasn't right. Normally Igor was keeping his journal in the drawer unless he was working on something. But there was no machines or tools on the table so… He looked at Igor who was still turned back to them. The rabbit got suspicious. But he didn't say anything. He and Brain just left the room, however, he hadn't closed the door completely. He left himself few inches of chink. Brain was a bit surprised by his actions, but the curiosity took better of him and he started to observe Igor's room too (Scamper was thankful that his annoying companion stayed silent, because he didn't know how he would explain Igor that they were spying on him). After a moment of waiting Igor turned his face on desk. Next he sat, stood up and approached the table. When he took a seat, he opened the journal and started to write something in it. Few times he stopped the noting to think about something, but then he was going right back to writing. Scamper narrowed his eyebrows. What are you working at, Igor? Igor noted his previous observations. It seemed that for now he was only experiencing the side effects and he was afraid that they might be the only effects of his serum. He was lucky enough that so far no one got the idea to look into journal which was lying on the plain sight all this time. He closed the book and hide it in one of his drawer, then he took some paper and pencil and started to scribble something. Scamper moved away from Igor's door and sat on the floor. The scene he just saw was actually normal. Igor used to work even when he had a flu. It seemed that he felt a bit better and decided to occupy his mind with something, despite the fact that few minutes earlier he vomited. Still, Scamper had some bad feelings about this. Waiting for Igor to fall asleep was annoying and Scamper would probably miss this moment, if Brain hadn't prove himself useful for the first time in… let say quite long. Nevertheless the hunchback had finally fell into sweet slumber at ungodly late hour of 2 am. Scamper opened the door without a crack and entered Igor's room with all stealth he could achieve. The only light was coming from moon hanged in the sky, so for a few seconds the rabbit had problems with recognizing the general outlines of furniture. But his eyes got used to the darkness and he could finally see the desk. Scamper took one last glance on sleeping Igor and then turned back to the drawer where the target of his mission was. He slowly approached the desk. His paw caught the drawer and carefully pulled it to his side. Scamper looked inside and smiled lightly. There it was. He took it and was going to close the drawer, when his eyes caught the outline of syringe. For a moment he hesitated if take it too, but he heard loud snore of Igor. No, he couldn't waste the precious time. He came here only to barrow the journal. Besides – any information about this needle's containing was probably already in the book. He left the room as smoothly as he entered it. Brain was already waiting for him in the hallway. \"Do you have it?\" He asked. \"Duh, and what do you think I'm holding in my hands?\" The rabbit replied. \"Come on, let's see what's in there.\" They sat in the \"directing room\". Scamper opened the journal and they both slowly started to read. The note from this day wasn't very long, actually it was taking barely two pages. However, it contained enough information to make Scamper sweat. The subject was injected with half-ounce of serum at 4 pm. 4:05 – first signs of dizziness recognizable in subject. The symptoms started to increase. Subject had problems with climbing the stairs… The scene at the stairs flashed before Scamper's eyes. He remember how Igor asked him about time and how he had problems with breaching and keeping himself straight. Subject had problems with climbing the stairs, its vision became blurry and it was panting. Around 4:08 the subject lost its consciousness and came back to its senses at 5:30. Few seconds later the nausea occurred and subject vomited. Subject also had a 200F fever. In next few hours before the subject went to sleep, the fever had gone down only to 180F and few times subject felt a small dizziness. The observations will be continued. Scamper closed abruptly the book and deepened into director's chair. He looked like the thing he just learned, hadn't moved him even a bit. However, Brain was completely different story. \"Oh, God! Igor is experimenting on himself!\" \"Thank you, Captain Obvious. I didn't think of that.\" Scamper said with sarcasm. \"I can't believe. After all he went through with Glickerstein… What we are going to do, Scamper? What if he will do something to himself? I'm too young for him to die.\" For a moment the rabbit was only sitting in silence, his whiskers moving from side to side in deep reflection. Suddenly he jumped off from the chair and smoothed his fur like he was trying to rid off of some dirt. Then he turned to Brain and said: \"We have to do what good friends do.\" Igor had been woken up by sun rays coming through his window. He felt well-rested and full of energy. The fever was gone and it seemed that at least for now he didn't have to worry about the rest of symptoms. He sat up and was going to write it down in his journal when he saw Scamper, Eva and Brain, leaning on his desk and looking at him, Scamper with disappointment, Eva with worry, and Brain… well, it was hard to tell… Eva was the first person who spoke: \"Igor, how could you do this to yourself?\" For a moment Igor was watching them with shock, but then he smiled nervously. \"I don't know what are you talking about.\" \"About you making test on yourself, that's what.\" Brain snapped. How did they know? Never mind. He decided to play dumb. \"That's ridiculous.\" The rabbit chocked to catch Igor's attention and drew out the journal. Scamper opened the book and started to read out loud: \" The subject was injected with half-ounce of serum at 4 pm. 4:05 – first signs of dizziness recognizable in subject. The symptoms started to increase. Subject had problems with climbing the stairs… \" He stopped, closed the journal. Igor's gaze changed from sheepish to tense. \"How many times I told you not to touch my journal?\" But Scamper was unmoved. He came closer to Igor, leaned closer to his face and gave him the gloomy look. \"Look what you've become. You're not a human being. You're a subject.\" \"Don't you dare judge me. I really need to test this serum. I know what I am doing.\" \"Oh please. Have you already forgot how it's like to be a guinea pig? Have you forgot about injections served ten times a day, dizziness, vomiting, sleepless nights and almost unbearable pain? Because we didn't.\" \"We were with you every time when you suffered because of these experiments.\" Brain cut himself in. \"They were rare, but when they occurred, we were watching.\" \"I needed to check this serum!\" Igor said firmly. \"Then why you didn't test it on me?\" Scamper exclaimed. \"I'm immortal, in opposite to you. I would survive any test and told you everything.\" \"And if you asked nicely, I would be your subject too.\" Brain added. He didn't sound honesty, so Igor assumed that Brain wasn't entirely sure about his statement. \"I would do it too.\" Eva gave her boyfriend a soft smile. \"You don't understand!\" Igor rapidly stood on the floor. \"I wouldn't dare to make a subjects of any of you. I would never make experiments on my friends. If I was going to test my serum on anybody, it was going to be me and no one else.\" He got quiet and waited for their response. When it hadn't came, he added: \"Besides, look at it in practical way. Brain was out of question right from the start, because he is… well… just a brain in the jar. And you both\" He first looked at Scamper, but then moved to Eva. \"Your bodies aren't normal. If I was trying to inject you, Eva, the needle would broke on your arm. And you Scamper…\" Igor once again turned to the rabbit. \"How would I know that my serum can be poisonous, if you're immortal? I'm normal person and I was reacting on this serum like normal person would. Also that way I could observe everything closer.\" He gave a soft sigh and sat on his bed. Then he looked at his friends with sadness. \"So it was both rational and moral to make myself a guinea pig.\" \"And what if you killed yourself in the process?\" Brain asked. \"Yeah, it would be a shame to die in such stupid way.\" Scamper's face returned to his usual bored expression, but in his voice there was some kind of… resignation? \"Think how it would look like in the newspaper. The great inventor dies from his own formula .\" Igor's eyes looked down. For a long moment he was only observing the floor in silence. Eva sat beside him and embraced him with her thinner arm. Igor felt nice warmness and closeness when she did it. He looked at her and she was watching him with sad smile. \"Who would direct my movies or help me with my roles if you were dead?\" She said, stroking tenderly his cheek. \"I admire your devotion to science, but is this serum so important?\" For a moment he was still silent, thinking about everything. He perfectly understood what his friends wanted to tell him. He liked his life and didn't want it to stop. But he had to do experiments. That's all he was – a scientist. He would die, if he couldn't perform science. Still, where was the limit of scientific curiosity? Where was the border he couldn't pass? Finally he looked at his girlfriend, gently took her hand off from cheek and put it on his knees. Then he looked at her and for the first time this morning a soft grin graced his face. \"Yes it is, Eva.\" He said quietly, but didn't stop smiling. \"But I promise you that I will be careful. If I will see that this experiment is going too far, I will stop it immediately.\" She didn't say anything, but her smile widened. \"And for now, genius\" Scamper started \"you can invest some money in laboratory rats, like normal scientists usually do.\" ","Summary":" My first fic to Igor .

His best friend who had finally done what he had wanted to do himself for years, he had killed himself. It was such a stupid accident, such a stupid accident that would have been hysterical, if it wasn't so serious, if it hadn't led to his death. He had been there, holding his arm, only noticing just how cold it was, when he faded away, the fluid leaking from his jar…Brian's jar.

He had died peacefully, much the way that he had lived, once he had gotten over the dream of being an evil scientist. Scamper had listened to Eva's wailing after he had passed, his heart breaking piece by piece. Eva…he missed her too. She had always been kind and gentle. Too kind and gentle. It was so easy to fool her, so easy to take advantage of her wonderful naivety that made her so innocent. It was always hard to imagine that she had once possessed the capacity for great evil as well. Once the Evil Bone was destroyed, she had lost the ability, instead, living the life of a kind hearted actress. A kind hearted actress who died of a broken heart. They hadn't had children. Made, or…shudder at the thought, born. Eva hadn't been made with the ability to give life. Instead having been made to destroy, even though she had given life to Scamper for a time. A want to live, a NEED to live had been given to him, and now…they were dead They were dead. They were all dead. He wished he could be dead. Oh God, how he wished he could be dead. But there was no chance of that happening. There was no hope for it. He was immortal. How he hated being immortal. How he hated it… He wrapped his arms around himself, a shudder passing through him as he fought back sobs with ruthless efficiency. He had shed too many tears for them. A deep breath wracked his thin frame, his grief having destroyed his ability to eat years ago. A further deep breath, a sigh, and a straightening of limbs, his hands rubbing at his eyes. Finally he turned around, walking back to his lonely existence. His fingers twitching and eyes downcast. There was nothing left for him, he had known on some level that he would lose his friends at some point in time, but that hadn't prepared him. He hadn't known that he would have felt like his heart had been torn to bits as a piece of him broke off and died. He wished he had, he would have tried harder to die. The thought made him pause. Would he really have? Was it better not to have gotten attached to them in the first place? He stopped in the middle of the room he had been visiting every week since they had died, and looked around. Eva's necklace, her posters, her gowns and wigs, each he had so painstakingly created for her with nothing but the deepest affection. Igor's blueprints, pictures, pens, other inventions…he wondered why he had never thought to create a person for him to spend time with, but he didn't hold it against him. He never could. He had known the amount of love he had for Eva, he had known that he was old news. He had known that Igor never wanted to make him feel like that, even though he had… His eyes then trailed over Brain's heap of junk, everything from ribbons to growth serum. A small smile twisted his mouth again as he pictured the crazy robot running down the halls with ribbon… All the way out the window, down the side of a four story house, to smash at the bottom. He immediately began banging his head against the wall; he didn't want to remember that, he never wanted to remember that… He didn't want to remember them like that. He didn't want to remember him… a groan and a frantic rushing around as he tried desperately to get rid of the memories. Tears clogging his throat, his eyes, his mind… He never saw it coming; first he was running around in panic, the next he had run into a table, sent it toppling over, and like trail of dominoes sent the rest crashing to the ground in a heap. A sob finally broke free. He fell to his knees, tears spilling down his whiskers, down his face, down onto a small plant… His eyes widened, red staring at the plant in wide eyed awe, rubbing the tears out of his eyes, he reached out, his hand seizing the plant with shaky amazement. A quick glance over it revealed it to have not changed a bit since he had last seen it. Eva's Prehistoric Evergreen…his gift…his memory…his friends. He clutched it to him, hugging onto the plant as though it was the only thing keeping him sane, keeping him whole. He had forgotten all about it. He had forgotten the feeling of joy that had bubbled up from his stomach as Eva handed it to him, telling him that it was a way to always remember them, to keep him company. He felt the joy now, the feeling of having something with him that would always be as he was, would always be young, would always be whole, and would never die. He knew the plant would never replace his friends, would never replace their love, their fondness for him, but he knew he would always have it. He'd just have to give some of their love to it.. He could do that. He could certainly do that. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: Own nothing aside from a rather strange obsession with all things weird. Whoo, weird.

Summary : Scamper feeling lonely because everyone is either dead or dying from age and he's still alive and well. A/N- I've developed the weird habit of seeing things when I watch children's shows, I'm referring to the fact that I could see Scamper and Brain as a pairing, don't ask how 'cause I'm not sure on that one, though someone else could probably have fun with the concept... Anyway, if you want to see them that way it's very possible in this little fic, though if you don't see things that way you don't have to view it that way -hurray most people are happy- ~Start~ Scamper sighed as the last attempt on his life regenerated as if nothing at all had transpired, as if he had not just tried to pierce his body with one hundred needles of poison at the same time. Which was very hard to do by the way. Why did Igor have to make him immortal? Why dammit! It wasn't fair. He used to think life might be worth living, but after living so long he began the vicious cycle of attempted suicide yet again. Igor himself was long dead from old age and he was the same old Scamper, exactly the same as when he had been experimented on. Even Brain was getting dumber with age, if that was even possible. Brain had been the longest to stay, possibly because if you're being technical he's not really alive. He did realize that Brain meant well though, he almost always did. After a thought Scamper wondered if Brain would be sad if he actually managed to find a way to end his eternal life. In a sick way he hoped Brain would be shaken beyond belief, that he would be crushed. No one else would miss him since he was such an anti-social rabbit, that thought was what kept creeping into his thoughts again and again. It tore him up a little bit, knowing that no one knew who he was. Just a sarcastic immortal talking rabbit. Oh but then again there was Eva. ... Eva had been crushed when Igor had gone though so perhaps Scamper would be an echo in her thunderstorm of sadness. She was a ghost of a monster now, practically melting away herself. Scamper thought about how if she was going to melt she should get a bucket, so she didn't spill everywhere. That made him laugh in a humorless way. Her body was indestructible, but if she wanted to there were still ways she could die if she so chose. A gun went off and Scampers brains were replaced by a rather large hole. After a few moments he sighed again, not that he hadn't tried that method before, it was just that it never ever worked. It was frustrating to say the least. When he was a full rabbit again he turned to pick up a map to see when the next train was coming through, hadn't tried that one in a while. He saw Brain standing half hidden behind a huge door, the jar of brains was staring at him strangely. After glancing around himself he saw indeed there was reason to stare, but you'd think Brain would be used to it by now. The room did look mildly freaky though, weaponry scattered around, vicious looking devices here and there, poisons in another corner and a whole collection of poisonous insects. Add to it all that the room was only grey and blacks, the only real colour being Scamper. He looked again to the door to see Brain coming towards him, he looked peculiar and Scamper was tempted to say something sarcastic about it but held himself back. Instead he rested his chin on a small hand, plastered an uninterested look on his face and waited for Brian to get whatever he was going to say over with. Needless to say he was surprised when Brain pulled him into a one armed metal hug and whispered into his drooping ears. It was short, sweet and surprisingly smart (for Brain) and it made Scamper feel just a little bit guilty for his previous thoughts. Maybe he didn't want Brains whole world to be shaken, but he would appreciate if he was at least a little bit sad. Or maybe he would live (indefinitely) at least until Brain kicked the bucket. After awkwardly patting the rolling jar Scamper sighed, giving in to the unrelenting hug and returning the feelings there. It would have to wait until his one true friend passed before he'd desperately want to die again, especially if the current attempts caused that much pain. Scamper gently took a soft paw and wiped Brains tears from his eyes. Yes, it'd have to wait. ~Fin~ Reviews are nice... Just sayin'.

Anticipation twists in my stomach as I take my seat my chair squeaks as I ease my withered body down my eyes darting around the room as I scan each face that passes through the door. I wince as my frustrated groan raises a few curious glances from the students around me I bit back a smile when some just roll their eyes whispering bitterly to their neighbors about me oblivious to the fact that I still have excellent hearing even at my age. I sigh softly as I wait in the darkness my only comfort was the familiar warmth in my fingers as I take the watch from my pocket knowing full well that my surroundings prevented me from checking the time. \"Almost my love.\" I whisper dropping my voice as the seats ahead of me of become filled. I let my eyes drift again looking at nothing as my fingers traced invisible patterns on the golden surface as I reflexively tightening my grip on my only solid reminder that the man of my dreams was, in fact, real as more seats became filled…it was then as I sat there eyes closed surrounded by the chatter of the young people around me my hand skimming over the remains of my heart as it ticked softly in my lap that I felt his presence in my life once again. He looks exactly as I remember if not better than the man from my memories if such a thing could even be possible. I had to concentrate on my breathing, my heart pounds against my ribs as his sea blue gaze sweeps over me his face splitting into one of his breathtaking smiles as he moves closer to me just as he had by the lake the afternoon he had first walked into my life. 'God he knows.' The thought is just a whisper in my mind as he continues forward that heart melting smile still on his lips. \"Oh, I'm so sorry Miss.\" His hands brush my neck as he catches himself on my chair having no doubt tripped over the empty one beside me in his hast. \"Are you alright?\" he asked worried at my sharp intake of breath squinting into the blackness to see my face the hand that was not still firmly gripping the back of my chair reaching toward me when I hadn't answered him. 'Always the gentleman.' I smile at him through the darkness nodding my replay as my voice was lost by his touch on my neck. \"Well enjoy the play.\" He said finally releasing my chair as he straitens himself before moving on. I drop my gaze from his retreating back. 'He can't know because we have not met yet.' I give a weak sight as I continue tracing the cover of his watch trying to ignore the ache in my chest as my mind pulls me away…away to nothing but the feel of his touch on my skin. The lights flash above me pulling my attention back to the cramped theater around me. I blink away the wetness in my eyes as he takes his seat only two rows ahead of my own the lights from the stage outlining him perfectly as he turns to speak to the woman at his side. Jealously races through me when she leans into him, lingering too long for my liking but my fury in quickly erased as the kiss brings another of his heart stopping smiles before the curtains finally part signaling the beginning of his play. After the performance ends I remain in my seat my eyes never leaving him as he rises from his chair. 'It was as if he had written each scene just for me.' The actress within me sutures as I continue to watch the playwright who ruled my heart as I waited for my chance to speak to him. He must have felt my gaze upon him as he moved around the room accepting congratulations from the remaining people separating us. I couldn't help by laugh softly as his fleeting glances in my direction became more frequent the terror growing more pronounced with each one. I took a deep breath to clear my head getting to my feet as the group around him closes as the cake was brought out finally pulling his attention away from me. ' Time for one last performance of the great Elise McKenna.' The words seem to echo in my mind as I take a shaking step toward him. The crowd parts as I approach my heart beating louder and faster in my ears as I move mesmerized by his very presents as if our previous encounter before the play had not even occurred. \"Let's not cut the masks lets save those for last.\" He was saying as my hand reaches toward him rested briefly on his back \"Uhm?\" he asks as he turns into me. There is nothing but shock in his eyes as he registers my closeness I take one quick breath to mask my pain as I take his right hand in both of my own pressing my heart into the warm frozen finger of the only man it would forever belong to curling them around it while he continues to gaze unseeing back at me with those sea blue eyes I have dreamed of for so many years. I pause for a heartbeat savoring the feeling of his hand in mine as I such for the words that would make him understand \"Come Back to me.\" My plea comes in a hushed broken whisper as I struggle against the tears as I pour all that is left of me; my years of pain, my fear, and all of my love into those four simple words. I meet his fearful gaze with a searching one of my own as if I could simply will him into realizing who I am and how much I love him. He blinks as I relies him forcing myself to move away ignoring the whispers as I made my exit. I pause as his shaking voice reaches me my hand on the door \"I have no idea.\" He was saying answering a question I had not heard in my hast to leave \"I have never saw her in my life.\" I find my way to my waiting car in a haze of pain as I hear the truth of his words with each step I take. I do not answer Arthur's worried stare as I slide into the protection of the limousine letting a single tear fall onto the pavement before he closes the door behind me. I make my way to my room in a daze thankful that I had cried myself out on the way so I would not alarm anyone. My only thoughts center on the man I had just left…. Richard Collier. I lean against the door for support as my memories overwhelm every one of my senses. 'My Richard.' I can't help but smile as Laura enters from the side door ahead of me as I cross the room. \"How was the play?\" she asked excitedly as I pass her \"Did you enjoy it?\" she asked when I didn't answer. I wanted to spin around in shock at her vague question 'Why would I do anything but enjoy it?' I wanted to say my voice becoming louder than my normal hushed tone she was used to hearing from me. 'I would always love anything my Richard writes because he is the most astounding writer I have ever known.' But I do not turn, I do not even acknowledge she has spoken to me as I reach the white folding door that leads to my sitting room closing it swiftly behind me. \"Are you alright?\" Laura's frightened voice sounds from the next room but I still remain silent as I turn the lights on my eyes focusing on nothing as I open the lid of our music box letting the melody of my loves favorite song wash over me as I turn toward the window. I take a fleeting glance out onto the lake that surrounds both the island and the hotel. I can feel the moisture in my eyes again as I watch the small boat glide slowly across the water as I sink into my rocking chair the program from the play, his play still held in my hand. My fingers glide over his name as is I press page tightly in my chest imaging it was him, my Richard back in my arms again. My Richard the man who was everything to me just as I was to him my eyes drifted closed as I remembered the feel of his arms around me, remembering how he held me so close to him during our first and only night together as the last few bars of our melody filled the air around me. I stopped rocking letting the memory of his smiling face me take me on, on to the place I knew I would become the Elise McKenna he loved once again. \"Come back to me my darling Richard.\" I pleaded softly letting the white light around me envelop me whole \"I'll be waiting for you.\" The end ","Summary":" A Heart of Gold for Somewhere in Time…Somewhere in The Present She Will Find Him.

The tips of his fingers brushed the collarbone of the woman in the photograph, lingering there too long to have been an accident. He paused. This was beginning to get out of hand he was thinking that it might be turning into an obsession. And he couldn't afford to obsess, what with his career, his recent break-up and his whirl-wind life that hurled him forward, always forward, never ceasing... So how could he manage to just sit and stare at the portriat of a woman for hours? A woman he'd never seen before. Or had he? It was all too foggy, like a romance novel to which he recognized the silly plot but could not recall the ending. I hate to talk like this I hate to act as if There's something wrong that I can't say In any normal point in his life, Richard would have made up his mind to leave the red room by now. But her eyes held him there. Coca-dusted, burned-toffee eyes. They seared his soul, the secretive irises, the full, dark lashes... He was entranced by the chocolate in her eyes... And her lips. The radiance of her smile. What could she possibly be seeing that could make a goddess smile that way? And it wasn't just the obvious things, oh no. It was the curve of her delicate cheek, the smooth way her eyebrow arched, her determined yet feminine shoulders... Naturally, Richard was a poet, or else thoughts like this would not come to his mind so fluently. But they did as he sat, day after day, staring into the steady gaze of Elise McKenna, actress from the early nineteen hundreds. But she was more than this. She was the light that filled his days as he sat constantly thinking of her, the aparation that haunted his dreams so that it was impossible to sleep at night. I have this dream at night Almost every night I've been dreaming it forever It's easy to remember it It's always cold It's always day You're always here You always say I'm alright I'll be ok If I can keep myself awake He couldn't go on living any longer while she wasn't by his side. Tenderly, he ran his long fingers over the curve of her cheek once again. The still face in the frame did not flinch. He began to drift away to pleasant fantasies of Elise, Miss McKenna... Of how they might walk down a beach, hand in hand... Or how she might be standing under hot stage lamps, her hair swept from her face, her eyes aflame. He saw her full lips quoting words he had written, presumably a part he had created only for her. He burned for Elise... All the knowledge he had gained and all the time he'd spent staring at the infamous photograph was not enough. He needed to gaze into her eyes and feel her. It was then he decided. He would go. Back. To 1912. To her. To Elise... To the woman he loved. No doubt existed in his mind about it. He did love her. Because this went further than obsession and further than time. He would find her. He had to find her. There was nothing else that mattered anymore. I get up early I look around me Can't help but wonder what you mean Cause when I'm sleeping I'm So deep in it So much more real to me Closer than reality It had been almost seven days since he had returned and still the sight of her face brought tears to his eyes. But how could he do anything else but go to the red room with all of the things long since used and discarded and lie his broken body before the portrait again? He watched her for hours and sometimes he thought he'd go insane. When he was alone, he found himself watching to see a tremble of movement on her face. To see her eyes blaze again, to see her smile widen. Anything, anything to break the spell. But all he saw was a set expression. Short-lived joy, a doomed ecstacy brought about by forbidden love. Ah, he had almost forgotten. She had loved him. And now... she was gone. It's always cold It's always day You're always here You always say I'm alright I'll be ok If I can keep myself awake He'd forgotten the taste of food and the sensation of sleeping and waking up. But he could still remember the soft feeling of her skin and the ringing of her laughter. Wasn't it funny? It proved to have been longer since he had heard her laughter or felt her skin than when he had sensed these other things. But he might have never eaten, never slept. He was nothing but a hollow shell now. All he embodied were memories. If you held him up to the light, you would be able to see clear through him, like a window. That was how empty he felt without her. Keep myself awake Keep myself awake Keep myself awake \"Of course you're going to marry me..?\" She had said with utmost certainty but also a hint of question. He had laughed, partially because of nerves and maybe because he had never given the matter much thought. But when he gazed at her, caught her eyes, the question didn't matter. He knew the answer. \"Sure.\" He had heard himself reply but the words on his tongue were more like Always. Darling, I would die if you asked me to... Of course, no man readily reveals the deepest secrets of his heart, even a man like Richard. He kept the true answer to himself. Now, the truth seemed bitter, as if he should have said the words when he'd had the chance. But there was no need for remorse or regret. It wouldn't save him, wouldn't do him any good. His soul had been burried back in 1912 and that's where it would remain. All he could do was watch himself slip away and stare into the unseeing eyes of the portrait, the one taken when she had been staring at him... I get up early I look around me Can't help but wonder what you mean Cause when I'm sleeping I'm So deep in it So much more real to me Closer than reality It was all too much. Suddenly, he swallowed, tears welling in his eyes not for the first time that night. He stood and walked to her. He placed his fingers on her hair, her cheek and let them graze her collarbone, lingering there too long to be an accident. He felt breathless. He heard his heart beating, though he scarcely felt it at all. His own voice echoed in the memory-filled chasms of his mind and he closed his eyes, listening... Darling, I would die if you asked me to... And then he heard something unexpected. Her voice. Grayed, tinted with age, barely about a whisper... Come back to me... Slowly, a wave of understanding washed over Richard, leaving him calm. His eyes met those of the unseeing ones in the portrait and he felt as if he saw a flicker of recognition in hers... He knew what must be done. With all his strength, as his health had seemed to be waning lately, he lifted his feet and began to walk, slowly, steadily away from her. He threw a last glance over his shoulder at the woman in the frame. Hold on. I'm coming. Richard entered his empty hotel room. He felt a sigh escape his lips as he sat down in the chair by the window. After a moment passed, he reached into his coat pocket and produced the watch, ticking softly, showing the hour in the glow of the early morning. Right on time... A few hours later, Arthur and the hotel's doctor came to Richard's aid, frantically trying to revive him. But nothing could be done. He had returned to her.

Intumbled through a vortex, time and eternity passed in brilliantnflashes of light, like sparklers in the hands of a child. Decadesnpassed before me, people, places and things, from the pages ofnhistory books, darted past me on their trek backward in time. Thencenturies passed like flipping the pages of a book, times of war, thensounds of battle, the cries of death, fear and famine. Spiritnseparated from body, and then returned, with the sudden realizationnof a higher being. One of majesty, love, and awesome power. The likenof which I could never have imagined. Mynheart felt faint in this uncertain reality. Darkness engulfed me, Infelt the grip of a hand in mine and I held fast, as it was the onlynreality I knew. Life moved around me yet in silence and in darkness. ThennI felt the reality of a cold floor against my back. I lay therenshivering. Uncertain of what was happening. It was then, I realized,nmy eyes were closed. In opening them, my first sight was a womannstanding over me. Arenyou able to stand? Inthink so. I answered without hesitation. And stood to my feet. Stillnholding my hand.She led me out of the room glancingnback at me. Then turned and led me down the hall toward massive doorsnthat opened to the outside world as we approached. Inwatched as a golden carriage stopped in front of us and a footmanndressed in white stepped forward to take her hand. There was anothernoccupant, a young woman, who sat quietly across from us holding anwhite rose to her cheek. Asnthe carriage pulled away from the portal, I realized, we were boundnfor a place not of this earth. Or at least... not the Earth I knew. Itnwas then she spoke to our traveling companion. Suchna beautiful pink rose Alana, and so early in the spring, wherever didnyou find it? Spring?n I thought... It's the middle of August. Itnwas a gift from...She stopped as if she couldn't remember where shengot it Indon't ... It'sna symbol of love.

She said. You will return tonhim. You must find him again, then and only then will your love beneternal. Yet...nhow will I find him? You must search with your heart not your eyes.

Henwill remember the love. And he will return the rose. Alana'snhand instantly moved to her breast. Removing the handkerchief fromnher bodice she found but one peddle. She held the handkerchief closento breathe in, the fragrance that lingered. Whennthe carriage stopped we stepped out onto the threshold of a largenbuilding. Inside... a great arched hall ran the length and acrossnfrom where we stood, another arch led to a massive spiralingnstaircase. The halls were graced by large paintings, and pricelessnpieces of sculptor, both porcelain and marble. Wengo this way, the woman pointed to the stairs. As we up the stairs, Inrealized it was a gallery, and oddly familiar. At the top of thenstairs...She lead us across the hall and through the door of firstnroom to the right and into another adjoining room, at the rear. Therenwere people admiring the works of art. Alana stopped and turnednaround. Whatnis this place? She asked. Whatnare we doing here? I asked. I wasnto show you this. The woman pointed behind us. As we turned, I foundnsomething quite unexpected. We were back in the Museum, the NationalnArt Gallery, in Washington. It was the same portrait, I instinctivelynturned to look for the girl on the couch. There was not even a couch. I don't understand,nhow? why? I questioned. Watchnquietly, and just listen. Thenna small girl came and stood next to us. Who arenyou she asked? Do not answer her.nThe woman told us. Cannthey see me? Alana asked Onlynthe child can see you, Are younAngels? The little girl asked. DonNot answer her. Let'sngo sweetie, the child's mother took her by the hand and left thenroom.

Justnlisten carefully When the first womennentered the room, Shenwas looking straight across at the fabulous portraits and when shenturned, what she saw took her breath away. To her astonishment shenfound her own image looking back at her from a portrait on thenopposite wall, dressed in 16th century attire. Shenlooked as faint as I felt. How could this be possible? It was likenlooking into a mirror and seeing even the crinkles in her lips. Thendimple in her chin, the huge sparkling blue eyes, the curl... \"Ohndear heavens\", the young woman was startled.

Came the response. \"Mom\"?nHer voice grew weak, Inmoved in behind her but she passed through me as if I weren'tnthere. My mind was spinning . Thenshade of pale on her face, testified to the lack blood. A fathomlessncavern threatened to swallow her. \"I'mncoming Ashley.\" Her mother said again. Asnher mother entered the room she saw a very pale face and eyes thatnthreatened to close in a dead faint. \"Ashley!nWhat's wrong\"? Shenflew to her daughter's side and gathered her into her arms. But shencould only point at the wall. Hernmother turned not knowing what to expect. \"Ohnmy! Oh heavens! It looks just like... Oh my Lord! Chris, look atnthis\"! She called to her friend. Whonis she? I demanded. Shhh,ncareful! Therenbefore them, larger than life was a portrait, which bore the exactnimage of Ashley. They were amazed at the portrait. Both the mothernand daughter were over come with emotion. The mother took herndaughter to the couch and sat down. Who isnshe? Readingnthe brass plate below the painting, Jessica replied. It saysnMadame De CauMartine... As Hebe. It was painted in 1573. At.... Versailles.nWhispered Alana. Shhh Cannthey hear me? Therenare some, who can, but most are small children so we must be quiet. Indon't understand what's happening. Younhave been so patient. Henwanted you to understand what was about to happen. Once you leavenhere, you will not remember this moment. Thenlikeness to Ashley was startling. Right down to the small lock ofnhair that had rebelliously refused to comply with any sort ofnhairstyle, her entire life. Hernmother had always referred to it as her baby curl, being that it wasnher only lock of hair with natural curl from the time she was small. Thentwo gapped at the portrait and then began to compare, every littlenaspect of the faces. Her hairnwas the same fine gold. Her smile, that was somewhat mischievous andnbeguiling at the same time. Her mother kept looking from thenportrait to her daughter. \"Ok Inrecognize that expression, what was she thinking\". It was a secret. Shhh... \"Shenwas keeping a secret\". Ashley told her mother. The blue eyes thatnstarred back, from the mirror image were like the depths of an ibis.nIt was chilling to say the least. Other people entering the roomnrealized the likeness as well. They began asking if she was andescendant of the woman in the portrait Hernmother reached and took her by the arm. \"Let'sngo see if we can find out more about her\". They left the room Alananstood there not knowing what to think. In the past few moments, theynhad seen places and things that she never knew existed. theynhad seen the world she once knew go through so many changes. Warsnwere fought over boundaries, religion, slavery, and freedom. Kingsnno longer ruled the land. Thenworld turned finally to peace once more. Yetnthe Middle East was still in complete chaos. Carriagesnnow moved at great speed without horses to pull them. Greatnflying machines filled the heavens Hugenships, sailed the seven seas, both above and below. Wondersnupon wonders, she could hardly keep up. Therenwas so very much to learn. Comenwe must leave this place now. Wherenare we going? You'll see. I'mnnot going anywhere until I get some answers. What the hell is allnthis? Alananstood silent. Thenwoman approached his side. You do not understand, You and she werentogether in another life. You shared a love unspoken, a lovenrepressed. When she died, a prayer was spoken, asking for anothernchance to share that love. He has granted that request. You are thenone who spoke that prayer. LooknI don't know where you get your information from but... Gonto her, touch her hand. Why?nJust touch her hand. Inmoved to where she stood and reached for her hand. It was like thenwalls. Nothing, as if she were not there. I dropped my hands to mynside and asked. Can you please explain all this to me? \" OhnYe Of Little Faith\" She smiled. Donyou not remember coming here? YesnI remember. But what does it all mean? Henbrought you here. She does not know you are here. She cannot see younor hear your voice. Thenyoung girl you were watching in the gallery, is Alana. Younsaw her and the portrait. Look around you, what else do you see? Everythingnis the same as before. Yes,nbut look carefully. Inturned unsure of what I was supposed to be looking for. Then I sawnit, there in the shadows of the doorway...\" my brief case\". Younwere brought here, so that she would not see you. When you leave herenyou will may or may not remember any of this, I don't know how youncame to be in the gallery. But I suspect you have a memory that hasnled you to this place and time in search of her. ButnHow? Younforget, you have been thru 300 years of waiting for this chance. Shenhas already stolen your heart. You have been searching for her. And Inthink you were about to find her. That is why you were brought here. Willnshe still be there? Yes.nBut you must return to... Tonthe Gallery. Yes. Butnhow do I get back. Inwill show you the way. Come. Shentook my hand and we walked toward the portal where my briefcase stoodnin the shadows. I turned to say goodbye and she was gone. ","Summary":" ThenOther room...

Vuelve a mí Cuánta belleza plasmada en una fotografía, tanta que no le era posible apartar la mirada. Richard se negaba a dejar de verla, ya ni siquiera recordaba cuánto llevaba allí parado, de pie, petrificado como una estatua viviente mirando embelesado la faz de esa mujer. Era inverosímil no contemplarla, cómo no hacerlo, ella era increíblemente hermosa. – ¿Quién eres tú? –le susurró, siendo aquella sus primeras palabras en un largo tiempo. No importaba si ella era sólo un retrato, Richard deseaba acariciar su rostro, delinear con las puntas de sus dedos esa cara que, contra toda lógica, se robó su cordura por completo. Observó la piel pálida de su cuello y mejillas, pese a ser una estampa de hacía décadas, la tonalidad nívea de su tez se plasmó perfectamente en la imagen. – ¿Quién eres, quién eres tú que me embrujas tanto? –Richard volvió a cuestionarse, ahora, mucho más cerca de la fotografía. Se suponía que su viaje era para buscar inspiración y terminar así su obra inconclusa, pero aquello valía poco, nada. Qué hubiera sucedido si no hubiese entrado en ese pequeño museo dentro del hotel, ni él mismo lo sabía y tampoco le interesaba averiguarlo. Únicamente podía pensar en ella, en esa mujer cuyo nombre desconocía, y en su sonrisa. Esa sonrisa suave, curvilínea, bella, sublime. Seducido, pronto su atención se volcó a sus ojos. Ella lo miraba, lo miraba a él. Sonaba ridículo quizás, pero Richard lo sabía, ella lo veía a él. A pesar de estar separados por más de sesenta años, por un breve instante, uno realmente corto, los dos se conectaron. Ella en el pasado. Él en el presente. Permaneció allí por varias horas más, plantado como un árbol, inmóvil frente a ese retrato, se sentía ansioso por conocer su más que simplemente su identidad, saber su nombre no le bastaba, necesitaba más, necesitaba saberlo todo de ella: ¿quién fue, a qué se dedicó, por qué su foto está en el museo del hotel, aún vive y sí es así, dónde podría encontrarla? – ¡Eres un estúpido, Richard! –Se dijo, liberándose parcialmente de su encanto–esta foto es de antes de que nacieras, probablemente ella ya esté muerta. ¡No! ¡Ella no puede estar muerta! ¡No, no puede ser verdad! ¡Ella está viva! ¡Vive en mí! ¡Ella está viva dentro de mí! Volvió a posar su vista en ella, y contagiándose por esa sensación inexplicable que ella le transmitía, le sonrió, prometiéndole, sin saber cómo todavía, que se conocerían y que serían inseparables. Richard debió reunir toda su fuerza de voluntad para darse la vuelta para no verla más, y al hacerlo sintió una punzada en su interior. Ella se anidó en él tan profundamente, que el simple hecho de no mirarla lo apuñalaba en su corazón. Mientras caminaba fuera de la habitación, resistiéndose a la tentación de regresar, se mofó de él mismo. Como cualquier otro hombre joven disfrutó de varios romances en su vida, pero ninguno podría presumir haber sido amor, fueron solamente aventuras efímeras olvidables y hasta en cierto punto, patéticas. Pero ahora, por primera vez en su vida, estaba realmente enamorado. Estaba enamorado de una mujer fotografiada antes de que él tan siquiera naciera. Sin embargo, para Richard Collier ese detalle no valía nada. Él la amaba, apresurada o burda, eso tampoco le preocupaba, esa ansiedad por estar con ella no era fingida ni artificial. Él la alcanzaría, buscaría la manera de encontrarse con ella, él lo presentía, él la hallaría y la amaría como ningún otro hombre jamás sería capaz de hacerlo. Y así será. Firme, mirándose frente al espejo de su recámara, se estudió de arriba a abajo. Su ropa, hasta su peinado, eran los de antaño, y creyéndose preparado se acomodó en su cama repitiéndose una y otra vez aquella frase que se convirtió en su mantra: hoy es 27 de junio de 1912, hoy es 27 de junio de 1912, hoy es 27 de junio de 1912… Y esas palabras resonaron en su cabeza miles de veces, reiterándoselas infinitamente obligando a su sensatez a creerlas. Él renunció a su época en su totalidad, se despidió de 1980, suplicando ser parte del ayer, del pretérito, de una era a la cual no pertenecía pero que ella sí. La mujer que alteró su existencia llevándolo al borde de la desesperación por el anhelo de conocerla. Elise Mckenna. Para Richard sólo existía ella. Todo lo demás ya no importaba. Ella cambió su vida. Al despertar se dio cuenta, lo había logrado, consiguió retroceder las manecillas del reloj. Él y Elise se encontrarían, él y Elise se tomarían de la mano, él y Elise se amarían, él y Elise estarían juntos… En algún lugar del tiempo. Fin Las películas románticas nunca han sido de mis favoritas, ya que algunas, en mi opinión, son muy cursis, pero no las rechazo ni las odio. Vi Somewhere in Time por casualidad, me topé con ella navegando en internet hace unas semanas. Anteriormente ya la había oído mencionar, pero les debo confesar que no le presté la atención que merecía, y por las vueltas de la vida, acabé frente a mi computador viéndola. Como dije, las películas románticas no son de mis preferidas, pero Somewhere in Time tiene algo que ni yo mismo puedo explicarme, quizás sea la trama de la historia, la música de fondo, las actuaciones de los protagonistas, el final de la película, o todo junto, en fin, pero lo que les puedo decir es que Somewhere in Time me terminó gustando, y mucho, no por nada es una película considerada de culto por muchísimas personas y con su propio club de fans. Después de ver la película busqué el libro en el cual se basa y también me gustó, incluso más que la película, y al revisar descubrí que casi no hay fanfics de Somewhere in Time y me dije que debería escribir uno. Esta es mi primera historia que no tiene nada que ver con Dragon Ball , y fue un paso que disfruté dando, el fic es corto, no di demasiados detalles de la trama de la película o del libro por si alguien que la quiere ver por primera vez, la vea sin adelantos o spoilers. Si deseas ver la película, entra en mi perfil donde he colocado el enlace donde podrás verla completa. Muchas gracias por haber leído.

I have been here so many timesnI've memorized the textures and styles of each Artists work, But today, Inwas only one of the few that now crowded the halls of the Museum.nOn this particular day I was standing in an inset doorway, deep in thenshadows, trying to meld into the surroundings. I had no idea, that in thennext moments the world I knew would be gone.nA young woman strolled in, removed a heavy backpack from one shoulder andnsat down on the couch. Jeans and a baggy shirt hid the features of a lovelynyoung woman. Her hair was pulled tightly back in a ball with one of thosenghastly things women lovingly call a scrunchy.nShe sat down, opened her pack and removed a lap-top Computer. I foundnmyself wondering who she was. It was rather strange. She sat there lookingnat the painting and smiling. Then she spoke.n \"You know don't you?\" I ducked backward deeper into the shadows.

Thengirl said. \"I wish I could just close the door and lock everyone out untilnthe time is here.\" It was at that moment, I realized she was talking to thenpainting. I glanced up only to be caught in a whirl-wind of vertigo. Instood captive between reality and an imagination gone wild. The room spunnaround me as my eyes locked onto the painting.

Well at least in this live it is. Around 900 years ago my name was Sofiel and I was cursed with eternity but not in the same way Kaulder was. I was cursed to be reborn. Every life time I have been born and died all before my 30th birthday. Around the age of 15 I have a near death experience and I gain my memory of every single lifetime before. I was not the only one who was cursed. The love of my life Karter was as well. Because of what I had done he was punished as well. While I had been cursed to remember, Karter would not until he had fallen in love with me. We died after we were cursed and reborn into new families. I didn't remember who I was until at 15 when I had fallen off of log and into the rapid river below. I was whisked away and nearly drowned but I was able to pull myself out. I laid on the creek as it all came rushing back to me. All the memories from my past life. I ran away that night in search of Karter. The man I had fallen for. I searched the country for three years and found him. His name was Kaulder and he was married with a daughter. No matter my love for him I could not break up a family. So I followed Kaulder to the witch queens plague tree. I watched Kaulder come out of that tree a charred mess. He had been cursed. That was the last time I saw him. Now 800 years later I'm in New York City just living my life. Yeah, I remember Kaulder. But centuries ago I gave up looking for him. Now I live my life knowing I'm counting down the days until I die. Then it's 15 more years until the torture of remembering returns. I'm two weeks away from my 30th birthday. I know it will happen. This cycle will continue until Kaulder falls in love with me. But it's impossible. No one can fall in love with a stranger in two weeks. Something was different about this time I came back. This time I was born a witch. It was strange. There was so much power. I knew this wouldn't change anything. I still wouldn't find Kaulder. I spent my nights at the witch bar that my friend Chloe owned. I helped her out with potions. I had been around long enough to know most of the potions by heart. It wasn't too hard. Chloe knew of my curse. She's the only person I have ever trusted enough to tell. But I didn't tell her the man I fell in love with was the witch hunter. \"Soph what are you doing here? You should be out living. Traveling the world?\" Chloe asked as I stood behind the bar. \"Why? I've got eternity to live and live again. And continue to live. Right now I just want to forget that my 30th birthday is coming.\" \"Fine but tomorrow we party.\" Chloe said pointing to me. \"Fine.\" I smiled at her. Then all the witches began running. Chloe and I looked around and then we saw Kaulder walk through the room. \"Miranda, where are you going?\" Chloe asked our friend that worked with us. \"I've heard that you don't even have to do anything. He knows when you're going to do something bad then he slices off your head.\" Miranda said. \"That's a story grandmothers tell us to keep us out of trouble.\" \"Chloe, go with Miranda. I'll take care of him.\" I said and she nodded running with Miranda. I stood there almost breathless. He looked just like Karter. I felt my heart race as he walked over to the bar I stood behind. \"We're up to code, and I make sure no humans get in here.\" I said standing across from him. \"It's a beautiful place.\" Kaulder said with a smile. \"Thanks, but I just work here.\" I said flatly. \"What do you charge?\" \"Depends on what you're having.\" \"A memory.\" \"That's $500.\" \"Done.\" Kaulder said turning around and walking around the room. \"I'm sorry I meant $5,000.\" \"Is that what you meant?\" He asked turning back to me. \"Yes, $5.000.\" \"Sold.\" He made his way back over to me. \"You must really want this memory.\" \"Shall we start?\" Kaulder asked. \"No, I changed my mind.\" I said reaching for the potion I had made for myself earlier. Kaulder picked it up before I could and sniffed it. \"Fear potion? What could you possibly be afraid of?\" He asked seriously. \"Dying.\" I said honestly. \"Do you know what I'm afraid of?\" Kaulder asked leaning forward on the bar. \"Nope.\" I said grabbing the potion and finishing it. \"Nothing. It's actually really boring.\" \"I know you have a code, and I haven't done anything wrong. Since you've already messed everything up why don't you get out?\" \"I do have a code, but I'm also not leaving.\" Kaulder said taking off his jacket. \"What do you need a memory potion for anyhow? You hunting a witch?\" \"I'm helping a friend.\" \"Fine, take a seat.\" I said and Kaulder walked over to the more comfortable chairs while I made the potion. I set the tray up and walked over to Kaulder. \"A word of warning. If you get hurt in your memory you get hurt out here. If you die in your memory you die out here.\" I said injecting the potion into the cherry. \"I can't die.\" \"It's a disclaimer for the insurance.\" I handed it to him with a smug smile. \"Bottoms up.\" He said and put it in his mouth. Kaulder leaned back with his eyes closed and I stood up. I made sure he was out before I started talking. \"Alright, God. This isn't funny. You lead him here two weeks before my 30th. Is this to torture me? To punish me for loving one more than all. Now I'll have to spend another lifetime looking for him.\" \"I've never heard a witch talk to Him.\" Kaulder said making me jump. \"That conversation was supposed to be private.\" Kaulder nodded and this time actually ate the cherry. I began cleaning my things and I heard someone walking around the bar. I hid as a man grabbed Kaulder and hand cuffed him to the grate before waking him up. He hit the ground and groaned as he pulled a needle out of his neck. \"Hello, witch hunter. I was once yanked out of a memory spell. My mind was mush for hours.\" The man said laughing. Kaulder was grunting trying to get his hand out of the handcuff. \"People shouldn't dig up the past. That's why it's in the past.\" Kaulder tried to reach for the man, but he was just out of reach. Kaulder ran the other way and broke his hand in multiple places while pulling it out of the cuff. The man had walked over to the cabinets and was smashing all the potions and the ingredients. Kaulder walked over to the man while his hand healed and by the time he got there his hand was perfect and it was landing a punch into the witch's face. \"You cursed my friend.\" Kaulder said to the man why was lying at his feet. \"He lasted longer than most do.\" He taunted behind his barrier spell. I crawled over to the bar and grabbed what Kaulder would need to be pulled out of the memory spell. \"Doesn't take balls to get into a bar fight when you can't get hurt.\" The man pointed out as he stood over Kaulder. \"I guess your mind isn't as tough. No more memory potions.\" He walked over to the back of the bar and I hid at the end. He was chanting and then the back of the bar was on fire. Chloe is going to kill me. I thought as I watched her bar catch fire. I crawled over to Kaulder and he grabbed my throat cutting off my airway. \"Kaulder.\" I struggled to say as I grabbed his hand trying to pull it off. I took the lid off of the container and blew the spell into Kaulder's face. \"Kaulder. Can't. Breath.\" I said in between short gasps. His eyes widened and he let go of my throat. He grabbed my shoulder and looked at me in concern before running over to the man disappearing into the floor. I stood up and looked around at the fire surrounding us. \"You're a monster. This is some cruel joke. I could never love you.\" I said and ran out of the building. I ran out of the building and all the way back to my apartment. My phone was ringing and I knew it was Chloe. \"Chloe, I'm so sorry.\" I said. \"Soph, are you okay? I got the call, and they didn't find you.\" \"I'm fine. I'm so sorry about the bar.\" \"It was a bar, I'm just relieved to find out you're okay.\" \"I promise you, you will get every penny when I die.\" \"Soph, don't talk like that. You'll find him.\" \"I did, and he's not someone you fall in love with. Chloe, take the money and fix the place up.\" \"Insurance will cover it.\" \"Still, take it. You're the only person in 850 years I've trusted with my secret. If I were to give my fortune to anyone it would be you.\" I said. \"Thanks, Sophie.\" \"You're my best friend, Chloe.\" I hung up and poured myself a drink. I sat on the couch with the TV playing in the background. I heard whispers over it and I sat straight up. I turned on all the lights in my studio and looked around. I saw nothing so poured a glass of water and downed it. As I was drinking all the lights became increasingly brighter. Then they all shattered leaving me in darkness. I opened my fridge and stood in front of it for a minute before I ran to grab my shoes. As I was putting them on the light from the fridge was fading. I looked back to see it slowly closing. I went for the door but something grabbed my legs causing me to fall to the ground. I tried to pull away, but it had a tighter hold and was puling me into the wall. I was somewhere that I didn't know. I was surrounded by my past selves. They all scowled and then screamed as their faces decayed. \"Sophie, grab my hand!\" I heard someone yell. I reached out and felt myself leave that place. I saw Kaulder's face as I blacked out.[Chapter 2] I woke up in a really nice room. The bed was soft and the room was filled with natural light. Then it all came back to me. I remembered Kaulder rescuing me and bringing me here. I climbed out of the bed and walked over to the window to see Central Park. \"Wow.\" I said looking around. I heard people talking on the other side of the door and walked out to see Kaulder hunched over a computer with a smaller man with black hair. \"Why doesn't he want me to remember my death?\" Kaulder asked. \"Baltasar Ketola, and now goes by Belial. He's Finnish.\" The smaller man read. \"He's the one Ellie was working for.\" \"He cursed Dolan?\" Kaulder nodded. \"Ever generation deserves the chance to destroy the world.\" \"We aren't all like that. We're the same as you humans.\" I said making my presence known. \"You may look like us, but you have magic in your blood. Powerful magic that can do bad things. We were interrupted at the bar. We have to try again.\" \"Yes, the bar that's owned by my best friend. Thanks to you I now have to pay for the reconstruction of that bar. Not like I was using the money anyways. I'm leaving.\" I said sarcastically. \"I don't like this any more than you do.\" \"You don't know that.\" \"But if you help me, I'll keep you safe.\" \"I need Snowdonia hawkweed. There's a girl I work with that grows everything. I'll text her.\" \"Thank you.\" Kaulder said and he walked away. I sent Miranda a text and then I decided to text Chloe. Miranda's cat ringtone started going off and both men looked back at me. \"She's a cat person.\" I said and answered the phone. \"Hey Miranda.\" \"Are you dead?\" \"Nope, not dead yet.\" I said giving Kaulder a look the he smirked at. \"Why do you need Snowdonia Hawkweed?\" \"I need it for aa memory potion.\" \"Okay, I'll get it out for you. Come by and grab it.\" \"Thanks, Miranda. Oh, and don't freak out, but the witch hunter will be with me.\" \"Why are you with him?\" \"I was attacked last night by another witch. He saved me. I owe him my life.\" \"Okay, but he better not kill me.\" \"He won't. I'll see you soon.\" I led the way to Miranda's and pulled out my keys. \"When you see her don't make any sudden movements. I promised her you wouldn't kill her so don't.\" I said unlocking the door. I opened it a little and one of Miranda's cats came running out. It scared me and I jumped back causing my back to his Kaulder's chest. He had his hands on my waist and a smile on his face. \"Wow.\" He said steadying me. I apparently needed it because being back in the arms of my soulmate caused my knees to grow weak and my heart to race. \"Sorry.\" I said quietly while I stepped away from him and opened the door. I walked in and set my phone down on the ledge while I looked for the hawkweed. \"Here we go.\" I said grabbing a stool and stepping up to look at the plant. \"Crap, it hasn't budded yet.\" \"Genocidal, asshole, fascist.\" Kaulder said reading the text I sent Chloe. I looked at him in surprise. \"That about me?\" He asked with a small laugh. \"No, it's about a guy I fell in love with, but I'm realizing he's not the man I used to know.\" That wasn't a complete lie. Kaulder wasn't Karter. I had barely changed over many lifetimes, but in his extremely long one he had. \"It's interesting that you all fall in love.\" \"We aren't mean. We don't have green skin and wear pointy hats. I'm sorry to disappoint but I'm not the Wicked Witch of the West. No one cares how many innocent people and witches died at Salem.\" I included. I sighed and walked into the other green room. \"Salem was wrong. Those women were innocent.\" Kaulder said following me. \"What if they were witches? Then would it have been okay?\" I asked him. He didn't say anything. \"See, if it was me found guilty,\" which I had been, \"no one would care.\" \"I would.\" Kaulder said. Don't get my hopes up, Kaulder. Is what I wanted to say, but instead I kept looking for the hawkweed. \"The hawkweed's gone. Someone's taken it.\" I said continuing to dig through the plants looking for it. Kaulder didn't say anything. \"Kaulder?\" I asked looking at him. He stood stiff staring at the ground. \"What is it?\" I asked walking over to him. He turned to stop me, but it was too late. I saw Miranda dead on the ground. He held on to me as my knees got weak, but this time from seeing the poor dead girl on the ground. \"I killed her.\" Said quietly. \"No, you didn't. Belial did.\" He said in my ear. Then Miranda's ringtone started going off. I answered my phone. \"You're too late, Kaulder. She died screaming. Alone. Just like you.\" Belial said over the phone. I covered my mouth and ran out leaving my phone with Kaulder. I sat on the steps outside Miranda's with my head in my hands. I heard the door open and close then Kaulder sat beside me. \"You're going to kill who did this, right?\" I asked him without lifting my head. \"I'll take care of Belial.\" He said. \"Good, but I don't know where else to get what we need.\" \"I know a place, but it's old magic, and it's dangerous.\" I felt someone put their arms around me and my head popped up in shock. He pulled me over to him and I put my head in the crook of his neck. We fit together like puzzle pieces. We always had. \"I'm sorry.\" He said as he rubbed my shoulder. We sat there a while longer before I spoke. \"Karter, we should go.\" I said quietly. \"Who's Karter?\" Kaulder asked and I moved away from him. \"I said Kaulder.\" I said wiping my eyes. \"No, you said Karter.\" \"Just a slip up.\" I said standing up and straightening out my clothes. \"Is he the guy?\" \"You could say that. We have somewhere to go.\" I said changing the subject. Kaulder gave me a look and then we started walking. It was a fashion warehouse, and there was currently a show going on. I felt completely underdressed compared to everyone else. \"Kaulder.\" A girl at the door smiled at him. Sonya.\" He replied before kissing her cheek. I felt a fire flare up inside of me. Jealousy that someone else was touching my soulmate. She led us backstage where we walked through all the changing models. \"Danique's been busy, I'm surprised she agreed to this.\" Sonya said to Kaulder. \"She wouldn't have liked the alternative.\" I looked at all the models as we walked through. Their true faces showing in the mirrors in front of them. One glared at me and I turned to see Kaulder waiting for me. He stayed behind me as we were led into a room where Danique was sitting smoking her hookah. \"Kaulder, you've officially made my night.\" Danique said and we moved to sit on the couch. Kaulder walked over and kissed her hand. \"You rescue her from a thrift shop?\" She asked looking at me. Oh if only you knew what I could do to you, sweetheart. \"You're lucky he's here.\" I said threateningly and Kaulder grabbed my hand to calm me. We sat down and he let go. \"So, what is it you must remember?\" Danique asked Kaulder. \"He forgot where he parked his car.\" I said smugly earning a look from Kaulder. \"Don't worry about it how much do I owe you?\" Kaulder asked. \"Have a drink with me. That's my price.\" She smiled. \"You know what I'm here for.\" \"We all pretend to be something we're not. But you've lived. You've seen all of history. You've known Stalin, Napoleon, Hitler.\" \"We don't need to be nostalgic. There's enough evil in this world now.\" I was handed the plant and checked to make sure that it was real and what we wanted before we paid. \"They aren't much different that you. They used their power to control the world.\" \"Can't change what you created.\" \"Kaulder, somethings wrong with this plant.\" I said turning to him but he was mentally gone. \"You're here.\" He said to someone that's not there. \"Kaulder.\" I said realizing what was happening but the two side-girls held me back. \"Kaulder! Kaulder!\" I was trying to snap him out of it without using witchcraft. \"I don't want to do this.\" I said before entering his mind. \"Kaulder, you need to listen to me. You're dreaming. This is a trap and you need to wake up.\" I said seeing the Kaulder that came after Karter standing there. Then a baby was crying and he was holding her in his arms. \"You won't find any answers here. The longer you stay here the harder it will be to get out.\" We were flashing through memories. It finally stopped when Kaulder and his wife were standing by the river. I was walking through the river to get to him. \"Kaulder you need to wake up or we'll both die. Wake up!\" I went to stab him but he said something that made me stop. \"Sofiel?\" \"Karter?\" I shook my head and shoved the knife through his stomach. He gasped and then we were sitting beside two graves. \"This isn't real, Kaulder. Wake up!\" I said softly. Danique had brought some men to carry Kaulder away. \"Bring the car around and throw him in the trunk. We're going to be the ones who beat the witch hunter.\" Danique said happily. I looked u when I was kicked out of Kaulder's head and I saw him kicking one of Danique's men in the back knocking him out on the door. He took out all four of the men and then threw the gun at one of the girls holding me causing her to drop her gun. \"Get out.\" Kaulder said to the girls and they ran. Kaulder looked at me while I rubbed my wrists. I nodded to tell him I was okay. \"Burial dirt. There's nothing more powerful to help conduct dark magic.\" Kaulder said holding up some from the pot. He walked over to Danique and ripped off her necklace. \"Why does Belial want it?\" Kaulder asked. \"Who?\" Danique asked and Kaulder pulled out the gem inside. \"What doesn't he want me to see?\" Kaulder asked as he began to squeeze the gem. \"Stop! Belial didn't tell me anything. I helped him get the dirt and in return I took some for myself. Please.\" \"Thanks for the drink.\" Kaulder said dropping the stone in the glass. I grabbed it before Danique could. \"You have betrayed your kind.\" \"Just in this life. I love thrift shops. Everything in them is old.\" I said then dropped the stone before crushing it under my foot. I heard her groaning as the spell wore away. \"Bitch.\" I heard her say and I flipped her off without turning back.[Chapter 3] We walked outside and Kaulder still hadn't said anything. \"Well, now you know.\" I said unable to handle the tension. \"You're a dream-walker.\" Kaulder said looking at me. \"We all know dream-walking is a black gift. I spent my whole life hiding from it.\" I sighed and leaned against the wall. \"You knew I would find out, but you didn't care. You pulled me out of that trap. That was brave.\" He said leaning against the wall with me. \"Thanks.\" I said quietly looking at the ground. \"Here, I want to show you something.\" He said grabbing my hand and pulling me along. We drove to the church and went down below into what I was guessing was where the witches council meets. We were walking past very intricate drawings. \"This is the history of witches.\" \"This is you, they even got your eyes right.\" I said running my hand over the picture. \"Yeah.\" He said with a small laugh. \"These, right here, are the dream-walkers. They were the queen's deadliest assassins. They could turn your dreams into nightmares.\" \"Is this a history lesson or are you trying to make me more afraid of what I can do than I already am?\" I asked and Kaulder walked over to me. \"No, I'm just showing you. But there's something nobody knows about dream-walkers. They don't need memory potions. They can do that themselves. There's something buried in my mind and I need your help to get it out.\" \"I can't.\" I said quietly while shaking my head. \"Sophie…\" \"I can't do it. I had a sister. Well, a foster sister. She just loved to piss me off. No one ever saw what she was doing, so I always got in trouble. One day she stole something and led me up to the roof where I fell. I should have died. I was in a coma and in that coma I dreamt of getting back at her. I beat her up. When I woke up she was in the hospital bed next to me. I didn't mean to, but I did it. So I did what every other 15 year old would do, and I ran away.\" I walked past Kaulder and sat down on the ground. Kaulder walked past me and sat next to me. \"What were your wife and daughter's names?\" I asked. \"Helena and Elizabeth. I haven't said those names in a long time.\" \"I don't even know where to begin.\" \"Think of a word you associate with me.\" Kaulder said standing up and taking off his jacket. \"It can be anything and then empty everything else out of your mind. Focus on that word.\" He said kneeling in front of me. \"One word.\" I said searching my mind for which word fit him best. I wanted to say love, but I knew he would feel awkward so I said exactly what I had felt since the moment I had been cursed. \"Alone.\" He looked sad in his eyes, but I knew he was. He would be until he remembered. He slowly reached out and grabbed my hand putting it over his heart. We were back in his memories. He was crouched by the graves and I held out my hand. \"Take my hand, Kaulder.\" I said softly. He looked up at me then stood up. We looked to the source of light and saw the plague tree on fire. We walked down and through the burning labyrinth to find Kaulder's charred body. \"This way.\" I heard someone yell and people walked over towards us. Kaulder put his arm protectively in front of me and made me step back. \"Brother Dolan.\" Someone said pointing to Kaulder's body. \"What is that?\" Another man asked pointing to the witch queen's body. \"Dolan, tread carefully.\" \"He did it.\" The Dolan said and pulled the sword from her chest making her crumble. The Dolan went to bless Kaulder when he came back to life. \"He's possessed.\" Someone yelled unsheathing a sword. \"Kaulder is alive. Our nightmare had ended with a miracle.\" The Dolan said. Some of the men held onto him and helped him lie down as he struggled to breathe. There was a heartbeat and I looked over at the pile of ash to see the queen's heart still beating. \"When we destroy the heart we will have destroyed her.\" Dolan said looking back at his men. Dolan stabbed the heart and Kaulder began screaming. The screaming intensified when the heart was held over the fire. \"Destroy her.\" One of the men yelled. \"No.\" Kaulder said from beside me. Dolan removed the dagger and Kaulder stopped screaming. \"He kept it.\" Kaulder said shocked. \"The queen is dead.\" The Dolan said to the men. \"They betrayed you from the start.\" Kaulder looked at me, \"They tortured your friend because he knew where the heart was. They're gonna bring back the queen.\" Kaulder looked at the Dolan and himself. \"Kaulder?\" I heard someone say. \"What did you say?\" Kaulder asked me. \"I didn't say anything.\" I said. I looked behind me as I remembered when I saw Kaulder's scorched body. Kaulder looked between the past Sofiel and my present self. Poor Sofiel who had just found her love had to watch him become the man he was standing before Sophie. \"Sofiel.\" Present Kaulder said looking at us. \"Come on.\" I said taking Kaulder's hand pulling him out of the memory. \"Who's Sofiel?\" Kaulder asked me when we were back in the council room. \"Someone you don't need to worry about. You need to go talk to your Dolan. We need to find Belial and the heart.\" I said. Kaulder and I walked out and he told me to wait in the main church area for him. I sat there and looked around at the depictions of God and Jesus. If only they knew what they really looked like. \"Go to my apartment. You'll be safe there.\" Kaulder said putting on his jacket. \"The deal was we'd stick together.\" I said following Kaulder. \"If I can't trust my own people how do you expect me to trust you?\" I grabbed his arm making him stop to turn and face me. \"This isn't who you are. I know you better than anyone.\" \"Then you don't know me at all.\" He said then walked away. I sighed and ran my hands through my hair. \"You're not making this any easier.\" I said looking at the ceiling.[Chapter 4] I walked the streets back to the apartment. I stood in the window looking over Central Park. Kaulder finally came back and I waited for him to come out of the room where his cursed friend was. He came out and walked over to his vault. I stood behind him. \"Kaulder.\" I said trying to get his attention. He pulled down his sword. \"I never named her. But the witches called her Hexenbane.\" \"Witch slayer.\" He sheathed the sword. \"I'm coming with you.\" I said as her turned to walk past me. \"Our agreement was me keeping you safe.\" \"No, it was if I helped you, you'd keep me safe.\" \"I can't heal anymore.\" \"All the more reason to have me there. Who says a witch can't hunt witches?\" I said pulling out my knife. Kaulder slowly walked over to me standing inches from me. \"I can't promise you'll live.\" He said quietly. \"I've died before.\" I shrugged. Kaulder grabbed my hip and kissed me pulling me closer to him. \"Who is Sofiel?\" Kaulder asked with his eyes still closed. \"I'll tell you about her after this is all over.\" I said and stepped away from him. We walked down to the car and took it to the church where the 37th Dolan was waiting for us. \"Sophie. Kaulder.\" He greeted as we walked up to him. Kaulder stopped and put his hand on his shoulder before walking past him. Dolan and I followed Kaulder into the church but something was different. It had been turned into the plague tree. \"The plague tree. She's here. When the spell is complete the swarm will be released. We don't have a lot of time.\" Kaulder said and we made our way deeper into the building. We walked into the council room to find them all dead and the room destroyed. Kaulder looked back for me but I was only a few steps behind him. \"Stay close to me.\" He said to me. We walked into the tunnels and I didn't see anything. \"Kaulder, where are the witches?\" I asked. We walked up to a wall, shook a vile, and then threw it on the ground. I saw them. All the witches trapped in a wall, waiting for the witch queen to release them. \"Every witch I ever caught. The queen is liking them together and using their power to release the plague.\" Kaulder explained. \"How do we stop them?\" I asked. \"Every chain has a weak link.\" Kaulder unsheathed his sword and started hitting the wall causing the prison to crack. He then reached in and pulled one of the witches out. The witch just laid there. His blank face staring up at the ceiling as he chanted. \"I'll do it.\" Dolan said pulling out his gun. \"It's not his body that needs to be destroyed.\" Kaulder said stopping the Dolan. \"It's his mind.\" I said quietly. \"I wish there was another way.\" He said with an apologetic look. \"You'll be here when I get out, right?\" I asked kneeling next to Ellic and looking up at Kaulder. He didn't say anything. \"You're going to take her on alone.\" I said coming to the realization. \"It has to end.\" Was all he said. I placed my hand on Ellic's chest and took a deep breath. Kaulder knelt down across from me and placed his hand on mine. \"Be careful in there.\" \"You sound like you care.\" I joked. \"I just got used to you.\" Kaulder smiled. \"Good luck.\" \"You too.\" I focused on Ellic and Kaulder faded from in front of me. I was inside the plague tree. I stood up and looked around. Once I didn't see Ellic I started climbing out of the hold I was in and found Ellic on his knees chanting. I pulled out my knife and slowly crept up on him. Once I was close enough for a blow he stood up and threw me to the ground knocking the knife out of my hands. He had one hand on my throat and the other was grabbing my knife. I reached out to get a hold on the hand with the knife. He ripped his hand out of mine and the knife created a deep gash in my palm. I screamed and clenched my hand shut. I used my other hand to grab something to hit him with. I found a log and knocked him across the head causing him to get off me. But only long enough for me to catch my breath before he wrapped his hands around my neck again. We were over by the hole I had climbed out of. I grabbed onto one of the roots on the edge making sure I had a good grip before I used my body to force us over the edge. I held on as Ellic fell and then I was thrust out of his head. I looked down in front of me and saw Ellic dead. \"I did it.\" I thought to myself. I ripped off a piece of clothing and wrapped it round my hand using my teeth to tie it tight. Dolan helped me up and the chanting had stopped. \"We need to find Kaulder.\" I said beginning to walk away from Dolan. \"I couldn't agree more.\" Dolan said and I turned to see him pointing the gun at me. I put my hands up in surrender. \"Keep walking.\" He said placing the gun between my shoulder blades as I continued in whatever direction Dolan told me to go. We walked into a room where Kaulder was about to kill the witch queen. \"Stop!\" Dolan yelled and stood behind me with the gun pointed at my temple. \"Kaulder.\" I said and he looked over to see us. \"Sophie.\" He said quietly. \"I'm sorry.\" \"Release my queen. The witches you rescued me from when I was a kid. They were my parents. Not the pathetic humans. Sadly I was born without magic.\" Dolan said. \"You're a witch.\" Kaulder said coming to the realization. \"Yeah.\" Dolan said and then shot Kaulder. \"No! Kaulder!\" I yelled trying to get away from Dolan. \"You stay here!\" He said keeping his hold on me. \"Stay away from him!\" I yelled at the witch queen who was leaning over Kaulder. The witch queen looked at me and smiled. \"A fallen angel. Turned into a dream-walker. How ironic.\" She said walking over to me. She grabbed my head and then there was a flash of light. I was standing in a field chanting along with the other witches. We all stared at the plague tree. I couldn't stop. She had taken control of my mind. I was snapped out of it and fell to my knees. I looked up and saw Kaulder lying on the ground. \"Kaulder!\" I yelled and ran over to him. \"My love.\" I said placing a hand on his chest and the other on his head. He gasped and opened his eyes. I smiled and looked down at him. The scratches across his face healed and my face turned to one of utter shock. He looked at me and then touched his face feeling the healed skin. He then looked over at the crumbling witch's body. He walked over and pulled out his sword showing the queen's still beating heart. \"As long as the Hexen heart beats, she'll never truly be dead.\" Kaulder said without looking at me. He raised his sword to kill her, but I stopped him. \"Kaulder, you can't. You'll die.\" I said shakily. \"I'm ready to face that.\" \"No! There has to be another way. I saw things in the shadows. Things much worse than the witch queen. They're waiting in the darkness.\" \"For what?\" \"A world without you.\" \"We need you. I need you.\" He lowered his sword but didn't look at me. \"The axe and cross betrayed me. I can't trust anyone.\" \"You can trust me. You can always trust me.\" I said stepping closer to him. He finally looked up at me. \"800 years I've been on this road. Always hunting and always…\" \"Alone.\" I finished. \"You don't have to be anymore.\" I said and grabbed his hand. \"Besides you asked about Sofiel.\" I smiled. \"So, we're negotiating now, are we?\" He asked returning the smile. \"I guess so.\" Kaulder sheathed his sword and grabbed the queen's heart. We took it back to Kaulder's apartment and placed it in a safe in his vault to be locked away forever.[Chapter 5] Once the vault closed her turned to me. \"I believe you promised me a story.\" Kaulder smiled. \"I did.\" I smiled and walked over to him. We sat down on the couch on opposite sides. I leaned against the arm of the couch and pulled my knees up to my chest. \"Let's start with what the witch queen said. About being a fallen angel?\" \"Sofiel, was the angel of nature. She put the love of nature in humans. She loved nature so much she sometimes would come down to the earth to see what she loved up close. One day she met someone who was hunting in the woods. They fell in love right away. God didn't like the relationship so he gave Sofiel the chance to come back to heaven and forget the feelings that she had developed. She refused the offer. So God ripped of her wings and she fell. That wasn't all god did to punish her. He cursed both of them. To be reincarnated and wander the earth until they found each other. Now Sofiel was cursed to remember every life she had and die before her 30th birthday. While he would be reincarnated and never feel whole. He would never remember Sofiel until he finally loved her and broke the curse.\" \"You were Sofiel.\" Kaulder said. \"Yeah.\" I said slowly nodding my head while looking at my knees. \"And your 30th birthday?\" \"Is in a little over a week.\" \"So you knew you were dying, and you still followed me everywhere instead of enjoying your life?\" \"Karter was my life. I was reincarnated with the purpose to find him. A couple centuries ago I gave up. Figured if God really didn't want us to be together he wouldn't let us be. Then one day I saw him.\" \"And you didn't go get him?\" \"He wasn't Karter. At least not the Karter I fell in love with.\" \"What happened to him?\" \"I guess time. Being alone for that long and feeling as if you were incomplete. It can make you hard. Make it so you give up hope.\" \"I know how that feels.\" \"Anyways, Chloe's probably worried about me. I should give her a call.\" I said getting up off the couch. \"I'm Karter, aren't I?\" \"You used to be.\" I said walking away. I saw Kaulder sitting there staring at the wall while I closed the door. I dialed Chloe and she almost immediately answered. \"Sophie, I saw the swarm. What happened?\" Chloe asked. \"It's okay, Kaulder and I stopped it. The queen is gone and she's never coming back.\" \"Thank god. So, what are you going to do for the next ten days?\" \"I don't know. Maybe just find a nice beach somewhere. Chill for a few days.\" \"Well, if you want to hang out before you go, call me.\" \"Of course. Love ya.\" \"Love ya.\" I hung up and went to open the bedroom door. I jumped when I found Kaulder standing outside the door looking down. \"I remember the day I first saw you. You were in the forest reaching for an apple that was just out of reach. There was an apple what was closer to your reach but you just had to have that one. I walked up behind you and grabbed it for you. When I asked you why you didn't go for the other one you told me that the best apples were the ones you had to work to get.\" \"You remember?\" I asked smiling while feeling the tears coming to my eyes. \"I remember when you told me that you were an angel. I knew it all along. There was this natural light about you. No matter how dark it was I could see it. I remember when you told me that you would fall if you didn't return to heaven. I told you to go because I wasn't worth it. I was just another guy.\" He said grabbing my hands and looking me in the eyes. \"But I didn't think so and I fell anyways. We were both punished for it. I ruined your life.\" \"I may have spent the last 800 years thinking that something was missing. Something I could never fill, but these last few days with you I've felt like this is what I needed all along. Maybe if you'd never given up we would have found each other sooner, but maybe we found each other right when we needed to.\" \"Maybe.\" I said quietly while I wiped my eyes. \"Sophie, I love you. This you. That you. Every you.\" \"I love you too Kaulder.\" I smiled and kissed him. I waited in the car while Kaulder went to the church to go talk to the 36th Dolan. I was playing music in the car when I felt something strange within me. I looked down at my hands and saw light spreading through my veins. I smiled knowing that this was God's gift. He was restoring my immortality so that Kaulder and I could be together. I got out ready to run all the way to the church to tell Kaulder the news, but when I got out I saw him coming around the corner. He smiled and walked over to me kissing me. \"So, I'm driving.\" I said smiling and holding out my hand for the keys. \"Fine by me.\" He said gladly handing them over. We got in the car and she came to life. I smiled wickedly and if it wasn't for the immortality I bet Kaulder would have been terrified. \"So, I've been wondering how this me being immortal, and you not going to affect our relationship?\" Kaulder asked as I sped my way to the edge of the city. \"The curse is broken, but that doesn't mean I become an angel again. Not like I would, but you were given the gift of an immortal girlfriend.\" \"Wait, immortal?\" \"What's the fun of an immortal life when your soulmate is going to die?\" \"So where are we going?\" \"Wherever the road takes us.\" Kaulder smiled and I pressed down on the gas.

The Gill-Man stood on the rocky shoreline, wondering in his own way how things had ever reached this point. It hadn't been that long ago that he had been the master of his domain, the ruler of the lagoon he called home. Everything was part of his dominion. Nothing else in the lagoon could rival him. All that, of course, changed the moment that the first people invaded his realm. The first ones had found the remains of one of his mate. Was nothing sacred to these monsters? Could they not let her remains stay undisturbed? The Gill-Man had tried to reach up and grab at them from beneath the surface of the waters, to drag them down and drown them, but he was just a moment too slow and missed his target. Later on, when evening fell, he atoned for his mistake by slaying them all as they slept. Or, at least, he thought he had gotten them all. Apparently one was absent at the time and thereby unknowingly saved his own life. In retrospect, in the manner of his thoughts, he recognized it to be one of the greatest mistakes of his life. He should have killed them all right away when he had the chance. More invaders came soon after. Their boat had disturbed the top of his water, polluting the air above with its gaseous waste. From miles away, he sensed their approach and swam up the mighty river so that he could attack them and hopefully end their threat once and for all. That was, of course, until he saw her , the female of their species. In spite of his hatred for the surface creatures, she overwhelmed him. He relived feelings he had not experienced since his mate had died, and he found her muddling his thoughts. In hindsight, she was the beginning of his undoing. Had it not been for her, he would have killed all the males and been done with it. He did claim a couple of lives, but he impulsively chose to take the female to his lair instead of harming her. For his trouble, he got attacked by the surviving males, who used their long-distance weapons on him. He sank unconscious into the depths as projectile after projectile hit him. In time he healed, but his battles with the humans were far from over. The boat returned, and this time he found himself captured. They took him to some sort of prison with water, a place where countless members of their despicable species came to watch and make sport of him. Much to his chagrin, there was another female, and he found himself as attracted to her as he had been to the first. The Gill-Man escaped, taking her captive and killing some humans along the way, but he found himself once again sinking into the depths after the humans attacked him with their long-distance projectiles. However, his last run-in with them was the worst of all. It wasn't enough for them to capture him again, nor was it enough that they burned him. They didn't even have the decency to let him die. No, they have to work on his body, make him an air-breather like them. He tried to swim away and nearly drowned. Then one of them killed another and tried to blame him. He escaped, claiming some victims as he went, and now stood here looking out at the ocean. The sight broke his heart. Hadn't the water been his home just a short time ago? Now, as he looked out upon it, it represented the prospect of death by drowning—-a death that the humans had denied him, a death that would be sweet release for his tortured soul. Without further delay, the Gill-Man ran out into the water, throwing himself into it. Much as his new lungs balked at the water intake and screamed for air, he forced himself down beneath the surface. Soon, it would all be over…. Only it wasn't. The Gill-Man thought death was looming, could nearly see what lay beyond this life, when suddenly something unexpected happened. Something beyond his wildest imaginings, something that gave him hope. He breathed the water. His precious gills were coming back to him! Much to his surprise, the Gill-Man found himself wanting to live. The thought of being able to call the water home again transmogrified his thoughts of suicide into a sudden determination to hang onto life. What was to be his exit from his tortured existence was now turning into a homecoming. The gills weren't instantly developed. Several times he had to come up for air, but every time he went down he found himself able to stay down longer. At last, by the time the sun had sunk behind the horizon again, he knew he could stay down as long as he liked. And he would…for as long as he could. The water had been given back to him, perhaps by the Divine, and this time he would hold onto it. And woe would come to any human who ever tried to encroach upon his domain again….

A Creature from the Black Lagoon story. As always all rights to the storyline and backgrounds of the Creature belong to its creators. Story, The team made a startling discovery about the Creature. the Creature makes his first kill. Rated T for brief violence, and suggested violence. The next morning the research team stared their investigation of the Gill-man. they only had the records of the team that initially discovered the creature almost 60 years back. Jim Ness made the first discovery. It was an partial skeleton buried in the mud. \"Do you believe this!\" Ness exclaimed happily. \"An arm and partial torso.\" the rest of the team ran over. Cheryl asked \"Can we get an age off this?\" \"Absolutely, boss.\" Jim said \"Give this to our geek, and we'll know how old our friend is.\" Tom Westerfield stuck his head out of the tent. \"And do I have something to play with?\" Cheryl strode over with the sample. \"See if you can get an age off this.\" Tom took the sample. \"Let's see what Mass Spec has to say.\" He took the sample and went to work. \"It should take about an hour, depending on the age of the sample.\" Tom explained. \"The older the sample the longer it will..\" he got no further as the mass spec machine rang, indicating the test was done. \"What the hell?\" Tom said as he read the printout. He stared at the paper for a few minutes, then ran the test again. McWaters came into the tent as Tom ran the test a second time. Mac asked \"What's on?\" Cheryl replied \"We running a mass spec on the sample we found. Tom thinks there is something wrong.\" The test ran its course and Tom took the readout, and shook his head in disbelief. Mac and Cheryl watched in curiosity. \"Well, what is it?\" Cheryl finally said running out of patience. \"Boss.\" Tom said rubbing his hand through his red hair. \"This sample is not from a fossil. It is in fact about 15 to 30 years old.\" \"But that's not possible.\" Mac said. \"There was only one of these creatures, and it was killed back in the 50's\" \"At least, that's what everyone thought.\" Cheryl said. Thinking about the possibilities here. Turning back to Tom. \"What are the chances of being able to find the rest of the skeleton?\" Thinking about the problem, Tom said. \"Fair, if we can dig deeper into this bank we may find the rest of our friend here.\" Practically dancing with joy, Cheryl said. \"Ok, we'll start digging into this in the morning.\" Turning back to McWaters. \"Mac do you think that we'll need some heavier digging equipment for this?\" \"Maybe.\" he said. \"If we hit anything hard in the bank, we will. The only way we'll know is when we start to dig. Suddenly the conversation was interrupted by the boat's horn. McWaters told Cheryl and Tom. \"Be right back.\" As he made his way to the boat, McWaters started to take notice of what was going on around them. There was little to no sounds coming from the jungle. he knew that this was a sign of a problem. As he got to the boat, Max was on the stern scanning downriver with binoculars. McWaters also was quick to notice that Max had his rifle close by as well as his pistol. \"Do we have a problem here?\" McWaters asked \"Hard to say, my friend.\" Max replied. \"I'm sure you noticed the sound of silence out there.\" \"Yes I did notice. Care to guess what the problem is?\" \"Maybe our shadows that are still down river.\" Max said, then looking toward the jungle. \"Or maybe something else.\" McWaters considered. \"Let's find out.\" He took Max's rifle and pointing downstream, squeezed off several shots. Some sound of birds taking to the air, then silence again. \"Whatever's out there, they or it's not afraid of guns.\" The rest of the team came racing to the river bank. Ness shouted to them. \"What's going on?\" With a quick exchange of looks. Max replied. \"Nothing my friends.\" We thought that we could pick something off for dinner\" Ness shook his head in disgust as he and Tom went back to work. Cheryl gave the two men on the boat a long questioning look, then went back to work. Max looked down river \"We may have a problem soon.\" He had no idea just how right he was. As the night went by, the team discussed the day's events. \"We have found a sample of the creature that supposedly was extinct and now isn't? Ness asked. \"So are we saying that there may be a specimen that is actually out there?' \"It does make for an intriguing situation.\" Cheryl said looking into the night. \"Just think, actually finding a living being. A bipedal form of life as different from us as night and day.\" Max interjected a note of caution. \" Remember the history of this animal. The last team that tried to capture this thing most of them did not come back alive.\" McWaters also spoke up. \"To do that we would need a lot more equipment and bodies to do that.\" Cheryl frowned at these statements. To be patient when they were so close to a breakthrough discovery was not part of her nature. But what McWaters and Max were saying was good advice and she knew it. \"OK.\" she said. \" This is what we'll do. Get a hold of the lab in Chicago, and get a second opinion.\" Ness nodded and went to his little tech cubby. \"And while he's doing that . I'll grab a quick swim before it get too dark out.\" Cheryl said as her grabbed a towel and headed for the outer side of the embankment. Tom called out \" Do you need someone to play lifeguard?\" \"No. Tom.\" Cheryl replied as she walked away. \"How about washing your back?\" McWaters added hopefully. \"Not tonight, Mac.\" Was her reply. \"Or how about a you tube show for the gang back in Chi-town?\" Ness said slightly giggling at the very unlikely prospect. \"Bite me!\" was her answer. Shaking her head in amusement Cheryl quickly stripped off and dove into the water, loving how the warm water made her feel. She was clueless to the fact that she was at this moment in a considerable amount of danger Under the cover of the brush, a man from the other boat was watching the young woman swimming with hunger. Joao watched Cheryl from the jungle. He took in all of her beauty. From her blond hair to her firm breasts, narrow waist and well-formed backside. he watched her with undisguised lust. Then he glanced down river to where the others were waiting. \"Screw them!\" he thought. \"I will taste this one's sweet charms, now.\" And he started to move toward her. Cheryl was unaware of the danger moving toward her as she continued to bathe. \"It's a quiet night.\" she thought to herself, as Joao edged closer. Joao had an evil smile as he quietly moved through the bush. But what he didn't know was something stalked him as well and was getting closer. The boat's horn sounded, Tom was calling out to her. \"Hey Boss.\" We got through to Chicago.\" \"All right.\" Cheryl called back. \"I'm coming\" As she quickly dressed, and ran back to the boat. Joao was disgusted as he glared down the path back to the boat. \"So close.\" he snarled. \"But Joao is patient, you will know me well before this is done.\" He turned to go back down the path, but found to his alarm the he was not alone. he froze in terror as he looked into the eyes of the Gill man. They both stared at each other for a brief moment. Joao in horror, the Gill man with primal rage. Before Joao could move or even scream. The Gill man took what passed for his hand with claws sharp as razors and tore out Joao's throat. His blood spraying himself and the creature was the last thing he saw. The creature took Joao's body and returned to the water. Hs first kill, but not his last. To be continued . ","Summary":" Creature pt-3. A Creature from the Black Lagoon story.

Rated K+ for right now. The expedition boat was sailing up the Amazon River. The 8 people on board were seeking a legend, much like the Yeti or Bigfoot, but much more dangerous. The expedition's leader Robert McWaters was somewhat skeptical. The fact that there were rumors of the legendary Gill man after nearly 60 years, he found this hard to believe. However the Natural History museum that was funding the expedition was willing to take the chance. McWaters walked back into the wheelhouse. \"Max.\" he said \"How much further do we have to go?\" \"Well, sir\" Max Jessup the boat captain replied. \"We are 20 miles from the tributary. then we will sail up there for another 60 or 100 miles. That should lead us to the Black Lagoon.\" \"And that's where we'll find this thing if it even still exists?\" \"Maybe.\" McWaters looked into the afternoon sun. \"Do you think it's out there?\" Max shrugged It's hard to say. The few old timers that actually saw it say it's possible.\" Looking back to McWaters \"They also say that if it still does exist. It is in everyone's best interest to leave it in peace. They say that only death and terror follow it.\" McWaters just grunts and walks below decks. In the cramped crew quarters the rest of the team is assembling their equipment. The team paleontologist Dr. Jim Ness was going over his records from the last few years. It was his reports and observations that got the expedition moving. Next to him was Tom Westerfield, computer geek. It was Tom that would transmit and data if and when they had anything to send. And of course Cheryl Coleman. She was the museum's eye and ears. And technically the boss. Cheryl looked to McWaters. \"Where do we stand, Bob?\" \"Max said we should be in the lagoon within the next day or so. After that we can begin.\" Ness looked up from his notes. \"Do you know what a find this could be? After all these years. Another form of humanoid life!\" McWaters nodded \"Just remember though, this creature did not like visitors. And there were not too many people that came back alive from any expedition to this part of the world.\" Cheryl raised a blond eyebrow \"Your not getting nervous are you Bob?\" McWaters smiled at Cheryl \"No, but I do have a healthy respect for the unknown. And not to put too fine of point on it. I'd like to get home alive.\" Any further discussion was cut short by the sound of the boat's horn blasting. The team went up on deck. Max was pointing to the tributary that they were heading. \"We are on our way, folks.\" Max said as they turned off the main river. As the boat started down the tributary, another boat slowly came into view and followed them at a discrete distance. But what both boats did not realize was they were being watched from under the water. The creature had felt the vibrations of the boats engine. And watched with interest, and anger. As the two boats sailed by, the creature slipped into the water and followed. For three more days, the boat continued down the small tributary. It seemed to all on board that the jungle was growing thicker and starting to block out the sun. Then the tributary opened out into a vast bay. Max blew the boat's horn. Everyone came out on deck. \"Here we are one and all.\" Max announced proudly \"The Black Lagoon.\" To be continued: ","Summary":" Creature: A Creature From the Black Lagoon story.

I just own this. Please let me know what you think of my first little foray into this franchise. Kay's Memories. She had known from the moment they had left the region the Black Lagoon was located in that it would only be a matter of time before the Gill-Man popped up again in her mind. But in the meantime, she had tried hard to bury the memories she had of that amazing, terrifying creature. But that hadn't stopped the nightmares that continued to haunt her. One of her worst nightmares was the blend between talking to Dr Thompson and then the Gill-Man's terrible gurgling screech as it grabbed hold of his face, threatening to tear his skin to shreds. What made that particular nightmare terrifying was it took place at night, just like it had in reality when they'd managed to drug the Gill-Man sufficiently to place it in an improvised cage onboard the Rita. But the nightmare she had was she hadn't thrown a lantern at the head of the Gill-Man instead, it had simply killed Dr Thompson while she had been too terrified to move or even scream, and it dragged her under the surface of the lagoon. Kay shook off the shiver she felt as she remembered the nightmare, and glared at the newspaper that lay on her lap. She had been out of the country for a while, so she hadn't heard the latest news, and that included radio and TV. She had a long-standing subscription to the local newspapers to deliver the papers to her home whenever she was on an expedition. What she had read shook her to the core. The Gill-Man had been taken from the Amazon all the way to an aquarium in Florida. Later the creature had escaped, killing the keeper responsible for its welfare, and it disappeared into the ocean. Later it began stalking a young woman, an ichthyologist called Helen Dobson. It later abducted her from a seaside restaurant where a party was going on. Helen was later rescued, but the creature was shot by the police. Kay doubted the Gill-Man was dead - David and Carl had thought they had killed it before they had left the Lagoon, after all, but they had seen that the Gill-Man was strong enough to resist a drug that made other fish float to the surface. Kay sighed as she read the newspapers for what seemed like the tenth time and wondered if the Gill-Man would ever be left alone. She closed her eyes, thinking…. She could understand why the Gill-Man had stalked this Helen Dobson, just like it had stalked her so long ago when she, David, Mark and Carl had travelled to the Black Lagoon in search of fossilised remains. The Gill-Man was lonely. Who knew how long it had lived in that part of the Amazon? Did it once have a family, and if so what had happened to them? But the simple reason it had been lonely for god knew how long did not excuse its actions, she could still remember the dead bodies that cropped up in its wake, and she remembered the savage way the Gill-Man had almost torn Dr Thompson's face to pieces. She could understand desperation, but every time they had tried to escape on the Rita, the creature refused to let them go. Kay wondered what the Gill-Man was doing right now, wondering if it was still alive….. part of her hoped it was still alive even after being dragged from its home in the Amazon river and taken all the way to Florida. She understood why science wanted the Gill-Man; it was a humanoid creature, it had a body suited for life underwater, with webbed feet and hands, it could breathe underwater and it probably had abilities they hadn't even seen yet. She remembered how she had talked to David and Carl after their ordeal in the Amazon. When the expedition was arranged to track the rest of the fossil after that hand had been discovered, David had lectured an entire hall of people, including herself, about how humans had just gone into space and they might need to find a way to adapt their bodies by studying fish and other aquatic species. David probably wasn't the only person to think that way. There were probably dozens of scientists who had spent a lot of time working out the best way of making humans live in space without any ill effects, and they had turned to the underwater world for inspiration. Fish were too far separated from humans, but the Gill-Man was similar enough to humans for scientists to learn how to do it properly. Kay frowned as she remembered how their encounter with the Gill-Man had virtually torn the somewhat shaky relationship Mark and David shared, a rivalry that she had been in the middle of, much to her chagrin. Mark had been a good man, she knew that, but she had found his growing obsession when they had been trapped in the lagoon tiresome. He had treated the whole expedition as a hunting trip, and his desire for fame had become even more transparent as their fight to get out of the lagoon went on. But just because he had been mad didn't mean he hadn't been a good man at heart, and she hated what happened to him. Kay pushed those memories aside, memories of what had started out as another seemingly easy expedition to locate fossils before they had turned into a nightmare. She cursed the idiots who'd kidnapped the Gill-Man from his lagoon and taken him to Florida where they poked and prodded him in a series of experiments to get an idea of how intelligent he was, underestimating just how dangerous he could be. She wondered if the Gill-Man was still alive, she hoped so. When she had encountered him, she had seen two sides to his nature which were both conflicted. On the one side, the Gill-Man was a savage, merciless killer who went after anyone who got in his way, and on the other side, he was a more sympathetic, lonely character. Besides, the Gill-Man had survived all kinds of hardships over the years - he had been drugged, kidnapped, shot, hit with a spear gun…. If he could survive any of those once, he could survive being electrocuted, forced to live in cruelly chlorinated water, and then shot again. Kay looked out of the window, already dreading the next time she would once more hear of the Gill-Man. ","Summary":" I don't own Creature from the Black Lagoon. I just own this.

As always all rights to the storyline and backgrounds of the Creature belong to its creators. The Story: Tales of the Creature still being alive has circulated and a team is going hunting. Rated M for some sexual action and violence The research boat continued down the tributary. The team started to gather their equipment as Max slowly guided them down stream. The deeper in they traveled, the closer the jungle seemed to be. It was almost as if the trees were closing in to envelope then in a green shroud. Suddenly the river led into a large bay that spread out in front of them. Max called out. \"There it is my friends.' He said \"The Black Lagoon. We are the first craft here in the last 50 years.\" Everyone looked around. The first thing they noticed was the burned out hulk of another boat not unlike their own. Cheryl pointed and asked. \"Who were they?\" \"The last boat that came up here.\" Max said. The rest of the team looked to Max. \"I never said they came back alive.\" McWaters grunted at that last comment. \"Nice to know.\" The boat pulled up next to the remains of a dock. \"Ok, people\" Cheryl said. \"We have arrived. James and Tim will set up shop in that clearing up there. We can work over there and sleep here on the boat.\" The team started to gather their gear and make their camp. The other boat stayed out of sight two miles downstream. The crew quickly camouflaged the boat, and quietly set up their own camp. Meanwhile under the surface of the river, the Gill-Man watched what was happing with growing anger. There were these intruders in his territory; the creature felt the lust for their blood growing. That would come later. As the research, party was setting up their camp. Max Jessup was looking back toward the tributary was interest. \"Anything interesting, Max?\" McWaters asked him. Max frowned and looked back downstream. \"Not sure.\" He replied. \"But I thought I heard the sound of another engine.\" McWaters took the binoculars and looked himself. \"If there's anything out there, then they don't want to be seen.\" Max nodded grimly. \"People have spoken of hidden treasures and gold in this part of the river for centuries, my friend.\" He warned. \"I would keep one eye open for trouble.\" McWaters looked back to the camp as he saw Cheryl heading for the back bay with a towel. \"Trouble, old friend?\" he quipped. \"That I already have.\" Max chuckled; \"Yes I can see where she would be.\" Cheryl headed for the small back bay and quickly stripped of her clothing and jumped in the water and started to swim. She swam to the far bank stopped and cam back taking her time swimming back, she did not realize that she had company on her swim. The creature followed her movements below the surface fascinated by the young woman's motion. He started to move toward her when he detected motion from the shore. \"Excuse me Lady Godiva.\" McWaters said is a sardonic tone. \"Base camp is set up and we should have satellite hook-up in 10 minutes. Cheryl chuckled and walked out of the bay. McWaters turned round quickly. \"Oh my god, Mac.\" Cheryl said. \"It's not like you haven't seen the territory before.\" \"True .\" McWaters said with a grin \"But that was then, this is now.\" Hmm.\" Cheryl said as she finished dressing. \"You say we'll have satcom in 10 minutes?\" \"That's right.\" he replied. But there may be issues being this deep in for continuous links.\" \"Ok, Cheryl said \"We'll see how thing rock.\" As the left for the camp they did not notice the Gill-man slowly rising out the of bay.

The man she loved had just vanished. She was so confused. How could he just leave her like that. Now she had no one. Jonathan had left with the company the night before and Richard was who knows where. She was stuck at The Grand Hotel with nowhere to go and no one to turn to. Wherever Richard had gone, she wished she could've gone with. --------------------------------------------------- Three Years Later 1915 Elise McKenna Collier Hayden never thought she could love again. But then she met William. About three years earlier, Elise had discovered that she was with child. She didn't know what to do. She was pregnant and alone. But like I said, then she met William. He was nice, smart, handsome, and he didn't care that she was carrying another man's child. She didn't love Will like she loved Richard, but Richard jr. needed a father. Just Six Months after she met Will, he proposed to her. She was still not over Richard but accepted thinking of the baby. Just after they were married, Elise explained to Will that she couldn't be with another man. William understood having lost his wife to another man the past year. They both agreed to remain married, but thought of eachother more as brother and sister. Richard still of course needed a father. Richard Jr. was almost two and a half and as healthy as ever looking just like his father. ----------------------------------------------------- 1979 Richard Collier couldn't believe what had happened. He was sure he checked his pockets before he left. He was almost positive. Elise McKenna was the love of his life. He knew that they were meant to be together. She was amazing. As he sat by the the window of his hotel room, all he could see was Elise. All he could remember was their last few hours together. It all kept replaying in his head. He had tried to go back but the first trip had taken too much out of him. All he wanted was to see Elise one last time, just to say goodbye. If he gotten to hold her and kiss her and tell her that he loved her one last time. At the moment he was remembering the last time that he had held her in hi arms. it was just after their lovemaking. She looked at him with her beautiful brown eyes and told him that she never wanted to leave his side. That had almost brought him to tears, knowing that someone could love him that much. Now all it was, was a memory. ---------------------------------------------------- Three years later 1982 Richard was exhausted. He honestly felt like he hadn't slept in three years. He knew he should be over her. He knew he should've been over her a long time ago, but he just couldn't let go of her, not yet. About three years previous, he had almost died. He had been right on the brink of death. He was sure he would've died and almost wishes he had, if it hadn't been for the blasted doctor. He got there just in time to get enough oxygen into him. Right at this very moment, he was reading the paper, looking more at an article that he felt drawn to so he started reading. The article was titled, William Hayden Dead at Age 96. Wow he thought, that's old. the article read: William J. Hayden, age 96 was found dead at his home in Chicago yesterday. Hayden didn't appear to have any physical wounds so it was assumed that he had just died of old age. Hayden's wife, Elise Mckenna Collier Hayden, died in 1979, peacefully in her home. (A/N I didn't know if she died at Mrs. Roberts house or if she died in a hotel room) Their son, Richard Collier II, age 69 is currently living in Springfield in a small cottage. M.T. Jensen Oh My Gosh thought Richard. I can't believe Elise got married. And she had a son. What he didn't know was that, that very son was looking for him at that very moment. -------------------------------------------------- A/N I knowe really weird but I wanted a plot twist. Disclaimer : Somewhere in Time Belongs to Richard Matheson and Jannot Swarc. I own nothing. I wish I did so I could cahnge the ending though. Based on The Novel Bid Time Return By Richard Matheson The next chapter should be out in the next week. RandR! Thanks! WL700[Chapter 2] A/N Hey everyone, I don't know if anyone out there remembers this story but I am in the process of wirting and getting chapter 2 up on the site. If you're still with me, thanks, and if not, I understand. Thank you, CarolineElizabethLautner Formerly, WingardiumLeviosa007[Chapter 3] A/N: I'm so sorry that this has taken so long. I wrote this chapter two years ago but I misplaced it and just found it when I was cleaning my room. I also want to say that i don't know how old Richard is supposed to be in the movie, so I am just going to say 30, so in 1982 he would be 33. 1982 Richard Collier Jr. was on the hunt. At 69 years old, that was relatively risky considering that the person that he was hunting for was his father. his 33 year old father. Now Richard Jr. found this whole idea pretty unbelievable and insane and would honestly have rather just left the issue alone, but he promised his mother, on her deathbed, that he would look for his real father. 1982 Richard Collier was confused. Why would Elise name her son with another man after him? Did she mean to torture him? To remind him of what could have been if he would only have emptied his pockets? All he wanted to do was lie on his bed and go back to her. But he knew he couldn't. He knew that the impact would likely kill him, and to tell the truth, he would rather be dead than without Elise. 1979 Elise Mckenna COllier Hayden was contemplating the way that she would tell her son about his father. But really, how do you tell your son that his father is younger than him, about 30 years in fact. He would likely stop believing his mother and claim that she was insane. This could be a difficult journey, but if it meant Richard meeting his son, it was well worth it. So I'm really sorry this is so short. I am facing a little bit of a block as to how Richard should meet his son. If anyone has any ideas, please review.. Thanks! CarolineElizabethLautner (Prev.

How he'd fallen for her just from that picture-that picture that was taken when she was looking at him-so many things that she left behind with him-the strange mystery behind everything. How he'd later return the watch to her-how he had introduced her to his favorite music-her very essence-her laughter-and her touch oh her touch-to finally reach and feel her smooth cheek to brush his fingers along her face and feel the warmth when the blood rushed to it-it was so different he felt at awe whenever he could touch her to hold such beauty in his arms-her kiss-their first kiss how she had felt against him-the way she said his name \"Mister Collier\" and how he'd convinced her to say his first name...how she'd whispered it when they had made love that night several times that night. She was more than a dream come through- she was the love of his life. Their love was something that had transcended through time- She had approached him begging him to come back to her-she had waited for him-\"love is patient….\" She made him go mad –He was crazy enough that he almost starved himself to death but they were able to revive him-that's when he came to his senses…she had patiently waited for him…he would return to her again-he would find a way she had been an obsession –but now, she was his life-and their lives were meant to be entwined together they how they were meant for each other. - As she had changed his life and the first words that she had said to him \"is it you?\" And later on when he'd gained her trust and when she no longer was afraid of him-everything about her had drastically changed him made him- he wouldn't let her sink into that despair-how she had become subdued lost all the energy, vivacity, fun and charm-quit everything that made her her-including her acting.

She recalled seeing him for the first time-dressed in his suit it would've seen humorous if not for it had heightened her fantasy of finally meeting him the man who William had told her about-who would changer her life- who all her life …unknowingly she had searched for-those clothes reminded her that maybe he was from a different time altogether- come to save her from what had become a dreary and somewhat predictable life. His soothing voice-had once scared her claiming to know her-his forwardness- he'd danced with her and her not knowing him she had tried to politely decline- his soothing way of asking her to \"please stay\"… his quiet insistence and finally convincing her when he said \" you have no idea how far I've come to be with you\" his different speech all together And when he told her there's no need to be afraid of me-it was him staring into her eyes and knowing her thoughts… He was such a pleasant looking man and intriguing and also she went along with him outside she wouldn't have done this if not for William being so determined to keep him away from her-he had peaked her interest and something else-something about him there was an intensity and it began to send a shaft of light and thaw the icy confines of her heart. Her heart…it was no longer hers it was with him-she could no longer do the things she used to do without feeling the loss. It took only 2 days that had seemed like a lifetime…that walk together she was in pure joy- she didn't recognize the unreserved girl she was with him how she laughed freely enjoying his company or how quickly she had grown comfortable around him –and the kiss they had shared later in her room … What had happened to \"excess within control\" something was missing- or someone…someone caring for her fully and loving her-it had come to her so quickly -so suddenly-she didn't know how to describe it-her confession and discovery came rushing to her lips at the stage...at the play of all places…it was the first time that she had poured it out- and it came over her with such an intensity… she never knew that she could even express them. Richard Collier -he had given her so much in such a short time-and had taken so much in that period as well... he had been to good to be true… he had found her-saved her then was so swiftly wrenched from her life he had taken a part of herself with him and because of it she would be forever hollow. The pocket watch ticked on…the only actual testimony of his time with her… time that now stretched on…reminding her of its emptiness…. . her cries shook hr body and pityingly sobbed… \"my love where are you-please come back to me-why'd you disappear- my heart i have inquired about you everywhere-no one has ever head of you- the great playwright Richard Collier-I've made up my mind to travel to Chicago-I know our love will help us find another even if it takes forever…..\" And that's where the dream soothed her…albeit momentarily she relived their memories together and the joyous hours before tragedy struck[Chapter 3] So I'll be continuing this story, due to a request from an old friend :) So yeah this isn't my usual style/ or pairing but I really do love this movie and these characters from Somewhere In Time I guess it's not for everybody but ya'll should check it out...If you guys liked Kate/Leopold or just movies about time travels you'll def like the movie. I actually jotted all this (the story) down waaay back but never was confident enough to post it online don't worry I haven't fogotten my other fanfic will post by tom hopefully. Rated: T Warning: Smut (yeah don't judge this was from like three years ago? I only got back to it now the whole thing sorta embarrasses me a little so just..bear with me please. And that's where the dream soothed her…albeit momentarily she relived their memories together and the joyous hours before tragedy struck He ran to her hearing her call him. She hadn't left him. He leaped down skipping the steps hurling towards her…and as he picked her up and hugged her not wanting to let her go-he was the happiest he'd ever felt knowing that they were united again and that no one and nothing would keep them apart. She looked as shaken as he did. He asked if she was alright trying to comfort her kissing her slowly, lovingly pouring into her his love… overcome with passion he unwillingly broke off and stared dizzily into her eyes seeing the desperation, the longing reflected in hers. He kissed her again and held her close as they walked arm in arm to the hotel. RPOV Slowly she leads the way and I am slightly unaware of where we are going, just following her steps before I know it am standing in front of Elise's room, wasn't it just several hours ago I thought I'd never see here again and that I had to get going and tell as well as show her how I felt- and how she had yielded herself to me-how I finally saw that she felt the same way… remembering what had happened between then and now so much had happened. I feel so undeserving of this moment- she opens the door and walks in ahead she lets go of my hand and I stare open-mouthed as she gives me a lovingly reassuring smile and she frees her hair from its confines-my heart is fit for bursting her beauty her radiance, the happiness written on her face is all I can see all I want to remember…I had seen her hair down when I'd asked her to walk with me-it was like seeing her at her very essence \"you're so beautiful\" I dare to whisper but those words cannot cover what it feels like having her here in front of me loving her and her returning my love. She flushes and I slowly close the door-then I approach her. Cupping her face into my hands feeling her pulse-I skim my hand across her cheek her eyes flutter close I lean in and kiss her on her eyelids reveling in the tickly feeling of her lashes, her temple, her ears she shudders lightly as I wanting to taste her creamy skin boldly take her earlobe into my mouth and suck it then I move towards her nape and leave a trail of kisses from her neck to her jaw line grazing it a little with my teeth and stopping to lick and suckle and start moving lower… I see goose bumps and I smile to myself for she has started murmuring \"oh my god\" over and over again I hear my name somewhere amongst them and then she lets out between gasps \"Richard I love you\"…and it causes my insides to melt-I realize that we are still hovering around the entrance what am I doing?\" Shit\"-I unwillingly move away cursing myself- she deserved more than this she is the love my of life I can't just mount her anytime, anywhere –with that thought in mind I adjust my coat a bit to hide my already growing erection. \"Richard?\" she looks taken aback by her behavior as well as mine-I turn red under her stare furious with my lack of self-control she was just so soft and…curse the weakness of man! hmmm that line it ought to be in a play… maybe it was my thoughts were so muddled, so loud at the moment….but around them the silence stretches longer till her voice, her talking fills the void. \"Richard my love, what's the matter…?\" \"Elise…\" EPOV \"Richard my love, what's the matter…?\" She looked at him he looked angry had she done anything wrong..? \"Elise…\" Until that moment everything had been going well-perfectly even she felt as though she was wrenched from a dream his kiss alone would be the death of her –it had loosened her tongue and made her feel a certain warmth spread and a peculiar wetness down there she throbbed in new had never known such bliss…but then he halted and until then he kept quiet and tentatively asked him-her height was dissipating it was being replaced by fear-and rejection? But then he said her name-his faced was screwed up like he was experiencing some pain I approached him to soothe him but he hastened backwards-I felt my lip tremble as I felt things go awry-what was happening? 'I don't understand –was it me-have I done anything wrong?\" Richard looked a bit shocked at my statement then shook his head \"no, my love it's me-I'm sorry I apologize if you feel violated-I didn't mean to take advantage of you in anyway-I love you too-I will never love anyone as much as I love you- \"I don't quite comprehend what it is that you are stating…\" \"Please listen-I can wait for you-I lost control-I'd say I was mesmerized by your beauty but I can't blame you for this it's really my doing-my lust taking control… \"Your? he sighed and adjusted his position I only noticed the strange lump-I had felt it poking me…oh I'm so naive that a simple kiss could lead to \"oh-\"I'm rendered somewhat speechless. I was a virgin but being an actress from a young age had exposed me to things I'd never be able to see or know of if I had stayed at home with my parents. The older actresses would always share a secret or two with me-at first they would *shush* each other but the I never complained-I've always had a mind that was constantly in search of new things…I had dismissed such information as useless and supposedly forgotten it- but surprisingly it had just stayed stored in the back of my brain- little did she know it would come useful. Richard was the man of her dreams-she must remember the first few lines –he was a man with certain needs-he was blaming himself no wonder he looked so miserable he thought that he was taking advantage of her…like she hadn't done anything to encourage him, or tried to prevent the heated kiss. Oh his skilful lips… she should be ashamed of herself, a respectable woman. But she knew that even though he was a man-he wasn't just any other man-he was her Richard he would stay by her come what may, his concern for her made her love him more if that was even possible, she was also relieved that he hadn't suddenly changed his mind And she flushed she couldn't take her eyes of his lump-he wasn't rejecting her, in fact he was trying to control himself. \"Excess within control\" at suddenly hearing William's voice in her head, she shuddered not deliciously this time no, she didn't want that, or him. He was a man who tried to control her, reign in her happiness, dominate over her…though he was good mentor and he had done wonders to her career-she didn't want to be in control with everything she wanted to be-free to be herself and to be loved by someone who saw her really saw her-he had said he loved her too would he show her how much he loved her? He was still explaining himself-he was facing the wall and he was seating on the edge of her bed as far away from her as possible she quietly approached him his head was in his hands he had discarded his coat and his shirt was unbuttoned…she wrapped her arms around him and her lips though they were trembling for she wasn't used to these things, she pressed them softly then firmly to his cheek-felt the friction of his growing hair around his face-what he had tried to shave the other day \"What're-Elise!\" he weakly protests. then she found his lips effectively silencing his protests. He was responding albeit hesitatingly-she was making him lie on his back-she tried what he had been doing to her she kissed him underneath his strong jaw she tasted and smelt the tang of him salty and clean smelling…he was gasping clearly she was doing something right he was holding her nape her hair but not to hurt her but she sensed he was experiencing inner turmoil- he was both pulling her closer and away from him…she lay not completely on top of him for she was kneeling but he moved her legs to be on either side of him so that she was straddling him and she felt him groan cause she was directly on top of his erection, he unconsciously moved his hips upwards she felt a surge of pleasure in her—but then he rolled them over \"Elise please I'm trying to be a gentleman here-but you're making it difficult my resolve is at its breaking point-I said I love you and you don't need to do this for me-especially when you're not ready \" he started to firmly but gently push her away… \"Richard love. You don't understand I'm not doing this for you\" \"You're not?\" \"I'm doing this for me-for us and our love\" \"We have forever my love…I don't want to rush things.\" Richard had moved of her and lay beside her on the bed he gathered her into his arms her head lay across his chess she could hear his steady heart beat \"This act of making love… Richard I never ever thought of doing it-for I'd never found that man who really loved me though many men claimed they did but Richard now that you have come to me, I've finally found the man I would love-the one I'd spend forever with- I knew then I would give myself wholly and fully to this man. And it is you.\" I felt extremely vulnerable overcome by my emotions now it was my turn to face the other way but then I feel his hands cupping my face and start to brush away the tear that unknowingly freely flowed with his thumb \"look at me blubbering-I look so unkempt\" \"no-your beautiful even when your crying-Elise love I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings-*sigh* there ,there please don't look so sad\" he took a cloth from the table made sure it was clean then handed it over to me. He held it while I blew my nose but my eyes were still a bit wet, he then proceeded to kissing my eye lids my cheeks my nose- to soothe me... \"I love you with all my heart do you know that and I'll make up for hurting your feelings\" he was whispering-his hot breath against my skin he looked so in control unlike me but his heart is thudding showing that he's feeling everything, that his emotions, sense are all intensely overwhelming like mine-but I felt the now familiar spiral towards pleasure and I braced myself awaiting his mouth on mine and when he finally did I kissed him with a need that came from feeling of wanting to be assured of his love… she felt in awe when he used his tongue she tentatively went along and soon they were both breathing raggedly-gasping for air they were no longer on their sides and his hand that had been behind my back had crept lower until it rested on my waist he was massaging it drawing circles on the thin fabric near the ribbons to her bodice-he looked at me with a question in his eyes it was a silent one but she answered it a loud-\"yes, Richard please show me you love me…please make love to me\". RPOV I had made her cry-I had hurt her man this was all so complicated-I'm not entirely chaste-I did have a girlfriend Shelly and we were together for ten years. But Shelly had cheated on me, what I felt for her was nothing near what I felt am feeling for Elise-but I'm hesitant It's funny I'd have jumped for this when I was so ruled by my teenage hormones-but not now…Elise is the love of my life, I have to treat her with respect, love and with gentleness. They were bathed with the little lights left by the candle –it's heat flickering but never wavering … He slowly started divesting himself of his clothes-till he had worked the remaining stiff buttons of his shirt and there he stood ready to take of his pants and he was only in his boxers…when he looked up to see her struggling with her skirts he swallowed she had gotten rid of the outer most layer her face was red with the exertion her hair was disheveled…she was- so perfect \"here let me…\" EPOV She had only made the knots worse she looked up to say decline… and blushed harder when he approached her he had a well-defined torso and chest…his arms and legs had just a little bit of hair…not too much to be called hairy no too little to be called bald-he was perfect…she sighed she was down to her pantaloons- \"I'm sorry Marie ties my knots so complicatedly…\" \"nah it's just like unwrapping a present\" his hands so big firm and just a bit calloused deftly pulled at a choice string and it came away- exposing her his eyes scanned her up and down taking in her beautiful skin her form \"perfect\"-he murmured - just under her thin chemise a thin see through cloth to cover her breasts, her nipples peaked when the cold air hit them and when his thumb grazed it-and as he reverently brought his hands to them - she couldn't help the sound that came from the back of her throat. \" this is one hell of a present-oh Elise you're absolutely perfect\" while his other hand traveled lower beneath the petticoat and raised her knee over his hip- touching, cupping her full warm mound caressing them-titillating her sensitive peaks. He kissed her again harder as he sucked her lower lip and slowly licking a line down her throat and to her cleavage he buried his face there *what a glorious feeling* wherever he touched he followed with his lips and tongue, he proceeded to her nipple and she all but lost it there and then when he took her quivering hard tip into his mouth and he grazed his teeth over it. He paid equal attention to both breasts and blew hot breath \"oh\" she moaned and pressed his head harder he then lead her to a sitting position she was on his lap, both her legs around him. He could feel her heat- her moistness. He was so hard, she was grinding onto him and he was grinding back his hand moved further down and found her moist heat- there where she was aching with desire to be touched-his hand working expertly he slid a finger in and started stroking her tortuously, slowly... intense pleasure surging through her making her buck on his hand \"oh Richard\" he covered her moth with his lips he took a peek at her face her mouth slightly open but she looked intensely happy-his pleasuring of her was enough for him but he had to make her come-decidedly he got to laying her on her back again her legs spread wide on either side of him-\"beautiful\" he whispered to her ear –he then grabbed her earlobe and tugged it with his teeth he explored its confines and down below he had slid another finger deeper ever so gentle but still his inhibitions grew quicker stroking her faster demanding something and she soon found out-the earth-shattering climax she was blinded by the pleasure as he didn't let up until she had come twice the other more powerful than the last-during the latter she had grabbed at him sank her teeth and bit him on his shoulder-crying out his name-blinding light toe curling ecstasy. But somehow she still it wasn't done…it was his turn now she was still in need she was empty she longed to be filled-she reached down between them he stilled her he was gasping painfully at the effort \"Elise if you don't want to…we can stop-\" she held his throbbing member still in the confines of his boxers-just feeling her small hand warm hand around his thick length would've made him come but he had to do this for her-he moved her hand though his penis protested but kicked of his shorts and it stood proudly… She sat up Elise took it all in *oh my-he's huge* 'honey-this will hurt-but it'll wear off and then I'll make you feel so good-Elise my love please tell me when to stop it'll be hard but I will-the last thing I want to do is cause you any pain\" She only responded by laying back down, he placed a soft tender kiss on her forehead, then her lips before he moved between her legs. She arched upwards loving the feeling his hard chest against hers he stilled her holding her hips, he expelled a great breath and started to thrust slowly-and almost stopped completely. Her body was tensing up. \"Elise Please...look at me.\" he murmured ever so softly,comfortingly trying to get her to relax. Her eyes shut tight in concentration, perhaps fear, he felt it gripping at his heart. She finally did encountering his eyes telling her all that she knew already... of his love and she remembered her complete trust in him. Richard saw and felt the change as she eased up a little and then he finally met her barrier, he kissed her and in a swift thrust he had taken her virginity. *man she was so tight* He was fighting the urge to ride her-tears were sliding down her eyes he kissed them, then her mouth enjoying the salty taste-her body adjusted the pain started wearing off and the need returned distracting and overwhelming \"I'm alright now my love…\"her eyes consuming drowning him-she then arched herself against him and like an unspoken command, he slid himself deeper filling her completely wonderfully. He pulled out again and slowly entered again-he did this a few more times setting a steady rhythm slowly first and then he started to go faster. He was cupping her nicely shaped bottom making sure she was deeply seated-and that none of his length would go to waste-he used all of him to pleasure her… it unleashed in her a molten heat that made her wrap her strong legs around him. \"oh Shakespeare -Romeo- hamlet-king leer\" she muttered her mutters becoming louder and louder as he thrust rapidly he was holding her by her hips guiding her to his rhythm and hitting just right spot \" Shakespeare's characters are all fine but what about me?\" Richard grunted out laughingly, \"oh-oh yes you're divine\" \"just may be so –\" He momentarily stilled and pulled out causing her to give a cry of protest-but the tune changed to altogether as he thrust himself back in as he began to pound hard into her with every word he uttered\"I-want-you-to-shout-my-name-loud-when-you-come\" making her cry out- and within her came the escalating need that kept building up and even as she thought she would burst from this- his fingers once again played with her most sensitive nub and he pinched her, there she came violently. She was wracked with such intense pleasure, all she saw was blinding light, the waves have broken over her as it rushed out of her body flailing widely \"Richard\" she moaned helplessly, \"louder\" he gasped out, \"Richard\" she keened, as he impossibly picked up the pace, \"Louder!\" He was wracked with sweat with the efforts of holding back as she clenched his length \"OH My-RICHARD!\"she finally screamed, He couldn't hold back any longer at the sound of his name being screamed out of her lips. He rode out through the last of her tremors before he sobbed his own release\"ELISE!\" shooting his hot seed into her he then collapsed his strong arms finally giving out –not breaking the connection he rolled so that she lay on top of him he kissed her head and played with her hair he was humming Rachmaninoff again… He pulled a sheet over them relishing in their heat-and through the man she love's voice she was falling asleep…but she pushed through the cobwebs of unconsciousness baring on her. She just wanted to look at him some more, not wanting this perfect, beautiful night to end just yet. \"Hmmm my love?\" she whispered, meeting his eyes feeling the slow smile stretch across her own face in respond to his. \"yes love?\" he says softly, tenderly. \"I don't want to sleep yet\" you get out, \"What your still not done?\" he says humor lacing his tone. \"No-Yes \" she blushed realizing the joke of the question…\"I don't want to wake up and find that it was only a dream\" she confessed, an irrational fear of abandonment. \"I never realized that Miss Elise McKenna could have such vivid dreams…\" his tone was teasing but he sensed the distress….\"I won't leave you I'll be here when you wake up I promise.\" And he lifted her chin upwards cradling her as if she was an infant or something fragile he kissed her softly-lovingly… \"Or so I won't have to miss you we could use this time wisely...\"she left off suggestively \"Miss McKenna I'm astonished! Give me 15 minutes rest first okay it's surprisingly hard and draining, it's sort of like experiencing a certain kind of madness with you…a good kind-but highly addicting but once I'm fully recharged -then you'll see what's waiting for you.\" She wanted to reply but her happiness at its height was so draining, she felt her lids grow heavier and heavier. As sleep nearly took over her-she asked one final question \"how come you were able to undo my knots they were so complicated-and it took you one pull and all unraveled…\" \"if there's a will there's a way…well anyway I was in the boy scouts\" \"oh…that explains a lot-but were they just established last year?\" \"Shush sleep my love-I'll wake you up when it's time\" a few minutes later…. She woke up to him nuzzling her breasts…\"you love them don't you\"- \" no I love you every part of you-they just look, feel and taste so perfect…I want to give you everything cause you have given me all that I could ever want-let me show you my gratitude\" Elise willingly gave up herself to her desire-she held the back of his head loving the feel of his hair in her hands…the way his blue eyes smouldered how he wanted her to be first, in everything…not really taking in that he was moving lower and gasped with belief when he placed himself directly in front of her –he bent her knees up and moved and placed tentative kiss down there she gasped at the sensation but she grew dizzy when he latched his mouth on to it and entered his hard tongue\" mm you taste so good\" she was shivering his hot breath down there sending pleasure signals thru ought her body-his tongue was driving in and out and his fingers parted her folds so he could \"dear god-oh' he licked her devoured her-enjoying her taste the sounds she made... Elise closed her eyes thinking she was in heaven or the closest she'd ever been, fully enraptured, thinking, and feeling like she was dying... after she had reached completion once again. She drifts away into sleep and rest, looking into her loves eyes, if she'd die at the moment she wouldn't have minded. It was pretty morbid, but she couldn't think of a better way to pass...feeling satiated, happy, content, and complete in the arms of her one true love. 1972 Elise She started to close her eyes-and leaned back into her chair she sat in her room in the Grand Hotel reserved room the window on looking the view of where they had walked-and where she had started to fall for him she had waited for him for so long-and when she heard of a Richard Collier from Milfield College had written and staging a play called \"Too Much Spring\" when she had finally gotten chance to approach him… \"come back to me\" she had said it, her heart longing for him to take her in his arms or even to just recognize her…she didn't look like herself the beautiful youthful vivacious Elise McKenna. While him, after all these years, he was still the picture perfect handsome youth who came and left her forever changed. He was different though; she felt it as she searched his eyes for any form of recognition but didn't find any. He looked scared shocked and without recognition whatsoever…she felt the ache in her gut which had started even as she had watched him…move around with his girlfriend Shelly. He was so full of life chatting away with people supposed critics of plays…the play itself were beautiful the lead actress though lacked mystique. She would've been perfect for it, if she had auditioned she would've been chosen for it, it was rightfully hers She wondered why she had said those words but the she realized it was because -she couldn't say more for fear of him thinking her crazy-she knew all about the time travel she had read the book Travels Through Time several times-she had somewhat expected him not to know her-but it was different experiencing it first hand and worse not seeing the love for her in his beautiful blue eyes-her heart was weak it had been for the longest time but one thing kept it going strongly and steadily-to be able to see her love again and 60 years later she did…and even as she felt her heart beat reach its last she knew that she would wait for him still till he would come back to her and be hers once more…the last thing she saw as she drew her last breath was his face as he leaned over-she felt his kiss she smelt his natural man-scent and heard the sweet melody of Rachmaninoff….[Chapter 4] 1912 Elise She woke up gasping feeling a great loss a terrible dream-so strange her face was wet with tears she looked around scared where was Richard? There again was the panic clawing at her-she remembered the lost of breath\"Richard?\" she called aloud-standing up from the bed putting on the first thing she saw a discarded blouse and started buttoning it up she hear him before she saw him… \"Elise-come here my love\" he answered and she felt the surge of relief, gasped in delight. She gave a little laugh when she saw the picnic setting within her very room…not realizing that she was ravenous for food…she hadn't thought about anything else- being satisfied after last night \"I thought you'd be hungry after much of the physical-ahem activities of last night\"Richard comments like he had just heard her thoughts-recalling it made her shudder and go warm at the same time-his eyes didn't leave her and she couldn't take her eyes of off him neither his shirt lay unbuttoned his hair rumpled…her mouth went dry she wanted to kiss him… \"Good morning my one love-\" he gestured for her to sit down \"Marie helped me bring things up from your pantry…\" She took his hand and sat down across him-with his legs touching her thighs, she felt her heart quicken-she let out a calming shaky breath- she should learn to control this;her new constant longing for him. How would they ever leave this room? But she knew that it was because Richard was more than enough for her for forever-she could see him and her with their children they would be beautiful with his blue eyes. She could see them growing old together she could see the picture go so vividly so clearly she blurted out \"you will marry me won't you?\" he laughed which jolted her confidence, unwillingly doubts arose in her till he said \"sure\" and gave her his loving smile \"I'm just laughing at they way you asked, that's all\" The two so blissfully happy, ate and chatted like they had no where else to be, like they had the rest of their lives to worry about other things. They were content to spend the rest of their lives just like this- discovering each other-making up for lost time having so much to say to each other-and yet Elsie felt that she knew so little about him; no matter, they could change this and they had the time… \"Tell me more about yourself my love…\" he started to talk but she cut him off excited to know everything about him to inquire what could be inquired \"… what kind of plays do you write are there any parts for me-assuming that I want to act again after tonight…\" she says, feeling the heat rising to her cheeks at having admitted how she was feeling, the shade turning darker after, hearing the responding sound he made at the back of his throat...one that she immediately recognized. His hand cupped her face moved to her nape feeling her hair massaging her there with his fingers \"you will\" his tone sure answering her question. \"I want to be everything to you\" she replies a bit breathlessly, as his fingers stat caressing her, \"You are..\"he said once then repeated for emphasis \"you are\" before he leaned closer to her-he had been chewing on a piece of chicken she tasted it on his mouth her eyes close, as his lips moved with hers, she was sufficiently distracted before \"good plays-\" Richard says, \"What?\" she asks laughingly bewildered also a bit shocked that he had cut the kiss short teasing her \"I write good plays\" \"oh-I never gave you a chance to answer did i?\" Elise realizes, feeling a bit embarrassed at her prattling so, he smiles at her tenderly, and the nerves disappear... The two continue eating, occasionally asking each other questions...they had discovered each other in the barest sense last night, the details, their stories however...had yet to be cleared out... It seemed however that one of them knew much more than the other, \"How come you claimed to know everything about me…\" Elise asks, something that had unsettled her the first time she heard it, but now it seemed to apt. He truly was the only person to get to know her, who saw her as someone or something other than the star Elsie Mckena. Yes, he appreciated that part of her(which was understandable, being a theater person himself) but never once did he see that one portion of her as her entirety, Elise was confident he loved her simply as herself. \"I do…at least the facts…exactly where and when you were born...and other stuff.\" she smiles as this little speech, already somewhat used used to his different way of conversing \"but how do you know of it, is it like William's way of knowing things before they happened?\"Elise presses on, he seems agitated, she feels his body tense, \"I researched I mean...I asked about you…from where I come from...\" \"Chicago?\" \"Yes...\" he says, his eyes vacant, his thoughts elsewhere...as if he were someplace else altogether, for the fist time since last night she feels a shiver of foreboding pass through her. She brings his face to hers till their eyes meet, and he seems to come back. \"Your world and mine are different ones-Elise\" he says softly, Richard 1 month and 2 weeks had passed since his own disappearance...he had incessantly been researching about time traveling since his recovery, He was able to go back to 1912 for few seconds, long enough to see her sleeping...he left her the book and his heart as well. He leaned in to kiss her and her eyes fluttered open she looked thorough shocked, but then she smiled \"oh what a good dream-it's more real now.\" He knew he couldn't stay long and he didn't want for her to see him disappear again…so he kissed her lightly on her forehead left the book by her table side. \"Good night my love\" and fare well. I hope you find out how to work this soon-I'll see you very soon I pray. \" he was being pulled back he brushed his lips against hers before...he felt that familiar pull, \"Come back to me.\" he whispers, before he's back in his own study, groaning in pain, feeling weakened... \"Please...please...I can't live knowing I ruined your life...\" he says before he collapses. Elise woke up to a familiar ghost of a taste on her lips she put her fingers to them \"Richard..\" she whispered into the room as dawn crept in. She had such a wonderful but heartbreaking dream, it was a dream wasn't it? She couldn't allow herself even a shred of hope-but it was so real-his voice coming back what had he been talking about, he had laid something on her bedside table? She shook her head at herself \"Quit being ridiculous.\" she muttered, trying to suppress that surge of pain threatening to take over her, the exhaustion that had been enveloping her as of late. Then she saw the book and froze. That definitely wasn't there when she fell asleep last night. She jumped up, he had been there... it wasn't a dream but where was he now? She didn't need to search her rooms, she could've felt his presence. She had felt him kiss her. The loneliness threatened to overwhelm her, she took deep breaths to gather herself together. Had he come to give her more grief and what was the use of this book? She turned it over and saw the title \"Travels Through Time\" she then flipped to the first few pages-admiring how the paper was so fine. Till her eyes, landed on the publication date. She stared unwilling to believe what she was looking at until her hands shook till she nearly dropped it- then something else dropped out, a glossy piece of paper with a picture of...Richard... if the book, the paper, the fine photograph hadn't given indication that everything, all that Elsie knew, that she was sure of in this world was coming apart at the seams...the information on the paper about the man she had loved, but never truly known... certainly did... was this the answer to everything? She felt a wave of nausea (much more violent now) grip her she raced to her wash basin and felt the need to retch-she felt the pull in her belly then the sour taste before, she emptied all of her stomach's contents. When she was certain she was indeed finished, she looked at herself in the mirror sighing at her pale and tired countenance. \"What has fate have in store for you...\" Elise whispers aloud, William had offered her a new project, he sent it by way of a messenger boy. She couldn't bear to see him- how he would give a knowing monologue about being right about Richard …that was two days ago, today is... wait, she remembered something else that seemed inconsequential. She began counting back with her fingers and she breathed deeply when it dawned on her-the particularity in food, her stomach pains…she was sure of it -she was pregnant –and the child's father was a man who didn't exist yet.

University of Florida Nick Kowalski got out from biology class full of energy, he finally had aced the exam and soon he would be able to leave the university and try to find a job involving science. Has he walked through the door and into the university's garden he suddenly felt someone gently punching him in the arm \"Nick, my buddy how did you're exam go.\" Nick turned to see the face of a skinnie brown bearded young man, Max O'Neill, his childhoods best friend, he smiled and answered full of happiness in his voice. \"Excellent, it went perfectly, it was clean and simple, in other words I passed.\" Max smiled \"Perfect, so did I. Meaning we can go celebrate together.\" He looked at the University and screamed \"Goodbye University of Florida. Come let's go check with Mark and Spencer at the café, I agreed we would meet them there.\" Nick was glad to hear that. \"Let's not keep them waiting then shall we.\" They crossed the garden and then arrived at the complex of the university where the café was located. They could see Mark, a tall blonde muscular guy who looked like he was on steroids, and Spencer, a normal sized African-American with small beard and short standing up hair, sitting in one of the outside tables of the café. They looked at them, smiled and then waved them to come over. Nick and Max obliged, and sat next to them. \"So\" said Mark \"down to business, I managed to pass my exam with acceptable grades, and Spencer, like the genius he is, aced it with no difficulty whatsoever. And you too, by your faces I guess it went well.\" \"You guess correctly\" answered Max for the both of them. \"Then it's time to celebrate, bring out the alcohol and let's make a party.\" Said Spencer. \"Or maybe even something better.\" Said Mark. That picked everyone's curiosity, especially Nick's \"What do you mean by that?\" \"Oh it's a surprise I have arranged for all us, it's…\" \"Don't tell us yet.\" Said Spencer rather abruptly. \"Save it for when the girls are here, they deserve to hear it has the same time we do.\" Mark looked at him in a mocking way \"Ha Spencer, always the gentleman.\" That got Nick's attention. \"Wait, Sarah Palski is coming here.\" \"Yep\" said simply Mark. Nick felt heart race. \"Whoa cowboy\" giggled Max \"Calm down, don't get your heart racing. I mean seriously you've had a crush on this girl for what 2 years? You're 23 years old, she's 22, so you're both grownups, so when are you going to ask her out.\" \"When I can talk to her without thinking my heart is going to explode. Plus I'm not sure she is single, and what exactly is there to like about me.\" Max looked at him with shock on his face \"First off she's been single for two years now, second you're a great guy, not a perfect guy but a good guy, you're reasonably handsome, you're intelligent, funny on occasion and you have great morals, the only thing stopping you from going out with her is your own timidity.\" Nick smiled \"Thanks I guess.\" Mark suddenly raised himself from the table. \"Looks like we didn't have to wait long, here they are.\" They all turned and saw, Leticia Oliveira, a long brown curly haired young woman of Mexican origin, Jennifer Carter, a slim tall woman with long black hair, and finally Sarah Palski, an athletic looking young woman with short blonde hair which reached the underside of her neck. Sarah smiled \"Sorry for the delay boys, Jennifer and Leticia only just now learned they have passed and I was in the swimming pool training for a competition.\" She looked at Nick with a puzzled look. \"Everything alright, Nick.\" Nick heart started to race. \"Uh yes sure, I I I passed.\" She smiled \"Oh congratulations I'm happy for you.\" Nick blushed \"Uh thank you, I appreciate it.\" The three of them sat down, Leticia kissed Spencer, and Jennifer kissed Max. \"Mark has something to tell us baby.\" Said Spencer. That picked the three girl's curiosity. \"Really?\" asked Leticia. \"What is it?\" Mark looked at them, he crossed his arms, like a magician preparing himself to perform a magic trick. \"So you all know my father is on business in Brazil?\" They all nodded affirmatively. \"Well, I got a call from him. He asked if me, and a few friends would like to spend a interesting vacation together.\" He reached in his pockets and got seven plane tickets. Sarah took one of the tickets. \"Theses or for going to Brazil.\" Mark smiled \"Yep, more precisely what I had intended is for all of us to go to Brazil, in Rio de Janeiro, when we get there we can loan my father's private yatch, and navigate up river to see the legendary Amazon.\" They looked at him in amazement. \"Really?\" said Nick. \"See the Amazon, the real Amazon.\" \"I could use a vacation.\" Said Jennifer. \"And in a yatch.\"said Max. \"I'm in.\" \"So were all in agreement about this?\" asked Mark. \"Yes\" they all said. \"Then it seems we are going to Brazil and to the Amazon.\" Said Nick. … Amazon River Black Lagoon The sun shone above the trees and water of the Black Lagoon, it's reflecting on the murky waters of the lagoon. The water was calm with the Caiman crocodiles resting peacefully in the river banks, a reflect of the peace of nature. Suddenly a roar sounded through the trees, the Caimans fled quickly to the water and in the place where they had been resting before a giant scaly creature appeared, the Gillman. He once again roared signaling his triumph. Then he submerged himself in the water and swam thinking about the humans he had met so long ago. It was a different time back then, he lived peacefully in his lagoon, a king in his domain with no creature able to hurt him, the only thing missing from his life was a mate, he was had felt so alone, even then he had a good life. But then those humans came, and desecrated the remains of one of his kind, insulted by their presence he killed them, but one of them had already left and he brought others of their kind with them. Gillman would have drowned them all, if it hadn't be for the beautiful creature that came with them, the female of their kind. He remembered filling a proximity to her, a desire to have her, to touch her. He even was able to swim with her, she swimmed so gracefully that she may had even been one of his kind. He had decided there that he would take her to be with him, but then the males protected they hurt gillman with their weapons who shot bits of metal and their poisons. Finally Gillman had managed to catch the female and take her to his cave, he had though then that he had won, that she would be his, but then her mate came after her and defeated Gillman, then they left leaving Gillman for dead, it could have ended there. But then the humans returned and used poison to catch Gillman, make him sleep, take him to their home and chain him in a concrete habitat. He had felt so enraged at the humans for stealing his freedom, but then like before his rage and hatred was washed again when she came, a second human female that came and worked with another male to get him to obey them. Unfortunately for them Gillman was too strong and he broke free from his bonds and escaped to the sea. He could have simply gone home after that, but thoughts of the female kept haunting his mind, he couldn't leave without her. He found her with the same male who worked with her, and he followed them patiently watching them fall in love, which angered him, patiently waiting for an opportunity to take her with him back home. Then the right moment came and he took her, he fled with her fleeing from the humans but unfortunately once again her mate and the others of their kind found Gillman and took her from him, then hurt Gillman. Gillman fled into the water and almost died, but then he managed to hide and heal. He understood he couldn't face the humans in their own territory, so fled back through the sea, a task which took him years but he finely he reached his beloved home. But this time he felt more alone than ever. Has he thought about it he emerged from underwater and looked east, from where the humans had come from. Gillman knew it was only a matter of time before the humans returned here. And when they did Gillman would be ready for them. He would defend his home from them, but more importantly if they brought with them another female which would make him dizzy and create this emotion called love in him, then he would take her and this time he would succeed, because this time he knew the humans and this time they would be in his home, where he had the advantage.

Hope you enjoy it. … The Amazon was buzzing with activity, from the sound of insects flying to the monkeys jumping from branch to branch. However suddenly something that wasn't part of this wild scenery appeared. It was a large yacht gliding though the water, once in a while pushing away of trees which were hovering over the water. And in the boat all seven of the young adults, Nick Kowalski, Max O'Neil, Mark Smith, Spencer Johnson, Leticia Oliveira, Jennifer Carter, and Sarah Palski, were relaxing in the rear part of the Yacht, were the swimming pull was located. Nick kept watching the trees, he was amazed at the beauty of this land, and all the natural sounds from the animals fascinated him. It was very different from the concretes jungles they were used to. \"Look at all this, isn't it beautiful.\" He asked his friends. \"Indeed.\" Commented Max. \"Absolutely, look at all this green.\" Said Leticia. \"Whatever\" said a annoyed Mark. \"To me it all looks more shiny with a smoke of this.\" And he showed his cigarette. Nick felt a surge of annoyance and barely concealable anger. \"You shouldn't smoke that trash, what is it Marijuana or Cocaine?\" \"Cocaine\" Mark answered in a matter of fatly tone. \"Drugs, can destroy a person it rots your brain and lowers your mental functions. To the point you become nothing more than a drooling animal.\" Mark wasn't amused by that. \"Hey are you calling me an animal?\" he asked with a tone of clear anger and threat in his voice. \"No that's not what I said.\" Nick quickly answered. \"I'm just saying that its what you may become if you're not careful with that.\" \"Whatever man, you don't know what your missing.\" \"Forgiving me if I will not take the word of someone who failed several times in the university.\" Mark seemed he was about to say something unpleasant, but fortunately Spencer intervened. \"Alright you too, stop it. Nick, Mark's lifestyle is of no concern of yours, he is already an adult and vaccinated, so he can do what he wants with if life, even if you don't agree. And Mark, Nick has a right to his opinion and what he says isn't wrong, Nick knows better than most how drugs can destroy a person and those who surround them, you know them.\" Mark apparently remembered what Spencer was talking about, he looked at Nick whit an apologetic look. \"Sorry Nick I forgot how drugs can be a touchy subject for you.\" Nick answered kindly. \"No matter, it was a long time ago.\" \"I know you're just looking out for me Nick, but please I'm a big boy now and I can take care of myself.\" Nick looked at him whit a note of sadness in his voice. \"I know, I just don't want to fail my loved ones again.\" \"You won't I'll be careful I promise. Look I'm putting the cigar away.\" And that concluded the exchange. Spencer sat back next to Leticia, who whispered in his hear. \"I love it when you're the alpha male.\" He smiled and kissed her in the lips. Nick went to the roof of Yacht, were he continued to watch the jungle and thinking about his past, the argument had brought up many bad memories. Suddenly he heard someone climbing the metal ladder towards the upper deck behind him. His heart started racing when he saw it was Sarah, she looked so beautiful, and her golden hair contrasted with the green of jungle, giving her an angelic beauty. The fact that she looked worried in no way diminished her beauty. She spoke. \"I'm not intruding am I.\" Nick was paralyzed a moment, but he decided to speak quickly before he made a fool of himself. \"No… I mean uh no… no, not at all. I'll even vacate the spot if you want.\" She quickly replied with an embarrassed look. \"Oh no, no. God no, I'm not here to chase you away. Plus there is enough room for both of us isn't it?\" Nick smiled. \"Sure there is. You're always welcome.\" She smiled, and what a pretty smile it was. \"Good, I don't want to make you uncomfortable.\" \"Is there something you came here to do in particular?\" he asked hoping she wouldn't think he was prying. \"Actually I came to see if you were alright.\" \"What? Me? Why wouldn't I be?\" She sighed I noticed you seemed pretty upset with Mark. And then that reference about your past, the others seemed to know what Spencer and Mark were talking about, but I didn't.\" Nick though about how he could have been so stupid. Of course she didn't know about his past, she had only joined their group a short while ago, apparently nobody had told her. \"It's not something I like to think about.\" \"I'm sorry Nick, if that troubles you I'll go. Even if I'd like to know.\" That was one of the few times she called him by his first name, and he found he liked to hear it. \"No, no don't worry. I think it would do me good to tell to someone.\" She want from her worried look to her more relaxed look. \"So did you take drugs in your past?\" Nick quickly replied. \"No, God no. I was always warned not to touch that trash, and I've always been interested in sciences, so I was always aware of the dangers of drugs.\" She thought about that for a while. \"So I guess it was someone close to you.\" Boy, she was smart. \"Indeed, my little brother to be precise. Me and my mother and sister tried to warn him about the dangers, but the fool wouldn't listen. You see he fell in with the wrong crowd, began frequenting drugs dealers and thieves, and he became convinced he was smarter than all of us because he frequented the criminal underworld and therefore had a larger view of the world, he said he saw how the world really worked.\" Sarah looked horrified. \"Which is?\" \"Which is, he though in the real world people are always false. He though people always faked feelings and emotions to fool other people into doing things for them. He thought that in the real world there is no loyalty or love, just the need to care for number one.\" \"That's a pretty dark way to look at humanity.\" She said with disgust. \"Yes it is. And his friend thought also, they began leaving him one by one, once they realized he was seeing them more has tools to achieve is goals, rather than friends. However it didn't stop there he began coming back home drugged and drunk, he became savage and aggressive he overreacted with everything. Once he lost his cigars and he became completely mad, he began attacking the furniture and searching our rooms, thinking we had stolen them. Only to find out the cigars were actually inside his own bag, he didn't even apologize afterwards. He insulted my mother and my sister for no reason, has he began to see woman has inferior to man.\" \"What?\" she exclaimed, with a look full of revolt in her face. \"What kind of savage retard his this guy, you must be joking.\" \"Not at all, he began seeing woman has being only good for two things: preparing the meals and keeping the house clean, and for going to bed. He sees woman has sex objects which he can simply use than leave them, which might explain the fact that he is still a virgin.\" \"He is a virgin?\" she asked. \"Yes, actually he told me he had slept with a dozen woman, but he talked about it with such disdain, whit such banality, and he often spoke of them by using stereotypes and clichés from movies, which made me suspect it wasn't true. My suspicions were confirmed when one of his friends secretly told me, that my brother had admitted he had never been with a woman. So apparently he was just lying in an attempt to make me feel less of a man than him.\" She looked at him with a curious look in her eyes. \"Why would it make you feel like less of a man?\" \"Because I'm a virgin.\" \"Really, you're a virgin.\" \"Yep\" he replied without emotion. \"I don't feel ashamed by it. I just want to do it with a very special woman, its not that I'm unable to.\" He quickly replied. \"You've never been another woman?\" she asked. Nick wandered why did she want to know that. \"No, it's just I don't see the point in jumping from one woman to another. I mean I often see guys in the states bragging about how many woman they slept with, like if it was a competition, or to see who managed to be with the prettiest woman.\" \"And you don't agree with them?\" \"No I think people should only enter a relationship were both people genuinely care about each other. Someone you would be there for at all times, someone who smiles when she sees you and you smile back, even someone I would be willing to lay my life for her.\" Has he spoke this words he noted he was looking intensely at Sarah, she turned back her head to look straight into his eyes, but he quickly turned them away embarrassed. Oh God, he hoped she didn't think he was a wimp, talking about all that sentimental things. She smiled. \"That's a very positive attitude. To be honest I didn't expect you to be a romantic, I which more guys were like you. Too many men treat women like they are some expensive cars, instead of speaking of the heart like you do. I also noted you're a very nervous person Nick, why is that?\" He hesitated before answering \"I'm just often afraid I'm going to make a fool of myself in front of other people. I'm not a popular person like Mark and the others or you.\" She gave him an understanding look, she gently then raised her hand and gently put it on top of his. \"Don't be afraid to be yourself Nick, you're a great guy, with great morals and I'm sorry about what happened to your brother and what it did to your family, but it wasn't your fault.\" \"Are you sure? Maybe if I had been a better big brother, maybe if I had been more attentive, maybe if I had given more attention to my brother he wouldn't have turned to such bad company.\" \"It wasn't your fault.\" She said firmly. \"You and your family can't be held accountable for the actions of your brother, he was old enough to make his decisions now he must bear the consequences, it's not up to anyone else including you to clean up after him. Live Nick, live for yourself your family and your friends. Am I your friend Nick?\" Nick was stunned by this question. \"Of course your are, I care about you a lot.\" She smiled once again. \"I'm glad to hear it. And I'm proud of calling you my friend too.\" For a moment everything became brighter, the light, the trees, the water Sarah's face, and he still felt her hand on his, it was pleasant the feel of her warm skin pressing down on his, he was amazed on how soft it was. He suddenly felt the urge to put his arms around her athletic body, and press his body against her. To put his right hand on her golden hair, and drown his face in it and then to press his lips on her lips. He quickly came back to reality, thinking how inappropriate it would be to do such a thing to her right now that she had offered him her friendship. They suddenly heard the voice of Max. \"Ay, you too up there we've just arrived.\" Nick was a bit frustrated by this interruption but he forced himself to reply. \"Arrived where, Max?\" \"Well the black lagoon silly, or have both of you forgotten?\" \"Already\" asked an exciting Sarah. \"How exciting, lets go.\" They came down from the upper deck. And has he went down Max asked Nick in a low voice. \"The two of you were there for quite a while. Anything I should know about.\" Nick was pretty embarrassed. \"Nothing that I would care to discuss with you.\" Max smiled and winked at him, has the three of them went to join the others in the forward deck. They were all baffled by what they saw. The lagoon was immense, beautiful, the water was very dark you could barely see what was under it. And the trees were enormous, covering most of the banks were they could land. \"It's beautiful.\" Sarah said. \"You said girl.\" Said Jennifer. Then Leticia said excitedly. \"I have an idea, let's go for a swim.\" \"Why go for a swim inside the lagoon if we already have a swimming pool aboard the yacht.\" \"Swimming inside a pool is not the same has swimming in natural water, with the algae, the fishes and the beauties of the deep.\" \"Yes\" replied Mark in a mocking voice. \"And the crocodiles, and the anacondas, and the piranha, and the bacteria, should I continue.\" Jennifer then asked. \"You're not afraid are you Mark?\" \"Me? Of course not, with all this muscle I can beat any crocodile or reptile that comes our way.\" Sarah smiled. \"Good it is decided. Now you boys go put on your swim shorts, while we girls go put on our swimming gear.\" The three woman went down to their cabins to change while the four young men stayed and took their swimming shorts from their bags. Nick's swimming shorts were a clear green, while Mark's were white, and both Spencer's and Max's were blue. They then waited for the girls to come back. The first one back was Leticia who was wearing a purple bikini, whose underwear was made in the form of a small skirt. The second one back was Jennifer, she was covered by a completely black swimsuit. And finally came Sarah, and Nick felt his heart pounce so fast he though it was beating like the heart of a rat, she was wearing a clear blue bikini wish accentuated her blue eyes, and contrasted with her golden hair, not to mention it went well with the rest of her slim athletic body revealing her strong slim arms, powerful delicate legs, and a very slim figure. \"My, my.\" Said Mark. \"Girls are you looking to give the four of us a heart attack, appearing ravishing like that.\" \"Don't even think about it Mark.\" Said Max and Spencer in a threatening tone. \"Wao, wao, hold your horses? I promise my intentions are strictly honorable.\" Nick couldn't help but laugh. \"You know quoting a man like James Bond isn't exactly going to put you out of trouble. You know him being a womanizer and all.\" Mark looked at him with shock. \"That line was from James Bond? Which one?\" \"The first one, \"Doctor No\" when he meets the first Bond girl.\" \"Hum I understand now why that scene stayed in my brain.\" The girls laughed. \"You boys don't look bad yourselves.\" Said Sarah. \"Well if were done admiring each other's bodies and quoting James Bond. I suggest we get into the water.\" Leticia, Jennifer, Mark, Spencer and Max didn't need to be told twice they all jumped from all sides of the yacht and into the black lagoon. Only Sarah and Nick had yet to jump in the water. \"What are you waiting for Nick jump.\" Said Sarah. \"Oh no thank you, ladies firsts.\" He said with hesitation. Sarah seemed confused. \"Are you afraid of something?\" Nick decided to be honest. \"Well I'm a bit afraid of cold water.\" She seemed surprised and she asked in a mocking voice. \"You are.\" She laughed. Which embarrassed Nick even further. \"Don't laugh please. It's just I'm very sensitive to temperature changes, so its difficult for me to get into cold water, once my body adapts I have no problem. However it takes me over a quarterof an hour sometimes half an hour to get into the water by slowly immersing myself.\" She laughed. \"You know its easier if you simply jump right in. The body adapts quicker then.\" \"I know, but I'm often nervous about doing it.\" \"Come with me.\" She said has she offered him her hand. Nick grabbed it and let her pull him towards the edge of the boat. She then told him. \"Now forget about the water for a moment, stop thinking about how cold it must be. Just think how nice it will be once you dive in.\" Nick banished all though of freezing water from his mind. \"Done.\" He said. She smiled she put her lips next to his hear and whispered. \"Now jump.\" And jump he did, he didn't even think about it, he flew overboard and hit the water, his body protested at first at the feeling of cold water, but a few seconds later he felt better, and the water felt natural. He swam back to the surface, but has soon has he managed to get his head out of the water he felt something landing on his back, pushing underwater, he felt a pair of arms around his neck and legs around his torso. He turned his head and saw the smiling face of Sarah staring back at him, he then realized with amusement what had happened. She had waited for him to resurface, then she had jumped from the Yacht unto his back and put her arms around his neck and her legs around his torso. He smiled. \"You little minx, that was low.\" She laughed. \"Common, a girl needs her noble steed to carry her.\" \"Who said I was noble?\" She fainted a look of shock. \"Nick Kowalski, are you implying you're not a good man.\" \"No, no, I'm yours to command, just hope your ready.\" He then suddenly dove underwater, with Sarah still in his back. They went through the dark waters of the lagoon, he continued until they reached the bottom where he took both of them through the algae, has they saw the fish swimming by them. Nick suddenly felt the need to come up for air. He made hand gestures to Sarah, pointing at his throat. She understood the message has she got out of his back, to allow him better movement has they both swam towards the surface. Finally their heads emerged from the water and they took both of them a big gulp of air. \"Boy that was fun.\" Sarah said. \"You sure can hold your breath.\" He commented. \"I do a lot of swimming at the gym.\" \"Cool.\" He replied, his admiration of her having grown. \"Did you see down there, it seemed like a whole other world.\" She said. \"Yes like a underwater forest. Who knows what lives in those waters.\" \"Hey you too over there, come and join us.\" They heard from a great distance behind them. They turned and saw it was Leticia, with the others a few 60 meters away from them. \"Apparently we swam more than we though, we drifted more than we though.\" Said Nick. \"We better join them. Race you?\" she said with a defiant look on her face. \"Your own.\" And they both started swimming towards the boat, unaware they had been watched from the beginning. … Gillman had been furious. Once again humans had come into his domain, his home on the coming on the back of their mechanical monstrosity. He had difficulty seeing the humans at first has they were high inside their boat. But then they had jumped into the water. And he could see them more clearly, he had considered attacking them then, but then he saw two of them were female, very beautiful females and he decided otherwise. So he simply hid in the algae and observed until another male and female, this one wearing blue clothes, why humans bothered themselves with covering their bodies with silk was something Gillman couldn't grasp, it was almost if the humans were ashamed to reveal their bodies. However this female had nothing to be ashamed off. She was absolutely gorgeous, her limbs were delicate but strong, she had a very slim curved body, and her golden hair seemed to shine underwater has it floated. But however she had grabbed one of the males, the one who jumped before her, and was letting him carry her underwater. Gillman felt a surge of anger and jealousy has he followed them through the algae, was this male her mate? They began to swim back towards the other humans, Gillman quickly swam under the golden haired female and began swimming with her, so close he could touch her. She continued swimming completely oblivious to his presence, while Gillman and her continued to gain distance from the male. When Gillman noticed they were getting close to the other humans he swam back towards the algae where he hid, disappointed that their swimming together hadn't lasted a lot more. … Sarah finally arrived near the others, while she waited for Nick to catch up to her. He arrived a few seconds later. \"So you can't beat me, slowpoke?\" \"Apparently not speedy.\" \"Oh, already changing cute nick names?\" Asked Mark. \"None of your business\" she said. … Gillman decided to approach the humans carefully. He swam near them careful not to touch their bodies, he then extended his hand and touched the leg of the sun haired female. … Sarah suddenly felt a hand touch her leg. She quickly screamed \"Who his touching my leg?\" She looked with suspicion at Mark. \"It wasn't me, promise.\" She then looked at Nick. \"Neither did I.\" She quickly looked underwater but there was nothing there. \"Maybe it was a stray fish.\" Suggested Nick \"It didn't fell like a fish, but yes like a hand, a strange hand it felt scaly.\" Mark laughed \"Maybe it was a lizard.\" Sarah though about. Yes it was probably it, she probably exaggerated the feeling of a hand, due to the surprise of being touched, after all what else could it be?[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 Gillman kept observing the humans, while they played in the water. He had had a narrow escape when he touched the gold haired female, but for him it had been worth it. Her skin had been smooth and pleasant to the touch, and now he realized he wanted to feel her skin touching his more, he thought she could mean an end to this solitary existence has the last one of his kind. She could be his salvations from this lonely existence. It was then he decided that he would make her his mate, she would stay here with him. He knew however her companions would likely resist, he remembered his confrontations with the humans in the past, all those decades before. He knew how stubborn and persistent their kind could be, but so was Gillman. And if that male who was courting her to be his mate got in the way, he would rip his throat out. … Nick and Sarah and the others swam for several hours in the water. The water was very pleasant, and it seemed to wash away all their troubles. But even so Sarah cold shake the feeling they were being watched. She knew she was probably exaggerating because of the scare she got earlier when something touched her leg, it was probably an eel anyway. They were already several hours forward in the afternoon when Mark said: \"The sun is setting, we'd better get back unto the yacht.\" Jennifer laughed. \"Afraid of the dark Mark.\" He made a snort. \"Of course not. But I heard it can be dangerous to swim at night, we may get lost or wander away from the yacht.\" \"That's a valid point, we should get back unto the yacht.\" After agreeing they all began to swim back towards the yacht when they realized something was wrong. \"Wait a minute, were his the ladder.\" Asked Spencer. \"We must have forgotten to lower it while we jumped in the water.\" Said Max. \"How are we going to reach it.\" Asked Sarah. Suddenly Sarah felt something putting itself between her legs and pushing the rest of her body above the water. Surprised she gave a little surprised scream, only to see with relief that it was only Nick which had placed her legs above his shoulders so he could raise her above the water. \"Thank you Nick.\" She said. \"No problem.\" She quickly grabbed the ladder and lowered it into the water, after wish they then proceeded to climb out of the water. After that they could see the sun had already set so they proceeded to get themselves some snacks while Mark put on some music, none of them saw any need to get out of their swimwear so they kept them on. They spent the night talking, eating, and dancing. \"Look at how beautiful the night sky his.\" Said Sarah has she pointed at the stars. \"You don't see that many stars in the US.\" \"That's because in the Amazon there is no pollution to block the view.\" Said Nick. \"Indeed, you'd think we were in paradise. And keep yourselves quiet for a moment and listen.\" They shushed, and listened to the sound of insects buzzing, around and the sound of nocturnal creature awakened now that their time of activity had come. \"I hear it. Its magical.\" Said Nick. \"We are truly in a whole other world.\" \"Yeah, a world of mysteries.\" Said Leticia, her eyes shining with curiosity. \"Talking about mysteries\", said Mark. \"I think I know what touched your leg Sarah.\" That got everyone's attention. \"What that might be?\" asked Sarah. \"Maybe it was the Gillman.\" He suggested in a low spooky and at the same time mocking voice. They all gave a big laugh. Spencer was the first to recover. \"Come on man. Everyone knows that the Gillman is not real.\" \"We all know the story, about the scientists who supposedly encountered it.\" Said Nick. \"It was deemed a ox, a lie the scientist made up to cover up whatever disaster caused the deaths of several of the expedition members and give voice to their theories.\" \"Very well\" consented Mark. \"What about the one who was captured?\" \"It was concluded it was probably a man the expedition disguised in a suit, which then conveniently escaped.\" Said Leticia. \"I know, I know I was just messing with you I don't believe in the Gillman either.\" Said Mark. \"Although it is said he likes pretty woman. And look, we have three pretty woman right here with us.\" Spencer put his arms around Leticia's waist, and told her. \"Don't worry, I won't let him touch you.\" She smiled and said \"My hero.\" And then planted a gentle kiss in his lips. \"I won't let touch Jennifer also.\" Said Max with confidence. Jennifer looked at him. \"Skinny has you are I doubt you could do much about it darling.\" She said in a jocking matter. \"What? You're going to tell me some kind of fish man has a chance against all of this.\" He said showing is body. \"He'll likely make a meal out of you.\" Said Jennifer. \"I don't think the Gillman actually eats people.\" Said Max. They all laughed and proceeded to carry on with their party. It was actually being a very enjoyable night. Nick decided to go to the upper deck, and watch and think alone when he saw something in the trees that caught his eye. He looked down from the upper deck into the rear deck, where the others were. And he whispered. \"Sarah\" She looked up to him and smiled. \"What is it?\" \"Could you up here please there is something I would like you to see.\" She discreetly got away from the others and climbed the ladder into the upper deck, until she was in front of Nick. \"Well here am I, what would you like me to see?\" \"Look there.\" He put his right hand around her shoulder and gently pushed her toward the edge of the deck, while he pointed with his left hand at the trees in front of the yacht. At first she couldn't see a thing, but then she saw hundreds, maybe thousands, of bright little green lights shining in the trees. She then understood \"Fireflies.\" \"Yes, beautiful aren't they?\" asked Nick. \"Beautiful. They're magnificent, another of our Lords great creations.\" Nick looked at her with amazement. \"You're a believer too!\" She smiled. \"Yes, I mean how can you look at all the beauty in the universe and not believe in something.\" She said with conviction. \"My thoughts exactly.\" Said Nick mirroring her conviction. They stayed silent for a moment. Then Sarah decided to brake the silence. \"So, why are they flashing like that.\" Nick looked at her and smiled. \"They're actually to draw each other out. The flashing is they're special way of saying they are ready to mate.\" She though about for a while. \"Do the females sparkles or do the males sparkle?\" \"Actually both of them sparkle. The females make this light brief, discrete feminine flashes every few seconds. While the males do those long manly drown out flashes.\" She smiled. \"I like that. No dates, no awkward conversations, no misunderstandings. Just God's nature at his work, with the simple drive to procreate.\" Nick looked at her with amazement. \"I didn't expect that from you.\" \"What? The fascination with fireflies?\" \"No, it's how spiritual and poetic you are with this.\" \"Many of my other boyfriends didn't care about this side of me. Mostly they wanted me to stay at their side and laugh at their stupid jokes, other than that they weren't interesting about anything I had to say.\" \"Then they were fools, to throw away respect and consideration for you. You're an amazing woman Sarah, any man would be lucky to be yours.\" She smiled. \"How come I'm always choosing man who persists in showing me off like if I were their trophy?\" Nick felt something he had never felt before. His emotions for Sarah were never has strong has how they were now. He felt driving him, suddenly nothing else mattered, not the grades, not the lagoon, not the vacations, there was only Sarah. And for the first time in is life he felt strong and confident enough to do what he knew he had to do. HE gently raised his right hand gently touched her face, he caressed her face and pushed aside her hair. He then bowed his head towards he slightly, until they're faces were less than a centimeter away from each other, and looked right into her deep blue eyes. He then whispered: \"You would never be my trophy Sarah.\" He then slowly crossed the distance between both of them and gave her a kiss. She was surprised at first, but she then responded in kind, has they both opened their mouths to each other. She put her arms around his naked shoulders, while he put his left arm around her waist, and made his right hand slide across her golden hair, has they both drew each other in a passionate embrace. Nick couldn't tell how long they were like this, it could have been minutes, it could have been hours, all he knew is that there was only Sarah and he didn't want to let go of Sarah. After a while they stopped kissing and looked deep into each other's eyes. They than heard a clapping of hands. They looked and saw Max smiling at them. \"Finally it has happened, took you both long enough to act on your feelings.\" \"Go away Max.\" said Sarah and Nick. \"Fine, fine don't go all King Kong on me.\" He said mockingly. \"I just came to tell me and the others are going to turn in.\" \"Fine good night, Max.\" said Nick. \"Good night to both of you.\" And then he went back down. Alone again, Nick and Sarah looked at each, still holding each. Nick spoke first. \"So… what now?\" She seemed puzzled. \"I don't know. I mean I know I care about you, and I hope you care about me.\" \"I do, I care a lot of you.\" He said. She could there wasn't a single hint of doubt in his voice. She giggled. \"Good. Then how would you like to proceed?\" \"I want to do whatever makes you more comfortable.\" She smiled \"Very well, in that case I would like for us to take this slowly, let's give it a test run tomorrow and see how well things go.\" He smiled. \"Very well, what do you want to do to test our new relationship.\" She gently approached his right hear, and whispered \"Why don't sleep on it and find out tomorrow.\" She then gave him a light kiss on the lips and said \"Good night.\" \"Good night.\" Nick replied. They then both lowered themselves through the ladder into the rear deck. They then went inside the yacht, descended the staircase to the deck below. Until they arrived in the deck below were there was a corridor with six doors, three on each side, each leading to a room. They gave each other a final embrace and kiss before parting ways and each going to their respective rooms. … Gillman was furious. That filthy human male had put his mouth inside the golden haired female's mouth. Although he knew they weren't mating, he could easily understand this was a very intimate act amongst humans, probably an important step in their courting behavior. He felt the need to put his claws through that insolent male's flesh. To drown him. But no matter, the male wasn't the important one, the female, his future mate was all that mattered. He hoped that if he just took discreetly during the night, the other humans would think she had been taken by a wild animal or maybe even another human, he knew sometimes humans killed each other, filthy little creatures, and therefore they wouldn't be able to know that Gillman took her, and therefore they would look somewhere else for her, leaving the lagoon, leaving Gillman and his mate to live the rest of their days alone and undisturbed. He decided that if his plan was going to work he needed to take the female now. So once he saw the male and the female descend inside their ship. He discreetly swam towards the ship, he saw there were several windows, which allowed him to see inside, he could see the humans quarters, the door to the corridor was open and he could see the male kissing the female before she went to her room in front his, while the male entered his own room, Gillman quickly let go of the window before the male saw him. He then swam under the ship to the other side and climbed the window on the other side were he could see the female cleaning her teeth. He now knew which room she was in. He knew he had to be silent. So he slowly dropped himself back into the water and swam to the back of the ship, were he energetically propelled himself, with a powerful push from his limbs, enough so he could grab the edge of the boat. He then pulled himself onto the boat and let himself fall on the floor. He could see he was in an open space, and there was some kind of pond full of water on the ship, he tasted and immediately spit it out when he realized the taste was foul. What did the humans put in that water? Did they drink this? Deciding it was a mystery for another day he proceeded inside the ship, he could see staircase which led to the rooms deck, he silently descended into the corridor. And he could see six doors, he moved into the center of the corridor, and looked at the door on his left, the one at the center. He knew she was in here. Normally he would have brought the door down, but that would make too much noise, alerting the other humans to his presence. However when he was suspended at the window he had managed to see the female entering her room by pushing the metal lever on the door down, and then pushing the door forward. He raised his right hand, slowly grabbed the metal lever, pulled it down, feeling the mechanism in the door shifting, he then slowly and quietly pushed the door forward. The door was open. … Sarah had just finished washing her teeth, in the bathroom, she was just watering her mouth to make nothing remained, she had yet to remove her bikini. Boy was she happy, she finally had found someone with whom she could be herself, someone who valued what she had to say, someone who saw her more than a simple pretty faze. But she wondered weather their new relationship would be something permanent, or was this just another fling. She was sure he cared about her, and she knew she did to, but was this just some teenage crush, or did she really loved him, and did he really love her. She knew it was too soon to tell but she looked forward to exploring this relationship more with him, something told her this time it would be different, she hoped to God she was right. She took her hair brush and started doing her hair, but she then accidentally dropped the brush on the bathroom floor. Frustrated she lowered herself and grabbed the brush, she then rose and looked at the mirror and she froze when she saw a large figure behind her in the mirror. She quickly opened her mouth to scream but a big green hand shot out from behind her and covered her mouth to muffle her scream. She quickly used her arms to grab the attackers arms but she soon found out she didn't have the strength to move it. The attacker than put his left arm around her waist, which wasn't covered by any clothes and held her close next to his body. Sarah was suddenly was aware that the hand in her mouth, and the arm around her waist were both wet, she felt the humidity and the water rubbing against her face and belly, and her naked back which was in contact with the aggressors body. And she felt the hard green scales, in contact with her skin, the sensation of the scales on the her skin were unpleasant, like she was being rubbed against a hard rock. Putting her discomfort aside she violently struggled, and tried to hit her attacker with her arms, and kicked him in with her legs, but the creature didn't even flinch, it absorbed the impacts with ease. Realizing she wouldn't be able to free herself from this creature with physical strength she decided her only hope was to call for help. She put all her strength in her arms, which then grabbed the hand covering her mouth and pulled with all her strength. She managed to get the hand of her mouth, enough to scream, \"Help.\" But has soon has she uttered the last sentence the scaly hand went back went back to cover her up, muffling her next wave of screams, reducing them to simple moans or low pitch screams. Apparently unnerved by his victim's resistance, the creature raised Sarah off the ground and carried her unto the bedroom while she kept struggling and screaming, he then gently laid her on top of her bed, and then quickly proceeded to put his right hand above both her mouth and nose, while his left hand held her down on the bed. Sarah grabbed the hand on her face with both her hands, but this time her attacker was putting all of his weight on top of her. She then realized he was suffocating her, she desperately tried to scream, to claw this monster's hand out of her face, but she soon realized it was hopeless, has her lungs screamed for air, she soon felt herself very tired, she could no longer keep her eyes open, so little by little she closed her eyes and slept. … Gillman pressed his hand has the female slowly closed her eyes, until finally she was sleeping. Gillman quickly took off his hand, afraid he had suffocated her, but to his relief she was still breathing. She looked so peaceful when she slept, and now he would get to look on that face whenever he wished, but first he had to get her out of here. Slowly and carefully not to injure her, he grabbed her legs with his left arm, and then put his right around her back and raised her on top of his arms. He liked how light she felt. He then slowly went out of the room, and into the corridor, while carrying Sarah whose head and feet were dangling from side to side. He took the time to admire his prize, she was truly lovely, and it felt good to carry her has he felt her soft warm skin on his scales which were pleasant to the touch. He had caught her, he had captured her he had earned her has a mate, and nothing and no one would take her from him. Has he though this he continued to move up the stairs to the back deck. … Nick woke up. He thought he had heard something, it seemed like a brief scream for help. He concluded that it must have been a dream. But then he heard the door on the other side opened and he seemed to hear heavy steps. He concluded it was probably Mark, up for mid-night snack, but it seemed strange this happened when he thought he heard a scream for help. Seeing no harm in making sure nothing was wrong he raised himself from bed and opened the door. The first thing he saw was the door to Sarah's room was open, then he noticed the drops of water on the floor that stretch though the corridor. Maybe Sarah had decided to go for a midnight swim. Even so he entered her room and nocked. \"Sarah are you in here?\" He looked at the room and saw that the bed was a mess, almost has if someone had moved violently inside it, he then went inside her bathroom and noticed her hair brush was on the floor, and all over there were the drops of water, spread out over an erratic pattern. Then a terrible though crossed Nick's mind. \"What if someone had swam towards the yacht, entered it, got into Sarah's room and taken her. Full of fear in his heart he ran to the corridor and screamed \"Sarah, where are you.\" He followed the drops of water up the stairs, and when he arrived in the rear he froze with what he saw. Standing in front of him was what he thought at first to be a man, but then he noticed the scales, the gills, and the claws and its huge size. He then noticed that the creature was carrying something in its arms, and he quickly could make up the unconscious shape of Sarah, she was just lying in his arms dangling like a doll. He realized the creature was about to jump into the water, and was about to do it with Sarah has his captive. \"No, let her go.\" Screamed Nick has he rushed forward with a courage he didn't thought he had. And with all his strength he pushed the creature in its left gills. The creature made a loud groan, apparently having been surprised by the attack, since it only know had noticed the presence of Nick. It turned to face Nick it's eyes full of rage and he made a loud growl, like Nick had never heard before. Unfazed by the growl Nick, who was only concerned for Sarah and what that monster would do to her. Once again he rushed forward but this time the creature was ready. He's left arm dropped Sarah's legs, though his left kept holding her by the waist. With his left arm now free the creature threw his arm forward to Nick face, and slashed with such strength that Nick was thrown towards the floor, blood pouring from four bloody wounds in his face. \"What's all this racket.\" Nick heard someone's voice coming from behind him, recognizing it has Mark who was probably going up the stairs. But the creature apparently heard him too. It quickly put his left arm back under Sarah's legs, firmly grabbed, then carried her towards the right edge of the ship. Nick had only the type to whisper \"Sarah\" before the creature jumped in the water, carrying Sarah with it, has they both disappeared in the black waters of the lagoon. Nick immediately rose and this time he didn't even hesitate, he ran towards the edge of the ship and jumped in the water, not caring about how cold it was. He felt the cold night water touched his skin, but it didn't matter to him. He swam, he swam for what seemed like an eternity but all he could see was algae, sand and rock, all which were barely visible in the pitch black water. He continued until he was out of breath and was forced to go back to the surface, where he took a big gulp of air than looked around. He had wandered a great distance from the boat, and there was no sign of Sarah or that creature. \"Sarah\" he cried into the night's sky so that the whole lagoon heard his desperation and sorrow.

She quickly turned around and walked back up to the front door. She turned the doorknob as the men inside were finally wrapping up the conversation of whether the experiment had failed or succeeded. \"This time, it only attacked when it was threatened,\" Dr. Morgan re-iterated. \"When Barton threw Jed's body into his cage.\" \"But it still attacked; it killed Barton after the fact!\" Borg replied. \"Yes, but Marcia said the marriage to Barton made her feel like a trapped creature ,\" Morgan replied, trying to hide his feelings for her. \"I guess it doesn't really matter in the end,\" Johnson countered. \"The creature is gone. Let's just get out of here.\" Dr. Morgan eyed Marcia as she made her way back into the house. \"Can I help you with anything?\" \"No. You gentlemen can go ahead. I just have to grab my other bag, and the taxi should be here any minute.\" \"Alright,\" he said as he grabbed his own luggage. \"We will meet you at the airport.\" \"We will see,\" she teased. \"Since we are flying to different cities.\" \"For now,\" He replied as he winked and closed the front door behind him. The other men had already made their way down the stairs and were waiting. \"Should we give the police a call now...About the bodies?\" Borg asked as he loaded their luggage into the back of the car. \"We'll ring them when we get to airport, tell them it was the monster. They already know he's in the area anyways.\" \"Sounds good,\" Morgan replied as he backed out of the driveway. Zzz. Zzzz. He felt his hands shaking in remorse…Not for his own actions, but for Barton's. Why had Barton killed Jed? Confusion. The love triangle? Rage. Murder. I mean, he had taken a life too, well, a few. But it was different. Barton killed in jealously. Is different. Self defense equals different. His hands continued to shake, but he hadn't even looked down at them yet. He had been framed for a crime he didn't commit. Yet, I'm sure he wished he had made the advances...Running his half-webbed hands-if you want to call them that-through Marcia's locks. Longing eyes…just wanting someone to love. And for someone to love him back. Who could ever want a face like his; the face of a monster. But he only killed when he was threatened; when it was kill or be killed. Didn't he? Or did he even know anymore. At first glance, the greenish color of his hands was still there. However, the webbed skin was almost gone. He groaned loudly, enough to wake the ocean's ancient sleeping beasts. He was turning into one of them. Into a human. Why did this have to happen? Why couldn't he go back to the ocean? Besides, that was his first true love. Not Kay. Not Helen. The sea. Would he ever be able to swim as he once did...after everything that had happened? He had torn through the house, leaving it a mess. But let's be honest, he had every right - Barton had killed Jed for making advances on his wife, Marcia...Then Barton picked Jed up and threw him in cage with him. He didn't kill Jed; Barton did. So what was he supposed to do? He broke out and put an end to Barton. Did that make him a monster? Or just another almost human? He had to kill. Or be killed because of the blame; because of the frame. If he didn't kill Barton, surely Barton would have convinced Marcia that he was on the one who had killed Jed; no matter what kind of creature-or monster-he was. Barton was nothing more than a lying coward, and Marcia was everything. He didn't deserve her, and she deserved the truth. \"And I thought the Mississippi was something.\" \"Testing. One, two, three four.\" So many voices. Flashbacks; his head was spinning as he tried thinking straight. He wondered if Marcia had even made it out of the house. Zzzz. Zzzzzz. \"Where is my bag?\" She said aloud. Impossible to find in this mess. Zzzzzz. Zzzzzzzz. Running. Running faster, faster. He wasn't really sure why, but something was wrong. He felt it. He was just trying to get away...but something drew him back. ...the house finally came into his line of sight. Zzz. Zzzz. Zzzzzz. Zzzzzzzzz. The electric fence that once kept him from the outside world had long collapsed…Lighting anything the sparks could reach. A blade of glass here and there. A shrub. The sparks licked the heels of a tree. It wouldn't be long before he heard sirens…He just hated the noise, but something was off. He arrived just in time to see a burning tree collapse into the roof of the house…Flames licked the shingles and found their way into the newly exposed cracks in the ceiling. He heard a shriek, and seconds seemed like hours as the flame spread throughout the house. \"Help!\" It was Marcia! She was in trouble. No matter how much hate for humanity he had built up, he couldn't let her suffer. As quickly as he could, he jolted up the stairs…passing Barton's dead body to the right. Jed's was back in his cage. By this point, the house was completely engulfed in flames. Why not head on in. Besides, not like he hadn't been burned in the accident...When the men were trying to capture him and take him away from home. That's what had started his awful transition to humanism. Before the fire, and whatever surgery the doctors performed to save him, he didn't even know he had lungs. He burst through the front door and charted a course through his own rage and wreckage. He glanced into the first bedroom. Nothing. No one. Something had to give; where was she? After searching in the common area, he tripped over a rug and landed shoulder first into a burning table. He groaned loudly as he stood his feet. He look at his shoulder, his skin was peeling as far as he could see up his neck. \"Help!\" She squealed once she realized someone was in the house. She had to be in the other bedroom. He glanced at his hands again...He could have sworn the green was wearing off, but it was to hard to tell because of the ashy film that was starting to layer his skin. The smoke was getting dense, and he knew he didn't have much time to save her. He stumbled into the other bedroom to find Marcia backed up against the wall...flaming bed and dresser in the way of her exit. He looked her directly in the eyes, and she looked back into his. For a moment, before her eyes closed, it felt as if they had connected...At least to him. Does he grab her? Did she lie in his eyes because she knew he was her only hope? Think fast. He reached under the dresser, gripping it - making contact with the flame. After letting out a loud groan, he forcefully flipped the dresser over on the bed. He bolted through the new path and quickly lifted her up into his arms. He trudged out of the hole in wall where the door used to be. Was this finally freedom? After inhaling a breath of fresh air, he looked around for a place away from the fire to lay her down. Or should he just take her to the shore as her final resting place? With her in his arms, he began the walk back to beach. Sirens finally sounded in the distance. Maybe he should have left her body next to her husbands, but she didn't seem to care for him anyway. Beach is best. And after miles of walking, he finally reached it. As soon as he felt the sand around his feet, he gently placed her on the ground. Had they connected? When she looked him in the eyes...it was deep. Or was she honestly pleading for his help. He'd never know...But in a way, he felt as if he had lost more than Barton ever did. He fell to his knees next to Marcia's body, moaned, and began to crawl towards the oceans. He wasn't sure how he had even tolerated the smoke for as long as he did, but it didn't matter. He had been burned. Webbed hand after webbed hand. Except for the first time, he noticed that his hands weren't really webbed at all. They actually looked like human hands. Did that make him a product of his own anger? A product of the Jealousy that possessed Barton to kill Jed? Was he guilty? He still couldn't even think straight. Another breath of fresh air...but this time the breeze was home to a light hint of salt. Right before he reached the water, he brought himself to his feet so he could feel the waves crash at his heels. He looked down to see the water washing away the ash. As each wave broke, his skin became lighter and lighter. No more scales, no more green. He was human. How would his lungs even work in the water? He was still confused and didn't care. He just wanted to be free...moving deeper and deeper into the water. He thought he heard a faint sound from behind him, but he kept going deeper until there was nothing but his head above the surface. He heard it again; it was a feminine voice coming from the shore \"Wait!\"[Chapter 2] \"Marcia!\" Thomas shouted as he grabbed the ringing phone.[Chapter 3] \"Is she really?\" Thomas asked...his tone more worrisome with every word. \"Yes. She's been keeping him in that house.\" \"For how long now? How do you know? Are you spying on her?\" \"Not on her. On him, and to be honest...I'm not quite sure. But she's in my way, and I don't want to have to hurt her.\" \"I don't even know who you are. Nor do I care. I'll kill you if you even think about hurting her; I'll kill you and the creature.\" \"Relax, relax. The reason for this call is that so we can work together. You want one thing, I want another...and working together, we can both get what we want. You get the girl, and I get the monster.\" \"What's your name? Your trade?\" \"You can call me Captain Lucas...my steamer is Rita .\" \"When you said you lost half your crew...You weren't kidding. You've dealt with the monster before, haven't you?\" \"Oh, I've dealt with him alright, but he slipped out of our grasp. Not going to let that happen again.\" \"I don't blame you, and I don't want to lose my girl to this monster. So what are we going to do?\" \"Isn't that the million dollar question?\" Lucas replied. \"You know where the house is right? Should we just show up...You can bring your harpoon or whatever?\" \"That would have worked a few weeks ago, but not now. As each day passes, this sucker becomes more and more human. To the point that I'd almost be committing murder should the police see me kill this monster.\" \"I see.\" \"So we need to work quick; before he finishes his human transformation. But we also need to work quietly.\" \"Just so as long as you think it can be done.\" \"Well, seeing both of our current situations...we really don't have much of a choice.\" x-x-x \"Go to the bedroom,\" she said as she motioned for the creature to hide. \"You know we can't take any chances.\" He nodded as best he could and made his way to the bedroom. \"Everything will be alright.\" \"Knock, knock, knock,\" the door demanded. \"I'm coming, I'm coming,\" Marcia said as she made her way towards the front door. She took a deep breath and slowly grabbed the handle. Here goes nothing...Knowing Thomas, he probably found me...and is coming to put and end to this creature. And I love Thomas, but I can't. This thing saved my life, and I owe it mine. He's come so far in the last few weeks...I can't just give up. She opened the door slowly and peeked through the crack. Whew, it isn't Thomas. \"What can I do for you, sir?\" She asked as she realized it was the landlord. \"For starters, you can pay me the money you owe me,\" he said as he stepped into the doorway. \"Excuse me,\" Marcia said as she stood her ground, not letting him enter. \"Excuse me is right. I own this house, and I expect you to pay per our agreement.\" \"I did pay. I left the check in an envelope in your mailbox...Just as you asked.\" \"Oh, did you?\" He asked as he raised his voice and forced his way by her into the house. \"Then why wasn't it in my mailbox when I checked it?\" \"I'm not sure,\" she replied. \"Why aren't you sure, woman?\" He asked as he shoved her out of his way, knocking her to her knees. She began to tear up, \"Why are you doing this? I paid you!\" \"Then where is it?\" He screamed. A loud crash from the bedroom. \"I'm...I'm...I'm not sure,\" She stuttered. \"What the hell was that noise?\" He asked as he glared at her. \"Never mind, I'll find out for myself.\" He walked past her as she shook her head in tears. \"Don't go back there,\" she pleaded. He ignored her and stepped into the bedroom. \"WHAT THE...\" Silence. A blur in the doorway as a the creature slung him across the room. By the time she made it, he was already dead. His body lay on the floor by the bed...Several broken bones. \"At least you still have your strength, but we're going to have to leave,\" She said to him. \"And we're going to have to leave soon. You can't keep killing like this.\" He glared at her, and she knew what he meant. I had no other choice...he hurt you. You're taking care of me, and I'm going to take care of you...Even if it means more killing. \"I know, I know. It isn't your fault. I just want to know what happened to the rent? I dropped it in his mailbox. Just as he had asked me to. Who could have taken it? A common thief? It just doesn't make any sense.\" The creature let out a groan. \"What if someone knows we are here?\" He shook his head no. Besides, it was almost impossible for someone to have found them...They'd covered every track. \"What are we going to do with this body!? Do we just leave?\" A nod. \"You're right. We've got to get out of here; I'm going to pack my things.\" He reached his hand out to the dresser and grabbed his cowboy hat. \"Not a bad idea, wear it low...try to cover as much of your face as possible.\" An even louder groan. \"I didn't mean it like that,\" she said as she playfully punched his arm and smiled. \"You've come so far...Except for your head, you're human. It shouldn't even take much longer for you to change. I'm just hoping we will actually be able to communicate soon. Like, I want to hear your voice,\" she said and looked up at him. Don't kid yourself, she thought. I mean, I do owe him my life...but there's no way I'll be ever to give it to this thing. Not after what it's done...It can't even talk. I'm being silly. She wants to hear my voice. One day...One day I'll be able to tell her how I really feel. How we were meant for each other. He watched Marcia close the lid on her suitcase and zip it shut. She went to lift it, but he beat her to it. \"Oh, why thank you,\" she said in return as she looked up at him and took his free hand in hers. \"You don't have to,\" She said as looked deep into his eyes. She took a step back to look at his face, and didn't let go of his hand. It fit perfectly into hers. Despite most of his face still being green, some of the scales had shed leaving various patches of perfect skin underneath. His nose still jutted out a little farther than any humans...A little deformed and wrinkly; almost as wrinkly as his forehead. She looked at his lips...The upper lip naturally turned up...Both lips were still red, but not quite as dark as they once were. \"If only,\" he said aloud.

I'm not really committed to this, but then again, I said that about \"Tai, Sage & Roxie,\" and look how attached I got to that, so I don't know. This is pretty bad, but I plan to expand. And I like Tippi. [Setting: Madstein's Castle...] Dr. Kenneth Madstein was a mad scientist. He knew he was destined to be; his name was too blatantly obvious. He could never keep his head on his shoulders in school; it was always in the clouds, scheming of devilish things to enter in the Evil Science Fair when he was old enough. Unfortunately, his family grew up in serious poverty. They couldn't afford much, so when he was finally educated and gung-ho to start unleashing terror on the world, he didn't have the money for an Igor. No matter, he would go it alone. But that was where she came in. One day, Madstein found a dying rabbit sprawled on the side of the road. He initially passed it by, almost delighting in seeing its pain...but he had an epiphany of sorts. Something made him unable to pass that rabbit by. He rescued it and nursed it back to health. He intended for the rabbit to be used to test out everything he created; every potion, every weapon, everything. But it would die at one surge of electricity or one drink of a death serum, so Madstein decided to make the rabbit a little more human. It had taken some pretty shady things to get the immortality serum, but, then again, Malaria was a pretty shady place back then. He was still in debt with a crazy hermit named Lazy Eye Freddy for buying it, but anything to finally gain a real servant. Additionally, besides the immortality, he gave the rabbit the opportunity to walk and talk like humans could. However, he was still poor, maybe even poorer; whatever money he had went to Lazy Eye Freddy. All he could afford was half a normal brain and half an old brain from the '50s. A brain transplant occurred and there she was. Then came the issue of a name. When Madstein finally decided on a name for her, he chose a name that was related to something chilling that once struck fear in the hearts of anyone who saw: she was named Tippi, after Tippi Hedren, star of Hitchcock thriller The Birds . For years, Tippi serviced (and annoyed) him, until an Igor, his monster, and his accomplices had exposed the secret of Malaria. It came as a great shock to Madstein, who was pretty young at the time, and had only gotten the chance to be in five Evil Science Fairs, losing every time, whereas others had so much more experience. He was unsatisfied. He wanted more power. So he spent his entire existence after that plotting to bring evil back into Malaria, and he would stop at nothing to get his way. \"Look out, world, the era of Madstein is dawning,\" he would say, \"and once it begins, may it never end.\" And it wasn't long before he wanted the world. \" Tippi !\" He hollered. \"What's up, Doc?\" She coolly ambled in. \"Tippi, it's that time of the day again.\" \"What now?\" \"You know... praising time .\" \"Oh! Sorry.\" Tippi dropped to her knees, leaned down, and stretched her arms out. \"You are the god of all that is evil and genius. A new age full of your wisdom is coming and all will worship you. You will be more powerful than Frankie Avalon and Chuck Berry combined. You-\" \"Oh, shut up!\" He rolled his eyes. \"The whole 'praise' thing has worn thin.\" \"Maybe because it's just weird.\" She frowned. \"I mean, the only guy I'd ever fall to my feet and praise willingly is good old Elvis.\" \"Well, I've been told the resemblance is striking.\" Madstein smoothed over his dark hair, smiling smugly. \"By who?\" \"It doesn't matter by who!\" He sputtered, knowing she'd just called his bluff. \"And when are you going to start on this whole 'taking over the world' thing? I'd just like to, you know, get in touch with the world once in a while.\" \"Why are you worried about being in touch? Half of your brain belonged to a teenage girl from the '50s! You will never be in touch!\" \"I'm sorry if I just appreciate Sinatra more than the ankle-biters today do.\" Tippi huffed. \"Why do I even keep you around anymore?\" He groaned. \"You're just so annoying!\" \"And you are just bad news for everyone in Malaria! Don't you have any, you know, morals or anything?\" Madstein grabbed her by the glass pendant she wore around her neck that sported the image of a black poodle and lifted her up, twisting the pendant so she lost all breath. \"Do you want me to put you back on the street?\" She shook her head, choking. He released her, letting her fall to the ground with a hard thump. \"I made you, and I can break you just as easily.\" \"I'm sorry!\" She exclaimed. \"You've been really good to me, and I've had a blast here.\" \"Now are you going to help me or not?\" \"Help you do what?\" \"I think I've thought of a plan to restore the clouds and gloom. Maybe, if I make a machine that controls the weather, I-\" \"Wasn't that what they had in the first place?\" He paused. \"Wait, what?\" \"Wasn't that what controlled the clouds in the first place? Some kind of magnet?\" He ground his teeth together. \"You've been doing your research.\" \"Well, yeah.\" Tippi shrugged modestly. \"No big deal.\" [Setting: Outside of the castle...] Tippi pounded on the door. \"I'm sorry! I'll help you think of a new plan! Please let me in! I have nowhere to go!\" Eventually, she gave up. Slumping on the door, she sighed. \"No use laying around.\" She got up and started walking. \"Time to agitate the gravel.\"[Chapter 2] A/N: Back! Tippi time! Sorry if this chapter kind of sucks. If they're OOC, please let me know! (For the record, I love Brain.) Also, I realized that \"far out\" wasn't the greasers, it was the hippies, so I think I'm going to make that the joke. ;) [Setting: The streets...] Tippi somberly walked to nowhere, looking for a place or a person that seemed remotely friendly. A little ditty by the Chordettes rang in her head so she wouldn't feel so lonely anymore. Tired from walking, she sat down. \"If only Fat City were somewhere nearby.\" She glanced down at the poodle necklace. Angry and exhausted, she ripped it off her neck and threw it away. After sulking with her head in her hands for about ten minutes, Tippi heard voices. \"Wait a minute! This! It's perfect!\" She turned around and saw an Igor examining her necklace - more specifically, the Igor who had exposed the whole \"clouds and darkness\" plot. But that necklace was the only thing she had left that really kept her sanity. No one was going to take that from her. \"Hey!\" She yelled. \"That's mine!\" He looked up. \"What?\" \"That's my necklace, nosebleed. Give it back to me!\" \"I'm sorry.\" He gingerly handed it back to her. She sighed. \"No, I'm sorry. I'm getting frosted and that's not cool.\" \"'Frosted?' What? Look, all I wanted was to try and find an anniversary gift.\" \"Aww! You're circled?\" \"Um...I guess?\" \"Poor sucker. Listen, Clyde-\" \"It's Igor.\" Tippi chuckled. \"The lingo's a little lost on you, isn't it, Daddy-O? Anyways, the thing is, I've got no pad and no gig. I was kicked out by my owner. This necklace is all I have, so I really need to keep it.\" \"Well, hey, how about this: you give me the necklace and I let you stay with me?\" \"Hmmm.\" She pretended to think it over, though inside, she was screaming, Yes! \"That's chili.\" \"Chili?\" \"It's a good deal.\" She held out her hand. \"Give me five - let's make it official!\" He reluctantly shook her hand. She laughed. \"Okay, where are we going?\" \"I'll show you.\" They started walking. \"Now-wait, what's your name?\" \"Tippi, like Tippi Hedren.\" \"A great actress.\" Igor nodded. \"Now Tippi, I must warn you, there are other people living here besides me and Eva.\" \"Eva, eh? She sounds like a Dolly.\" \"She is...I think. I'm not entirely sure what you're saying.\" \"Well, who else is living with you? Got some ankle-biters?\" \"They're annoying, all right.\" He groaned. \"One of them is a robot named Brain. Don't let that name fool you. Then there's Scamper. He's actually a rabbit too, except he's immortal.\" \"No way! Same here! Except my old owner owes a crazy guy a lot of dough, even though he's frail.\" \"Well, you two should get along perfectly then...Actually, forget I said that.\" \"Why?\" \"Even though he's going to live forever, he doesn't want to live. Don't let him scare you.\" \"Got it. And thanks for letting me stay with you. I was getting pretty freaked out all by myself.\" \"No problem.\" Tippi smiled. Maybe her luck was changing for the better. [Setting: Igor's castle...] \"Hey, Scamper,\" Brain called, \"look!\" \"What?\" Scamper rolled his eyes. \"I'm an Olympic skater!\" He slid across the room on his wheels quite gracefully. That is, until he slammed into a bookcase. \"Scamper?\" \"What now?\" \"I'm seeing stars. So does that mean I should become an astrologist instead?\" \"No, it means you should shut up.\" The door opened. \"Guys, I'm home!\" Igor called. \"Did you get me any ribbon?\" Brain inquired excitedly. \"No, Brain, I didn't.\" \"Ha! Get a load of this oddball.\" There, behind Igor, stood a pale female bunny. \"Igor!\" Brain wheeled up to him quickly. \"Don't look now,\" he whispered, \"but a homeless thing followed you in!\" \"Oh, guys, I forgot to mention, this is Tippi.\" He introduced them. \"She's going to be staying here for the time being. Her old owner kicked her out.\" \"Hey, beans!\" Tippi smiled. \"Tippi, this is Brain. I told you about him, remember?\" \"Oh, yeah, the robot!\" She knocked on his lid. \"Pleased to make your acquaintance.\" Brain attempted to sound formal. He extended his hand to her, and after she shook it, he accidentally hit himself in the face retracting it. Tippi just laughed. \"And I heard something about another guy? Kind of low, bit of a wet rag?\" \"That's Scamper.\" \"Wait, you understand her?\" Igor asked. \"Yes,\" he replied with dignity, \"I happen to speak '50s-ease.\" He shook his head. \"Great. Now if only we could get you to speak real English properly.\" \"Hey, if there's one thing I ain't, it's an idiot, kemosabe .\" He snapped. Suddenly, he looked around. \"Hey, where is Scamper?\" [Setting: The balcony, later...] \"Scamper!\" Brain called, wheeling around like a madman. \"Scamper, come out and plaaay! Oh, Scamper!\" \"Shut up, Brain.\" \"Oh, there you are!\" He noticed Scamper at the balcony. \"Why didn't you stay and meet Tippi?\" He was silent. Brain smirked a little. \"Fine, then, I'll just tell Tippi that you hate her.\" \"Wait, what?\" Scamper finally looked at him. \"Why would you do that?\" \"Well, I'd just like to let her know in advance before she meets you so she won't be surprised or anything. I mean, you refuse to see her, so…\" \"It's not that I hate her—\" \"So you like her?\" \"I haven't even met her. How would I know?\" \"But I thought you didn't want to meet her.\" \"I didn't say that, I—\" \"Are you in love with her?\" He teased. \"What? Brain—\" \"I bet you're in love with her.\" He wheeled around Scamper in circles, no matter how dizzy he was getting. \"I bet you want to kiss her.\" \"That's really mature, Brain.\" He replied sarcastically. \"I take offense to that!\" \"Do you even know what mature means?\" \"…It has something to do with birds.\" \"We're done here.\" \"Okay, dogs? Is that that thing where some dogs don't have tails? Am I getting warmer?\" No reply. \"Fine, then. I don't care about you and your silent treatment.\" Brain wheeled out of the room. Somehow, he would get his friend to come around.[Chapter 3] A/N: LET'S GOOOOOOO! Okay, um, yeah. So here's the new chapter. This plus the new episodes of Glee with all the Grease songs have me in a very '50s mood! Enjoy! By the way, the only reason I used the name of a real play is because Annie is a real play, so it checks out. And also, who can guess who Lili is named after? Hint: it's from a very funny movie and the initials of the person who plays her are MK. [Setting: Igor's castle...] Tippi sat down on the couch with Igor, watching the TV, eagerly awaiting a talk show he was telling her Eva was going to appear on. \"Hello, everyone, and welcome to Cristall Clear with Carl Cristall!\" The invisible host announced. \"Now, here with us today, we have Eva, an actress who is making her official theatrical debut. Can you tell us a little more about that?\" \"Well,\" she began, \"it's in a show called Funny Girl about an actress trying to get her start, and I can definitely relate to that. I play Fanny Brice and I'm really enjoying it so far.\" \"That rings a bell.\" Tippi nodded. \"So that's your girl?\" \"Yep.\" \"You really built a classy chassis, I got to say. I've seen people who look so much worse.\" \"Like who?\" \"Well, take my old owner's chick, for example. She was grundy. I never really knew what to think of her. She was a stick-thin girl who was frosted all the time and had this awful lisp. She was Madison Avenue, though, and she was always pretty good to me.\" \"I understood most of that, I think! We're getting somewhere!\" \"Igor, you really need to get with it!\" She shrugged. \"Anyways, when did you two tie the knot?\" \"Tie the knot? Oh, no, we're not married! At least, not yet.\" \"But you're planning on popping the question?\" \"At some point in our lives, yes.\" \"Well, you'll have to tell me when you're committed. Now let's watch the rest of the interview.\" [Setting: Madstein's castle...] There was a knock at the door. \"If it's you, Tippi,\" Madstein snarled, \"you can take those floppy ears of yours and shove them up your-\" \"Calm down, it's jutht me!\" Lili Barton interrupted. \"Oh! Lili!\" He opened the door sheepishly. \"I'm sorry.\" \"Thtuff it, Kenneth. What'th the deal with Tippi?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Where ith she?\" \"She's, er...what I want to say is...she...\" \"Cut it out, Kenneth, and tell me where she ith!\" \"She's gone!\" \"She's what ?\" Lili's face darkened. \"She's been nothing but trouble lately, so I kicked her out!\" \"Kenneth Jameth Madthtein, do you know how much that adorable rabbit meant to me? You need to find her!\" \"Lili, she's gone! I told her never to come back!\" \"You heartleth creep! I want that little thweetheart back in my life!\" \"Sweetheart? If only you knew her like I did, the wise-cracking little-\" \"I won't have you thay thuch thingth about Tippi!\" \"What are you even defending her for? She hated you!\" \"Au contraire!\" \"She wasn't even an asset to my plan!\" \"Oh? And what ith your plan?\" \"Well, Lili, it begins like this...\" [Setting: Igor's castle...] \"Hi, everyone!\" Eva exclaimed, opening the door to the castle. \"I'm home!\" \"Eva!\" Brain wheeled over to her. \"Hey, Brain! Where's Igor? He's been telling me about some new rabbit he wants to introduce me to.\" \"Oh, he's just showing her around. Hey, can you do me a favor?\" \"Anything.\" He handed her a bouquet of flowers with a blank piece of paper attached to it. \"Can you please write on that paper, 'Dear Tippi, I'm in love with you. Signed, Scamper.'\" She gave him a confused look. \"Brain, why do you want me to do this again?\" \"Because I have no fingers.\" \"No, that's not what I mean. What I want to know is, why are you writing love notes with Scamper's name?\" \"Because I'm trying to be a good matchmaker, but none of my plans are working! I even tried to rent that singing crab from the mermaid movie, but it just ran away! Worst forty bucks I've ever spent...\" \"Brain,\" Eva smiled warmly, \"that is so sweet what you're doing. But I think the best thing to do is to sit back and just let it happen.\" \"Fine.\" He dejectedly agreed. If I had fingers, I would have crossed them behind my back, he thought. [Setting: Elsewhere in the castle...] Tippi walked down the hallway by herself. She was really unsure of where to go since Igor had left her here to go greet Eva a couple stories down. She was evidently a surprise for Eva, as was the necklace, so she had to stay up here. \"Okay, where do I go now?\" She muttered to herself. She paused, her eyes locking on the only door in the hallway. Not feeling like she had anything to lose, she entered. To her surprise, there was actually someone in the room; another rabbit, who she deduced was Scamper. \"Hi.\" She spoke up. He noticed her. \"Did Brain send you?\" He sighed. \"No. I just, you know, figured since I didn't really meet you yet, I would take care of that. Tippi's the handle.\" \"Okay...I'm Scamper. Nice to meet you.\" \"Ditto.\" She sat down next to him on the couch. \"It's crazy that I'm actually meeting the rabbit who saved Malaria.\" He blushed. \"I wouldn't say that much.\" \"Yeah, you and Brain and Igor really did save us, and that's the word from the bird. Unfortunately, my old owner didn't think you were so boss. He really dug that Evil Science Fair idea. He hates music, anyways, so the music show thing wasn't for him. I dig it, though. I could spend hours listening to Buddy Holly or something. That guy is unreal. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, my old owner is just bad news right now. He needs to release all his gringles. His Sophie Lili, now she's a different story, but I'll clue you later.\" Scamper blinked. \"What was that?\" \"You people here really need to get hep.\" She rolled her eyes. \"I'm not even going to try and fathom what that means.\" \"Let's change the subject. So Eva has a new show. That's a large charge, right?\" \"I guess.\" \"You're really low, aren't you? You're a total odd ball.\" \"Says the one who at all times acts like she's from the '50s.\" \"DDT. So what if I'm a little kooky?\" \"What does 'DDT' mean?\" \"'Drop Dead Twice.'\" \"Believe me, I have. And it doesn't work.\" Tippi just laughed, not knowing that he was serious. \"That was a panic and a half, Scamper. You know, for an odd ball, you're all right.\" He smiled slightly. \"And you're not so bad for someone who talks like a lunatic.\" \"Tippi!\" Igor called. \"Come and meet Eva!\" \"Righto!\" She hollered back. She turned to Scamper once again. \"I'll see you later?\" \"Sure.\" He replied. \"Cool. Later!\" As she bounded down the stairs to get to the main floor, Scamper just sat there, a little confused. Maybe Tippi was better than he thought she was. His eyes widened. Actually, she was beautiful. Meanwhile, in the hallway, Brain watched, smirking. \"Yes! I finally got them together by painting over every door but this one. I am an evil genius.Now to go back to my room and celebrate.\" He murmured. He turned to open the door, but looking around, he couldn't spot it. \"What?! Where'd my door go?!\"[Chapter 4] A/N: This might be overly mushy because I'm listening to \"Freddy My Love\" from Grease as I write. Guilty as charged. Regardless, this is really important: I changed the ending of the last chapter! I decided that instead of having Tippi fall for Scamper, I wanted vice versa. So please keep that in mind! (Oh, and CityCat, you wanted some literal falling, so...) [Setting: Tippi's Bedroom...] Tippi laid down on her bed, a little panicked. When she was going out for a walk, she saw Madstein suffering the usual boyfriend abuse from Lili. She had laughed, but now that she thought about it, it was pretty frightening; what could he possibly be up to without her to monitor him? There was a knock at the door. She turned and saw Scamper holding a lone sunflower - they were growing all over now that there was sun in Malaria. \"Hey, bean.\" Tippi tried her best to be energetic, but thinking about Madstein still had her frazzled. \"Tippi.\" He smiled. \"You...look pretty today.\" \"Apple butter.\" She smirked. \"Is anything wrong? You've been up here ever since you got back.\" \"How'd you know when I got back?\" He lowered his eyes. She laughed. \"It's just a bit, Scamper, cool it. What's bugging you?\" \"Not much. I just wanted to see you. Is anything...bugging you ?\" \"Well, there is this one thing...Well, my old owner, he is an absolute hubcap, and he's planning to do something huge. He's just an actor, even though he has nothing to flaunt. Anyways, I saw him somewhere, and I knew if he saw me, he'd go ape, so I decided to cop a breeze before he cast an eyeball at me. But he's a goof, so I have very little gringles about him. Still...\" \"Don't be worried.\" Scamper reassured her, understanding the basic idea of what she was talking about. \"We're going to take care of you.\" \"Thanks.\" She smiled. \"I know you guys are earthbound. That reminds me, I was going to have lunch with Eva! Cool talking to you. See you later?\" \"Okay.\" He nodded. Tippi hopped off the bed. When trying to get past Scamper in the doorway, her long ear brushed against his cheek. A little weak, he slowly walked after her so as not to let her know he was following her. He looked down and saw the flower that had remained in his hand. Quickly, he ran back up to her room and left it on a table. He rushed back to the stairs, but he had lost her. With no time to waste, he started to run down the stairs, but tripped on one and fell in a heap, sliding down the stairs. As he lay sprawled out on the floor in pain, Igor walked by and noticed him. \"Scamper, what happened?\" He inquired, helping the rabbit up. \"Nothing.\" He replied, dusting himself off. \"Just fell. Hey, Igor?\" \"Yeah?\" \"How did you get Eva to fall for you?\" \"That's a good question. Even I don't know. I mean, what girl of any kind would have loved an Igor at that point in time? But I guess, after a while, we just clicked.\" \"So it took a while?\" \"Yes. Why are you asking me this?\" \"No reason. Let's just change the subject. So what do you think of Tippi?\" \"I think she's great, even though I can't understand her half the time.\" He chuckled. \"I'm kind of happy I found her. This 'old owner' she talks about makes me a little uneasy.\" \"What?\" \"He seems like kind of a jerk. He used to use her for experiments and testing. It endangered her constantly, but she's immortal, so she's safe. Still, it seems kind of like abuse, if you ask me.\" \"She doesn't deserve to be hurt like that.\" Scamper fumed. \"No one deserves to be hurt, Scamper.\" For a minute, Igor stood still, a vacant yet hurt look on his face, but he shook it off and turned his attention back to his friend. \"Well, that's what I think of her. What do you think of her?\" She's a divine creature who deserves only the best of everything, Scamper thought. \"She's all right.\" He replied. [Setting: A random room...] After her lunch with Eva, Tippi was wandering around the castle, a bit bored. She opened a door and found Brain underneath a zip line. He noticed her. \"Oh, hi, Tippi. How long have you been spying on me?\" \"Spying?\" She gulped. \"Brain, I-\" \"Just kidding!\" She sighed with relief. \"So what's buzzin', cousin?\" \"Well, don't you hate having to walk everywhere in this huge castle?\" \"I don't really mind. I like eyeballing the joint.\" He blinked. \"That was not the response I expected.\" \"Okay, yes, I do hate that.\" She decided to give him the desired response. \"So you admit it!\" Brain pointed accusingly at her, then retracted his arm and sighed. \"Brain, this is like when Igor told you to stop yelling at the mailman...just calm down...\" He murmured. His eyes immediately lit up again in a show of mood swings Tippi had never quite encountered before. \"So I decided to devise a zip line system around the house so you can get everywhere!\" \"But wouldn't you have to keep each and every door open all the time?\" \"Just test it out for me! We can work out all those technical bugs later!\" Tippi's shoulder twitched at the words \"test it out.\" Then it came back to her. [Flashback: over Madstein's pool...] \"What did you do?!\" Tippi exclaimed upon seeing the formerly crystal clear pool replaced with bubbling acid. \"Tippi,\" Madstein smiled, \"so glad you're here. I need you to test out the strength of this zip line.\" \"Over a pool of acid?!\" She panicked, then began to laugh. \"Ha! Madstein, you joker, you...\" \"No, I'm being serious, you're going over the acid.\" \"Wait, but why?\" \"I want this to be intentionally weak so the next person who tries to glide into the castle is met with a defective rope, a long fall, and some serious burns!\" \"So I'm sliding over a pool of bubbling acid on a defective rope?!\" \"Just go!\" He placed her on the small handle and pushed her. \"Forget Annette, Frankie,\" she screeched, \" I need you to help me out here right now!\" The rope eventually broke. \"Yes!\" Madstein exclaimed in victory. \" Help me !\" [Setting: A random room...] Small and insignificant as it was compared to what else she'd been through, Tippi had never forgotten that day. The plan didn't work after all; someone still broke into their castle, just not using the zip line. It didn't take a genius to realize that there are other ways in besides that one window. \"Brain, I'd rather not...\" She sniffed. \"Come on, Tippi,\" he beckoned, \"I'll be right under you the whole time! And I've got wheels, so I can go super-fast!\" He wheeled around the room at a lightning speed until he lost control of himself and, spinning, slid into a bookshelf. She laughed. \"Well, as long as you're going to be there the whole time.\" She slowly grabbed onto the handle and started flying through the room. \"This is actually kind of a blast!\" She called down to Brain. \"I told you so!\" He replied. Just then, the rope began to break. Tippi's heart nearly stopped. \"Oh, no.\" Brain groaned, going to catch her. The rope broke. She held onto it - and swung right into Scamper.[Chapter 5] A/N: Continuing from the last chapter. I've been away on vacation, so I haven't been updating anything; I did just put in a new Producers oneshot. Also, calling any Ghost World fans to read the probably oneshot I did for that. I'm also considering, once Tippi's finished, to do a Monsters Inc. story about teenage Boo. Just a thought. But back to Tippi. [Setting: A random hallway...] The two rabbits landed with a thump on the hard floor. \"Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry!\" Tippi helped Scamper up. \"That rope wasn't supposed to break, unlike others.\" She shuddered. \"That's got to hurt.\" Brain wheeled over to them. Scamper looked into her big, blue eyes. \"Are you salty?\" She asked. \"Cannibalism!\" Brain bellowed. \"No, nosebleed,\" she chuckled, \"I'm asking if he's mad. Get hep!\" \"Well, in that case,\" Scamper shook his head, \"I'm not.\" \"Cool. I'm getting a little tired. I think a nap's in order. See you later.\" As she walked away, Brain nudged his friend. \"Love hurts , eh, Scamper?\" \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" He replied. \"Whatever you say.\" He wheeled away, keeping his suspicious eyes on the rabbit until he crashed into a bookcase. \"I really need to stop doing that.\" He muttered, continuing on his way. Just then, Eva appeared upstairs, out of breath. \"What happened?\" She inquired. \"I came as fast as I could. I heard a huge crash upstairs and...\" She noticed the zip line. \"What's this?\" \"Brain's new zip line.\" Scamper answered. \"What is he working on now?\" \"I have a feeling you don't want to ask.\" \"Well, is anyone hurt? Stupid question. I know you and Tippi are immortal and Brain's very lucky.\" \"Hardly. So...what do you think of Tippi?\" \"She's great! I've wanted a female companion for so long. No offense, Scamper, but it's hard hanging out with boys all the time. I teach her all the songs from Funny Girl and teaches me all the songs from Guys & Dolls . I know it's unorthodox for animals to be in theater, besides in Annie , of course, but she would make a perfect Miss Adelaide.\" She noticed he looked confused. \"Adelaide is the beautiful showgirl fiancée of the gambler Nathan Detroit. It's a wonderful show!\" \"How's the show coming along?\" \"It is amazing, thank you for asking.\" She smiled. \"And Igor is being the most amazing supporter. I was talking to Tippi today and I told her that I could easily sing 'My Man' because I had someone to sing it to . That's arguably the hardest song in the whole show, you know.\" \"What did she say?\" He asked excitedly. \"She said she wished she was in a relationship like mine.\" \"Anyone in particular she's thinking about?\" \"No.\" Eva smiled coyly. \"Scamper, is there something you want to tell me?\" \"No.\" He replied quickly. \"Fine. But I did give her a little advice. I told her that the best thing to do is not rush into a relationship. Just in case you wanted to know that part too.\" Scamper walked away. She's onto me, he thought nervously. \"Rats!\" He heard Tippi exclaim from rooms over. He hurried over to the door to see if anything was wrong. \"What's wrong?\" He asked. \"Scamper?\" She noticed him. \"It's nothing. I just forgot to buy the chicken for dinner. Will you go out to the market with me?\" \"Sure.\" He replied. \"Thanks!\" She beamed. [Setting: A flea market...] Tippi sighed dreamily. \"This is my favorite place in the world. I always have a blast here just eyeballing it. Do you go here a lot?\" Scamper shook his head. Her gaze fell on a stand manned by an Igor. \"That's where I usually buy food. They only cost a thin one, but the Clyde who runs it, Mike, is kind of a wet rag. If we stay on his good side, we've got it made in the shade.\" He followed her to the stand. \"Mike?\" He noticed them, not bothering to smile. \"Tippi. How is life?\" \"Cloud 9, Mike. Can we have a chicken, please?\" \"Sorry. I have one reserved. You could buy it from me for, I don't know, five dollars?\" She looked down at her feet. \"All I brought was a thin one. I'll catch you later, Mike, okay?\" \"Sure.\" Scamper noticed the disappointment in the other rabbit's eyes. \"I don't want to make trouble,\" he attracted Mike's attention, \"but we need that chicken. Look at her. How can you say no to a face like that?\" Mike looked into Tippi's big eyes, then shook his head. \"I can't say no to her, you're right, but money? That you can't say yes or no to. It just comes and you grab it or lose it. I grab it. I say yes.\" \"Give us the chicken.\" \"No sale.\" He replied sternly, shutting a shade down right on Scamper's ears. The rabbit cried out in pain. \"Scamper!\" Tippi began stroking his tan ears softly to try and ease the pain. He smiled a little. If this is what it takes, then so be it. \"Why don't you cool it and I'll go look elsewhere for dinner?\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Yeah. I've got jets, don't I?\"'' \"I'm sure you do. All right, go.\" \"I'll meet you right here?\" \"Of course.\" \"Bye, Scamper!\" She hurried off. He sighed, watching her until she was out of sight. Realizing that he'd never actually been to this place before, he decided to look around. When he'd walked past at least ten stands, he came to a tent that caught his eye. The sign read \"MADAME LILI: MISTRESS OF THE STARS.\" Out of curiosity, he entered the tent. A beautiful blonde woman was gingerly painting her nails blue. \"Excuse me?\" Scamper tried to get her attention. She looked up at him. \"You're here for a vision?\" \"A vision?\" She rolled her eyes. \"Of courth you'd come unprepared. A vision. I'll find out what'th in your thoughth and your future. In fact, I knew you'd come to me today.\" \"I don't believe you.\" \"Well, why don't you thee what I can tell you? I will guarantee you that I'm right if you'll believe me.\" Should I? He stared down at the quarter that Tippi had given him in case she dropped what she had. \"How much?\" \"Whatever you have, dear.\" Without any word, she snatched the quarter out of his hand and pulled out one chair out of the two at her solitary table. \"Pleathe thit down.\" He did albeit reluctantly. She sat down in the chair across from him. \"I am Madame Lili, here to help you with the issueth of your life. Has anything been plaguing you?\" \"I'm not sure if 'plaguing me' is the right term for it...\" \"Ah. Tho now, I am going to senth what'th been plaguing you.\" She closed her eyes and put her head in her hands. \"I thenthe thomething...It'th a girl. You're worked up over a girl.\" Maybe she wasn't such a crackpot, he thought. \"Well, yes...\" \"Can you tell me what she'th like?\" \"She'th... she's beautiful. She's very kind to everyone and...and she always talks like she's from the 1950s.\" Madame Lili's head shot up, her doe eyes widened. \"What?\" \"She talks like she's from the 1950s.\" Scamper repeated. \"I thee...What color ith her fur? It'th one of your own, right?\" \"She has very pale fur. It's gray leaning into white.\" \"You're very hung up on her, aren't you?\" She smiled slyly. \"I can give you thome advith for that. You'll have her in your armth thooner than you can thay 'girlfriend.'\" He started pondering this situation deeply. Should I do what Eva said and wait for her or should I take Madame Lili's advice and strike now? He sighed. \"What?\" \"All '50th girlth love a thtrong guy they can lean on, thomeone who will make their entire exithtence bright. They want heartthrobth. I can help you with that.\" \"...You're sure?\" \"Of courth. A '50th bunny? She wanth Elvith. You're not handthome enough - I'm jutht being realithtic! I can't make you Elvith Prethley, but I can make you Conrad Birdie.\" \"Who?\" \"Don't worry, child. Ah, what'th your name?\" \"Scamper.\" He answered. \"Thcamper, come back to me tomorrow. What'th your girlfriend'th name?\" \"Tippi. And she's not my girlfriend.\" Madame Lili smirked. \"But she will be! Trutht me. I know her kind.\" \"How do you know?\" \"I told you I can work magic. And you didn't believe me.\"[Chapter 6] A/N: Finally returning to the fanfic front. Just been a little busy lately. Sorry for the short chapter. Includes an homage to a movie I love. Sorry it's not that great, but I can't keep you waiting any longer! [Setting: The \"humble\" abode of Igor and Eva...] After a long day of rehearsal, Eva headed home and found Igor sitting in the dining room. \"What'cha doing?\" She kissed him on the forehead. \"Waiting for dinner.\" He replied with a smile. She bit her lip. \"I'm really tired. I can't make anything.\" \"That's my gig!\" Tippi grinned, carrying in two plates of chicken. \"Sit down, Eva!\" Laughing, she sat down. \"Thank you so much!\" Tippi put the plates down and headed off. \"Eva...there's something I wanted to talk to you about.\" Igor began nervously. Eva dug into the chicken. \"Yes?\" She replied through a full mouth. He chuckled at this, how childlike she could still be. \"We've been together for a long time now...and you're my finest creation. I mean, really, my finest, because you're so beautiful, and because my others have all turned out to be annoying pests.\" \"No, they're not.\" She giggled. \"But continue.\" \"Eva, as my finest creation, my love, and my favorite actress...\" He crawled over to her, eventually settling on his one knee. \"Will you marry me?\" He took out a ring. Teras came to her eyes. \"Igor...of course I'll marry you!\" \"That's amazing!\" He rejoiced. He slipped the ring on, albeit nervously, and they embraced and kissed. \"I was thinking that the wedding could take place when the show is done.\" \"That would be perfect, Igor! Where are the others? We need to share this with them!\" Tippi, Scamper, and Brain emerged, clapping. \"We heard the whole thing.\" Brain smiled, wheeling over to Eva and elbowing her. \"You are one lucky lady to be marrying a handsome bugger like him.\" \"Come off it, Brain.\" Igor rolled his eyes. \"This calls for a celebration!\" Eva exclaimed. [Setting: Madame Lili's tent, the next day...] \"Thcamper.\" Madame Lili smiled. \"Tho I thee you've returned after all. How are you?\" \"I'm fine.\" Scamper sighed. \"The couple I live with just got engaged and we're all very happy, but it kind of reminds me how everyone else is in love but me. Well, except for Brain, but he's too in love with himself.\" \"Don't worry, I'm going to change all that.\" She sat him down in a chair. \"Now thit back and embrath the Birdie.\" \"What is this Conrad Birdie business?\" \"You've never heard of Bye Bye Birdie ?\" \"Never.\" \"Conrad Birdie ith the girl'th idol. They thwoon over him like crathy! If you want to win the heart of a '50th girl, you need to be a heartthrob. I thought I exthplained thith to you.\" \"Whatever it takes, Madame Lili.\" Once she was done with the makeover, Lili gave Scamper some instructions. \"Bring her to me tomorrow. That'll be the final thetp.\" \"Okay, Madame Lili. Thanks for everything.\" \"No problem, Thcamper.\" She grinned. Once he left, she looked up at the sky as if talking to another person. \"Kenneth, you've never loved me more than you do now.\" [Setting: The \"humble\" abode once again...] \"Where's Scamper?\" Tippi asked. \"You know, I don't know.\" Brain answered. \"He said he was going out, but I-\" Just then, he screamed. Someone rode in on a motorcycle, which made Tippi a little interested. Once it stopped, the rider revealed himself: it was Scamper in a gold suit. Tippi didn't know what it was, but he was suddenly a hundred times more attractive. \"Scamper...\" \"Hey, my little Dolly.\" He had no idea what he was saying, but Lili told him it would make sense to Tippi. \"You know, all this time, I've been wanting us to be jacketed, because you are the most.\" \"Scamper...you're a new person...I love it!\" Sure as Lili promised, the '50s bunny was going crazy. \"How about we go out to the market and I'll treat you to dinner?\" \"That would be like crazy! I'll go get cleaned up; I want to kill when we go out!\" She hurried off. Eva, who had been watching the whole time, approached Scamper slowly. \"Wow. She's fallen under your spell.\" \"It's great, isn't it?\" He grinned. \"But...don't you think it would be better if she loved you for you?\" \"If this is the only way, then so be it.\" \"I think you're making a mistake.\" He frowned. \"What other choice is there?\" [Setting: The market...] Scamper and Tippi walked, hand in hand, the perfect night coming to a close. \"Scamper...\" There were stars in her eyes. \"I think I'm real gone for you.\" \"Me too.\" He replied. \"And someday, we're going to get circled and have little ankle-biters.\" \"That would be like crazy.\" \"I know. I know.\" He spotted some flowers. \"Lay dead, baby. I'll be right back.\" She waited. In back of her were some stands and a tent, but she didn't notice them because she was carefully watching her beloved. So carefully, in fact, that she didn't see the hand emerging from the tent until it grabbed her and dragged her in. \" Scamper! Help! \" But he didn't hear.[Chapter 7] A/N: Yes, I am back after a long absence! I'm ready to continue with the story. [Setting: Madstein's Castle...] When the bag was lifted off of Tippi's head, she was face to face with the very last person she wanted to see: Dr. Madstein. \"Madstein!\" She exclaimed in horror. \"That's right, Tippi.\" He smirked at her. \"You must be wondering why I kidnapped you.\" \"Well, not really, I mean, I was cruising for a bruising when I decided to cut out. I knew you wouldn't dig it-\" \"Shut up!\" He slapped her. \"Now, as you know, Tippi, that Igor fellow you were staying with...he's the one who saved Malaria...from my future grip.\" \"Yeah, I'm hep.\" She nodded, trying to look fearless. \"You belong to me, you ungrateful thing. Now that you're back with me, I'm enlisting you to do something very important. Kill him.\" \"What?! Kill him?! But...but...he was like a keeper to me! I could never...And Eva! She was a real scooch. And Brain...he was just like the sweetest little ankle-biter, a little brother to me. And...and...and...and Scamper...\" \"Who's Scamper?\" \"...I am real gone for him. Whenever I look into his running lights, I see the word from the bird, and that's my future...with him.\" \"So you really like him, don't you?\" \"Yes...I do...\" Madstein's scowl turned into a twisted smile. \"If you won't kill the Igor, then I'll kill you.\" Tippi screamed in horror, but stopped immediately. \"Wait, I can't die, though.\" He frowned. \"Dammit! Uh...er...I'll think of a new plan!\" He pressed a button that created metal to hold her down. [Setting: Igor's place...] \"So where are we going to have the wedding?\" Eva asked Igor as he stroked her hair. \"Your choice, sweetheart.\" \"Well, I was thinking we could have it at the-\" \"Tippi!\" They turned to see Scamper in hysterics. \"What's wrong?\" Igor asked. \"It's Tippi! She's gone! I came back to where I left her, and she wasn't there! I looked everywhere for her, I screamed her name, nothing!\" \"She's gone?!\" Eva panicked. \"Scamper, she must still be somewhere. She wouldn't have left without you.\" \"What...what if she learned that my whole change was just a lie? That I was told to change by Madame Lili? Maybe she's disappointed in me...\" \"Maybe her old owner took her back.\" Igor realized in horror. \"What were their names?\" Eva tried to recall. \"Madstein and...\" \"Lili.\" Scamper filled in. \"Wait a second...Lili...how could I have been such an idiot?! Madame Lili used me to find her again!\" \"Scamper, show us where the tent was!\" They began to run out the door. \"Are you guys leaving without me?\" Brain sobbed loudly, appearing. \"I knew you all hated me!\" Igor rolled his eyes. \"We don't have time for this, just come on!\" \"Yaaaaaaaaaay!\" He wheeled outside, following them. [Setting: Madstein's Castle...] Please rescue me, guys, thought Tippi desperately, but she didn't know how they could. She was going to be tortured. It was times like this that made her wish she could die and get it over with. \"Tippi!\" She turned and saw Madstein coming back into the room, a smug smile on his face. \"I've decided what to do with you. Since I can't kill you, I'm going to replace your brain so that you can't remember anything of your little friends, especially not your little boyfriend. Then I'll make you kill Igor because you won't remember how in his debt you are. And the best part? I'll make them watch as you slowly forget everything.\" All she could do was continue to think of rescue...but she knew it wasn't a possibility anymore.

I'm not really committed to th"},{"Movie":"Creature from the Black Lagoon","Title":"Dark Universe: Creature from the Black Lagoon","Author":"Goku vs. Superman","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12962452","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Actors portraying characters: Dr. Charles – John Kapelos, Afonso – Diogo Morgado, Guilherme – Jose Fidalgo Creature from the Black Lagoon Female voice opens, \"Creation by God, the Big Bang Theory, whatever it is you choose to believe, we can all agree on one thing: our world can be ugly and we have to look deep inside, through the ugliness, to find the beauty beneath.\" An elderly man is standing at the bank of a large river, the river in front of him and a tent behind him, his arms are crossed as he stares at the water with a scowl. \"Show yourself damn you,\" he says harshly to the water. \"Professor Lawrence!?\" A young man cries out from behind Dr. Charles Lawrence. Charles turns to see the young Brazilian man come from the lush of green leading back to civilization. \"What is it, Afonso?\" Afonso grins as he walks to Charles. \"I should ask you the same thing.\" Charles turns back to scowl at the water. \"What are you doing, Professor?\" Afonso asks in an exhausted manner as he stands next to Charles. \"Waiting, my boy,\" Charles answers stoically. Then with some irritation in his voice he tells Afonso, \"And hoping those Prodigal bastards, or whatever they're called, don't return to take my research.\" Afonso sighs. \"Sir, all your research was about the Creature after they had killed her.\" Charles whips to Afonso, pointing a finger at the young man. \"There is no proof that she is dead. They only took her arm.\" He put his hands on his hips and looked out to the river. \"'The Creature from the Black Lagoon' may still be alive.\" Afonso chuckles and states his opinion, \"That is such a silly name for a monster,\" he too staring out at the water. \"Professor, if the creature is still alive then it would have shown itself by now like it had before those Agents of Shield guys killed it, but it hasn't.\" \"Not true, Afonso. The creature must be weary of humans after such a traumatic experience; and yet, I must not cease my search, despite the actions of those 'scientists' who dared to call themselves educated men.\" Afonso turns back to Charles and asks, \"Why is it so important for you to find this thing?\" \"If the creature is indeed dead, then what those men were wrong to have done such a tragedy; not because they killed an innocent creature for 'research', but because of the potential evolutionary theories this creature could possess. If we are connected to this…fish-man, then our current theories would be undermined and our understandings forever changed. It's possible we may have actually found the missing link.\" \"And if it's not half-man?\" Charles chuckles. \"Always a man of religion, aren't you, Afonso?\" Afonso smirks. Charles relaxes and shifts to face his companion. \"If this creature is not the missing link, then at least we will have discovered a potential new genus of mammals or homo sapiens. Regardless, its discovery will be groundbreaking, completely reshaping the world.\" Afonso whistles and goes to Charles' tent. \"That's a bit heavy handed, don't you think?\" \"You and I have very different ideas of 'heavy handed'.\" Charles jokes and follows Afonso into the tent. Upon entering the tent, Charles sees Afonso packing up his possessions. Before Charles could question why or protest— \"You need to go back home to America, Professor,\" said Afonso. \"Yes, I know, but,\" Charles stops Afonso, \"I am staying here for one more week.\" Afonso smiles and says, \"Good.\" He puts down the items in his hands and continues to talk to Charles. \"My brother, myself, and all of Brazil will miss you.\" Charles smirks and asks, \"'All of Brazil'?\" Afonso sits on a chair, \"Well, all of Portugal, at least.\" The two then spent the rest of the evening talking and enjoying whiskey. Afonso stands from his chair and questions Charles about his letter to his favorite student back in America. \"I will not be writing my final letter to him, instead, I will wait until I arrive back in the states and tell him about my failure here.\" \"Oh, don't call it a failure, Charles.\" Another young man comes into the tent. \"It's about time you showed, Guilherme.\" Charles replies. Guilherme turns to Afonso, \"Are you ready to go, brother?\" \"I am,\" Afonso gives his attention back to Charles. \"Are you going back to your hotel tonight?\" \"Not tonight, I think I will spend one more night here.\" Charles looks around the tent fondly. Guilherme asks Afonso, \"So, you convinced him to go back home next week?\" The brothers bump fists. \"Out! Out the both of you!\" Charles chases them out of his tent in a mock fashion. \"Will we be seeing you tomorrow for breakfast?\" Guilherme questions. \"Yes, regrettably so.\" The young men laughed as they proceeded to go back home. \"Goodnight, Professor.\" \"Goodnight, Charles.\" \"Goodnight, boys.\" Hours later, from the river in front of Charles' tent, a scaly webbed hand arose from the water with elongated nails, bright silver scales, and a dark bluish-gray hue starting at the top of its middle finger going back. Charles is asleep on his cot in the tent. The sound of a low gurgling growl awakes Charles. Charles groans as he slowly comes to reality, he sits up, rubs his eyes, and sees something in his tent. \"What on earth!?\" A loud roar comes from the tent and is followed by Charles screaming.[Chapter 2] Daniel Reed - Kendall Schmidt, Kaitlyn Maria - Zoey Deutch, Matthew Wilkens - Nicholas Hoult Daniel wakes up to his phone's alarm. He stands from his dorm bed, in nothing but boxers, and stretches. His room is of a standard single dorm room, clean and well kept by his attentiveness. Daniel turns off his alarm and goes to a terrarium with a grey rat snake inside. He leans down to the snake's level and greets the animal. \"How's it going this morning, David?\" The snake flutters its tongue. \"How would you like it if I got you Kaitlyn's gerbil for lunch?\" David lifted his head, as if he understood. Daniel chuckles and then proceeds to start his day with a shower. Minutes later, after his shower, a knock comes from his door. \"Who is it!?\" He asks loudly, yet politely, from his desk. \"R.A.!\" The Dorm R.A. calls from the hall. \"Got some mail for you, Daniel!\" Daniel walks to his door and opens it for his mail. \"Here ya go,\" the R.A. hands him the mail. \"Thanks, man,\" Daniel responds. The R.A. says, \"No problem,\" and continues down his trek with his mail cart. Daniel shuts his door and sorts through his mail. He sighs. \"Come on, Dr. Charles.\" Later, Daniel comes into his girlfriend's apartment and sees her dancing to Someone to Call My Lover . She closes her eyes and begins jumping in a circle, swinging her head back and forth. She turns her back to Daniel and he starts dancing along, copying her moves. She turns around again, but opens her eyes to see Daniel. She shrieks, hastily shuts her music off, and laughs with Daniel. Daniel holds her in his arms; the two stop laughing and stare lovingly. Daniel smirks. \"Really, Kaitlyn? Someone to Call My Lover ?\" Kaitlyn smiles and tells him to shut up. \"What?\" He chuckles. \"Am I not your lover!?\" She throws her head back with an, \"Oh my God!\" She feigns exasperation. \"That was the cringiest question.\" Daniel pulls her closer and they kiss. Minutes later, the two are sitting on Kaitlyn's couch drinking beer. Kaitlyn sitting in the middle with her legs over Daniel's lap. \"So,\" Kaitlyn starts playing with Daniel's hair, \"have you heard from Dr. Lawrence?\" Daniel looks down, discontent and tells her, \"No. It's been a while since I last heard from him. He was supposed to be back by now. He should've called me or something.\" Kaitlyn smiles and reassures Daniel, he is Dr. Lawrence's student, not wife. Daniel bops her face with a pillow. Kaitlyn laughs and the two start wrestling. \"Can I give your gerbil to David for lunch? I promised him.\" \"No!\" At Prodigium: Dr. Jekyll walks into his office with files of paper, followed by Matthew. \"What makes you think this will happen, Mr. Wilkens?\" Jekyll asks, as he comes to his desk. Matthew clears his throat. \"If you knew this…colleague,\" he exaggerates the word, \"of mine, you would not be questioning the validity of my assumption.\" Jekyll slams the papers onto his desk. \"And there lies the problem. 'Assumption'; that's all this is, nothing more.\" \"Doctor, please. The probability of this not happening is exceptionally inferior in comparison.\" Dr. Jekyll sees the flame in Matthew's eyes. \"IF you are correct, then you have my permission to pursue.\" He sits at his desk. \"And if I am incorrect?\" Matthew pries. \"Then nothing,\" Jekyll smiles mockingly.[Chapter 3] New characters this chapter: Richard - Anders Holm, Julie - Jillian Bell, and Mrs. Lawrence - Cloris Leachman In the evening: Daniel and Kaitlyn are on a double date with two of Kaitlyn's friends, Richard and Julie, at a pub. The couples are adjacent to their significant other in the booth. \"Well, how does it feel to be in your last semester?\" Julie asks the couple, smiling already knowing the answer. Kaitlyn replies with a large grin, \"Like I'm ready to use my diploma on video production to hunt the supernatural!\" She states triumphantly. Richard chuckles. \"Does that even pay?\" \"It better,\" says Daniel, teasingly. Kaitlyn feigns shock and gently elbows Daniel's ribs. \"Easy there. Not all of us want to be Marine Biologists, okay?\" Richard requests Daniel to pronounce his field of study. Daniel pronounces slowly, \"Ichthyologist.\" Richard shakes his head. \"I'll never be able to pronounce that.\" The four laugh and minutes roll by with food and drinks. \"Kaitlyn told me that your advisor is missing.\" Julie uncouthly brings up the sensitive topic. Kaitlyn looks to her with wide eyes, as if to ask \"what the hell?\" Julie quickly apologizes and pushes her drink away from herself; as drinking makes her blunt and careless. The mood became solemn as Daniel gazes at his food in contemplation, while also pushing down any negative feelings. Daniel clears his throat, brings his attention back to the group, and tells Julie to not apologize. \"I don't know if he is missing. All I know is that he should've been back already…if something has happened, then I should get a call from his wife soon.\" The somber mood continues until… \"Let's get you a shot,\" Richard says to Daniel. \"See how much of a fish you really are.\" Daniel chuckles. \"All right, let's do it.\" The night continues on happily until the next morning. Morning in Daniel's dorm room: Daniel wakes with a hangover, his phone blaring in his ears like a rock concert in an auditorium. \"Damn you, Dick.\" He curses Richard. Answering his phone with a groggy \"Hello\", Daniel is met with the weeping of Mrs. Lawrence. He looks at his phone, seeing her name on the screen; the severity of this moment sobering him. \"Mrs. Lawrence?\" He asks, with hesitation and unease. \"Oh, Daniel,\" Mrs. Lawrence squeezes out before her crying takes over once more. Days later, Daniel and Kaitlyn attend the funeral of Dr. Charles Lawrence. Daniel spoke to many family members of Charles', most importantly with Mrs. Lawrence. Daniel hugs Mrs. Lawrence and asks if there's anything she needs. \"My husband,\" she responds with a heartsick smile. Daniel kisses her on the cheek, earning a genuine chuckle from the new widow. Mrs. Lawrence looks to the floor, sighs, brings her eyes back to Daniel and says, \"I more than likely should not be telling you this, but…Charles' work was taken after he died.\" \"What!?\" Daniel holds back his anger, as to not cause a scene. Kaitlyn rushes to his side and quietly shushes him, holding his arm in support. Daniel asks at a lower tone, \"Who stole his work?\" \"I don't know,\" Mrs. Lawrence clears her throat. \"All I know is that they had intervened before. Some agency called…oh, they were named…Prodigious, I believe.\" Daniel nods, kisses her hands, says his goodbyes, and storms out of the church. In the car ride back to Kaitlyn's apartment, the couple is having an argument. Kaitlyn yells, \"You are not going to Brazil!\" \"Yes I am!\" Daniel fires back. \"I cannot let what happened to him go without SOME consequence!\" \"If you go there, the only consequence will be your death!\" Daniel glares furiously at the road as he drives. \"Nice, Kaitlyn, very nice.\" \"Well, I'm sorry, but I don't want you to be killed by the same person or thing that killed Charles.\" \"I won't be killed!\" \"How do you know!?\" \"I'm going to take extra precaution!\" Kaitlyn feigns a smile, appalled by what she was hearing. \"You're going to take a weapon to kill someone or something?\" \"Whatever or whoever killed Dr. Charles deserves what is coming to them.\" Kaitlyn had never heard such determination come from Daniel before; she stares at him in shock and disbelief… \"Okay…I guess there's no talking you out of this.\" \"Thank you,\" says Daniel, his demeanor calming from his previous rage. They then made it to Kaitlyn's apartment. \"I'm coming with you,\" says Kaitlyn. Daniel is now the one shocked. \"What?\" \"I'm. Coming. With you.\" Daniel furrows his brows. \"No.\" \"Yes.\" Kaitlyn exits the car. Daniel gets out of the car. \"No!\" He says a bit sardonically. Kaitlyn shoots back with the same snarky attitude, \"Yes!\" \"Kaitlyn. No.\" She rushes to Daniel. \"What am I supposed to do without you, huh? What am I supposed to do if you die!? Huh!? Tell me!\" Daniel slams the car door. \"I don't know!\" He crosses his arms and leans against the door, frustrated by the situation. His face his cupped by her hands. \"I want this relationship to go further than just dating,\" Kaitlyn confesses. \"Don't you?\" He puts his hands over hers. \"I do.\" They lock eyes. \"Then I'm coming with you to Brazil. I can help you and you know I can.\" \"I just don't want you to be in danger.\" Kaitlyn chuckles. \"I want to be a paranormal investigator. I'm going to get into dangerous situations.\" Daniel chuckles as well. They share a kiss and the two agree to go to Brazil together. That night, Matthew dials on a flip phone. \"Yes, Mr. Wilkens?\" Jekyll answers on the other end. \"He is going as I presumed,\" Matthew reports. \"Then do as you planned. You have my permission to pursue this case.\" Matthew thanks Jekyll and hangs up the phone with a proud grin.[Chapter 4] Security Officer - Octavia Spencer. \"Grandpa\" - Richard Jenkins. Daniel opens the door to Kaitlyn's apartment and sees her standing in her kitchen talking to Matthew. This catches him off guard and slightly angers him, but he keeps his composure. Kaitlyn smiles and says, \"Hey, babe.\" \"Hey,\" Daniel replies and hugs her when she jogs over to him. Matthew comes to Daniel and puts out his hand. \"Hello, Daniel.\" \"Hi, Matthew,\" Daniel shakes his hand. When the two stop shaking hands, Kaitlyn claps her hands together. \"Guess what,\" she beams at Daniel. Daniel smirks and turns to her. \"What?\" \"Matthew is coming with us!\" Daniel puts his hand on her shoulder and asks, \"Can I talk to you outside?\" Kaitlyn agrees and the two start to go outside. \"I told you, you should have consulted him first,\" Matthew tells Kaitlyn. \"What he said,\" Daniel adds before he closes the door. Kaitlyn apologizes and adds, \"I really should have said something to you first.\" Daniel widens his eyes and patronizingly says, \"Oh yeah you should've.\" Kaitlyn's mouth hangs agape with surprise and irritation. \"Excuse me? You don't have to be so condescending to me.\" \"I'm sorry, but why the hell is he coming along anyways!?\" \"He's my friend and loves this kind of stuff and has a biology major, why isn't he coming!?\" \"I just don't like him, especially not with you alone.\" Kaitlyn rolls her eyes. \"Oh my god, how many times do I have to tell you that he doesn't like me anymore?\" Daniel sighs and looks away from her, to the parking lot of the apartment building…searching his feelings, not wanting Matthew to go along, wanting to make Kaitlyn happy, and wondering if this was a bad idea to start with. \"Well?\" \"Fine.\" \"Good.\" She went to the door. \"Now, stop sulking.\" She opens the door with a big smile for Matthew. \"You're going!\" Matthew smiles back. \"Great.\" Jekyll received a text from Matthew that read, 'Success'. Jekyll messaged back, 'Success of what?' 'My mission to Brazil, sir.' Jekyll furrowed his brows in confusion and rubbed his palm against his mouth. 'Was there a probability of you not traveling to Brazil for the mission?' 'With all due respect, sir, I feel as if that is inconsequential at this point.' 'Incorrect. You should prepare for defenestration.' 'This will not happen again, sir.' The next week: Daniel, Kaitlyn, and Matthew are going through airport security. Matthew is first to go through the metal detector, followed by Daniel, and then Kaitlyn. Daniel accidentally bumps into Matthew. Matthew sighs. Daniel gets agitated. \"What? It was an accident.\" He said with an attitude. \"I'm sure that it was,\" Matthew replies with some attitude as well. \"It was,\" Daniel raises his voice. \"Are we gonna have a problem, you two!?\" The female security officer asks. Daniel and Matthew brush off the incident and continue down the line. When Matthew goes through the detector, the security officer tells him she likes her white boys tall. Daniel goes through and is given a 'random' check with the security officer's wand. She looks at Daniel's ass as she scans him and then lets him go on. Kaitlyn comes through with her arms crossed, sneering at the security. \"What you glaring at, lil white girl?\" Kaitlyn rolls her eyes and continues on. \"Mm-hmm, that's what I thought.\" She turns to see an older man standing behind the detector. \"Let's go, grandpa, we ain't got all day!\" In the plane, Daniel hands Matthew Kaitlyn's bags, telling him she wants the window seat. Matthew puts her bags up in the overhead compartment and when he bends down to get his, Daniel puts his bag inside and informs Matthew that he is sitting in the middle. \"Of course,\" Matthew politely says. He puts his bag in last and sits next to Daniel. After the first few hours, Kaitlyn falls asleep on Daniel's shoulder listening to music as he watches a movie with his head leaned against hers and his arms folded under his chest, while Matthew sits cross-legged reading a book. When they arrive, Daniel wakes Kaitlyn up and tells her they arrived. Kaitlyn smiles out the window. \"Say hello to Brazil, boys.\" The two sarcastically say, \"Hello, Brazil.\" They grin at her after saying this. She grins back and says, \"I hate you both.\" ","Summary":" Actors portraying characters: Dr. Charles – John Kapelos, Afonso – Diogo Morgado, Guilherme – Jose "},{"Movie":"Creature from the Black Lagoon","Title":"Memories and Encounters","Author":"Writing1sLife","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13212043","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"Beginnings\" Genesis 1 – 1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.

And the evening and the morning were the second day. 9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. 10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. 11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. 12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. 13 And the evening and the morning were the third day. 14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: 15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. 16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. 17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. 19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. 20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. 21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. 22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. 23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. 24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. 25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. 26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. 29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. 30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. 31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. . . . . . Genesis2 – 1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. 2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. 3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. 4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, 5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground. 6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. 7 And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. 8 And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. 9 And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. 10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads. 11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone. 13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. 14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates. 15 And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. 16 And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: 17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. 18 And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. 19 And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof. 20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him. 21 And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; 22 And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. 23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. 24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. 25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed. . . . . . Genesis 3 – 1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? 2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: 3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. 4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. 6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. 7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. 8 And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. 9 And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? 10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself. 11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? 12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. 13 And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. 14 And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: 15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. 16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. 17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; 19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. 20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. 21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them. 22 And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever: 23 Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. 24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life. . . . . . . . This was how the Earth came into being. God spoke and it was. Nothing like it has ever occurred since for only God ever had such power and the knowledge and understanding of both what is good and evil clouds the mind of man. Man cannot create like his creator for he is a flawed being and this drives him to do many things: to explore, to discover, to pursue; an almost never-ending search for truth. Man is a driven being; one who is forever pushing the boundaries of what he does and does not know. This is one such tale of the pursuit for that which cannot be truly explained nor understood for it is beyond the feeble limited mind of man to comprehend it even as he tries to do so.[Chapter 2] \"It's important?\" The time was the past. But to some things in this world, time has no meaning. Though they live, they do not comprehend time as we do nor do they try to. The location was some new piece of land formed by the incredible event brought down to destroy the Earth called the Flood. On the smooth, glistening, wet sand, something appeared in the moonlight that seemed out of place. It was a shape imprinted into the sand that resembled a foot like that of a man and yet no living man had, as of yet, set foot on this beach since the great event. A trail of them lead from the water on to the beach headed in towards the interior of the land, and there was no one there to see whatever had come out of the water. . . . . . . . He traveled all over the world looking for things in the earth. That was his interest and trade for Carl Maia was a geologist, and he would forever be that until the day that he died for there were answers to riddles there and he longed to uncover all that he could. He had long ago reached the unalterable belief that the record of much of life, if not all of it, was written in the earth and the land. The planet itself was a massive record of life just waiting to be read in full and Carl Maia had made it his life mission to uncover all of it. And thus it was, in the headwaters of the Amazon, that he found himself still trying to reach as far into the past as he could successfully. It did not get that much more difficult than this. The ground was virtually hidden from site by vegetation and the trees took up what the plants themselves did not cover and, of course, men were chopping the whole place down faster than it could grow and this all came together to make things very complicated and difficult. Because of what was going on, the terrain kept changing and there was no telling what was obliterated in the process. At the same time, one had to remember that the ground was unstable and forever in a state of disarray, so the trick was getting there before something happened. Hard to believe that tracking an earthquake or tornado could actually be easier than this, but he had never liked something if there was not some challenge. A challenge made life worthwhile in the life of Carl Maia. And he never went anywhere without his two friends Luis and Thomas. They helped him look for anything unusual, helped account for transportation and supplies, and chiefly provided much enjoyed companionship. He found it very difficult to go anywhere without the two men for they were family and anchors for they helped him keep from falling as they did not have their heads to close to the earth as he did. They had been there a number of days, when the peace that reigned in the jungle, despite the sounds of wildlife, was shattered by Luis. Thomas had been out searching for fruit when he heard his friend yelling for him. He ran as fast he could towards the sound. He raced past the tent towards where his friend was staring in horror on the ground towards a cliff face. Carl came from the tent with his camera and equipment to try and quickly spot what his friend had been startled by. \"Please,\" he asked of one of the other two men who had accompanied him with his friends as he reached out tentatively to touch the fascinating thing as people were want to do in order to confirm if something was actually a part of reality. The man stepped aside upon spotting the camera which Carl promptly focused upon the object which was made horrifying both by appearance and the fact that it stretched out from the cliff face. A most unnatural sight. It looked like some horrific hand, but it was impossible to determine anything right off the bat. \"Wha-What that is Dr. Maia?\" This came from Luis with a hint of trembling. \"I do not know Luis,\" was the reply as Maia with practiced precision primed the camera. \"I have never borne witness to a sight such as this before in my whole life.\" \"It's important then?\" Luis could not see how such a thing was important given its appearance, but then he did not understand or see the world as the doctor did, so he did not question his judgement too thoroughly. \"I believe that it is; very, very important.\" He snapped a picture and readied the camera again. \"We shall take just one more picture and then dig it out.\" He did precisely as he said trading the camera for a pickaxe which Luis passed to him. The man delicately set to work with experience honed by years of study in academics and long labor in the field to retrieve valuable samples intact so as to get the best information. The \"hand\" came loose relatively easily, much to the relief of Carl, for he did not desire to have to struggle for hours on end. He held it in his hands and the men crowded around to get a better look. For a minute all were silent before Maia spoke with feverish joy and glowing eyes. \"Luis, I am going to Marajo Bay. I am going straight to the institute. You two men are to remain here in the camp and keep this area free of disturbance. I am clear yes?\" Both Thomas and Luis nodded though it was Luis who asked the question on both minds. \"Will you be gone for very long?\" \"Just long enough to find out precisely what this is. And get help in digging out the rest of the skeleton that is surely buried somewhere in this very spot.\" He walked back to tent cradling his prize and gazing at it in wonder. \"I want a man to remain in the camp at all times,\" he instructed, one foot positioned across the threshold and through the flap of the tent. \"Luis, I am ultimately leaving you in charge.\" The rest of the day passed uneventfully, but that was ultimately a blessing to the men. Carl in particular felt this most, for he could hardly wait to depart and seek answers to the many riddles and questions plaguing his mind. Nobody noticed anything…yet something noticed them.[Chapter 3] Misunderstood Life went on just like normal, though it had been several days since Carl had left with his find to the Institute. Supplies were used for food, and if they wished for something different, the men knew how to hunt. There were cards to play, and of course the sounds of the Amazon to listen to. They took turns going out to collect wood for the fire and anything else they might desire. Life went on in a simple fashion with absolutely no disturbances to the camp site or the cliff face Carl had removed the \"hand\" from. It was night now; the time when certain creatures came out and stalked through the trees, or on the ground amongst the vegetation and earth. Some creatures even flew when the sun set, but nothing approached the camp. The men paid it no mind. Thomas was lying shirtless on his cot, while Luis cleaned up the machetes and rifles, before beginning to prepare for bed himself. Outside, the water at the bank stirred, ripples appearing in the moonlight. In the light of the moon, the liquid almost had a black appearance; an appearance that fitted the dripping object that emerged: a hand. But no human hand had the same appearance as the skeletal remains dug up by Carl Maia a week back. It emerged onto the bank and began to take sticky, dripping, wet steps towards the object of its curiosity: the tent with the light emanating from it. Luis had just finished with his final task for the night and was about to at last give in to the desire for bed. A noise stopped him. Something was grunting or making some alien noise. An animal? What in the world would make such a noise that would make his blood freeze and his heart skip a beat? In the dim light of the lantern, a horrific object poked through the opening in the tent flaps probing about before settling on the partially open right flap. The light glistened and caught on what looked like… claws . \"Tho-Thomas…\" Luis' voice was alien to his own ears so great was his terror. Thomas jolted upright and froze at the sight of the appendage that terrified his companion. Luis desperately grabbed the lamp and threw it. The thing gave an angry howl at the thrown object, thrust fully into the tent. Despite the absence of the light, Luis could see it fully and gasped. \"No.\" It came closer. \"No…\" then he screamed as the thing shrieked and grabbed him by the face. The tent shook viciously as Thomas was hurled from his bunk to the other side of the tent. The thing menacingly advanced towards the man with clear intent. His frantic hands found a machete and he swung it with desperate strength. His hand was caught in a grip of unbelievable strength, then he was violently yanked down on to the ground and pinned. He fought in the dark with all his might, but his adversary was stronger than his muscles and strength honed by physical labor. Shrieks, screams, and grunts emanated from the shaking tent. After a time, there was silence. Throughout the rest of the night, silence reigned. The tent was not approached by anything, not even in broad daylight. Not that day, or any day after.[Chapter 4] \"One word: Why?\" As his hand moved, writing flowed freely on to paper from pen. His hand was old and withered compared to the smoothness of his flesh at birth. His hand did not shake surprisingly. The horror of what he was describing, and his age, by all rights, should be interfering with his ability to properly write and remember. There were times where he wished that he could forget. Why was it that nightmares faded so slowly compared to beautiful dreams? Maybe it was because the sin that pervaded this world was never-ending in its pursuit. His name was Carl Maia, and he was writing his own memory on to paper; a memory that was black and sad indeed. Why? The pen continued to write. Why did I go down to the Amazon? I went because I was seeking knowledge that lay buried in the earth. But what I did not expect to find was that horrific appendage embedded in the cliff. It resembled a hand but what kind of a hand possessed such an inhuman appearance? I took photographs and then removed it from the cliff. Burdened with a prize like none that I had ever known, I made ready that very evening to head off to the institute of Marajo Bay. My sole purpose for my hasty departure was the acquiring of an expedition and crew to help me dig up the rest of the remains. I would gain much intrigue and attention from an old student of mine and his boss. Dr. David Reed was an Ichthyologist and was looking towards the future with promise of marriage and a family in due time. He looked to the future with hope, for science and himself; his superior in the institute, Mark Williams, was something of a different matter. He looked to the future with the ideas of attention and wealth. He was a single man, and this created a lack or void within him as I look back now. Perhaps here, in the institute itself, began a descent into blackened and uncertain waters. I will never truly know. Reed was very much interested in the potential of finding something that would advance the cause of science in discovering more about our world; Williams was thinking only of the fame and fortune that could result from an incredible find that no-one knew of apart from him. Our return was something of a bitter one, unlike the original beginning which was filled with hope among many mixed emotions. The one who was most bitter of us was Williams, who thought of nothing but success, while the rest understood we were taking a chance, yet that was part of what discovery was. Our arrival was greeted with silence most disturbing. My return did not get answered by the two men I left in the camp Luis and Thomas. Ultimately, to my horror, they had been killed. The tent was in a state of utter disarray with objects smashed and destroyed, slashed fabric, and two bodies that had been grievously wounded unto death in an exceedingly violent manner. It resembled the attack of an animal with dangerously sharp claws. I knew not what could cause this, but I could not bear to look but for so long, for the nature of their death was too terrible to imagine in my mind. We quietly did our best to put the incident out of our minds and set to work but unveiled nothing from the cliffside. Then I remembered that my boys told me that there was a lagoon at the end of the tributary we had camped at. We journeyed to the end of the water and found that, true against all odds, the lagoon existed. What we never imagined was that something followed us there. It eluded our best attempts to even see it and killed one of the shipmates that belonged on the vessel. Ultimately, even before this to be precise, events began to reveal to us that not all was as it appeared and around the same time, Reed and Williams began to butt heads. When we finally did manage to catch a glimpse of the source of our nightmares and fears, Williams pursued a far more aggressive agenda, while Reed fought with all his might to bring it back alive. Then they began to argue about course to take from there. Despite successfully capturing the strange being, another man died before we could secure it. Then, while we were absent from the boat, our \"prisoner\" escaped and viciously attacked Dr. Thompson as he attempted to drive it away. It surely would have killed him had Kay Collins not desperately thrown an oil-filled lamp at it, setting it ablaze and making it desperately jump into the water to put out the flames. We became victims of our own ship. The water itself held unknown terror for us, and even in the light of day, we never felt safe. How could we? Everything that held us together began to unravel. The conflict between Reed and Williams grew so heated as to threaten to explode into full-blown physical violence. Dr. Thompson would live despite his injuries if he managed to pull through, but his handsome face would be forever ruined. Kay was like a flower that was wilted before a blast of cold air. Mark had ultimately grown cold and calculating, indifferent to anything except the object of his agenda. I was no longer certain that I wanted anything to do with this place. All I wished was to leave. As for Lucas our captain, he remained an outside presence that acted only when he was included. Personally, I believe he was willing to depart with all the speed he had. Ultimately harsh words were exchanged by the two men, two champions of different beliefs and ways of life that would not, or could not, see eye to eye. David was for departing the place with all speed that we possessed. Mark was incredulous at the very mention of the idea. To depart without what we came for? Yet as David was quick to point out, we never came to this place to struggle against a being whose nature defied our understanding; we were scientists who had come seeking answers to a riddle. Later on we could come back prepared for something like what lived in this place, and that was indeed most reasonable logic and thought to me. Mark spoke out quite vehemently against it and said that none of us would leave until we had our prize. David promptly spoke him down and told Lucas our captain to get us ready for departure. Mark was prepared to physically coerce the captain into following only his word but was stopped quite calmly by the captain in a simple fashion. With a smile, Lucas drew a knife and gently put it point first under Mark's chin and asked if he wished to say anything else. To this, Mark had truly no choice but to relent as it was obvious that not one single shred of authority he might possess would be recognized. He was left standing there realizing that no one would follow, obey, or listen to him and that all were truly against him. The return trip was uneventful. Williams stayed away from all of us with an angry, bitter scowl the whole way. David and Kay remained together, having an expression akin to hope, faint, but still there nonetheless in their eyes. All, it was obvious apart from Mark, would not feel safe until we had departed the jungle entirely. Just as we got near the entrance of the lagoon, I noticed from my vantage point at the bow a great dam placed right in front of our only exit. We were fortunate the boat did not wreck itself, but we were completely trapped, unable to leave unless it was removed. This drove Mark to insist that we remain and get the evidence of what had happened, otherwise no-one would believe anything that we said. This in all truth was because Mark Williams was a man who would accept nothing less that total success. David Reed was more concerned with our lives over the belief of other people. Ultimately this marked the start of terrorization by our jailer, for no sooner had Lucas ascertained that no damage had been inflicted to the vessel than one of the life boats was destroyed. Uselessly I shot at it, but nonetheless it fled, its objective complete for the moment. We were trapped, helpless, hopeless, and with its eyes always on us, there was no chance of escape. We tried in vain to remove the obstacle in our way. Whether by human error, or interference from the being, the winch lost its grip on the massive load of debris and we remained prisoners. Reed concluded that he had no choice but to go into the water and ultimately restore the cable around the debris. Williams was quite insistent, eager even, on helping, but I would learn later that it was only to continue to push his cause forward. The two men came to blows and this led to all respect or restraint between them falling apart with Williams throwing the first punch; only for a very determined Reed to retaliate with a stunning series of blows. I do not believe that what hurt was the physical blow, but the knowledge that Reed had the courage and the drive to stand up to him without any hesitation. David proceeded as intended without Mark, only for Mark to ironically save him when the creature noticed what David was trying to do and Williams shot at it with a spear gun driving it away. Williams would chase after it and manage to shoot the creature, but it got away. The only thing that stopped him was running out of air and David. When they resurfaced, the two immediately were all but at each other's throats with Reed, supported by us, to trying to reason with Mark. He was all for heading out as soon as the tanks were full again, but he was gunned down by our verbal rejection. He was left to stalk way from us with great anger. We were ready to depart but David was unsure if the cable was secure and the light had begun to fade. David would not dare attempt anything until the light had returned to us, plus he feared that Mark was becoming quite paranoid, obsessed to the point of being dangerous even. We agreed on this, Kay bitterly, and I went down to lock him in his own cabin. I found that he was not there, nor had been idle while we discussed what to do. No, but he had promptly returned to the storage room and while we were in horror over the potential of his actions we heard a splash. Despite the many dangers of his actions, he had returned to the water and was going to hunt it alone. David would not go after him with the light of day gone. It was another long night for us all. Kay tried to rest in the cabin but came back on to the deck to remain close to David. Lucas and I armed ourselves with the only rifles available and spent our time attempting to pierce the darkness with our naked eyes, but the only thing to see was inky, solid-black water and the shore with its trees which had taken on nightmarish appearance for the moon had completely vanished. That night was easily the quietest and most horrific night ever for there was not a sound. The animals had fallen silent; even the wind it seemed was no longer active. I must have fallen asleep, along with the others, for the next thing I knew was that I heard a scream: Kay. She was in David's arms, completely in a dead faint, and she was deathly white. I had never heard a cry of such anguish and horror in my life. David handed her to me and dove over the side to swim the source of all our anguished gazes. The only reason we found him was the fish; they had been drawn to the place because the scent of blood permeated the water. Despite the danger, David refused to leave him and brought him back onboard. The condition was horrific. He had not just been attacked, he had been cruelly slaughtered. One look said everything to me. Now I knew the fate of my boys. They had been killed by the very same being that killed Mark Williams. His spear gun was missing; the air tank had been viciously scarred by claws and impact against rocks, yet it had not been ruptured. His body bore cruel cuts made by claws half an inch long, and the face mask was missing along with a cruel scar over one eye; but what had ultimately killed him was the air hose being savagely torn in two. He had been drowned, with his adversary refusing to give him the slightest shred of mercy. One can only guess what his final thoughts or moments were like. I can remember the horror and shock we all shared that one night when it first rose up out of the water, caught in the light of the one powerful spotlight on board the ship. It was terrifying in appearance and oh, but how it howled and snarled at the light, before sinking out of sight into the black water that one night all of us were gathered together. The only reason we had found his body was because the air tank had brought him back to the surface, and the currents had carried him back to the shore where he had finally come to rest. Never until now did I realize the true cost of ambition stroked to a fever pitch. Mark Williams died in the name of his ambitions to science and his utter need to be recognized. His attraction and jealousy of what David and Kay possessed may have also been a driving force, as I would later learn that Mark too longed for Kay's attention, but any answers we might have been given died with him. David himself swore and cursed most bitterly over the tragedy. He and Mark may have clashed at times, but never did he want the man to die so pointlessly. That day was the worst sunrise ever and we were now but four, though in truth only three for Kay could not truly act in her defense. Surprisingly, the being had not tried to kill her as one might have thought when it had a chance. What might have happened ultimately remained unknown for it had succumbed at last to the drugs we had laced the water with some time before the incident. Ultimately, David came up with a risky plan that managed to work; though it was not as effective as we thought for all too quickly the being came back and promptly dove off the boat with Kay in its clutches. We gave pursuit to its home, a cavern we had found, and David would have perished had Lucas and I not arrived rifles in hand. David had just been grabbed by it and it would surely have killed him by dashing him against the cave walls, except that it was very much vulnerable to bullets. In the end, we must have shot it a dozen times and only after the twelfth shot did it finally stop trying to attack us and instead tried to leave, with David telling us to let it go. It stumbled off back towards the water bleeding profusely from the numerous wounds we had inflicted on it. I aimed down the sights to strike it straight in the head, but David calmly pushed the barrel down with a simple no. To this day I do not entirely understand his reasoning, but I believe that it may have something to do with the idea of humanity. It finally reached the water and disappeared beneath. It never surfaced again. I asked David if he wanted to retrieve it and he simply said he wanted to go home. David's words cut through the haze over my mind and I realized that the prize was not worth all that we had lost and that I was caught up in the heat of chase, the heat of the moment. I now understood what it meant to have clouded judgement. But I also understood, in a sense, what it meant to throw everything away for one goal at all costs without any regret. Nothing, in all of the world, is worth that. One question that should be asked more: \"Why?\" and furthermore, \"When is enough, enough?\" Is there a line and just how far and for how long? I never looked at the water the same ever again. For some reason, I always felt as though something was watching me. David's dark handsome hair had turned white completely by the time he was forty. No one knew the true cause save him. He and Kay were married and happy, yet they never were quite the same after all that happened and focused their time upon trying to be together as often as they could along with me. We all quickly realized that life is short and precious. We never told anyone as to what happened. How could we? This was something none needed to know about. Besides, at least for my part, it was impossible to recall what it was that we encountered.[Chapter 5] Author's Notes The Creature from the Black Lagoon was my first known monster. The first thing I ever knew of it was a toy from Jack in the Box, and then I was introduced to the movie. At only eight years old I was captivated by the water and the mysterious nature and wonder it held. The film is so memorable for unlike other monsters, the Creature is a silent character defined by its actions. It maintains its mysterious nature, while providing some revelation unto the nature of man by simply existing. Unlike some movies, the opening speaks of God and how he created the Earth. The creature itself is not evil, but rather is misunderstood and reacts just like the people around it with confusion and violence. It partially acts in protection of its home when it perceives a threat, yet it is also curious. At times it reacts to the choices made by others, such as killing two men when they attack it out of fear, while it is angered by the choice of throwing a lantern at it. Furthermore, it usually runs rather than simply attack someone outright, unless it is ambushing them. It acts like an animal reacting to a perceived threat, yet it also has reasoning in many ways like apes in that the creature displays learning capabilities and an inquisitive nature. I wished to make a story to revive it, but then began to realize that trying to revive the Black Lagoon completely would be a mistake and dishonor the legacy. Instead, the best of course of action would be to connect the past with the present by providing backstory that indicates that there was a \"Black Lagoon\" but what exactly occurred and what was found there is lost to an extent. From there, I could proceed to revive the Creature, albeit in the ocean depths, by bringing about a new kind of being without trying to resurrect the spirit of the original. With this, I could also continue the story with certain characters linked to those of the first film, while gaining the ability to have more freedom to create a new story. I hope to do so someday, but right now this short story is the closest I can get. I would require a team to help me make the kind of story that would achieve what I long to, and evoke the spirit of what the original film possessed. If I would most certainly take one thing from this story into the new creature from the depths, it would be a backstory detailing the original Black Lagoon to an extent while still keeping it a mystery.
