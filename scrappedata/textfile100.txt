Beside her is Rhulan. \"Who are you?\" asks Hollia. \"So,\" says the Leprechaun, \"tis not a golden bounty the dragon guards, but a bountiful virgin. You will make a wonderful bride…\" He scowls over at Rhulan, \"be gone governess the girl is mine now!\" He waves his hand and sends a green electric bolt at Rhulan. She absorbs it. \"What the bloody hell,\" says the Leprechaun, \"I see I was too quick, by thy garb I see thee are a witch. So what price you want for the…\" *punt* Rhulan kicks the little man sending him flying into the air. A green *flash* and he is back on the trail. \"Oh so tis like that is it lassie? I may not look like I have much to offer, certainly not money. But perhaps knowledge…power…I have more magic than…\" \"Mystic bolt,\" says Rhulan throwing the violet fiery energy with a flick of her wrist at the ground, \"be gone yourself annoying creature.\" Hollia looks down at the Leprechaun, \"My apologies sir, I…don't know what you are talking about, however we are adventurers on a job. Perhaps you are under the influence of something causing confusion here,\" She reaches into a sack, her arm going deeper than the sack should allow and pulls out a vile with a pink fluid inside, \"Here sir, this is a status antidote, it will clear your head of what ever is confusing you.\" Hollia sets the vile on the ground. As they walk off the confused Leprechaun picks up the vile, opens it and gives it a whiff. \"Potent magic,\" says the Leprechaun, \"so they were both witches.\" (#Fool!###) comes a harsh voice bringing pain to the Leprechaun, \"I told you magic is what stands between you and the riches, those two are your enemy.\" \"Oh but I fancy the young virgin lass,\" says the Leprechaun. \"Then have her,\" says the voice, \"the dark sorceress is your opponent. She is my enemy. Destroy her and all the wealth shall be yours!\" The Leprechaun spins and vanishes. He appears again, suddenly however he finds a cape wrapped around him, he is scooped up smashed into the ground and thrown from the cape into the air. He lands and tumbles a short distance before standing and dusting himself off. \"That was unexpected,\" says the Leprechaun pulling a sword from his tiny cane. Rhulan, Hollia, and Lin Lin are clearly ready for battle, Lin Lin's head back like a snake ready to strike and Hollia having summoned her staff holding it before her. \"You know,\" says Rhulan, \"your master really shouldn't speak to your through the astral plane. Every mystical and magically trained individual and creature for miles felt his dark evil presence. No doubt at this moment numerous adventurers and creatures out to protect their territories are on their way to investigate.\" \"I do not scare so easily,\" says the Leprechaun, \"nor scar so easily witch. Have at thee!\" He shoots a green bolt, it changes direction and goes into Rhulan's hand instead of at Hollia where he aimed. \"what?\" says the Leprechaun as the energy becomes a green fire in Rhulan's hand and is snuffed out as she closes her fist. \"A transportation spell?\" asks Rhulan, \"trying to kidnap Hollia?\" \"I thought you only an old man,\" says Hollia, \"I see now you're a demon! As a priestess of the goddess I can not allow you to taint our land with your evil!\" Hollia's staff glows white. \"What is this light?\" demands the Leprechaun shielding his eyes, which start to boil and steam, \"Why…why does it hurt!?\" Hollia's Light of Banishment fades away leaving the Leprechaun steaming but still intact. \"What happened?\" asks Hollia. \"He is not a true demon,\" says Rhulan, \"at least not the kind that can be sent away by such a spell. However clearly he is not an…elite demon, or something that would be immune. He was harmed, just not sent away. No doubt that evil that spoke to him has anchored him to this world for some task.\" \"True, so true,\" says the Leprechaun who with preternatural speed, strength, and an unnatural cry leaps into the air at Rhulan. She grabs him by the throat, her movements too fast for him to see. He smiles, the blade of his sword extending. He feels his cane kick back in his hand. The blade tip has met a blue spot, an energy barrier against her body. The corset like top however displays another trick as thin shadowy tendrils come from it and wrap around the cane ripping it from his hands and throwing it to the ground. \"What manner of witch are you?\" asks the Leprechaun through gritted teeth. \"I am a sorceress,\" says Rhulan as her hand glows with violet flames followed by, \"Mystic Blast.\" The beam consumes the Leprechaun, and blasts a small crater in the path. \"What was that about?\" asks Hollia. \"That voice,\" says Rhulan, \"It felt familiar…hmmm, yes, a demon I fought once a very long time ago.\" \"Is it…\" starts Hollia. \"No,\" says Rhulan, \"this is unrelated, something older, something I slew fairly easily. However it comes to mind quickly thanks to the dimension gate.\" \"The gate?\" asks Hollia worried, \"but all we fought was a giant insect.\" \"It's the reason I had the project shut down,\" says Rhulan, \"a demon had arrived on Aesperia, claiming my actions had unbalanced the supposed balance between good and evil. I slew it and shut down the dimension gate project. There were no other intrusions…that I was aware of.\" \"You believe using the gate…brought that…thing here?\" Rhulan puts her hand to her check, index finger pointed behind her eye in thought, \"I can't be certain. It could just be coincidence. After all this demon was far weaker than the one I fought before, and didn't seem to be nearly so focused. It could just be a coincidence, however the chance does exist of the gate being keyed to this. But given all the transportation between this reality and other realities of late it does seem unlikely that if this enemy is such a force that could sense the gate that it wouldn't have sensed a different portal…our visit to Dark World could just as easily for example have been the key. I will need to see into this.\" Hollia nods, she was expecting Rhulan to turn back towards Stratalia and is caught off guard as Rhulan continues towards Agate Town. \"Like I said,\" says Rhulan seeing Hollia's confusion, \"it's more likely to be our trip to a demon world or any number of similar portals. When we do return I'll look into the gateway's controls to see if that demon jumped off its signal. But given it came to us, there is no reason to deviate from our normal agenda.\" \"Yes Miss Rhulan,\" says Hollia following. Lin Lin looks down at the staff which begins to pulsate and flies down quickly to smash it with an electrically charged tail smack. \"You coming Lin Lin?\" calls back Hollia. Lin Lin *chirps* and catches up quickly.

Right now, he had to listen to this farmer. \"It's like this Sheriff,\" George began nervously, pacing around the office to work off his fear. \"I need you to help me out with this. If you don't, I won't last past evening.\" here he stops, focusing on the sheriff. Further words are caught off by a mind devoid of anything but worry. Words escape him, leaving only an empty mouth that grasps for the words he needs. Sheriff Catling, looking at his half-finished coffee, doesn't think there are any words that could save George's life at this point. That doesn't mean he can't try. Doing so was a part of his duty here in the valley. He stood up from behind his desk, letting himself loom over George briefly as he reached his full height. Swiftly, he moved to the map of the valley that dominated one wall. Ignoring the collection of farms that sat next to his town of Greenwood, his gaze focused on Fair Folk's Forest. \"Which part of the forest did you find the gold?\" he asked, hoping he'd get a good answer. He'd heard stories, typically of the horror variety, about people who found gold; depending on the area, this story might not have to be one. \"From that area between the bones and the spiderwebs,\" George explained, pointing to the area on the map. His finger sat next to a lake between the exaggerated illustrations. \"How do you know it really was there?\" Catling challenged. He liked the answer so far, but had to be sure. Between his distrust of the shoddy map and George's nature, Catling wasn't accepting easy assurances. \"There was this old statue there. It had heathen designs on it, probably left behind by the barbarians. After that, I barely walked a few steps before I found the gold.\" Inside, Catling felt just a bit happier; whatever was causing trouble, it wasn't anything important. There were things with great power deep in that forest, which kept to themselves and didn't cross into the sorts of areas someone like George would wander. George might have been careless about wandering there in the first place, but he wasn't that stupid. Unfortunately, he was just stupid enough to pick up magic gold in a magic forest. Catling tried to remember which fable warned against picking up something tempting in a magical place. When the details blended into a homogeneous stew of religious diatribe and moralistic truisms, he gave up. Returning to his desk, he found a pen, paper, and began using both to record the facts of the case. If all went well, a little paperwork would be all he needed to keep things in order. As he put the facts to paper, he patted the silver-lined revolver necessary if all didn't go well. Fact one, after finding this gold last week, George began to experience unusual activity. Water turning to salt water, a piece of the ceiling falling down, and a pig falling over to die on the ground. He received \"all o' this unnatural buggery,\" as he phrased it, over the next week. While George explained all this, Catling was thinking it was just a run of bad luck. It was unfortunate, but it was all far more mundane than the typical curses he knew about. Then, George moved on to fact two. Yesterday, a threatening letter was delivered to George; almost giving him a concussion as it flew through his window, wrapped around a rock. The letter commanded George to bring the gold he found to Greenwood's Gate at sundown today, or face the consequences; which, from what Catlin could determine from reading it, included simple limb-breaking and the supernatural curses of Bac-Mec-Bunain and several other barbarian deities. That last part convinced Catling that George's situation might be more serious than just a mundane prankster. Catling only recognized Bac-Mec-Bunain from a friend at a university which studied religion, which led him to vague recollections on some of the others mentioned. Very few other places even taught about those deities anymore; so, unless George pursued a college education before becoming a farmer, he wasn't making this up. Fact three, his solution was ... going to be more complicated. Catling already had a vague plan in place, but he didn't want to record it yet. Besides the fact he'd look like an idiot if his plan didn't work, it wasn't a plan that would look good in vague details. If all worked out, then he'd figure out how to make it sound good. If not, then no one would care about the public record. After adding a few more gesticulations to pretend he put something more down, he put the aborted paperwork in his desk. While checking to make sure the paperwork fit in, he declared \"I think I can help you George.\" Catling hoped he sounded unconcerned, like someone who considered unorganized paperwork to be a bigger threat. He didn't want to raise George's hackles with his next question. \"I just need to see this gold you're talking about, to verify your story. Do you have it with you?\" With a sideways glance, Catling kept his eye on George. Putting a hand on his gun, he remembered stories where ordinary men who found mundane gold slaughtered each other with standard means. He didn't know how magical this gold was, but hoped that magic wasn't dark; the sort of dark that would drive George to defend it with insane fury. \"No problem Sheriff,\" George replied simply. Causing Catling to let out a relieved sigh. This job proved too many fears real, kept him on his toes, and left him with the sort of tension that could only be satisfied with the ole cup of coffee. Grabbing another cup from the pot he had nearby, he took a glance at the gold George pulled out. It was too big and too rough to be considered a coin, being palm-sized and covered in sharp points. The thing, instead of making Catling consider its value, forced him to consider how uncomfortable it'd be to step in a flat sticker plant. Seeing the gold, and noticing no reaction from George, Catling decided to help the man out. \"Alright George,\" he drawled, \"I think I can help you with your problem here.\" \"Thank you, Sheriff!\" George cheered. \"Once you take of whatever sent me that letter, I'll be able to sell this trinket for some good cash.\" Catling frowned slightly, disagreeing with that plan. \"Be careful George,\" he warned, \"a little caution could go a long way. Especially when we're not out of the fire yet.\" With that warning, followed by a chuckle that threw caution to the wind, the two parted to reconvene at sundown. Surveying the area, Catling found nothing around Greenwood's gate except the semi-unnecessary sign. Anyone who had put the effort into reaching Greenwood Valley would know what it was, since there was no other town to compete for the name; still, the Oak & Elbar Corporation needed to put their mark on the village. Under scrutiny, beneath the bold lettering of the town's name, he found that mark. Resisting the efforts of time and nature, the worn lettering defines everything within two miles of the village as property. An important distinction, since it meant Catling, who still had to help out with the nearby mines, didn't need to be too concerned about the forest twelve miles away. The day Oak & Elbar tried to own that forest, he'd resign and leave this valley on the same day. He liked the town well enough, but he'd rather die in his home then die taking that eldritch place. Thankfully, Catling's foreboding thoughts were banished by the sudden sound of nervous steps. George emerged from the alley, sharply turning his head to search. \"Have you seen anything strange Sheriff?\" Catling just shook his head. \"Nothing yet, but we haven't reached sundown yet.\" The sun was only close to touching the ground, a golden ball squatting over a red-brown horizon. He checked his pocket watch, counting down the ticks of the second hand while listening for a sound on the edge of hearing. Experience taught him that could be a good way to find something. Looking directly could fail against magic, noticing nothing that sat in a direct line of sight. Instead, looking out of the corner of the eye, letting instinct keep watch, would be more useful. It quickly proved itself, when Catling perceived the tap of wood against stone. He kept his gazeon the falling sun, while his eyes took a peek to the left. There, from behind the sign, it came out. A knee-high creature covered in green fur, clothed in odd green overalls and a green bowler cap. The portly body showed yellow skin where the fur didn't cover. This let the sheriff see the red-slit eyes and the gnarled teeth emerging from a wide grin. A suspicion bounced through his head about it, but there was only one way to know for sure. \"Are you a leprechaun?\" he asked. The small creature giggle with joy. \"Hee hee indeed! You found me! Good eyes you got there fellow!\" George, who hadn't noticed the little creature yet, found his attention dragged to it. It shocked him for a bit until his mind returned to the here and now. \"Is that it Sheriff?\" \"Is that it Sheriff?\" the leprechaun teased in a high-pitched squeal. \"It's me little Georgie and I've come for me gold!\" The creature's eyes turned serious, taking on a crimson color darker than blood. \"You have it here, it's magic calls to me, so give it here!\" \"Not a chance you little monster!\" George screamed in equal parts rage and fear. \"After what you did to my pig Porgie? Not in this lifetime!\" \"I was taking things a wee bit easy on you it seems. Laddie, little Porgie was a demonstration of our wicked ways.\" The little creature warned with a grimace filled with sharp instruments. \"What I've got in store for you will be worse.\" \"That's what you think. I brought the Sheriff here! He'll help me take you out and-\". \"George, turn towards me,\" Catling ordered. \"What is it She-\", the question was cut off by a sudden uppercut from the Sheriff. In a demonstration of precise pugilism, Georgie was knocked up into the air and had his fall stopped by the sheriff. Setting George to lean against the wall, Catling pulled out George's gold and turned to a laughing leprechaun. \"Good show!\" screamed the leprechaun, bowled over with laughter. \"The bloke didn't see a thing coming.\" It got up and threw two jabs in the air. \"Pleasant surprise, but maybe not so pleasant for him!\" After a short chuckle, the thing turned towards him, \"what's your name my good man?\" \"Sheriff Catling at your service. How about you?\" \"The name is Fearghus Mac Canann,\" the leprechaun said, adding a brisk bow to the introduction. \"Pleasure to meet you.\" \"Mac Canann,\" Catling repeated the name, tasting a familiarity from the words. \"That sounds like some old god I heard about. A … Bac-Cercon?\" \"No relation there.\" Canann waved away the guess. \"You mean the dream god Cercunnos. I do have cousins in other worlds who might have that name. I can't say for sure, since my forest is comfy.\" \"I see.\" Seeing that the little leprechaun was acting friendly, Catling decided to focus on the important question. \"If I just throw you this gold and you take it, would you leave farmer George here alone.\" Canann, giving the unconscious figure a considering look, answered, \"don't you want the gold? It's a good piece.\" \"Why would you ask me if I want it?\" Catling asked, annoyed that the important question wasn't answered. \"You've already put in all this effort into getting it. Leaving the forest, messing with George,\" \"Aww. I would've put a trick or two on the farmer there for fun if he gave me the chance.\" \"And then,\" Catling continued, \"came all the way here. This place is … far from the forest.\" He was tempted to make a joke about short people and long distances, but thought the creature looked spiteful and petty. \"All that is true sure, but hear me out for one point,\" Canann paused, holding up a stubby finger to emphasize. \"The best way to determine a thing's value is by how much someone wants it. So, I'm curious about what you want more than gold.\" Catling considered it for a moment, having reached the answer long ago. \"A peaceful life for this town. Both that and my life are worth more than this gold.\" This answer sent Canann into a chuckle. \"Wisdom! A rare thing among the tall folk! A king of thinkers among the lessers\" Before Catling could comment on the backhanded compliment, Canann continued in a whisper, \"just for you my friend. I'll give you an opportunity.\" \"You let our little Georgie think he's gotten away with no punishment for his crime. Then, out in that lonely farm of his, I'll take him by surprise in my own special way. Maybe jump on top of his empty head, run over him with a cart, or just stuff him with enough good gold.\" Catling took the words in. \"So, killing a man's your source of joy?\" he asked simply. He took the little monster's energetic nod as an answer. Then, with a nod, he said, \"okay, I'll throw the coin over there.\" He kept the words brief, remembering that some magical creatures could hear a lie. Before the leprechaun could ask anything else, Catling threw the gold piece. He needed the distraction, anything to keep the tiny bastard from pulling some magical shit out of his ass. Shining in the sunset, it flew forward in a soft, golden parabola. As it launched, Catling's hand shot for the revolver. With the coin in mid-flight, the revolver flew from its holster. Near the end, with Canann's eyes on his piece of gold, Catling pointed his revolver. There at the gate, Catling aimed at the light between him and the leprechaun. He pulled the trigger, shattering the silence with a bang and a shocked gasp. Holding himself steady, Catling saw. There on the ground, the leprechaun had fallen. His hands reached for his heart, stopped by death's grasp. A gold piece stuck there, marking the spot where the bullet had entered. Catling smiled at the sight, glad the blacksmith who forged that bullet wasn't lying about it being made from \"proper anti-nonsense materials\" as he described it; Catling might not know what they were, but he didn't care. Checking to be certain the thing was dead, with a tap to pale and cold skin, Catling nodded to himself, glad he took the shot before Canann could do anything magical. This was a job almost well done. Now he just needed to get rid of them both. He didn't want anything else from the forest coming for this gold. If that leprechaun had any relatives, he didn't want them too think that he stole that gold. Later, a few would complain about how he dropped the leprechaun and gold off at the forest. Some, especially George, considered it capitulation and called it a \"pagan sacrifice\" to the self-proclaimed gods there. Others would remember this feat of gunslinging. They would talk about the showdown at what they called \"Gold-Coin Gate\" for a long while. ","Summary":" After this day, Sheriff Catling would be known as the greatest gunslinger in the valley.

Not much is known to historians about his early life. In fact, it would seem that the only being who would live for centuries afterward to tell the tale was a small magical creature... As a child, Edward was bullied by other boys in his neighborhood. They made fun of his name and threw pebbles at him in a field. He felt a bit of pain from those three boys. \"Come on, Eddie!\" \"You should leave and go to England!\" \"Yeah! And drown on the way there!\" \"Leave me alone!\" Edward said. Watching from the top of a hill was a Leprechaun. He did not normally feel sympathy for others, but this was just a child. He felt that he had to intervene. He ran towards the bullies who were cornering Edward on the ground. \"Please!\" Edward pleaded. The Leprechaun jumped in front of Edward. The bullies were left with stunned expressions. They were terrified. \"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but all shall pay my golden loans!\" the Leprechaun said. The bullies ran off. The Leprechaun stretched out his hand. The ten-year-old looked at it. It looked brown and wrinkled, just like the Leprechaun's face. Sharp fingernails were noticeable. \"Go on and grab it, you coward!\" the Leprechaun said. Edward nodded and did so. The Leprechaun pulled him up. He was shorter than the boy. \"What are you?\" \"What do I look like, me lad? See the hat? The buckles on me shoes? Why, I'm a Leprechaun!\" \"I have heard of Leprechauns. I just did not expect them to be so...so...\" \"Ugly? Tales tend to change in these here lands.\" \"Do you have gold?\" \"Not at the moment. I would like some. Just the thought of it would make my head numb.\" \"Can I help you?\" \"Perhaps. If you become a sailor, you just may fit the bill. All in good time, see ya over the hill.\" In good time indeed. As an adult, Edward England joined a trade sloop. The Leprechaun found his way aboard. England was half-surprised to see him. The Leprechaun did the sentimental talk. \"Miss me?\"[Chapter 2] JAMAICA 1717 Up ahead in the Caribbean Sea was the lush green island of Jamaica. England had dreamed for a long time of traveling to a faraway island such as this. He just did not expect that he would experience such a voyage accompanied by a leprechaun. \"Land ho!\" the Leprechaun said. \"You never know what Jamaica will make ya.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" England asked. \"I do not mean anything in particular by it. You never know what you may encounter in new places.\" For a while, the sloop traded with others. England was regarded as one of the best mates on his sloop. He kept the Leprechaun a secret from the other mates. He did not want any trouble to occur. The Leprechaun was too stealthy to be caught by anyone on the sloop. He often explored the island in search of anything valuable. More specifically, he was looking for gold. Despite his efforts, he had no luck. The Leprechaun got on board the trade sloop as it sailed into the water again. \"There's nothing for me on this wretched island,\" the Leprechaun told England. \"Take me home.\" \"I cannot take you home. I am not even in charge of the sloop.\" \"May I remind you that I saved you when you were a young lad?\" \"I know. I want to repay that debt.\" \"Either pay me in gold or take me home.\" \"I am sorry.\" Their argument was interrupted by distant yelling. They turned and saw a ship heading towards them. \"Who do you suppose those people are?\" the Leprechaun asked. \"Pirates,\" England said. \"Pirates?\" \"People who steal ships and search for treasure. Have you ever heard of them? It looked like their heading to a port.\" \"Treasure? Hey pirates!

They were terrified. \"What is that thing!\" they cried. \"Stop!\" England ordered. \"Come over here and take us, pirates! If you even have the nerve!\" The pirate ship turned towards the sloop. \"Great,\" England said. \"Now we are in trouble thanks to you.\" \"Save your thanks for later. You shall see. The richest men shall be you and me.\" The ship was in front of the sloop. Pirates jumped onto the sloop. They intimidated the mates, not taking notice of the Leprechaun. The mates were too terrified to do anything. \"Join us or die!\" a pirate said. \"Where do we sign up?\" the Leprechaun asked. The pirates gaped in shock. \"You will be glad to have me. I am a Leprechaun. Very valuable. And, take my word for it, so is he.\" The Leprechaun pointed to England. The pirates nodded. They motioned for the others on their ship to drop down a dinghy. The dinghy was lowered. England and the Leprechaun were taken on board. ","Summary":" In the country of Ireland, there lived a man named Edward England.

This is what happens right after Brit and Candy return home. Candy and Brit hadn't said a word to each other on their drive back home. When they arrived at the dorms of the university, for a moment each of them felt like they'd never left. Like nothing had changed. Like they were just two ordinary college girls. But of course, everything was different now. Nothing could ever be the same. Cotty was already expecting them, smoking a cigarette in a corner, watching her two friends arrive. She was relieved to see they were unharmed. But the Brit and Candy she knew would have smiled. They would have laughed. They would have jumped out of the car and insulted her in a non-serious manner, they would have hugged her and told her all about what happened. But they were quiet. Avoiding eye-contact. Cotty dropped her cigarette on the ground and came closer. She didn't bother with smalltalk. \"What happened?\" Brit shut the door on her side of the car and made her way towards the building. \"Alien's dead,\" she said, and went inside. Cotty watched her leave and then turned to look at Candy. \"What are you staring at me for?\" she asked. \"He's fucking dead, that's what happened.\" \"What happened with Big Arch?\" Candy stared at the ground. \"One of his guys shot Alien.\" Cotty waited. \"And?\" \"And?\" Candy quickly looked up, suddenly with fury in her eyes. \"And what ? Can't that be the end of the fucking story? You left, remember? You fucking left, you didn't even fucking care enough to stick around! This one's on you, you cunt, you know that? We took revenge because you let yourself got shot in your fucking arm!\" \"You're out of line.\" \"Hell yeah, I'm out of line, you'd be out of line!\" Candy cried. They were silent for a moment. Then Candy looked up to the sky, blinking away the tears that were forming in her eyes. Cotty had never seen her cry before and she seemed determined not to let it show this time. \"You want to know what happened? We shot Big Arch's guys. Brit and I. Fucking shot 'em. And then we killed the motherfucker himself.\" Candy made her way towards the building but turned around one more time to look at Cotty. Her face was empty; pale. \"What is it, you surprised?\" she asked provokingly. \"That was the fucking plan after all.\" Then she went inside without another word. Faith was awake. She could hear Candy's voice in the hall. \"Brit! Wait up,\" she said. They were back. Faith got up out of bed quickly, and didn't even think to knock before she walked inside Brit and Candy's room. Brit was standing beside the window, Candy was nowhere to be seen, but Faith could hear the water pouring in the bathroom. \"Brit?\" she said. She turned around and forced a smile. \"Hey, Faith.\" \"Hey.\" Neither of them said anything for a moment. \"Things got pretty intense out there after I left, huh?\" she asked. \"What did Cotty tell you?\" \"She didn't have to tell me much, the hole in her arm kind of spoke for itself.\" Brit saw a bit of judgement in her eyes. \"Did everything turn out OK?\" Her friend nodded and smiled. \"Yeah. Everything's fine. Everything's great.\" Faith nodded. She knew Brit was keeping something from her but she wasn't sure she wanted to know. \"Okay,\" she said. \"I should probably get back to sleep.\" \"Yeah, me too,\" Brit said. After Faith left, she kept glaring outside for another few minutes. She did want to do better. Be a better person. Work harder at school. Her life had been boring before Spring Break. And it would keep being that way. But she would find a way to learn to embrace that. She would finish college. Get a job. Make money. Candy opened the bathroom door. \"Thanks for handling Faith, I couldn't have dealed with her right now.\" She lay down on her bed and stared at the ceiling. Brit looked at her. \"Candy?\" \"Yeah?\" \"What are we gonna do?\" Candy looked at her. \"What do you mean?\" she asked. \"We'll be fine though, right?\" Candy smiled. \"Of course we'll be fine. We got each other, right?\" Brit nodded. \"You know who else we got? Alien.\" She got up and put her friend's face in between her hands. \"I can tell you he's watching over us right now. You just gotta trust that, okay?\" Brit nodded. \"He's always with us. The three of us will always be together.\" ","Summary":" Back Home A Spring Breakers fanfic.

OR HER? First of all, I want to thank to this girl, MileyJakes; yeah I think it's also her FF name, anyway, if you're reading this, I really do appreciate your support for the story since it was up on YT, you already know the beginning so ... anyway. Hope you like it, along with all of you guys (: This was written because of a school homework and I decided on let you read it and letting me know what you think about it. It wasn't originally a Semi fiction, but since it's FF and I do have to add a created character, I added my Spring Breaker's favourite character, guess who? :3 Jaa ... ANYWAY!. I'm not planning on doing another chapter, this was just a One-Shot for a 100 on my grades chart. But if you guys want me to,I will be glad to make a novel for this, for you guys. Well ... Hope you like it ;) Sometimes you don't even know if you can trust your shadow. When you think that everything is going to turn out well, destiny laughs at your ingenuity to destroy you in any possible way. I thought I could trust on my own blood, on that person that, now I know, pretended interest on my well being. I don't know why I thought that though, I grew up with that idea, that that was pure love, the only real one; I guess it is not always like that. There he was, sitting on that old chair that seemed to have my grandfather's age, looking at me, thoughtful. It had been a week since I couldn't see any expression on his face. She, on the other side, always cried. Sometimes I listened to her sobbing while watching her novels on TV; that meant nothing good. Tired, bothered, desperate, I went out that insane asylum which just one year ago I used to call my home. It was the first time I did that and seeing no reaction I thought to myself why the heck I hadn't done it before, but then again, maybe it was just the tension which paralyzed them. I closed the door behind me, my keys making a small sound when they fell into my pocket. Without direction, that's how I found myself, without direction. It had been a lot since I hadn't felt like that, last time I did, it cost me three noticeable scars on my wrists, just above my wristbands and a pair of lashes with leather. When I arrived to the corner of the street. Like if it was a signal, the cold air brushed my face and the need of my best friend's hug made me direct myself a block left and five more to the front; the same path I use to take every Tuesday and Thursday that I get home with her. Two blocks after had taken my course I noticed a black TIDA moving along my steps. If there was something productive that the people who I am running from taught me, it was to keep calm when I find myself between coincidence and risk. I tried to see who the driver was from the corner of my eye, but the windows were polarized, it was impossible for me to recognize any face without being obvious. I turned back to my direction and before I could cross to the next block, my view went off, a pair of arms pulled me up to what I thought, was the same person's shoulder. Naturally, I screamed, though it was stupid. Less than a minute later I felt my head crash with something rough and the smell of new car invaded my nose before I lost my knowledge . . . It's twelve at midnight and I am still tied down to a bed. Everything that surrounded me were black walls, just that, except for a grey door on my left side. Wait, that was the only thing I could do, wait. It had been two hours since I had the opportunity of sending a message to my best friend; by any strange reason, m y cell phone was still in my right pocket when I woke up and for a brief moment I thought it was a trick, but there wasn't any other choice. When I arrived to the dark room, I immediately hided the cell phone under the dirty pillow where my head is resting now. After five minutes one of them entered the room to find me in shock, I may have had acted fast but that didn't decreased my fear. I always thought people that do this kind of stuff do not have a respectable physic, that's why when I looked up to look at her, I felt my jaw lose its friction, and for whatever reason, I felt even more fear. I observed her while she carried a tray with what seemed a glass with water and a piece of toast. Suddenly I felt like being in a hospital, eating for the first time after having received five stitches on my abs. She looked up at me, our eyes locked. Shame, that is the only thing that I saw in her eyes. Shame of be doing what she was doing, and for a moment I felt lacerate. If she really regret doing this, why does she do it? . . . It has been less than two minutes after practically had read her soul, when the pillow made a weird sound. – Holly Shit – I thought, the vibrating mode wasn't enough to hid the gadget. Her gaze focused on the piece of feather cloth and I felt like hours passed in which I bit my lower lip, waiting for her next move, observing her deep thoughtful look. She sighed and looked back to the door just to return her gaze and slowly, shoved the key inside the handcuff lock. I couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing, it was merely impossible. When finally my four extremities were free, a hard thump was heard from outside the room, followed by a shoot. I looked to the door and before I could do, or even think anything, the body of the girl who set me free was falling down my legs and to the old wooden floor. I felt a warm on my arm; it squeezed me softly while my feet moved by instinct because of the insistent pull from the hand that holds my wrist. I blinked slowly, and it was that moment in which I realized there was wetness on my eyelashes, and little by little, a drop of salty water started to run down my cheek; burning it in the process. I couldn't stop watching her, and maybe, just maybe, it wouldn't have been too bitter the gulp of saliva that I naturally swallowed, if her eyes wouldn't have been looking directly at mine; lost, but at the same time focused on letting me know that she was really sorry. The need of carry her in my arms and take her with me to where, probably, someone will be waiting for me accompanied by a pair of blue and red annoying lights going on and off, was almost excruciating. But it wasn't possible; my body barely could differ between cold and hot. I crossed the old door with an arm wrapped around my waist, pulling me towards the outsides of that perfectly designed for any person with mental problems could be isolated, old cabana. A gun, an envelope with what looked like white powder and a bottle of Douglas Longside, were a few of the lots of objects that had been placed above a colorless table striped by, what seemed, a needle. Names of people marked and remarked, followed by a tick, like if the nest person who saw it would have decided that the name had been well written. - Faith Bennett - announced a feminine voice that was quickly coming out behind, who now I recognized; mi best friend, and me. – She was reported lost two weeks ago, brunette, nineteen years old. Her parents said she didn't arrived home when they waited for her at four o'clock of April ninth's afternoon – there was no doubt now, those brown eyes were saying the truth since the moment in which her body entered the old and creepy room. - He abducted her and kept her for three days in the same room, until the fifth day, the same day in which he forced her to start watching the second victim. We'll take her to the ambulance, then she must go with us to the delegation – and with that she walked away, leaving her partner taking notes of the information given. I looked at the cop and back again to the principal entrance of the cabana. Her body looked just like mine felt a few minutes ago. They placed her over a litter, her chest wrapped by a bandage which didn't have any white space left. - She will be okay – whispered the voice I recognize now since two years ago anywhere. She knew me so well; my eyes could never lie to her. The worry for that soul in conflict was eating me alive and I knew she could notice it. After this night, the desire of going back to that insane asylum was at the minimum, and for any weir reason, that cabana seemed more comfortable for me, a better place. Then again, any place was better than that. The back door closed and the sirens began to sound . . . ","Summary":" HELP ME ... OR HER?

As the vehicle skidded to a stop, Brit turned to her friend. She took the older girl's face in her palms. Candy looked up a bit, making the other girl smile. She looked like an adorable puppy, and it killed Brit. \"I love you.\" \"You love me ?\" The younger girl moved her hands up, tangling them into blonde locks. Brit moved slowly closer to her friend. \"Yes. I love you.\" The space between them was gone quickly as their lips met. The kiss was long, but not heated.

On était parties pour le fameux Spring Break. Des vacances, alcool, drogues et sexe à volonté. La fête sur la plage toute la journée... Alléchant. En manque de sensations, les filles et moi avons économisé afin de partir en Floride. Avec Brit, Candy et Cotty, le braquage était un besoin. Une somme énorme a été amassée. Jeunes et insouciantes. On faisait rien de mal ! Finalement, emballées dans notre Spring Break, on ne s'est pas doutées une seule seconde qu'on pouvait mal finir. « Spring Breaker Bitches ». Les flics nous ont arrêtées, on a fait de la taule et un fameux « gangsta au cœur d'or » - plus communément appelé Alien – a payé notre caution contre nos services. Mais ça... On ne le savait pas encore. Je suis Emily et je suis dans la merde. Une salle de billard tellement enfumée que je ne voyais pas mes mains. Toujours sapées de nos maillots de bain – on sort de prison – on est là, entre tous ces mecs à attendre. Attendre quoi ? Je ne sais pas. Peut-être qu'Alien nous présente ou nous adresse un mot. Faith ne dit rien. C'est la plus sage du groupe. Je sais qu'elle a peur. Les autres sont plutôt joyeuses d'être là, Candy aguiche des mecs comme à son habitude. « Laisse jouer les filles ! Faith, allez, viens. » Tiens, Alien ne nous a pas zappées. Faith ne veut pas y aller. « J'aime pas être ici » . Mais elle y va quand même. Elle fait la gueule, à la limite de pleurer, je la comprends. « Je suis pas venue pour ça » . Moi non plus, je veux pas être là mais je ne le montre pas. La fumée monte à la tête. Je commence à perdre mes points de repères. On est toutes séparées. Et je ne remarque plus Faith. Putain. Il faut que je la trouve avant qu'il ne lui arrive quelque chose. Elle est si frangile. Je sors. Des mecs me sifflent et je leur adresse mon plus beau doigt. J'arrive dans la dépendance de la villa et je la vois, proche d'Alien. « J'vais te dire.. J't'aime bien toi. T'as quelque chose. » Il lui passe sa main sur sa joue et son pouce sur ses lèvres. Je m'avance et arrache Faith d'Alien : « Laisse-là. » Cet enfoiré éclate de rire : « Je peux savoir à qui j'ai à faire ? ». Je ne lui réponds pas et prends la main de Faith pour partir d'ici. Elle pleure. Un colosse nous barre le chemin de la porte. Je me retourne : « Qu'est ce que tu veux, Gangsta ? » dis-je du ton le plus sarcastique que je connaisse. « Wow wow wow. Rentre les griffes, tigresse. Je vais te dire un truc : je vous ai payées maintenant vous m'appartenez toutes les 5. Vous êtes apparemment les 2 plus lucides du groupes mais je compte bien vous garder près de moi. » Il parla tout en se rapprochant de nous. Faith sanglotait à côté de moi. Je me serrais contre elle pour la rassurer tout en ne lâchant pas Alien du regard. La tension de la pièce est lourde. Il se permis de me toucher la joue comme il l'avait fait un peu plus tôt et rapprocha son visage du mien : « Tu m'as l'air intelligente. C'est pourquoi tu me seras très utile. » Je lui crachais au visage. Son visage était neutre. Seul son regard trahissait sa fureur. Je partis de cet endroit avec Faith pour rejoindre les filles afin de le convaincre de quitter cet endroit. Mais je savais pertinemment que mon geste ne sera pas sans conséquence... « Brit ! Où sont les autres ? » « Aucune idée.. » Elle glousse, elle a du picoler encore. Je pris Faith par les épaules : « On va quitter cet endroit avec ou sans elles, compris ? » Elle hocha la tête. On passa la porte direction le portail. Je sentis une main m'encercler le bras. Alien. « Tu veux jouer la rebelle ? Très bien, on va utiliser la manière forte. » Il me jeta sur son épaule et me traîna jusque dans sa voiture tandis que Faith se faisait emmener par l'un des jumeaux, des sbires d'Alien. Ce dernier ouvrit la porte du côté passager et me balança dedans comme un vulgaire objet. Il prit place du côté conducteur, me regarda et dit : « A nous deux, ma belle. » J'entendis le verrou de la voiture.[Chapter 2] « Quel est ton problème, toi ? » Son air ironique me donne envie de vomir. « Tu sais, j'ai connu plusieurs filles comme toi, butées, bornées. Tu veux savoir comment elles ont fini ? Non, tu veux pas savoir. » Il s'esclaffe et retire une latte sur sa roulée. Pauvre tâche. Je pipais mot. Ca sert à rien. « Tiens ? Tu dis rien maintenant ? » Il rigole encore et recrache la fumée sur moi. Connard. Sa main lâche le levier afin de toucher ma joue. Je m'écarte le plus possible contre la vitre en lui adressant mon regard le plus noir. Il en rit de plus belle. Je croise les bras. Alien me regarde. Je le regarde à mon tour. Malgré cet air de gangsta méprisant, ses tresses dégueulasses et ses dents, même pas j'en parle, il reste plutôt bel homme. Quel âge peut-il avoir ? Je baisse le regard et m'attarde sur ses bras. Putain que j'aime ses bras et musclés et ses longues mains. Je détourne rapidement mon regard en voyant qu'il sourit. « La vue te plaît ? » Je ne réponds pas. « Au fait, ma belle, quel est ton nom ? » « Emily. » « Tu parles ?! Miracle. Bien ! Je vais t'apprendre quelques règles quand on sera chez moi. » Après ces dires, Alien tourna et je sentis la voiture ralentir. Je m'apprêtais à sortir mais il me retient par le bras. « T-t-t-t-t, je veux pas que tu t'échappes, tu comprends ? » Il me fait un clin d'œil. Dieu qu'il m'énerve ! J'attendis donc qu'il sorte et qu'il vienne ouvrir ma porte. La pensée de passer du côté conducteur m'effleura l'esprit mais je me ravisais. Je vais me le faire cet enfoiré de … Hum. Il me prit le bras et m'emmena dans une magnifique villa que je n'eus pas le temps de de détailler. J'ai juste vu les deux colosses armés autour de la baraque. Wow, il rigole pas. Je sens mes entrailles me serrer. Et si j'étais allée trop loin en lui crachant dessus ? Que va-t-il me faire ? Je revins au moment présent en sentant sa main dans la mienne. Je me suis raidie mais il continue sa route jusqu'à l'intérieur. Après une multitude de pièces et d'escaliers, il me lâcha et me fit rentrer dans une chambre dans les tons orange. Un lit King Size trône au milieu. Il est truffé de coupures et d'armes. Prise de peur, je me retourne brusquement. Mais je me cogne à son torse tellement il était près de moi. J'eus encore un sursaut avant qu'il ne m'attrape les poignets. Il était près, trop près. Mon cœur s'emballe de peur. « Emily, ma douce Emily... Comment refréner tes pulsions meurtrières envers moi ? » Mettant mes poignets dans une seule main, il me touche la joue et met sa bouche contre mon oreille. Il chuchote. « Moi, je sais. Tu vas rester ici pendant que tes petites copines vont venir avec moi, faire le sale boulot. Tu ne pourras pas leur parler, évidemment. J'approfondirai tout cela avec toi, plus tard.» J'essaye de me dégager, mais il reste trop fort. Il rigole encore et approche son visage du mien. Avant qu'il ne touche mes lèvres, je lui écrase le pied afin de me dégager de son emprise. Mais il me pousse contre le mur et me presse de son corps contre celui-ci. Je lâche un petit glapissement. « Il faudra que tu arrêtes tes conneries, toi. » Ses mains de part et d'autre de ma tête me disent que je suis vraiment coincée. Putain. « Patron ! » Les jumeaux sont rentrés. ","Summary":" Voilà le vrai prologue que je n'ai pas pu mettre car il est trop long :).

Nous étions sur le plateau, attendant que les derniers préparatifs soient finit pour commencer à tourner la scène. Juste avant qu'Harmony nous appel le téléphone de Vanessa sonna, à notre grande surprise à tous elle prit l'appel et s'éloigna pour éviter les oreilles indiscrètes. Harmony rageait quelque peut, surtout que la conversation s'éternisa. Au bout d'un quart d'heure la petite starlette revint sur le plateau et le tournage put commencer. Personne ne s'était rendu compte de rien. Même lorsque le réalisateur avait râlé contre Vanessa elle n'avait pas réagit. Même le tournage de la scène s'était merveilleusement bien passée, une prise ayant suffi, ce qui au passage calma Harmony. Vanessa et moi devions enchainer sur une scène qui ne demandait que notre seule présence. Vingt minutes de pauses nous furent quand même accordée et ce fut lorsque nous nous retrouvâmes seules toutes les deux qu'elle commença à pleurer. - Oh, Vanessa !

Je lui priais de s'asseoir devant le miroir qui se trouvait dans la pièce et je lui refis une beauté. - Je comprends ce que tu dois ressentir en ce moment, et je te trouve forte d'arriver à te contenir ainsi, mais ce soir je passerais dans ta chambre d'hôtel si tu veux discuter, ou simplement pleurer, ou même pour parler de tout autre chose histoire de te changer les idées, proposai-je en regardant mon travail dans le miroir. - Tu n'es pas obligée de faire ça pour moi tu sais… - Mais j'en ai envie ! Je te connais depuis longtemps, même si on était pas vraiment proche avant, maintenant on est amies, je ne peux pas te laisser seule dans cette situation, surtout si tu comptes ne pas en parler aux autres. - Merci… - Voila ! Tu es parfaite pour la prochaine scène ! Elle se leva et je l'interceptais pour me poster face à elle et déposer un baiser sur son front. Elle me rendit un énorme sourire et nous partîmes en direction du studio. La scène que nous tournions paraissait simple, pourtant nous dûmes nous y reprendre à plusieurs reprises, un coup l'éclairage n'allait pas, un coup ce fut le cadrage, bref une vraie galère, mais je crois que tout ce remue-ménage changea les idées de Vanessa. Ce fut la dernière scène que nous tournâmes aujourd'hui. Il devait à peut près rester une ou deux semaines de tournage. Comme d'habitude, le soir nous mangeâmes avec toute l'équipe dans le restaurant de l'hôtel entièrement réservé pour nous. La bonne ambiance y régnait toujours, on rigolait vraiment bien, j'adorais ces à côtés de la vie d'actrice. Après manger des petits groupes se formaient et nous allions dans les salons nous asseoir pour papoter de tout et de rien. Ce soir nous étions toutes les quatre, Selena, Rachel, Vanessa et moi, et parlions de la scène que nous avions tournée dans l'après-midi. Nous rigolions bien quand Vanessa prit un air étrange, et s'excusa prétextant qu'elle était fatiguée pour monter dans sa chambre. Je fis comme si j'étais aussi surprise que les autres et attendis que nous montâmes toutes les trois nous coucher pour frapper à la porte de mon amie. Il s'était bien écoulé une heure entre le départ de Vanessa et mon arrivée devant sa prote, j'avais peur qu'elle soit déjà couché, mais j'avais promis, alors je frappai. - Oui ? fit une petit voix de l'autre côté. - C'est moi, Ashley. - Oh ! Attend, je t'ouvre. Quelques secondes plus tard la porte s'ouvrit. La lumière était éteinte et elle l'alluma dès que je m'en rendis compte. Elle s'était démaquillée, mais quelques larmes ayant laissé des traces sur son t-shirt trahissaient sa tristesse. - Je pensais que tu ne viendrais pas, dit-elle en se frottant le bout du nez. - Lorsque je propose quelque chose je n'oublie jamais ! - Merci… Sa bouche trembla, je sentais qu'elle allait éclater en sanglot si je ne faisais rien. Je l'invitai donc à aller s'asseoir sur son lit. Nous nous installâmes en plein milieu en tailleur, face à face. -Alors tu préfères quelle option ? En parler, te lâcher, pleurer, même si je peux deviner que tu as déjà pas mal pleuré, ou bien changer totalement de sujet ? - Un autre sujet me changera surement les idées !dit-elle en essayant de se donner un peu d'entrain. Ce fut alors que nous commençâmes à parler de tout et de rien. Du film, du tournage, des bons moments que nous avions passés, du fait que nous gardions contact après le film car nous avions liés des liens extraordinaires toutes les quatre. Puis nous abordâmes le sujet des scènes qu'ils nous restaient à tourner. - T'as lu le scénario en entier ? me demanda Vanessa. - Evidemment, pourquoi ? - Eum… Il nous reste plusieurs scènes à tourner, dont la scène de la piscine, avec James. Je me demande comment ça va se passer, je veux dire, j'appréhende beaucoup. - C'est vrai que jusqu'ici on n'a pas eu vraiment de scènes « spéciales », bizarres, à tourner. Mais c'est quoi qui t'inquiète le plus ? La nudité, la proximité des corps, la sensualité qu'on doit montrer ? - Bah, la sensualité qu'on est censé montrer je ne vais pas m'en plaindre, c'est ça être acteur, jouer un rôle, mais pour la proximité dans la nudité, c'est dur tout de même… J'en ai parlé un peu avec James, il m'a plutôt rassuré même si je stress toujours un peu, mais cette scène se fait avec toi aussi, je veux dire, on sera tous les trois nus, et collés ensemble, avec des scènes de baisers en plus… Je crois que si tu étais autant inquiète que moi ça m'arrangerait ! conclut-elle en rigolant nerveusement. - Bien sûr je stress aussi ! Les scènes de nus, d'amour, sont toujours très dur à tourner, mais je crois que ce qui m'inquiète le plus c'est de devoir me coller à James. Toi ça va, enfin ça peut aller, on est deux filles, tu es mon amie, on se prend déjà dans nos bras etc, donc c'est plus simple, mais avec James, c'est un peu comme si j'allais tromper mon copain. Oups… Je m'étais rendu compte de ma bourde au moment où j'avais sortis ma phrase. Trop tard pour reculer. J'avais pourtant essayé de bannir le mot « copain » de mon vocabulaire pour ce soir. Elle ne répondait plus. - Pardon, je ne voulais pas… - Non, non ne t'excuses pas, ça allait dans la conversation, normal. Je voulais changer de sujet mais rien ne venait, un blanc s'installa, j'étai extrêmement mal à l'aise pour elle, mais rien à faire, je ne savais plus quoi dire. Et malheureusement des sanglots vinrent interrompre le silence installé. Ses larmes me fendirent le cœur, elle cacha son visage dans ses mains en s'excusant et je me rapprochai pour l'entourer de mes bras. Nous dûmes rester dans cette position au moins une heure. Je ne disais rien, je savais que c'était inutile, mes mots ne l'atteindraient pas. Je la laisser exprimer sa tristesse. Bientôt ses pleurs se calmèrent puis cessèrent. Mais elle resta blottie dans mes bras encore un temps. Je lui caressais les cheveux lentement quand je m'aperçu que sa respiration s'était ralenti. En effet elle s'était endormit. Je fis doucement et la couchai sur son lit avant de m'emparer d'un stylo pour lui laisser un petit mot, « Tu t'es endormis, je n'ai pas voulu te déranger alors je suis retournée dans ma chambre. Courage ma puce ». Ensuite je partis en retenant la porte. Le lendemain matin elle me remercia pour la veille et la vie reprit son cours normal. Je lui avais demandé si elle voulait que je vienne la voir le soir, mais elle ne voulait pas m'embêter, et puis elle avait l'air d'aller mieux. Arriva finalement la fameuse scène de la piscine, celle que nous redoutions tant. Comme je l'avais dit, c'était surtout le fait que nous soyons quasiment nus et collées à James Franco qui me gênait. En soit, embrasser ou caresser Vanessa n'avait rien de bien compliqué ou gênant, c'était une fille et mon amie. Avant de tourner la scène nous avions quelques répétitions en maillot de bain. Nous étions tous sur le plateau, salutations, relecture du scénario, mise à l'eau, et nous commençâmes. Harmony se tenait juste au bord du bassin pour nous guider. Tout était plutôt simple, après tout c'était notre boulot d'actrice. Nous nous connaissions tous, et cette partie du tournage ne fut pas si différente des autres. Finalement les scènes avec James passèrent toutes seules, comme n'importe quelle autre. Néanmoins, alors que j'aurais cru l'inverse, celles de baiser avec Vanessa me troublèrent. Les lèvres de James ne me faisaient rien, enfin, c'était du cinéma, donc aucune sensation exceptionnelle, mais celles de Vanessa, j'avais envie de vraiment les gouter, d'appuyer plus longtemps les miennes contre les siennes. De plus, quand sa bouche se pausait sur mon dos et mon épaule lors de la scène, je me sentais trembler, pas extérieurement comme un frisson, mais à l'intérieur, comme si mon cœur rebondissait contre les parois de ma cache thoracique. Lorsque nous sortîmes de la piscine pour aller nous sécher je n'osais plus regarder Vanessa. La gêne me passa vite, et le diner se passa comme tous les autres soirs, aussi drôle et convivial. Mais lorsque je me couchais, vers 3h00 du matin, mon esprit se repassait en boucle les scènes tournées aujourd'hui, et tout particulièrement les moments où Vanessa m'avait caressé et embrassé. Je voulais les évacuer mais c'était plus fort que moi, je revenais toujours dessus. Qu'était-il en train de m'arriver ? Pourquoi… Pourquoi j'avais tant envie d'être auprès de Vanessa, alors que j'avais un copain, que j'aimais. Je sombrai dans un sommeil agité en ruminant ces pensées. Au matin je me réveillais avec une impression bizarre, comme si j'avais passé la nuit avec quelqu'un. J'avais dut rêver, mais de qui ? De Vanessa, ma meilleure amie, ou de Ryan, mon copain ? Aujourd'hui était notre avant dernier jour de tournage et il ne nous restait pas le plus dur à tourner. Juste quelques scènes d'intérieur. Le matin j'avais quelques scènes à tourner avec Vanessa et Rachel, et l'après-midi une scène avec Vanessa. Lorsque la pause déjeuner arriva nous étions en avance, Harmony nous laissa donc un petit temps pour décompresser après avoir manger. Le réalisateur et Rachel, puisqu'ils étaient mariés, marchaient ensemble à l'ombre, Selena téléphonait à sa mère et Vanessa avait disparue. Je me retrouvais donc seule, à marcher, errante, dans les locaux. Je ne pensais à rien de spécial, lorsque je passai devant la loge de Vanessa. Pourquoi n'y avais-je pas pensé, elle devait surement être là, soit à textoter, soit à roupiller, ou bien peut-être pleurait-elle. Piquée par la curiosité je toquai à la porte. Un oui étouffé par l'épaisseur de la porte m'apprit qu'elle ne dormait pas. Je poussai doucement la porte et la découvris, debout, au milieu de la pièce, se regardant dans le miroir, en tenue pour la scène que nous nous allions tourner, donc, en maillot de bain jaune. Je me sentais presque habillé à côté d'elle, j'avais gardé mon mini short en jean rose de la scène précédente et avait enfilé un débardeur blanc, ample, tout simple. - Tu t'admires dans la glace ? ironisai-je en refermant la porte. - Non, répondit-elle en rigolant, je venais juste de me changer, je regardais juste si c'était bien mit ! Tu me cherchais ? - Non pas forcément, mais tout le monde est occupé alors bon, je m'ennuyais… On reprend dans vingt minutes, j'avais juste besoin de compagnie ! Sauf si je dérange, je m'en vais ! - Non, non pas du tout, j'allais pas me regarder dans le miroir éternellement, assis-toi ! Elle me désigna le petit sofa collé au mur et j'y pris place. Elle se tourna de profil par rapport à son reflet, releva ses cheveux à l'aide de ses deux mains, jeta un coup d'œil à son dos, et relâcha ses cheveux avant de venir s'asseoir à mes côtés. Sa cuisse toucha la mienne et je sentis une boule de chaleur me parcourir. - Ashley…, chuchota-t-elle secouant mon corps une nouvelle fois, je voulais te remercier pour m'avoir consolé l'autre jour. - Oh, mais ce n'est rien ! J'ai pas fais grand-chose en plus, et puis, c'était normal, j'allais pas te laisser seule. - Oui, mais je n'avais que toi, je ne voulais pas en parler aux autres, donc merci, je suis contente que ce soit toi qui m'ai prise dans tes bras. Cette phrase s'imprima dans mon esprit, « que ce soit toi » « prise dans tes bras ». Comme si… comme si elle préférait ma chaleur humaine, mon contact. Non, non, à quoi étais-je en train de penser… Alors que tout se bousculait dans ma tête, ses yeux se fixèrent sur les mien. Mes pensées s'envolèrent instantanément et mon esprit se vida. Il n'y avait plus que ses yeux chocolat qui me fixaient. - Vraiment, de rien, ajoutai-je bêtement. Un silence s'installa, nos regard toujours plongés l'un dans l'autre. Lentement, presque imperceptiblement, nos visages avancèrent l'un vers l'autre, attirés comme deux aimants éloignés. Et lorsque nos nez se touchèrent mes yeux se fermèrent automatiquement. J'attendais logiquement un baiser, c'est pourquoi je ne fus pas surprise quand mes lèvres rencontrèrent les siennes. Nous ne nous étions jamais embrassé, un baiser de cinéma n'en avait pas le même goût, j'avais juste sentis le bord de ses lèvres et l'ombre de sa langue, mais là, c'était autrement plus puissant. Et pourtant, j'avais l'impression que nous avions attendu ce baiser depuis toujours. Aussi bien elle que moi, j'entendais sa respiration, je sentais son souffle et son cœur accélérer au même rythme que le mien. Alors elle aussi avait eu envie de mes lèvres depuis le tournage de cette scène avec James ? Elle aussi avait pensé à moi hier avant de s'endormir ? Je ne lisais pas dans les pensées et pourtant je le sentais. Nos lèvres se détachèrent et ne regards se croisèrent à nouveau, pendant une trentaine de secondes il ne se passa rien, puis, à l'unisson, nous éclatâmes de rire. Ses éclats raisonnaient à mes oreilles comme une douce mélodie, son rire était merveilleux. Mais elle s'arrêta brusquement de rire, prit un air étrangement sérieux et se jeta sur moi, si violement que nous tombâmes à la renverse sur le sofa. Vanessa était entièrement allongée sur moi, sa bouche emprisonnant la mien, sa langue cherchant la mienne, et ses doigts s'emmêlant avec les miens. Mon esprit était embrumé, il vivait chaque seconde pleinement, entièrement, je ne voulais rien rater à toutes ses nouvelles sensations. J'en perdis complètement la notion du temps, tout était si agréable, ses caresses, ses baisers, mais aussi, le goût de ses lèvres, le goût de chaque parcelle de sa peau, et son odeur tellement parfaite. Lorsque nous nous rhabillâmes je dû courir dans ma loge, avant d'avoir embrassé furtivement Vanessa hilare, pour me mettre en maillot, afin ne pas être en retard sur le plateau. Quand nous nous retrouvâmes sur le tournage, elle m'adressa un magnifique clin d'œil qui me fit fondre et tourner la tête. Avais-je touché au bonheur ? Il sera en deux parties, j'espère que vous l'apprécierez ![Chapter 2] La scène se termina vite, Vanessa et moi étions tellement motivées, à fond, que nous jouions presque parfaitement. C'était notre dernière scène à deux. Celles qui nous restaient à tourner demain étaient des scènes avec James ou bien avec Rachel et Selena. Le diner se passa comme tous les soirs, même si nous sentions une certaine tension à l'approche de la fin du tournage, tout le monde était fatigué. Cela faisait presqu'un an que nous étions sur ce projet, casting comprit. Le montage allait surement prendre un temps fou, mais après ce n'était plus de notre ressort. Le soir je saluais Vanessa comme je saluais les autres, pour ne pas éveiller de soupçons. Mais une heure après on toqua à ma porte. J'allai ouvrir, et ce fut sans surprise que je découvris Vanessa, tout sourire, en nuisette, face à moi. - Je peux entrer cinq minutes ? - Bien sur !, répondis-je en la laissant passer. Nous nous essayâmes sur mon lit. - Je voulais parler de ce qu'il s'est passé tout à l'heure, commença-t-elle, puisqu'on n'en a pas eu l'occasion jusqu'à maintenant. Ce qu'il s'est passé entre nous, c'est… éphémère, c'était juste comme ça, ou bien, tu en attends plus ? Je ne m'étais pas posé la question, mais il m'avait été évident que ce ne serait pas éphémère. Je pensais que cela l'était pour elle aussi, elle me faisait peur soudainement, était-ce une histoire d'un soir ? - Je… Je ne voulais pas seulement coucher avec toi, commençais-je, je voulais plus, je crois… Pourquoi ? Tu trouves que tu as fais une erreur ? Je baissai la tête pour regarder les draps. Elle me prit le menton entre ses doigts et releva mon visage pour encrer ses yeux dans les miens, comme elle savait si bien le faire. - Si j'ai fais une erreur, c'était la plus agréable de ma vie ! Bien sur que non, ce n'était pas une faute, mais j'avais peur que pour toi ce ne soit qu'un coup comme ça… Je veux aller plus loin avec toi. Je chuchotai son prénom presque imperceptiblement et me jetai sur ses lèvres. Notre baiser fut bref mais passionné. - Je vais retourner dans ma chambre, je pense que, eum, coucher une deuxième fois le premier jour, serait un peu maladroit non ? - Oui, sans doute, répondis-je en souriant et en me levant en l'imitant pour la raccompagner. Elle me donna un vif baiser et nous nous souhaitâmes une bonne nuit avant que je ne referme la porte à clef. Je m'allongeai sur mon lit en soufflant. Tout bouillonnait en moi, mon cœur pompait mon sang à une vitesse folle, mon estomac était noué, mes oreilles bourdonnaient et un sourire béta ne quittait plus mon visage. C'était étrange, nouveau, je n'étais jamais tombée amoureuse subitement, toujours mes sentiments avaient évolué avec le temps, passant de l'amitié à l'admiration puis à de l'attirance, mais là, du statut d'amie elle avait tout de suite prit un statut beaucoup plus élevé, une immense place dans mon être. En quelques secondes, elle avait capturé mon cœur. J'espérais avoir fait la même chose avec le sien. Le lendemain était donc notre dernier jour de tournage. Je passerai la description des scènes que nous avons tournées, mais reviendrai plutôt sur notre soirée. Forcément une soirée était organisée pour fêter la fin du tournage. Nous étions tous réunis dans le hall de l'hôtel entièrement réservé. Tout le monde était là, acteurs, réalisateurs, monteurs, caméramans, perchistes, etc., personne ne manquait à l'appel. Nous étions extrêmement nombreux et l'ambiance était super. Nourriture et boissons à volonté, discours, remerciements, la soirée fut mémorable, remplit de délires et de rigolades. Vers minuit/une heure du matin, beaucoup partirent se coucher pour éviter de trop abuser de l'alcool. Vers deux heures il ne restait plus que Rachel, Vanessa, Selena, Harmony, James et moi, les cinq acteurs principaux et le producteur. Nous nous rappelions quelques anecdotes sur le tournage tout en buvant de plus en plus. Forcément nous finîmes par être un peu imbibé d'alcool, je gardai le contrôle et arrêtai de boire, mais les autres continuaient, surtout Vanessa. La conversation se transformait en vrai fouillis, quand Vanessa lança un nouveau sujet qui nous surprit tous. - Ah ! Aufait ! Je me suis fais larguer par mon copain !, dit-elle la voix qui déraillait à cause de l'alcool. - Ah ouais ? s'enquit Rachel, tout aussi bourrée. - Oui ! Et ce connard n'a même pas attendu que je rentre pour le faire en face, non ! Il l'a fait pidaya…pitoyabeulement par téléphone ! - Raconte ! lança Selena sur le même ton que les deux autres. Vanessa commença un long récit de leur conversation, sans jamais m'adresser un seul regard. James en profita pour s'éclipser en me saluant, et fut bientôt suivit par Harmony qui embrassa furtivement Rachel avant de monter se coucher. Lorsque Vanessa eut finit son histoire, elle éclata instantanément en sanglot sous nos regards abasourdis. Elle avait raconté son historie avec un telle mépris envers Austin qu'il semblait invraisemblable qu'elle se mette à pleurer. - Ça va aller ma puce, susurra Selena en lui caressant le dos, tu trouveras quelqu'un d'autre ! - Mais je l'aimais ce sal type ! - Si c'est un sal mec, et qu'il t'as lâché, il n'en vaut pas la peine, ajouta Rachel. - Mais je l'aime ! C'était l'homme de ma vie. C'était comme si mon cœur venait de se briser en milles morceaux. Même bourrée, elle avait crié cette phrase avec une telle puissance, qu'il n'en put être autrement, elle devait l'aimer vraiment. Et elle se mit à répéter encore et encore qu'elle l'aimait plus que tout, et elle pleurait de plus belle. Je n'arrivais plus à supporter la scène, pourquoi m'avait-elle embrassé si sensuellement si elle ne ressentait rien pour moi ? J'étais désespérer, mais je ne devais pas pleureur moi aussi, cela aurait parut suspect. Nous décidâmes de monter dans les chambres pour aller coucher Vanessa, qui visiblement était la plus éméchée d'entre nous. Evidemment il fut à ma charge de la ramener jusque dans sa chambre, étant moi-même la moins éméchée. Elle avait passé un bras sur mon épaule et je la soutenais par la taille pour qu'elle marche droit. J'ouvris la porte de sa chambre et elle insista pour que je la porte jusqu'à son lit. Une fois assise dessus elle recommença à pleurer et à parler de son ex petit ami. C'était plus fort que moi, je ne pouvais décemment pas partir et la laisser pleureur seule, alors je restai là à la consoler, même si je ne pensais pas les mots que je disais, même si j'avais envie de me tirer pour hurler de douleur. - Je dois t'embêter à pleurer tout le temps Ashley, je suis désolée… - T'es complètement alcoolisée, c'est pas vraiment de ta faute, je ne t'en veux pas. - Dis, on a vraiment couché ensemble l'autre jour ? demanda-t-elle sautant du coq à l'âne. - Pourquoi cette question ? Je suis sûre que tu n'as pas oublié… Quoique là j'ai des doutes… - Non, mais… Enfin je veux dire… C'était bien hein, on recommence quand tu veux d'ailleurs, et on peut s'embrasser quand tu veux aussi ! Puis ya pas de rapport avec Austin, mais voila, t'étais là et voila… Non mais non, t'as toujours étais là enfait, et puis je t'aime beaucoup beaucoup beaucoup et c'était super bien, vraiment ! - Aller, tu devrais aller te coucher, tu dis n'importe quoi là, allonge toi, il est tard, et j'ai envie de dormir moi aussi. Elle ne répondit pas mais m'obéit. Une fois que je fus sûre qu'elle ne se relèverait pas, je sortis de sa chambre et courrai dans la mienne. Je refermai ma porte et m'écroulai à genoux, pleurant à chaudes larmes, évacuant toute la tristesse accumulée en moi pendant cette fin de soirée. - « Tu étais là et voila », dis-je à voix haute répétant les propos de Vanessa prononcés quelques minutes plus tôt, alors tu insinues que j'étais là au bon moment au bon endroit, que je passais par la pendant ta tristesse et que je te t'ai consolé sexuellement ? De rage j'abatis mon poing sur le sol en étouffant un cri accompagné d'un flopée de larmes. Moi qui pensais tomber amoureuse, je me retrouvais bien bête, elle s'était bien jouée de moi ! Mais pourtant… j'avais envie d'y croire. Les mots qu'elle m'avait dit l'autre soir dans ma chambre avaient eus l'air si sincères, ses baisers avaient été si tendre, comment tout cela aurait-il put être faux ? Je ne comprenais plus rien. Je dus mettre une bonne heure avant de me calmer et d'aller me coucher. Le lendemain nous retournions à New York en avion, il devait décoller à 23h. Heureusement, cela nous laisser le temps de dormir, de faire nos valises et surtout de dessouler. Je dus me réveiller vers 13h00 et, avec une légère gueule de bois, je fonçai sous la douche pour me rafraichir. Je m'efforçai de ne pas repenser aux évènements passés. Une fois propre je m'afférai à faire mes valises. Pas bien compliqué, nous étions en pleine été et ma garde robe se composait essentiellement de shorts, t-shirts et maillots de bains. Une fois inactive et ne sachant plus quoi faire je m'allongeai sur mon lit et me mis fatalement à penser. Ce que Vanessa avait dit hier, était-ce sous le coup de l'alcool ou bien le pensait-elle vraiment ? Je n'arrivai pas à répondre à la question, je voulais aller la voir dans sa chambre, mais il n'était « que » 15h00 et vu l'état dans lequel je l'avais laissé hier, je pensais qu'elle avait encore besoin de sommeil. Je voulu descendre pour voir s'il y avait du monde en bas, mais je fus prise d'une flemmardise immense et restai couché sur mon lit attendant 16h00 pour aller frapper chez Vanessa. Je m'assoupis quelques instant et ré-ouvrai les yeux vers 16h10, j'estimai donc que je pouvais aller rentre visite à mon amie, ou plutôt devrai-je dire, à « la seule personne au monde qui ne m'avait jamais fait autant d'effet, et ressentir autant d'émotions différentes en si peu de temps », enfin c'était beaucoup trop long. Je me levai une boule au ventre et sortis de ma chambre me dirigeant vers celle de mon amie. Je restai un petit moment devant l'entrée, hésitant finalement à frapper, mais j'avais soiffe de réponses, l'amour sans doute me poussa à toquer. Une petite voix demanda qui était là et j'informai Vanessa qui j'étais. J'attendis un moment et elle ouvra lentement la porte, je venais visiblement de la réveiller, ses cheveux étaient en pétard, ses yeux cernés et sa voix roque. - Euh je peux passer plus tard si tu veux, chuchotai-je gênée de la voir ainsi. - Non, non c'est bon, au moins je suis réveillée, il va bien falloir que je fasse ma valise un jour, entre. Une fois dedans elle s'assit prestement sur son lit. - J'ai un de ces mal de crâne ! râla-t-elle en se prenant la tête à deux mains. - Pas étonnant vu l'état dans lequel tu t'es mis hier… T'as pas une boite de doliprane qui traine quelque part ? - Si surement dans ma trousse de toilette. - Bouge pas je t'apporte ça. J'allai fouiller dans la salle de bain et dénichai les cachets, choppai au passage un verre d'eau et revins lui donner. Elle avala le tout en me remerciant. - Bon mais je suppose que tu n'es pas venu ici pour me soigner… - En effet, tu te souviens de la soirée d'hier ? demandai-je en espérant au font de moi qu'elle aurait tout oublié. - Malheureusement oui… Ecoute, je… - Non laisse moi dire quelque chose avant, la coupai-je, vu la situation je ne veux pas être méchante ou te blesser, mais je veux que tu le saches. Hier soir, en t'entendant parler, j'ai eu si mal, mon cœur se contractait sur lui-même, c'était comme si tu avais réduit à néants tous nos moments passés ensemble, j'aurai donné n'importe quoi pour aller égorger cet Austin et t'avoir rien que pour moi. Mais aujourd'hui ma colère est passée et si je suis venu ici c'est pour m'excuser de ce que j'ai fais, si je t'ai embrassé et que tu n'en avais pas envie j'en suis désolée, si tu t'es sentis forcé de coucher avec moi j'en suis désolée, je ne voulais pas te déboussoler, si… - Attend, attend, attend, qu'est ce que tu racontes ! s'exclama-t-elle en me coupant cette fois, pourquoi tu t'excuses là !? C'est à moi que revient ce « droit », ce devoir ! Peut-être que je ne me suis pas complètement remise de ma rupture avec Austin, du fait qu'il est fait ça par téléphone et aussi parce qu'il était ma première relation sérieuse, mais les moments que nous avons passé ensemble, je les ai aimé, je les ai voulu, t'embrasser ça a été tellement beau, bon, libérateur, je n'avais jamais ressentis cette sensation auparavant. Hier sous le coup de l'alcool j'ai ressassé bêtement le passé et je m'en excuse, je ne voulais pas te blesser, mais tu sais comment je réagis à un surplus de Vodka, ça part n'importe où… - Mais tu es sûre que je n'ai pas précipité un peu les choses ? - Ashley ! Bien sûr que non ! Ce baiser j'en avais autant envie que toi ! Je… Je n'ai jamais ressentis autant de sentiments aussi fort et aussi vite envers quelqu'un… Je ne pus me retenir, des larmes de joie s'échappèrent de mes yeux et un sourire fendit mon visage, un rire nerveux coupa le silence et je me jetai dans ses bras. Ses mains chaudes se plaquèrent dans mon dos, puis je retirai mon menton de son épaule pour venir placer mon regard devant le sien. Un énorme sourire étirait sa bouche, mon visage l'imitait, nous nous regardions, ce moment était magnifique, quelques rires nous échappaient tellement nous étions heureuse d'être là. Je ne pus me retenir et je me ruai sur ces lèvres. Je frissonnai à son contact, cette nuit j'avais cru que jamais plus je ne pourrais les posséder, et pourtant là, je l'embrassais, elle m'embrassait, j'étais heureuse, c'était magnifique. A regret nous nous décollâmes pour reprendre notre souffle. - Je… Je crois que je t'aime Ashley… Ses yeux s'emplirent de larmes et elle sauta de nouveau sur ma bouche. Notre baiser fut encore plus passionné que celui que nous venions d'interrompre. Nos corps frêles et secoués par l'émotion cédèrent et nous tombâmes à la renverse sur son lit, elle sur moi. Elle me caressait les cheveux, je caressais son dos. Malgré la légère odeur d'alcool qui l'entourait ce moment était intense et j'aurais voulu qu'il ne cesse jamais. Mais je dus y mettre fin. - Il va quand même falloir que tu fasses ta valise et que tu te prépares, dis-je en la regardant en souriant intensément. - Arf… Tu as raisons ! Elle déposa un baiser sur mon front et se leva vivement du lit, tanguant sous le choc. Elle sortit sa valise et l'ouvrit, se hâtant pour en finir vite. Je la regardais ranger et quand elle en fut à la moitié je me levai et me postai derrière elle alors qu'elle prenait un tas de t-shirt dans le placard. - Je crois que je t'aime aussi, chuchotai-je à son oreille en passant mes bras autour de sa taille. Elle rigola, se mordilla la lèvre et me regarda lui embrasser le cou et ensuite venir chercher sa langue pour jouer avec. Puis je la lâchai difficilement pour l'aider à boucler sa valise. J'ai vraiment adoré l'écrire même si j'ai bien galéré x) ","Summary":" Cet OS se passe pendant le tournage du film Spring Breakers.

I wanted to say. \"We got to wake up Isaac.\" Pearl said. Getting off my legs. I finally got up. We went to the next room which was Isaac's. Dawn open's the door slowly and we stick our heads in. We can see Isaac cuddling up to his blankey. His favorite blanket since he was five years old. Me, Joel, Dawn, and Pearl quickly jumped on the bed. \"Wake up little BITCH!\" We all yelled. \"Dudes! What the fuck!\" Isaac said covering his ear's with his pillow. \"God Dammit Isaac! It's Spring Break!\" Pearl and Dawn basically said at the same time. I nodded my head in a agreement. Joel hit Isaac with the extra pillow he had on his head. \"Back off my grill!\" Isaac shouted. Me, Pearl and Dawn laughed. \"You we have to wait for Autumn and her mom?\" I asked. Autumn was 15 like Isaac. Dawn and Pearl the same age 18. But there birthday's are in different months. Joel was 17. And I am 14. The youngest. Dawn was the oldest cousin, then Joel, then Autumn and Isaac and last me. Pearl wasn't a cousin. She is Dawn's best friend and our's now. Joel and Isaac were related. Dawn was related to her younger brother Greg. And I was related to my younger brother Travis. \"Of course. There always late.\" Dawn rolled her eyes. \"Yea. Like Autumn tell your mom she can strip for guys later!\" Joel said. I gasped then laugh and so did the rest of us. \"This spring break's going to be the best!\" I said. \"Totally!\" Dawn said grabbing Pearl's hand and Isaac's and Isaac grabbed mine and I grabbed Joel's who grabbed Pearl's. We had planned this Spring break. To have the best of all times. Do the craziest of the craziest things ever. \"Spring Break Forever Bitches!\" We shouted. OKAY GUYS! TELL ME IF IT WAS GOOD! COMMENT, FAVORITE ME AND MY STORY, FOLLOW MY STORY AND ME! ILL BE POSTING WHEN I HAVE TIME! SO BYE![Chapter 2] \"Come down! Party is about to start!\" One of the aunt's or uncle's yelled. I rolled my eye's. \"Better go, or there start being pussy's and get pissed.\" Joel said. All of us got off Isaac's bed and walked down stairs. \"Happy Birthday BABY!\" Isaac's mom said for the millionth time. \"Thank's mom.\" He said annoyed. \"Are the game's ready?\" Isaac asked excited. \"We need to set the one up.\" Isaac's mom didn't want to say which game it was. \"Oh! The nacho's are ready! Eat up!\" \"Yes!\" We all yelled. After Joel and Isaac served there plate I did. I put everything on it. Chips, cheese, beans, avocado, sour cream and other stuff. \"Dawn, Saved you a spot.\" Pearl said taking the chairs. I groaned. Then made a sex noise. Then Riley and Pearl made one. Then Joel and Issac. We laughed. \"Is Mitch coming?\" Isaac asked. Mitch was Autumn's older brother but younger than is older sister. \"Let me check.\" Riley said getting his IPhone 4S out. Out of now where laughing bursted out. We turned to see my dad and my uncle laughing at my aunt's. I rolled my eye's. \"Shut your mouth's you vipor's!\" I shouted and Pearl giggled. On our shirt's me and Pearl had easter names that we had found on Facebook Mine was Clumsy Cotton Tail and Pearl was Pop RainDrop. \"I want an easter name!\" Riley said. \"Then find one!\" Isaac said in a laugh. Riley frowned. \"I'll look for one for you.\" I said. I grabbed my laptop that was next to me. I went on Facebook and looked at the posted. \"Riley, you are Loco Sprinkles.\" Riley laughed. \"Joel you are, Daffodil Marsh mellow. Isaac! Your, Purple Marsh mellow.\" \"What's Autumn's?\" Joel asked. I looked for Autumn's anishalls which are A.H. \"Her's is, Lily RainDrop.\" I grabbed a piece of paper and wrote the names for Riley, Joel, Isaac, and Autumn and tapped Riley's, Joel's, and Isaac. Not Autumn's because she wasn't here yet. RING! The doorbell went! Thunder, Joel's and Isaac's dog, went crazy. So did Lulu my dog. When they opened the door it was Isaac's dad side's uncle. We waved hi and Isaac gave them a hug. \"It feel's like i haven't seen you in forever!\" Isaac's other grandma said. Isaac was about to reply but his mom interrupted. \"Since everyone is here. We can start the games!\" Autumn's mom was always late so Isaac mom didn't care about her right at this moment. We all went out side. \"Okay! Get in a line!\" and so we did. She numbered us into groups. I was basically with my whole family but I had Riley's little brother on our team. I looked at Pearls team who had my uncle Adrian, his son Adrian who was five, Pearl, Joel, and Isaac's uncle on his dad side Jeff, I believed. Riley's team contained him, his mom, Isaac, Isaac's dad's mom, and my aunt Lilia. \"Now decided who's going to be team caption. \"Dad you gonna be team caption. Okay?\" I said. \"No! Let Adam be team caption.\" My mom suggested. I rolled my eye's. Great. I though. \"Okay. Raise you hand if your team caption.\" Isaac's mom yelled. Adam raised his hand for our team. I could see my uncle Adrian rasing his hand for his team, and Issac raise his hand for his team. \"Your team one.\" She told us. She told My uncle's team they were two and Isaac's team three. \"Our first game is . . . . . . Darts!\" Mrs. Benson said. (Issac's mom.) The balloon's had paint in them when you hit them. But she wouldn't tell us the amount each color was. \"Team caption's start first.\" Mrs. Benson announced. Adam went first and threw it but didn't hit a color. \"I got this.\" My uncle said. But then missed. I laughed. Isaac went up the threw it and hit a green color. \"Yea!\" Cheered there team. \"It's going youngest to oldest after the team caption.\" So my brother went next. He threw but missed the yellow by an inch. Baby Adrian went next and hit the flowers. We all laughed. Riley went next ad was trying to hit a red but missed. I was next. My goal was the green one. I threw but it didn't hit it. Joel went for his team and hit the red one. Riley's mom went next but missed. My mom went and got a green and then jumped around like the crazy mom she was. Pearl went next and Pearl was a pro at darts so she got a red one quick. And so on and so on. There was at least 10 left out of the 20. \"We have to move on!\" Mr. Benson said. We all groaned. The team who got first place was team two and three!\" Yea they cheered. They game Riley's mom and Pearl and extra because they got the most darts on. We got second place so they gave a us orange paper that had 2's on them. While everyone else got papers with 1's on them. \"Ok so the next game!\" Mr. Benson called out. Hi guys! Tell me if you thought it was good! The team's might have been confusing so ill tell you. Team 1: Dawn, Her mom and dad, her younger brother ,and Riley's younger brother Team 2: Pearl, Joel, Joel's Dad's brother Jeff, Mom's brother Uncle Adrian and his son Adrian. Team 3: Issac, Riley, Riley's mom, Uncle Adrian's wife Lilia, and Issac's dad's mom. (Issac's other grandma.) So those are the team's for Isaac's college games. Hope you enjoyed![Chapter 3] The next game that we had to do was we had to tie balloon's to our ankle's and step on each others. \"Okay. Is everyone ready?\" Mr. Benson asked. We all said yes. \"Go!\" He shouted. I quickly stepped on my Uncle Adrian's balloon but it wouldn't pop. Finally I stepped on it so hard it popped. He was out of the game. POP! POP! POP! Went three other balloon's out of the fifteen. I step on my brother's Isaac. He snap's his finger's then walks out of the area. POP! POP! POP! POP! Four more went. I could see my uncle Jeff on my dad's side try to pop me but then Pearl popped him. Seven more people were still in. Me, Riley's mom, Pearl, Dawn, Dawn's mom, Dawn's dad, and my aunt Lilia. I could see Pearl and Dawn were tag teaming and trying to pop me. So i quickly ran past Dawn's mom and Dawn stepped on her mom's balloon. \"Got out by your on daughter!\" My aunt Lilia shouted across the field. Riley's mom was dancing in place for an odd reason. Dawn then popped her dad's and I popped my aunt Lilia. There was only four of us left. Pearl, Me, Dawn, and Riley's mom. I was trying to step on Pearl's or Dawn's but it was hard. \"Why aren't you guys getting her!\" My aunt's and uncle's yelled pointing to Riley's mom. \"Hey!\" Riley's mom yelled. Finally I popped Dawn's. I let out a laugh. While Riley's mom was staying back I was against Pearl. Pearl was getting on me. when I was going to pop her's she had popped me. I frowned. I walked to the cement and watched the game. Riley's mom against Pearl. \"Oh great!\" I shouted. My aunt's and uncle's laughed. \"Oh god. Riley's mom is going to crush Pearl. Right, Joel?\" Dawn asked crossing her arm. \"Totally.\" I agreed. \"Look who decided to show up.\" Riley said now standing by Dawn. We looked seeing Autumn and her mom getting got the car. \"What is she wearing? Her stripper outfit?\" Riley let out a laugh and so did me and Dawn. I looked back at the game and still there were fighting each other. Finally Riley's mom pushed Pearl to the ground. \"Oh my god!\" Riley shouted. All of us laughed. Riley's mom finally stepped on Pearl's balloon. Riley's mom cheered and then took a shot with the other adults. My mom ,Mrs. Benson, gave Riley's mom a pper with a number 1 on it and she gave me and Pearl paper's with two's on them. Me and pearl high fived. I looked in the corner of my eye to see Autumn and Isaac talking. They were probably talking about Team fortress 2. How dumb I though. Then she starts to talk to Riley. Finally she makes her approach. \"Hey, peasants.\" She says. \"Hey, freak.\" I said bacl. \"What took you so long?\" Dawn asked then Pearl. \"Traffic.\" Autumn said quiet. \"Sure...\" I said.

It's been about a year. A whole three hundred and sixty five days, give or take, since I shot my way into the newspapers and naturally, the idiots got it all wrong. All kinds of myths, misinformation, rumors, so much of it now regarded as fact by too many people. Some of the ones who have at least a piece of the truth won't say anything, don't want to have any part of the aftermath, and while I'd say they have a right to- they should, after what I put them through- it keeps the story from being told for what it is. Far more than otherwise, the morons were wrong about me. Sure, there were those bands I listened to, and yeah, I played the violent video games some feel are going to be the end of all civilization. Then there was my anger, and my well-hidden but nonetheless evident record of it- which some seem to think means I was a soulless psychopath, incapable of being pissed off for anything but selfish reasons. Each rumor has a small glint of truth, each piece forming a part of the entire puzzle. But they haven't got all the facts. They're not holding all the cards. I've still got a few. And they'll never know why. No, indeed, they won't. Not my parents- not like they talk to each other much anyway, so have fun trying to get a story straight between the two of them- not my friends, or anybody else I ever knew or was known by. Some of them have made sincere efforts towards finding out why I did what I did, and why Eric helped me. Most have just done their best to move on, which is about all any of them have been able to do. But nobody ever really moves on from something like this; not really. Someone will always be wondering, but I couldn't say anything even if I wanted to. Neither could Eric. But, like me, he doesn't seem to mind. I think the both of us still have our own questions about what we did, our own curiosities. Because, really, even we don't really know. We're not too sure of it ourselves these days. Eric and I don't regret what we did; it's not that. We knew what we were getting ourselves into, what we were about to do. We knew that the day after we had our revenge, millions would curse our names. We knew, each in our own way, what course fate would take. But what exactly drove us to do what we did? What single reason did Eric and I have for coming up with our plan for V-Day? Vengeance Day, we called it. Eric and I had a lot of laughs over that; we thought the name so fitting. We loved ourselves for being so clever. We were smarter than everybody else; better. More than them, we lived on a higher plane of existence. Who knows? Maybe there is no one, single reason. I just decided to do it one day; I just made up my mind that that's what I was going to do with my life. I was angry, yes, but I hated myself more than anyone else ever could've. I killed, yes, but the one I wanted dead most was me. Ultimately, maybe I did it because I dismissed the ones who talked about such thoughts, such mental struggles as I went through before resolving to do what I did, as weak. I laughed at the ones who impulsively attempted suicide and went through a recovery process, ignored the fact that many managed to move on and make something of themselves. I resolved that I would end the battle waging in my mind on my terms. I decided I would rely on no one but myself. And, well, we all know where that led. And Eric? I think, in his own way, he figures it was just the same for him, too. If nothing else, he one day just decided to do it. V-Day was just what he figured on doing with his life. It wasn't until he- we all know who he is- wrote that essay that appeared on that TV star's website that I saw someone really, and truly, want to know why with no hatred towards me. That journalist, he was a man looking for truthful answers; not easy ones. It hit me hard, that paper. I honestly didn't believe, when I stood there in the school cafeteria kitchen with Eric and pulled the trigger on my rifle, that there was anybody left in the world who gave half a fuck. I was sure there wasn't a thing I'd be leaving behind, that there wasn't a person in the world who'd mind my departure. In the aftermath, I learned many facts about them just as they learned many facts about me. You can do that, when you're like this. I've learned a lot since I came to the 'other side', wherever it is I am now. There were a lot of unexpected things, some not so expected, other revelations that I never could've seen coming. One thing I should have expected- but didn't- was just how happy Eric was that I spared him. That bizarre moment while we shot up the school together, when he was telling me how he killed Mr. Luce… I nearly shot Eric. I didn't know why then and I don't know now. It just seemed like a good thing to do at the time. But I changed my mind; at the last moment I did. And Eric was just so stunned that I'd even considered it; he couldn't even begin to understand why I'd ever stop being his friend. I think I escaped something very bad by not shooting Eric. Had I killed Eric, and seen him again here… I don't think I could have looked him in the eye. I'm glad I chose otherwise, because it's quite possible Eric would have never understood being betrayed like that. It surprises me, in a way, but I really am glad we were friends. And that we still are. Something I learned from dying- death by gunshot is indeed quick. The pain is blinding, but it doesn't last for even a full second. When I got to the 'other side', it was kind of like waking up from a deep sleep. There was a lot of white; the ground beneath me felt kind of sandy. Off in the distance, I could see somebody curled up, sleeping. Vaguely, I noticed the shape seemed familiar. Getting up, I walked over towards whoever it was. I glanced around me about then; the white, sandy ground and pale sky stretched on, seemingly forever. Wind howled, making a strangely hollow sound; but I didn't feel any wind on my back. A sun of some kind shone above, but I felt no harshness or heat. It wasn't hot or cold, or any of those things. It all simply was ; same for me, and this other person. We were just there . Then I stood over the sleeping figure; sure enough, it was Eric, dressed just the same as I last saw him. \"Eric,\" I said quietly, \"Hey, man.\" I knelt by him, gently shaking his shoulder. Eric blinked, sitting up and looking around. He stretched a little and groaned; almost reflexively, he suddenly put his hand on the back of his head- where the 9mm gunshot wound should have been. His hand came away clean, and he looked at me in confusion. \"Dude,\" he said, \"What the fuck?\" I just shrugged. Eric always was a bit slow on the uptake; I could see that hadn't much changed, even here. Wherever 'here' might happen to be. Then comprehension slowly dawned on Eric's face; he looked up at me, suddenly happy. \"Dude!\" Eric jumped up, hugging me tight and grinning. \"Aw, man. Fuck, Alex! Fuck!\" He just didn't seem to know what to say; Eric never was much of a talker. But he was clearly happy to see me. And for my part, there weren't many I'd have rather met on the 'other side' either. \"You're the best friend I got in the world, man,\" he said after a minute of us looking around. \"I'm glad I'm not alone.\" After a few moments, I said, \"Yeah, me too.\" I meant it. We've done a lot of thinking since then; a lot of experimenting, and figuring out just where we are and what we can do here. There's actually a lot of things we can; our minds are more free here, and more powerful. And we can see the world we left when we want to- sometimes we can even visit it. But neither me nor Eric can ever make ourselves known. We can't talk to anybody, or anything like that. Maybe in time we'll figure out how… or maybe we can't because we don't really want to. I think Eric doesn't really understand why people are saying we're such bad guys now. He doesn't quite see the connection; in his eyes, we're good friends who did what we wanted to do with our lives. It goes no farther than that. Some people would mock Eric for that, for being so simple- and sometimes, a little stupid. But he's loyal. When Eric decides to be a friend of yours, he'll be there as long as you want him around- and sometimes, when you need him around but only he knows it. He trusts his instincts like I trust my intuition; for Eric everything is always simple. All questions have an answer… but the things he doesn't understand baffle him. That's where he turns to me. I think sometimes I wonder if I really did the right thing- if I would do it all again if I had the chance to go back. For Eric, though, it's simple: we did do what we should have. He doesn't regret anything. I think, in many ways, he was angrier than me- he had more wrongs he wanted to pay everybody back for before he went. But I made my choice. I made it, and it won't ever fully fade from memories of those who knew me before and those who heard of me afterward. The same goes for Eric; all the same things apply to him. He made is choice, too. We knew what we were doing. And we have no regrets. We did what we wanted to do; that's all. I guess we're gonna be here a while; good thing the both of us have good company for the wait, and plenty to do with our time. But there's always something to think about; always another question. The other world, the one we left, is only more so. Where we've got a few questions or thoughts about what happened, the old world has a million. I couldn't change that even if I wanted to; the questions will always be there. Theirs, and mine. But they'll never know why.

His best friend and the love of his life. Now Alex is on death row, doomed to lethal injection. Eric is brought to him late at night. What will he say to Alex? A/N: I've watched the movie Elephant multiple times and I must say... I'm still not bored of it. It's wonderful. The characters are both very fascinating to me. Enjoy! Disclaimer: I don't own anything except... no, nothing at all. Eric fell onto the cafeteria floor, dead. Blood spilled out of his chest. He never felt any pain. He was just suddenly dead. A flash of light appeared. Eric got up and began to walk into it. As he stepped into the bright light, not stopping until he was on the other side. \"Alex?\" Eric found himself asking as he saw what appeared to be his best friend. In a single jail cell lying in bed. \"I wondered when you were going to show up. I'm surprised it took you so long.\" Alex laughed as he sat up in bed. He took this time to look at Eric. Who was wearing the same clothes he had died in. Alex, on the other hand was in an orange jumpsuit. \"I got a little lost. Being dead is a lot harder than it looks.\" Eric scratched the back of his head nervously. \"Yeah, I'm sorry about that.\" Alex apologized with a sad look on his face. Eric walked over to the bed and sat down beside the same boy who had killed him just two months before. \"Bullshit, you enjoyed killing me!\" Eric was angry. Angry because the only person he had ever loved killed him. Alex betrayed him in the darkest and cruelest way possible. Alex looked up at him with shame on his face. \"I loved you, Eric. I couldn't just let you go to jail for something that was my idea.\" Alex whispered then softly sighed. He had felt incredibly bad about killing his best friend and lover. Yes, his lover. \"You loved me so you had to kill me? What kind of fucked up shit is that? Did I mean anything to you?\" Eric was pissed off. And why wouldn't he be? His own best friend had murdered him! Alex the one who had fucked him in the shower just hours before killing him. \"You meant absolutely everything to me, Eric.\" Alex replied as he sniffled a bit and started to cry. Eric frowned as he did this but couldn't bring himself to comfort his killer. \"You're really fucked up. Aren't you?\" Eric knew he wouldn't be there dead if he was just fine. Alex looked like he hadn't slept well in weeks. Then again, he was in prison. Probably on death row. Which is the only reason Eric was there now. \"I didn't want you to be like me.\" Alex said through a light sob. After that, Eric couldn't take being a bastard anymore and he hugged Alex. Alex grabbed onto Eric tightly and buried his face into Eric's chest. \"That was what you wanted... Wasn't it? Me to help you?\" Eric asked while he placed a hand on Alex's back and rubbed it carefully. \"Well, yes. But I didn't want you to be a monster like I am. I really loved you Eric. I still do. I fucked up majorly. There's no possible way you'll ever forgive me. You can't, you're dead. Soon I will be too.\" Alex whispered and sobbed more. He pulled back only to look at Eric's face. Eric simply smiled at him. \"You really loved me?\" Eric didn't care that Alex had killed him. He didn't care at all. As long as what Alex was saying was true. That's all he needed to move on. \"With all my heart. I just couldn't stand to see you destroy your life for me. I didn't want to be responsible for ruining you. So I got the idea, if you weren't here then nobody could arrest you.\" Alex had a very intelligent explanation. It even actually made Eric relieved he had died. \"Thanks, Alex.\" Eric smiled a bit at his once best friend. Alex wiped his nose and looked up at Eric with fascination. \"You mean you aren't mad at me?\" Alex whispered in a conflicted voice. Alex may have been the smarter one of the two boys. But Eric never ceased to amaze him with little things he'd do or say. It was as though they had been clearly designed for one another. Alex, the more talented and analytical of the two. Eric, strong and only a little bit arrogant. \"Now that I think about it... If you hadn't killed me... I'd be locked up in here. Like you. I don't want that for me. I don't want that for you either. But I suppose in a little while none of that will matter. Will it, Alex?\" Eric placed his hand under Alex's chin and gently caressed him. Alex merely smiled up at Eric happily. He was so glad that Eric didn't hate him. Even if this was only a hallucination due to mental health problems or sleep deprivation. Alex didn't care. It was soothing. This was something Alex missed the most about Eric being dead, he was no longer there to comfort Alex. In life he was the only person to be able to. \"I'm so sorry, Eric.\" Alex whispered softly before swallowing saliva. Eric continued to hold onto Alex's chin. Eric didn't want to let go. \"Don't be. I probably deserved it anyway. Do you know how many people I've robbed?\" Eric scoffed and laughed. Alex did too. \"Yeah, you've stolen from me plenty of times.\" Alex grabbed ahold of the hand that was under his chin and brought it down to his lap. Eric's fingers intertwined with Alex's and his did the same simultaneously. \"I have never once stolen anything from you, Alex.\" Eric shook his head. Giving him a serious face. The thing about death for Eric was, he couldn't lie. Eric had tried plenty of times. He just couldn't anymore. It was like something prevented him to. \"I can name one thing easily.\" Alex snickered with a wide grin. Eric was curious now. He couldn't remember ever taking anything from Alex. \"Oh yeah, what's that?\" Eric wondered in a sigh. \"You stole any chance I ever had at being straight.\" Alex answered with a sinister smile. Eric managed to smirk at this reply. Alex was the type of guy who denied that there was such thing as homosexuality. He continued to deny it even if he was kissing another guy. Nevertheless while he was having sex with him. It simply didn't exist to Alex. Or he ignored it. \"You finally admit that you're gay when I'm dead?\" Eric snorted at him. This was perhaps the last thing he wanted to hear. He'd waited for Alex to confirm that his whole life. He waits until Eric is dead? Awesome . \"Shouldn't you just be happy to be the reason for it?\" Alex had a point. Eric paused while he thought of this. Finally, Eric nodded his head. \"Okay, yeah. I'm happy about that.\" Eric admitted in a bitter tone. Suddenly Eric felt Alex kiss him on the lips. Eric stayed still. It felt like he was alive in that small moment. Eric pulled away from Alex. \"Why am I here, Alex?\" \"What?\" Alex looked hurt because Eric was pushing him away. Eric placed both hands on Alex's shoulders and kept him at a distance. Eric knew he would become completely enthralled with him if he didn't. But Alex didn't need that. Not so much as he was trying to avoid something else. Eric knew Alex far too well even in death. \"Why am I here in your jail cell with you in the middle of the goddamn night? I'll give you a hint, it isn't just to have a one night stand with the dead guy you already hooked up with either.\" Eric had always been one to know when Alex was bullshitting him. Though Alex was very good at lying, he always seemed to know just what to say to make anyone believe him and he even fooled himself a few times but he couldn't bullshit Eric. \"I'm supposed to die tomorrow morning. Lethal injection.\" Alex informed with a frown on his face. He was clearly worried by this because he sucked in his cheeks. Alex reached up and held onto Eric's elbows tightly. So, that's why he could touch Eric? Because he was close to death as well. It seemed like their bond got stronger each second. \"So, what? I'm supposed to wait for you and we're supposed to live... Die happily ever after?\" Eric let go of Alex. Alex looked hurt again. Tears fell from his eyes. \"That's not what you want?\" Alex asked in a child-like voice filled with disappointment. As though he'd been expecting Eric to be happy about this. \"I don't want you to die! As for me, I deserved it. You don't deserve this, Alex. You don't deserve any of it!\" Eric shouted at him angrily. Alex looked down. \"I killed you, Eric. I deserve to die for that.\" Alex whimpered sadly into his hands. Eric felt like shit now but he was still pissed off. \"You really want to be with me after you die?\" Eric asked while holding in his anger. He didn't like this situation. But it was obviously something he'd have to endure. \"Yes, of course I do!\" Alex screamed at him through crying. As though he couldn't believe Eric would think otherwise. At this point, there was no way in hell Eric could say no to him. He never could. \"Okay, okay...\" Eric spat. Alex stopped crying when Eric grabbed his hand again and held it in his. Alex intertwined their fingers once more. \"I'll wait for you.\" Morning came. When Alex woke up in his cell Eric was gone. Nowhere to be found. But he could hear Eric's voice in his head guiding him. Alex was strapped to a chair. People stared at him. Prison guards next to him, doctors across from him. It was scary. Eric talked Alex through the hard parts. Even if it was only in his head, it comforted Alex a lot. Enough to die without being afraid. \"It's okay, you'll be fine.\" \"Close your eyes and count backwards from one hundred.\" \"It's almost over now.\" \"I forgive you, Alex.

I wanted you to be near me.\" \"You remember how I always used to say you sucked at playing the piano? You don't suck. You're fantastic, magnificent even.\" \"My favorite part about getting you drunk was when you'd pass out. You'd always fall asleep on me.\" \"Five, four, three, two, one.\" \"Good job, Alex!\" Eric clapped his hands as Alex walked into a bright light. When he stepped onto the other side there was nothing but white all around him. And suddenly, Eric appeared. \"Eric!\" Alex quickly ran over to him. It took seconds. When he reached Eric, he shoved him down. They fell together. Eric smiled at him lovingly. \"Hey there, how's it going?\" Eric laughed and put his hand under Alex's chin. Alex merely smiled at him. \"Is it weird that I actually feel happy being dead?\" Alex whispered before forcefully kissing Eric. Eric didn't object to it, he simply went along with it. Not to mention the fact he really enjoyed it. \"Nah, it's cool. I'm kinda happy too. Now that that you're here.\" Eric ran his hand through Alex's mess of black hair. Alex looked around. It was nothing but white, as though it were snowing so much you couldn't see anything else. Nobody else was around either. \"Are we in hell?\" Alex pondered the thought while he sat on top of Eric's stomach. Eric laid down and looked up at his friend. \"I was thinking more along the lines of a purgatory.\" Eric stated even though he wasn't at all religious. Alex was the one who went to church every Sunday morning. Which explained why he never admitted there was such thing as homosexuality before. Not that it mattered anymore. \"Oh, I like it here. I wanna stay. It's just you and me.\" Alex leaned forward and put his bright pink lips onto Eric's red lips. \"You want to stay? We'll stay here. It's always been just you and me, Alex. Always. I love you.\" Eric laughed in reply. He would be happy there in purgatory. As long as he was with Alex. The only person to ever take Eric seriously. The only person to ever think of Eric as something more than just some stupid kid. Alex, his best friend. ","Summary":" Summary: Alex shot and killed Eric. His best friend and the love of his life.

Un jours de décembre avec les classes de 6 eme nous sommes aller au cinéma voir éléphant man, un film sur la maladie ? Et j'ai trouver se film magnifique, j'en ai même pleurer, et en rentrant au collège seul a la fin du peloton comme toujours j'ai entendu plusieurs personne parler l'éléphante woman et qu'il en avais même un exemplaire au seins du collège, j'ai pris sa a la rigolade, jusqu'au moment ou Mélanie ai venu vers moi avec la plaquette du film et as dis - ma petite éléphante woman a moi il te manque juste un peut de maquillage pour ressemble a ton frère, dis t'elle en plaçant la plaquette prés de mon visage, on y voyais le visage du monsieur du film et le miens cote a cote - oui alice tu as le même visage, avec peut être un peut de peau en moins ria Nicolas qui était a coté d'elle Il y avais des éclats de rire de partout et moi j'était en larmes, le professeur qui nous accompagnais était au prés de moi et me réconfortais, il avais puni tous les élèves et m'avais mis a l'écart pour que je puisse me calmer, Je savais que mon visage n'était pas gracieux comme ceux de mes amies, ou des filles de ma classe, je savais que je n'était pas jolie, mais je ne me sentait pas si laide, enfin jusqu'à ce que mon surnom ne reste celui de éléphant woman, durant toutes mes année collège se surnom m'as suivi, j'ai passer quelque bon moment quand même, et j'ai même eu de très bon amie qui m'on toujours soutenu, et aider a passer les moqueries qui était permanente pour moi, et puis un jours j'en ai eu marre de tous sa et j'ai demander a parler avec quelqu'un pour m'aider, et l'infirmier de l'école a dis que c'était juste des moqueries rien de plus donc j'ai mis sa de coter et je suis retourner a ma triste petite vie, je vivais pour moi et j'ignorais au mieux ces voix qui me méprisais de jours en jours d'avantage. Durant les vacances de juillet 97 Un jours, a un rendez vous chez mon orthodontiste, - alice, j'ai le résultat de ta radio et je n'ai pas que de bonne nouvelle, premièrement je vais te faire un beau sourire et après se beau sourire tu ira voir un chirurgien pour faire une petite opération esthétique pour avoir une nouvelle mâchoire car comme on en as déjà parler tu as une malformation, je ne la pensais pas si volumineuse. - Comment ca, s'inquiéta ma mère qui était avec moi, que se passe t'il monsieur. - comme je le disais alice fais une forme de calcification, mais sa se soigne avec une légère opération, je vous conseil de prendre rendez vous avec monsieur Otavie au Mans pour prendre plus d'information, nous dit' il en nous remettant la carte du chirurgien - bien nous ferons sa dis ma mère. - au mois prochain alice, madame Chery merci de m'avoir écouter et de me faire confiance pour les soins de votre enfant et voila c'est comme sa que j'ai appris que j'avais une malformation a la mâchoire, et que pour avoir un visage correcte je devais finir mes soins d'orthodontie et subir une opération esthétique, pour moi accumulé tous sa en si peut de temps était un peut dure, et j'ai beaucoup lutté avec moi-même pour me faire a l'idée que je devais me faire opéré, mais l'opération ne sera pas pour tous de suite car je n'ai pas fini ma croissance et que je devais être soigner en totalité niveau dent avant pour pas faire d'infection et avoir ensuite un sourire bien droit. Durant les vacances de noël de 97 mon année de 3eme Un jours je me suis fais des amies en dehors du collège qui était ami avec des mec de mon collège, que je trouvais assez gentil et qui ne me parlais pas au collège il était eux aussi des exclus mais pour quoi sa je en le savais pas, nous sommes très vite devenu amis tous ensemble et on formais un bon petit groupe, grâce a eux j'ai tenu la fin de ma scolarité, et j'ai même réussi a obtenir mon brevet chose que je croyais impossible vu que je m'était mis en échec suite a toutes ses moqueries. L'année prochaine serai une nouvelle vie, je serai au lycée dans une classe ou je ne connaitrai personne d'après moi, et ou je pourrais oublier toutes mes années collège La rentré en 2nd compta se passait très bien on était une grande classe 36, 30 filles et 6 garçons, j'adorais ma classe on était tous ensemble, aucun soucis particulier, un super soutient, une belle complicité, et des prof superbe, surtout la prof de Français, un petit bout de femme avec un cœur gros comme sa, et avec la mains sur le cœur, un jours durant un court en semi groupe elle nous fessais travailler sur je ne sais plus trop quoi et on devais parler debout devant la moitie de la classe sur un sujet particulier, et moi je stressais pour mon opération qui était a venir et j'ai voulu parler de sa, car les garçons avais repris leur moquerie a mon sujet, donc j'ai décider de mettre les choses au point, Mardi 16 avril, le dernier jours était arriver et il ne restais plus que moi pour l'exposer, alors je me suis lever de ma place mais n'ai pas été devant les autres, je ne m'en sentais pas capable, et j'ai commencer mon discourt -

A bullet to the heart of the jock, his prettyrngirlfriend, and their possible unborn child. A happy little familyrnwould they have been? No, a future of arguments, question ofrnabortion, and premature parenthood would have been ahead of them. Wouldrnthat justify their slaying? Alexrnclosed his eyes and dropped his arms. It was over, and all thatrnremained were bloodied corpses and lifeless hallways. The silencernthat crept among the scene of the crime was unsettling, but that wasrnthe least of his worries. In therndistance, Alex listened in on the screaming sirens. Through his eyesrnhe saw the image of their cherry and blue vivid lights flashingrnreflected on the glass that surrounded the cafeteria. At this pointrnhis choices were reduced to the consequence of wronging his scornedrnmind or death, and death he freely accepted. He quittedrnthe desolate meat freezer to return back into the vestiges of therncafeteria. The explosions there had not detonated, nor clued thatrnthey would at any point. Instead, the floors were clustered with thernremains of an ordinary lunch period in an ordinary high school on anrnordinary day. Had only they've known that it was anything but,rnthey were would have been spared of the horrors that had taken place. Glancingrnabout the cafeteria, Alex found himself alone for real in therndisaster that he planned so vigilantly. And this loneliness was allrntoo real in itself, so unlike the one he felt when he played thernpiano in his empty bedroom, left him to fret in silence. His viewrnbegan to blur around him as the sirens blared louder and louder intornhis ears, into his mind, into his weakening heart. Murderer. Alexrndropped to his knees with tears suddenly glistening down hisrnreddening cheeks. He shamefully covered his face with hisrnfatigue-covered left arm, muffling his pathetic, last-ditch attemptrnof feeling any emotion at all. Murderer. His mindrnscreamed, sparing him no pity for his horrible actions. Not even hisrnonly friend and partner in this massacre, Eric, was safe when hisrnmind, corrupt with immense hatred, shifted far from its previouslyrnbarely sane state into full-fledged psychosis. His death, let alonernthat of the rest of unfortunate souls that crossed paths with Ericrnand himself, became a plague that broke the remains of his heartrnafter the endless taunting into a million pieces that he knew herncould never replace. He shiftedrnthe barrel of his rifle towards himself and stared right into it.rnHis vision blurred once more as his fingers fettled around to findrnthe trigger. Mind racing through events that took place in span ofrntwo days, he searched for one reason to continue a life in the cruel,rnhopeless world he had come to known. Unfortunately, he only foundrnone more reason place a bullet into his own skull to suffer a sadrnfate of his own in the misery and emptiness he created. Wasrnthere really more to life then this? Sad tornsay, there wasn't a morel ending to the last chapter of the storyrnof his life. Instead, he placed the barrel to his head and fired. Oh, howrnbrightly did the birds sing upon the end of the nefarious storm. XxX \" Thisrnisn't something you wanna do,\" Nathan's voice cut through thernempty space of silence. Itrnwasn't, was it? The faintrnimage of the football field appeared from the void. A group ofrnjocks, all tall, attractive, and tremendously athletic, proceeded inrna game of football during physical education class across the field.rnRecognizably in the cluster of tackles and catches were Nathan andrnBenny. It was just a normal day for them. Bangrnbang. And thenrnsuddenly it wasn't. Darknessrnconsumed the view into blank nothingness. There, Alex lay cold,rnalone, and deprived of jubilance entirely. XxX Theyrndid it to their selves, hadn't they? Justice was due where theyrnhad harassed and picked on him. Wasn't it? The memoryrnof the day before the shooting played out like a film before him.rnBeautiful autumn sunlight poured through the window panes of thernphysics classroom discussing electricity and electrons. The leavesrnon the nearby deciduous oak trees had recently changed into theirrnNovember skin—golden leaves, dying and falling gracefully to thernground in spins. At thernobverse of the classroom, the late middle-aged teacher explained thernconcepts to his questioning and partly uninterested class. Caught uprnin this conversation, he did not notice that in the back of the roomrnAlex, the partner-less student sketching a drawling to pass the time,rnwas pelted with a grotesque, wet substance. Thernsource: Nathan and another nameless jock. They were looking for arnlaugh, an ego-boost, or perhaps even the sadistic pleasure ofrndegrading a lonely outcast. It wasn'trnuntil Alex was coated across his upper body and in his bistre-coloredrnhair with the questionable material that the teacher finallyrndismissed him shamefully to the bathroom. Actionsrnspeak louder then words, and with that Alex had turned his demurernnature into insanity. Equity would be severed. That wasrnthe twisted and ambitious promise to himself that he held close whenrnhe closed his eyes and held them shut, wanting to scream, as theyrntormented him physically until his emotional health was disrupted tornthe point that he longed for the weapon in his hands and the blood,rnthe blood, the blood, the blood. Their blood. Theirrndemise, as well as his own in the long run, would be the only end. They neverrnpicked on him ever again. XxX What wasrnthis? Out of therndarkness,a hallway appeared. Walls, lined with lockers, werernplain and repetitive. Straight ahead of him, periwinkle-coloredrnlight poured through the glass panes of the door to the exit. Thernfloors, recently waxed over summer vacation, replicated this lightrnand lockers into a distorted reflection. Thisrnhallway triggered the painful memory of the days he walked down thesernfloors to class, alone and trying to shrink and be small. Because hernwas merely obtrusive to them. That was allrnover now. Gunshots.rnLoud and shocking. They were coming. Run.rnJust run. Herninstinctively began to run, down the hallrntowards the exit, but it merely blurred before him. It never drewrncloser; it just stayed in the same place no matter how far he ran. Thernflorescent lights flicked out. Dark shadows, hiding their teeth,rnclung to the walls, ceiling, and floor. Everywhere. Lonelinessrnbreathed him in... Butrnthen it exhaled him. He was surrounded. Their silhouettes,rndark and cold and armed, were unclear but truly bold. Even thoughrntheir outline was hazy, he easily saw where their guns began andrnended. He didn't want to see it, and so he closed his eyes. The floorrnbuckled, shook, and spun. He couldn't maintain his balancernanymore, and so he fell to ground. Hard. It was difficult tornbreathe. He openedrnhis eyes for once last look, but what he saw before him was a twistedrnsmile. One that was so familiar to him. And then,rnAlex succumbed to a sad fate of his own. XxX That wasrnhow it played out for some of the ill-fated innocent students whornlost their lives to the ire of two confused, aloof kids who couldn'trncontrol their enmity. 'Maybe someone will remember us then,'rnthey subconsciously thought, secretly yearning to be known andrnthought of. But they were wrong. Nothingrnwould justify their actions. \" Thisrnisn't something you wanna do.\" Itrnwasn't, was it? \" Thisrnisn't something you wanna do.\" Itrnwasn't, was it? \" Thisrnisn't something you wanna do.\" Itrnwasn't, was it? \"Itrnwasn't.\" Alex finally said aloud to himself. His voice wasrnquiet, but audible. Uponrnspeaking these words, it suddenly hit him. He hadn't originallyrnplanned to hurt anyone, just prove a point that he wasn't going torntake their terrorizing anymore. \"..Butrnthey deserved it.\" No onerndeserves to die. A human body is a precious and rare thing to throwrnaway. For once it's gone, it is gone. Forever. Forever isrna long time. Carrie,rnMichelle, Nathan, Brittany, Nicole, Jordon, Eric... gone. Forever. Alex andrnEric were wrong. That was clearly apparent, but it lacked to sink inrntheir incoherent minds until now. Itrnwas unforgivable, it should never be forgotten, but eventuallyrneveryone will move on. And they will live on in hopes of preventingrnit from ever happening again. That's was right, that was what theyrnshould do. And itrncould have ended there with Alex left to wallow in self-regretrnforever. But, it didn't, because there was one last thing he couldrndo for a taste of the felicity he destroyed by bring firearms intornthe school. He could ask for forgiveness from the one person hernhoped would listen. XxX Anrnincandescent white light centered in the darkness and enlarged itselfrnuntil it completely enclosed the space in illumination. Anrnenormous sunflower appeared, hovering over the body of Alex. Vibrantrnbeams of immense golden sunlight shined past the steam and eachrndelicate petal of the sun-kissed plant. When the intensity of thernsun dulled, a vivid blue sky and long blades of lively greenrnryegrass, softer then he ever remembered it being in the past,rnappeared. Alexrnlifted his head and sat up. As he did, he watched as the sunflowerrnbecame smaller and smaller into normal proportions. He glancedrnaround at the field of grass and sunflowers, in search of a meaningrnfor this reverie. At firstrnhe found nothing but sunshine inhabiting the grassland. Suddenly, inrnthe distance he noticed a body between the blades of grass andrnsunflowers, napping. Alex wadedrnthrough the soft, light grass towards the figure curiously andrncarefully. He knew exactly who it was before any features wererndistinguishable. Thoughts of unspoken words sparked in his mind. Hernfinally had a chance to right one of his many, many errors with a twornword sentence of complete and utterly heartfelt noise. Suddenlyrninto view, Alex saw him. Curled up into a fetal position, Eric sleptrnsilently. \"Eric…\"rnhe whispered hesitantly at first as he edged towards him. He triedrnagain only to get no reaction, so he crouched down beside his friendrnand called his name shyly right beside his ear. Ericrntwitched. He opened his eyes slowly, only to find Alex staring downrnat him. Still barely awake, he blinked a few times and rubbed hisrneyes in such a childlike manner that Alex felt a horriblerngut-wrenching feeling in his stomach for he knew what bittersweetrnwords were ahead. \"..Alex?\"rnEric finally said. Then it registered. \"ALEX!\" Eric had beenrnthe more openly belligerent one of two eradicators, as well as thernmore outgoing one who always had something to say—whether it wasrnnoteworthy or not. But now, the usually satirical teenager foundrnhimself speechless and unable to express any anger or sadness; merelyrnshock. In thisrnterror, he scrambled to his feet and just began to run towards anrnunknown destination. Alexrnmerely watched his weaning friend as he ran into a maze of greenrnhedges with woven in vines and into the countless dead-ends that hisrnupset and incoherent mind had to offer.rnFor the first time in so long, he finally felt some form of empathyrnfor someone and it hurt him so terribly. After all this time ofrnhatred, vengeance, and blank emotions, he suddenly realized thatrnthere was nothing left to hate. Thisrnnew-found sense of care and affection burned away at his alreadyrnlong-since broken heart. Could a creature like him, so full ofrnabhorrence and vengeance, feel such an emotion? Alas, he could notrnreflect upon such a question, as the late evening sunlight wasrnengulfed by the familiar darkness. XxX Out ofrnthat peaceful world of sunflowers and unmolested purity, Alex foundrnreality to be harsher then before. He longed to be held close tornanother to generate both heat and tender intimacy. For the love herncraved to feel was and had been absent in his life. However,rnat this present time, his selfish needs needed to be put behind, forrnso much was at stake. Eric, his poor friend who he had convinced torntake part in the carnage, was now coping with a vast amount ofrnconfusion as well. And it was all Alex's fault. Alex justrncouldn't leave him like that. He was the only he right, and so hernwasn't about to give up. He couldn't rewind the hand of thernticking clock to save their lives, let lone the rest of the school,rnbut at least he could save the only human emotion the duo had felt inrnso long; love. And that was a horrible thing to destroy. XxX For onernmore taste of felicity... The fieldrnof rows and rows of sunflowers was as he left, except time had passedrnand sucked up the late evening light into the dark shades of dusk.rnThe light blue sky that he laid his azure eyes upon before had dimmedrnto a dark shade of ultramarine. Over his head, the wispy, lightrnstratus clouds had moved on across the sky out-of-sight. Even therncolors of the sunflowers and their stems and leaves had darkenedrnuntil it was nearly a silhouette right before his eyes. But now,rnmore important then anything else, he was alone. However,rnif everything truly was where he left it, then he knew exactly wherernto look. And so, Alex began to run upon impulse through thernlabyrinth of sunflowers under the weakening light. He followed alongrnthe footsteps of Eric and that guided the way. But, by thernappearance of the ruined plants he stepped upon, he could tell thatrnhis friend had made this path in frustration, and he was only tornblame for it. He keptrnrunning amidst the sun setting, the cool breeze blowing, and the timernhastily passing, completely occupied in chasing the remains of Ericrnthat he left behind in the grass. Suddenly, he thought back to therntwo had first shared a kiss, under the spray of the showerhead, nakedrnand close, their bodies practically rubbing against each other. Asrntheir last attempt to feel human love, it just seemed right at therntime, and they thought nothing of it. And that kind of kiss itrnremained, didn't it? Alexrnfinally found an exit from the sunflower field. Empty, dark, andrnsilent, he found himself at clearing where the grass was short. Hernfound his friend sitting cross-legged with his back turned on him offrnto the right. Unsure of whether Eric knew he was there or not, hernapproached him with careful steps, afraid that too much noise wouldrnstartle him into a fluster. He finallyrnstopped when he was about five feet behind him, frozen in fear, hernlost his recently composed determination and confidence. Eric'srnvoice, dull and sad, startled him at first, \"Fuck, ya know, Alex…\"rnhe said. \"... fuck...\" Alex didrnnot know how to reply to his friend's gloomy remarks, so he didn't.rn Instead, he walked over to him, and sat down beside him. He lookedrndeep into Eric's eyes as they were red and sore. He could see thatrnhe had been doing some thinking, probably haunted by the samerndisturbing images that he saw. That's when he felt it again.rnSympathy for a friend. He openedrnhis mouth to speak, to utter the words that were holding him backrnfrom the rest of the torturing afterlife they were admitted to. Butrnin this field of sunflowers, things were bright and calm, andrnalthough he gave up a chance of an enjoyable hereafter when hernordered the guns, he wouldn't mind seeing this field time afterrntime. Then thernwords came, just rolling off of tongue. And he said, \"I'mrnsorry.\" XxX A.N :rnThis was my first short story.

I was, and am still, quite content to sit on the wooden bench and have Mozart and Bach flow through my fingertips. There wasn't a single person in the world that could ever make me stop playing. So when you asked why I played, and I quote, 'that *** classical crap' I told you that I did it because I enjoyed it, and no one could ever change that. My calm little speech? It was a complete lie. If you had told me to never touch my piano again because the tinkling annoyed you, I would've. No matter how many times my parents would yell at me to keep the noise down, I wouldn't stop. Only for you. Only for you would the music stop. 2. I lied to you when I asked for details of what happened to the jock kid from school. My shocked expression and astonishment was an act as you told me how his car swerved off the road and the airbag shattered two of his ribs and left him unconscious. I knew exactly what happened. I even knew the exact chemical used to erode his brake cable. I lied when I said I didn't know until you told me. But what did he expect, after beating you up when gym class was over? 3. I lied to you when I said there were no spare blankets that winter night you spent at my house. The house was cold and you had nowhere else to go. There were three blankets in the box under my single bed, and I get the feeling that you knew that they were there. You complained for a bit, but you climbed in next to me without hesitation or even asking first. I didn't mind; that was the whole idea. It was the warmest night I'd had in a long time. 4. I lied to you when I told you that you were holding the gun in the wrong way. Your hands weren't in the wrong places and you probably would've had good control over any kick firing it could have delivered. But I needed some excuse and as I put my hands on yours and moved them out of position, you didn't recoil or shrink away. I put your hands back exactly where they were in the first place, but you didn't mind, did you? Even as you shot the gun you never stepped away. 5. I lied to you when I said I'd never been kissed before. I knew you hadn't and I didn't want things to be awkward between us. I didn't want you to think that I didn't give a damn who I kissed, because I really, really did. She had to be blonde and lean and have hard eyes. Sharp features. An ironic smirk. She had to look like you, because I had to pretend it was you I was kissing. 6. I lied to you when I told you my sister was sick and I had to go visit her in the city. She wasn't sick, but she did know a few people and I wanted to know them too. I left for two weeks, leaving you to fend off the bullies by yourself. I felt a little guilty, but when I was lying naked next to the blonde-haired sharp-eyed nineteen-year-old, I wasn't too bothered. I thought the girl looked like you, but it was much easier with him to forget that you weren't lying there with me. NOT A LIE I lied to you a lot in the time that we knew each other. About a lot of things. I wouldn't blame you if you never trusted me again. I know it's hard to believe, but I did tell you the truth some times. Like when I told you that I liked your hair blonde. Or when I said that there was always a bed for you at my place. But my favourite truth, the one that I'd never take back and hope you would never take for granted, was the time that I told you I loved you. Because I did. I still do. You were my best friend, my brother, my partner in crime. You were mine and I was yours.

The realization finally hit; he wasn't coming back andnsuddenly the loosely knotted black tie around my neck was too tight.nI reached up to loosen it, but stopped myself; it was supposed tonfeel like that.

He was the best friend that I could possibly have asked for;nhe was sensitive when most guys didn't want to be seen as weak, henwasn't afraid to be artistic, he wasn't afraid to ask me what wasnwrong – and when he did he actually cared enough to listen to mynanswer.

I recently watched the movie and I decided that it's beautifully amazing, and most certainly it deserves more than just three fanfics. This is a second person, 'you' being Alex, and focuses on his relationship with Eric to a certain extent. There is some slash here, don't like it don't read. This is a oneshot, and is slightly AU, and un-beta'd. The alternative title is Martyr. Disclaimer: I do not own Elephant or its characters, they belong to their respective owners. Words (Martyr) You have always been very good with words. You're charming, intelligent, and persistent if you have to be. You sugarcoat your voice to the point that people don't notice when you're talking about disasters about to happen. Your essays flow brilliantly, and your short stories are always very creative, but very fake. When you don't feel the need to speak, you just plaster a sincere-looking smile on your face. When your teachers confront you, you give them an innocent, childlike grin. They don't bother you anymore. When your parents yell at you for using their credit card to order things online, you look down, smile ashamedly, and offer such a sincere sorry that they're taken aback. And if all else fails, if your words don't reach people, at least they always reach yourself. You play the piano to be able to communicate, let go, say all the words you've always wanted to say. The emotions you normally bottle up inside of yourself run wild, and you feel like you're actually opening your mouth to scream and scream and scream everything that is wrong with you. And then you feel at peace. Words are yours to toy with; you don't even need words to express yourself. Eric has never been good with words. He knows little about disguising his hatred, swallowing his belligerence. He's dim and he fails almost every test his teachers throw at him. His essays are fragmented and his writing lacks grammar, punctuation, and evidence. He never finishes his stories. His anger gets the better of him before he does. Eric can never lie to people with smiles. He always seems stiff, insecure, and as if he's hiding something. Which he is. He doesn't get along with the teachers. He doesn't get along with his parents. And that's why he spends many of his nights at your house, living the life he wish he had. He's like you, actually. Very much like you. But the only difference is that he's got no means by which to free his pent-up emotions. He's much too awkward and clumsy to play an instrument, and he's got absolutely no artistic skill. Patience is not one of his virtues. So you're actually quite surprised when he walks in while you're showering. And you can see it in his eyes, his frosty blue eyes, that he's finally found his way to communicate. Speaking softly, he says he's never been kissed. You kiss him. He kisses back. His lips are soft and succulent beneath your own, and you move, press harder, become more desperate. You need this. You claim kisses from him again and again. Soon the both of you have fallen to your anger, fury, passion, and lust. You're biting onto his neck like a savage, his hands are rapidly rubbing the length of your cock. His moans mix with yours, and such a simple, one syllable sound conveys everything Eric has always failed to convey. Your wet, slick bodies are so close that they blur and are one. Afterwards, you lie awake in your bed. You know that you and Eric didn't fuck each other like animals because you two were queer, or because the both of you had been secretly in love with each other all along. You know that there is no such thing as love. It was because Eric had needed some sort of release. You needed it too. Mutually beneficial, you tell yourself. And as you fall asleep for the last time in your life, you realize that maybe, just maybe, Eric was actually quite good with words. He had just always been holding himself back. Let yourself go, Eric, you think, Just let yourself go. When you wake in the morning and come into the kitchen, Eric is already eating breakfast. Both of you are suited up and ready. Your weapons are in the duffel bag you place on the kitchen floor. You don't bother to try and talk to him, and he remains silent as well. You know things have gone beyond the two of you now. Your life, as well as Eric's, is significantly unimportant. You now could care less about your partner in crime. Because you're going to shoot and ravage and kill and kill and kill. Because you're going to put the ultimate plan into action and write your words all over the memories of the silly people who live in this town. You'll get your revenge against your classmates. Their blood will write your words on the school's walls. You WILL be remembered. You WILL. YOU WILL. You WILL be a martyr for your cause. Eric follows silently as you make your way out the door. Your breakfast lies uneaten on the kitchen table. I was five and he was six We rode on horses made of sticks He wore black and I wore white He would always win the fight Bang, Bang... How was it? The lyrics at the end aren't mine, they're from the song Shot You Down, by The Audio Bullys. Drop reviews/critiques, people. ^-^ ","Summary":" Hello world, this is my first Elephant fanfic.

Actually, when one dispensed with the modesty, he was the best. This wasn't idle bragging; it was simple fact. Nobody played the Classical greats better than Alex did. He knew it, and anyone who'd ever heard him play knew it too. The trouble was that most at his high school had either never heard him play or- more often than not- simply didn't care. They just didn't appreciate his talents, didn't respect his accomplishments. At sixteen, a junior in high school with no real plans for what was to come next, Alex played the piano better than anyone there and got nothing but grief for it. He'd get ignored some days, have spitballs tossed at him in class on others. On the worst of days he'd get slammed up against lockers or have the straps on his bookbag broken; Alex was smart, though, and had many years' of experience in waiting to get what he wanted. But he ignored them. Nearly always, he ignored all those idiots; even the ones who he might have retaliated against, he usually let go. They never changed, those morons, and trying to fight them and inevitably losing wouldn't change a thing. He didn't always; some days Alex would go to great lengths to see that someone who made his day worse had theirs get a bit shittier in turn, all of a sudden. On certain days, a popular football player's Tahoe might have a flat tire because Alex left school five minutes early, or his buddy's Mustang would inexplicably have the clamps on its muffler gone. One day Alex ditched seventh period and took the key to his house to the side of the football team captain's car. After admiring his work for a minute, Alex walked home, smiling all the way. That had been late in sophomore year, one of the best days Alex ever had in a long time. But that was the exception. Many of Alex's days in high school had been boring. Some had been bad; and nearly all of them had been lonely. One day in freshman year, Alex had been asked to write a short paper for English class. The teacher asked each of them to write a paragraph about what they thought of high school. After three years of misery in middle school, Alex was already coming to find high school was really no better, because now he could see the day coming when he could now get mocked for something new- his lack of ownership of a sufficiently 'cool' car. The definition of what was cool and uncool among high schoolers changed constantly, but Alex was pretty sure a 1976 Volvo in a perfectly bland shade of yellow would never be in the 'cool' category. He was going to school with all the same people, and soon the day would be coming when he'd never get a date at that school again. No girl was gonna be caught dead in that car his parents had left over for him. So after not even two minutes, Alex scrawled two sentences on his paper and turned it in. When the teacher read each of the responses placed on her desk, her eyebrows went up at one. That was when Alex knew she'd reached his; she could hardly seem to believe the words were there. But she read aloud, \"To me, high school is like Hell. You get up and go to Hell every day.\" The class burst into laughter; they thought it was funny. Sitting in the back, unnoticed and unknown in his mismatched and non-designer clothes, Alex sat in silent, helpless fury. They thought it was funny ! He wanted to pick up his desk and throw it at the two stupid jocks in the front row, making jokes and wondering aloud what loser had written that note. Yeah , Alex had thought, the both of you are gonna go pro. Football's gonna get you a future for sure. But he didn't care that nobody in the class took what he wrote seriously; Alex knew it was true for all of them. Alex didn't even care that the teacher recognized his handwriting, or that she had seen his glowering look and kept him after 7th hour that day, concerned and asking him why he'd written something so negative. Alex just shrugged, passing it off by saying it was no more or less than the first thing that had come to his mind. Mrs. Lewinsky told Alex to keep his chin up, stay positive; one day he would look back at these four years as some of the best days of his life. Yeah , Alex thought as he left the classroom that day, and on that same day pigs will join the 82 nd Airborne. But that day had actually ended up being just what Mrs. Lewinsky promised about high school itself; that day in September 1999 had turned out to be one of the best days of Alex's life. Waiting for him outside of class was a skinny blonde kid; lean and clearly, what substance he had was mostly muscle- much like Alex. He had crisp blue eyes, a fairly handsome face, and short-cut blonde hair. It had an odd, choppy look to it, though, like he often had to do it himself with a pair of scissors and wasn't very good at it besides. He had even shabbier clothes than Alex did, which immediately made Alex wonder how uncool a car he'd end up driving once License Day came. Or if he'd drive anything at all. Alex had stared the kid down for a moment; leaning up against one of the many lockers in the hallway and affecting a casual attitude, he seemed to have been trying to make it look like he hadn't just been there waiting for Alex to come out of the classroom. But Alex wasn't stupid; he was very smart by anyone's account- even the morons who loved pummeling him in the locker room in PE knew Alex was smarter than they were. This kid's lightbulb didn't seem as bright as Alex's… but at the same time, he was no dumbass football player. And he was waiting for a guy he otherwise didn't know in English class; briefly Alex wondered if this kid, too, had figured out who'd written that unusual note today. Keeping his voice even, Alex asked warily, \"You need something, man?\" \"Dog,\" the kid said, and right away Alex knew it was one of the blonde's favourite words. He probably called everybody 'dog,' aside from the ones he addressed as 'man'. \"Dog,\" the kid said again, confirming Alex's first thought. He clearly liked just saying the word. And taking his time. Just as Alex was starting to get annoyed, the blonde continued to say, \"I know you wrote that funny paper in English today.\" Now Alex did get irritated, but made a point of not showing it. He had excellent control over his emotions- most of the time. Even better, though, was Alex's ability to control what showed on his face. So he kept his face plain, and just said, \"Oh, yeah? You thought it was funny, too?\" The blonde shook his head. \"No. But the jocks did.\" Alex snorted. \"They find a lot of things funny. It's like monkeys and bananas.\" \"Or monkeys and shit.\" There Alex had paused; he looked at the blonde curiously, still leaning up against the locker looking perfectly chilled out. This kid seemed… different. Alex prided himself as being an outstanding judge of character, and his first impression of someone nearly always held true with what he ended up thinking once he knew them. How hadn't he noticed this kid before? He recalled they'd gone to the same middle school; they'd shared few classes, and somehow or another simply just never found reason to meet. But they'd never had a problem with one another, and if nothing else were two average students at an overrated suburban middle school, just trying to get by and hoping to be left alone. Alex suddenly had a feeling that the blonde, too, had mostly failed to get his wish in those days. So Alex had let curiosity get the best of him then. He'd just asked what the kid had wanted, and he just shrugged again. \"I just wanna talk. You busy?\" Alex shook his head; it was the truth. \"Not really.\" Mrs. Lewinsky chose that moment to exit the classroom, though, and as she locked it up for the day gave them an odd look. Students did not usually hang around in the hallway like this after school- most were in a big hurry to get home and do something they actually wanted to do. And something else made her eyebrows go up a little more, once she noticed- she'd thought these two didn't know each other, and already she could tell Alex wasn't the type who easily made friends. Yet here he was in the hallway with a boy he simply shared a class or two with, talking like he had nothing better to do. As Mrs. Lewinsky headed off, Alex started to leave as well. The blonde fell into step with him, and for some reason Alex hadn't objected. He pushed open one of the double doors at the end of the hall and started the walk home; the buses had already left, and Alex rarely rode them anyway. He was rid of the idiots he hated sooner if he took the extra time and walked. The blonde stuck with him for only a short time, asking questions like \"Dog, why'd you write that?\" and \"I thought it was cool, man. How'd you think of it?\" Finally, Alex just shrugged. \"I hate high school.\" The blonde had stared down at the ground then, looking a little sad. He seemed to be thinking about more than just high school when he said, \"Yeah. Me, too.\" Alex had stopped walking then; he did it so suddenly the blonde boy didn't even expect it, and walked on for a moment before noticing. Alex then walked up towards him, holding out a hand and smiling a little. \"Alex,\" he said simply. The blonde had taken the hand offered, shaking it and smiling a bit in return. \"Eric.\" It was almost as if an agreement had been reached that day; Eric had been forced to admit soon after that he lived in the opposite direction, and had headed for home. But they'd sat beside each other in English class every day after that one freshman year. And the agreement they reached when shaking hands had been simple- they'd been good friends ever since. That had been two years ago now; it was August 2001, and Alex was at home playing the old piano in his room in the basement. Eric was sprawled out on his bed, wearing a t-shirt with the arms cut off that was a little too big for him, almost looking like a pillow case, and faded blue jeans. His worn, frayed sneakers were carelessly tossed off to one side of the room- Eric hated how poor he was, and Alex had quickly learned the best thing you could do was not mention it. Eric would fast become angry if mocked for his family's lack of money, was fiercely protective of his mother despite her constantly lousy choices of boyfriends, and overall had one of the most peculiar senses of pride Alex had ever seen. Many times through freshman and sophomore year they had sat together at lunch, and more than once Alex had offered Eric a share of what he'd brought, or offer some money he didn't need so Eric could buy some of the school's overpriced Burger Town stuff. But every time Alex offered, Eric not only refused, but became very flustered and embarrassed if Alex persisted. Alex could tell easily his friend had no actual reason for saying no- he just didn't want to admit it. He'd make up every excuse in the book, and once became angry enough that Alex was startled at how much these things meant to the blonde with the choppy-cut short hair. Whatever else could be said about him, Eric had his pride. Maybe that was why it meant so much to him; at the end of the day, pride might have been about all Eric had. What Alex took to doing as a compromise, on some days when he could tell Eric was really hurting- hiding the fact that he simply had nothing to eat- was 'forgetting' a $5 bill or something like that, slipping it out of his pocket then getting up to throw out his trash. He'd make some excuse, heading off for class early or whatever, then leave. The first time he'd done that, leaving a note with Lincoln's face on the front right where he'd been sitting next to Eric, he glanced back when he knew Eric could no longer easily see him. Eric had been staring down at the money, his face a special tinge of pink. He looked furious and grateful, all at the same time. When Alex had returned from the bathroom, though, and glanced back across the cafeteria, he'd noticed Eric sitting back where they'd been, glowering at some jocks while he resolutely chomped away at a cheeseburger. Alex had smiled, and gone on to class. That had been the way he'd handled it ever since. Eric had never said a thing about any of it to Alex after that, and the dark-haired teen knew better than to ask. But that had been a ways into their freshman year, and Alex knew Eric appreciated it in his own way. Over the next few years, Alex and Eric had steadily become good, and then best friends. Eric, Alex suspected, was even coming to worship him- he began picking up mannerisms Alex had, like saying \"shitter\" or \"shitters\" about people he really hated, and saying he didn't give a \"tin shit\" when he most definitely did not care. Eric was acting as if he'd never had someone treat him this good in his life, and hero-worship was the only way he knew how to return it. Alex had been very moved when he considered, one day, there was a very real chance that was true. And it wasn't as if being friends with Eric didn't have pluses for Alex; he realised Eric was nothing if not a good listener; he loved hearing Alex's angry rants about the things wrong with society and with the world. He could always offer Alex an opinion about something, many times surprising Alex by pointing out things he hadn't considered before. Many people at the high school Alex attended did not appreciate Alex's great artistic and musical talents. He was a writer, a poet, a thinker, a boy who could craft pieces in ceramics class that would stun even the teacher. But he was an inept basketball player, a lousy baseball player, and absolutely hopeless at football. He did not care what a touchdown was, and all the bigshots at his school knew it. Most guys- and girls- at Alex's school could have cared less how well Alex played the piano. Eric was an exception. Today Alex was working his way through Beethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata\", his favourite piece from the great Beethoven besides \"Für Elise\". Alex loved playing Beethoven; it made him feel at peace with himself and the world, no matter how bad things were. But Alex had a fierce temper, one he'd had to spend years gradually learning to control as he grew up. It could flare at times even now, and on rare occasions suddenly explode. So far, so good; Alex's hands and fingers moved across the keys with practiced ease, knowing already where to go and when to go there. The music flowed, and even with the piano out-of-tune and old it would leave Eric entranced for about as long as his friend played. Eric could barely play even one note and not mess it up, but he loved watching Alex play. \"You look so peaceful, dog,\" he said once, when Alex asked why he liked watching so much. \"And you're really, really good.\" Alex had smiled at that. Praise wasn't a bad thing when there was damn good reason for it. But today wasn't Alex's day, not even with something he normally had mastered any day of the week. His fingers missed a key, then hit the wrong one and messed up a note entirely. Then he forgot he was even playing the \"Moonlight Sonata\" for a second and started trying to segue into Mozart's \"5th Symphony\" at the same time. Alex swore violently, trying to get back on track, but he'd lost it. The whole piece was bolloxed up, and there wasn't any bringing it back. Fury surged into Alex, and he balled his hands into fists, slamming them down on the keys. \"Shit,\" Alex yelled, his voice rising in fury. \"Shit. Fuck! GOD- DAMNIT !\" Eric sat up on Alex's bed, his eyes wide and his expression concerned. \"Dude,\" he asked, \"what's wrong?\" \"I screwed up the fucking Moonlight Sonata,\" Alex shouted, completely pissed off now. \"That's fucking what !\" It was a good thing Alex's parents were both staying late at work today. On the rare occasion Alex got mad like this, he tended to yell at a level that could easily be heard through the whole house. Eric started to say something else, but Alex abruptly started picking up books from his shelf beside the piano, hurling them across the room. \"Fuck!\" he yelled, getting angrier all the time. \"Fuck, fuck, fuck !\" \"Dude,\" Eric said, \"watch out for your fucking computer!\" \" Fuckit !\" Alex threw a dictionary. It hit the wall with a thunk. Suddenly he stopped, looking at Eric sitting up on the bed. A magazine from the gun store \"Ammunation\" lay open beside him; Alex got regular issues of those, and clearly Eric had been reading it. \"What were you reading?\" Alex asked, his breathing slowing a little as he became curious. He already knew what Eric had been reading; what Alex wanted to know was why. Eric looked at Alex cautiously, as if worried the sudden tirade of fury would come back if he moved too quickly. But Alex just stood there waiting for an answer, so after a moment Eric must have decided it was safe. \"Dog,\" Eric said, \"I was looking at this.\" He held up the magazine- Ammunation had an article saying that in the next year or so, they'd be doing clearances on TEC-9 submachine guns. There was another one, talking about the role Ammunation had played in securing a large number of AR-15s for the civilian market. \"Dog,\" Alex said with a hint of sarcasm, \"you thinking about shooting some dogs ?\" Eric smiled a little, but shook his head. \"Naw, dog,\" he said. \"It's more fun to shoot people.\"[Chapter 2] Chapter II- One Good Idea Alex paused, looking at the blonde curiously. \"What's that about shooting people?\" Eric just smiled that sly smile again; it was like he'd already been thinking about this, and was enjoying the fact that he knew something Alex didn't. But just what had Eric been thinking about? Finally, when it looked like Eric wasn't going to say anything more just yet, Alex sighed irritably and walked across the room, sitting down at the office-surplus chair and starting it up. Alex was playing what was easily his favourite PC game- Renegade Massacre- and was taking on about fifty of Hell's demons at once when Eric came up behind him, leaning on the back of the chair. It creaked slightly, tilting back just a little as Eric added some weight. \"Hey,\" Eric said suddenly, \"that place looks kinda like our high school.\" Alex laughed; as it happened, the joke meant more than the whole 'High School Is Hell' thing. The level Alex was on, with its long, squared-off corridors and gray, boring architecture that always looked exactly alike, almost did bear a passing resemblance to Alex and Eric's high school. Eric continued, in that semi-distant voice he seemed to use any time he was really thinking about something, \"Could you just fuckin' imagine, man… if those fuckers were jocks instead of those demon-things?\" Alex snorted. \"They look better than the jocks, if you ask me.\" Eric laughed, but said again, \"Just think about it, man. Taking that big fuckin' gun your guy's got, and just blowin' 'em the fuck away…\" Something in the blonde's voice made Alex turn around; he only just remembered to pause the game first. Eric's eyes were still focused on the computer screen, and he had a distant look in his eyes, a dreamy look on his face. Alex found himself truly and profoundly impressed with Eric for the first time; Eric was seriously wishing he could do it. Alex considered this; he'd actually had ideas of his own about this before. Nothing real serious, no specific plans of murder and revenge. Just… ideas. Well, and his hand-drawn maps of his middle school- maps he still kept hidden and treasured- that detailed his studies of just where to plant explosives at the school's key structural points. Blow them all at once, and a successful, complete detonation would have brought that fucker down. Alex had for so long wished he could actually do that; his hateful fantasies got him through many awful days. But he'd ended up shelving those plans; they called for too much. He'd need more than most any middle school student could hope to get in arms and equipment, he'd need a car- and he'd need help. At least one other person would be needed to quickly assemble and move the bombs on the morning of the attack- someone Alex could trust with anything. He hadn't had that kind of help in middle school. But… was there a chance things were different now, three years later? \"You hear about those two guys, shot up that mall in '95?\" Alex asked, and he was hardly surprised when Eric nodded. It made sense, somehow, that both of them had heard about it on the news- it just figured they'd both have found it intriguing in just the same way. The dark-haired teen paused for a moment, hesitant. Should he go on? He'd known Eric for about two years now, and considered him as good a friend as he had anywhere at his high school. But was Eric a good enough friend to trust with this? Say something , a voice in Alex's head told him. Just say something, and see how he reacts . Finally, Alex did so. \"Well,\" he began, \"in middle school I got to thinking about that some more. Wishing Cameron and Neal could have fucked up Jerry T. Rush Middle School instead of that mall.\" Eric just waited patiently. After a moment, Alex went on, \"So I wrote these maps up. How many people were in the cafeteria at lunch, the bell schedule, how many home-made bombs you'd need to drop the roof of the school on everybody…\" Alex smiled a bit at the memory; he suspected the smile wasn't a very kind one. Finally, Alex just shrugged. \"Shit like that. I hated that place; thinking about killing everybody there, about blowing it straight to hell, helped me get through some shitty days.\" Eric, still leaning on the chair with Alex looking up at him, was mesmerized. His eyes lit up, and it was clear he liked what he was hearing. In fact, he seemed so stunned at Alex's bold ideas that he had been struck dumb. Eric just couldn't think of what to say. Emboldened, Alex went on rather disappointedly, \"But there's no way I coulda done it. Can't get military-grade explosives unless you're, like, in Special Forces or some shit. And big home-made bombs, like propane tanks, you'd need a car for. Plus you'd want guns, and that's a whole other bunch of problems.\" Alex just shook his head, bitterly disappointed just thinking about it. But when he looked up, Eric was looking at him oddly. He seemed to have a lightbulb on in his head; Eric's face was brightening with every moment. He'd definitely just heard some things he wanted very much to hear. \"Dude,\" Eric said quietly and carefully, as if worried speaking too fast would be dangerous right now, \"Why don't you do it?\" Alex shrugged again. \"I told you, man. It wouldn't have worked, not back then. I mean, I dunno about now-\" Eric suddenly nodded eagerly. \"Yeah, dude,\" he said. \"Why not do something like that… now?\" Alex stared back uncertainly, not sure of what he was hearing, or just what Eric was getting at. \"I'd need help.\" \"You've got help,\" Eric said immediately, and Alex nodded slowly after a moment. He's serious. Trying again, not yet willing to believe all this was real, Alex said, \"Well, we'd need money-\" \"I'll break into some stores,\" Eric said, and Alex laughed. The idea was kind of exciting, and Eric almost seemed like he had the right kind of cunning to be a good burglar. Then Alex suddenly remembered something from freshman year; Eric had mentioned, almost as a joke more than anything, that he didn't want to go back to juvy just yet. Alex now remembered that, not so long ago, Eric had been a burglar. And maybe a reasonably good one. Finally, Alex shook his head. \"Not necessary, man. I got an uncle's rich as fuck. He's always trying to give me shit, and if I told him I wanted some money, he'd probably give it to me. I can always make up good reasons for shit like that.\" Eric nodded, smiling hopefully. \"So how about it?\" Alex stared back curiously, for once on the other side of the table- this time, he was the one that was a bit slow on the uptake. \"How about what ?\" Eric just grinned. \"How about we do that plan of yours?\" The dark-haired teen laughed a bit, but the excitement in him was building. Eric was serious; he wanted to help him make this real. And on the heels of that, a crazy thought occurred to Alex: We just might be able to do it. Alex stood up, walking back towards his bed and flopping down on it. Eric joined him after a moment, picking up the Ammunation magazine again. Alex pointed at the AR-15. Starting to become serious but maintaining a light tone as best he could- perhaps to hide just how thrilled Eric's suggestion made him- Alex said, \"You could kill 30 people in less than a minute with that. You know how to use one of those?\" Eric suddenly got a funny look on his face and grabbed his crotch. \"You know how to use one of those ?\" Alex just shook his head, laughing in spite of himself. Eric was so juvenile sometimes… but he deserved to have his offer answered. Alex could tell this sort of thing didn't come your way often- in most people's lives, such an opportunity never even appeared so much as once. Continuing the what-if talk, Alex gestured again at the magazine. \"Well,\" he said, \"what would you want? Which one would you wanna gun down the football team with?\" Eric laughed, his face brightening at the idea. In a way, Alex liked seeing Eric's face light up like that; he understood enough of the hardships Eric endured at home to see that there was a reason Eric found every excuse possible to be out of his own house. It made Alex feel good, in a way he hadn't really expected, to see Eric's day made a little brighter by something he, Alex, said or did. After only a moment, Eric pointed to the picture of the TEC-9 sub-machine gun. \"That one,\" he said, tapping the page. \"I'd take 'em all on with that.\" Alex leaned over to look, and resisted the urge to shake his head in dismay. Eric was a bit of an amateur with guns; he thought the TEC-9's popularity with gangs and rappers made it worth something as a weapon. In truth, Alex understood it was popular mostly because it was flashy, loud and cheap. That made a great weapon for movies or gang shootouts, but there was a reason few soldiers carried it in first-world countries. But Alex glanced up at his friend, and was somewhat surprised to see Eric looking at him. The blonde was trying to hide it, but there was a hopeful, expectant look visible on his face. He's waiting to see what I say , Alex realised after a moment. He's hoping to hear my approval . Alex mentally shrugged after a moment; if that was his friend's choice, then so be it. And besides- there were certainly worse guns. There were even SMG's that jammed more than the TEC-9, and a good, well-cleaned example might just be good enough for shooting up a suburban high school. Little sand or mud to be found there, certainly. So Alex smiled, even though his bullshit meter went up just a little. \"Well,\" he said, his grin widening as his mind already began envisioning the attack, the plans behind it and all the dollars and dates that would have to be met to make it happen, \"Tell you what. We got about a year to work on this. I think I might be able to use one of my dad's credit cards to get some shit online. That, and talk to my Uncle Charlie.\" Alex paused for a moment, then turned to look directly at Eric. \"When we get to the point where we're picking out our guns, I'll get my AR and you'll get the TEC-9. But you gotta help me put together the propane bombs and get blueprints of the school. How about that?\" Eric grinned, and stuck out his hand. \"Dog, I'm shaking on that.\" Alex grinned back; he was still reluctant to admit it, but he'd hardly ever been so thrilled in all his life. \"It's a deal,\" Alex said with his most winning smile, and they shook hands. The two talked and talked about everything and nothing for the rest of the afternoon; they played Renegade Massacre, taking turns at it and naming the ugliest demons and bosses after their favourite jocks at school. When the sun finally started to go down and Eric had to start for home, Alex shook hands with him again, telling Eric he'd always have a place to stay if his own home wasn't enough. Eric smiled shyly, turning a little pink and saying, \"Thanks.\" Alex smiled a bit as he sat at his desk after Alex had gone, starting to draw up the plans his mind was already working overtime on creating. Timetables, budget proposals, dates and times for the assault itself and how the explosives- they'd already decided on heavy propane tanks, as big as your typical grocery store sold- were to fit into it. Alex worked on that stuff until the minute his parents came home, then hid them inside his Biology textbook and headed up to dinner without a hitch. He passed his good mood off as simply having had a good day at school; that was a lie, since he'd had a terrible one. But it was truth in its own way, too- Alex had ended up having a good day today. A very good one. Two days later, Alex got called up to the principal's office, having to leave 4th Hour- PE class- early to do so. While Mr. Luce grilled Alex about his steadily rising number of tardies and skipped classes, and how important proper attendance was for learning responsibility, Alex began to fidget. He was growing increasingly nervous; Mr. Luce pressed on, encouraged by the sight and sense of Alex's unease, sure it meant he'd found a boy with a guilty conscience and needed to pressure him on it for his own good. But it had nothing to do with that- nothing at all. PE class was the part of the day where the jocks ran the show, and more than a few dominated the 4th hour session Alex and Eric were in. They typically took the mockery of their skinny bodies together, as brothers endured the laughter and occasional pushing or shoving. But now Eric was all by himself in that locker room- and unlike Alex he'd never really learned how to pick his battles. He always tried to fight back. Alex almost bolted out of the office when Mr. Luce finally let him go, hoping he'd get there in time. But the locker room was empty; class had ended ten minutes ago, and even Eric was already gone. Suddenly furious, Alex lashed out and kicked a locker, the metallic bang resounding throughout the tiled, empty room. Then he walked out without saying a word. Eric showed up late for lunch that day, limping and obviously in some degree of pain. When Alex refused to stop asking questions about it, his concern overriding his normal respect for Eric's sense of pride, Eric finally all but admitted that Sean Parsons had pulled him back in the locker room after class and given Eric the beating of his life. Nothing so bad as to send him to the hospital, but plenty more than enough to make Sean feel good about pummeling a scrawny dork- and give Eric many, many bruises to think about tomorrow. Of course, Eric didn't actually say it was Sean Parsons- even there he grew evasive, trying to excuse himself by saying he didn't really know who it was. But Alex knew. He knew that Eric, just like him, had the name of every asshole jock in their high school memorized, the car every stuck-up prep drove known by its make, model, and license plate number. Eric and Alex both had a lot of experience in memorizing the names and faces of their tormentors and enemies. So while Eric didn't name any names- perhaps afraid the individual would come after him if he told- Alex guessed easily enough. Sean Parsons was football team second, and he was also one of Mr. Luce's favourites. Alex didn't even bother asking why Eric didn't tell anybody in the principal's office; they'd both been through that drill before. Eric wasn't gonna tell anybody because he knew they wouldn't do anything. But Alex had other ideas. The next day, a certain brand-new Mitsubishi Montero ran off the road during the morning drive to school, slamming into a tree and crashing. The teenager driving it was often careless, and had as usual forgotten to put on his seat belt-the impact broke two of his ribs. Police were very curious as to the accelerated case of erosion that had caused the central brake cable to snap, rendering the Montero's brakes useless. But no one was looking for sabotage, though they came close. When the Parson elders blamed Mitsubishi, discussions were held with family lawyers and that was the end of it. Nobody even tested the broken cable to see if it had acid residue on it; Alex knew it would have. He had to act very surprised when Eric told him of how he saw it, riding the bus to school that morning. He was shocked, amazed; he pressed for details and wanted to know more. Eric was just as eager to tell him; both boys had to be careful to hide it, but this chance injury to one of their least-favourite fellow students was a good piece of news, indeed. Eric bought Alex's surprised act easily; Alex had so much practice at it, Eric never once doubted that this was the first his friend had heard. But Alex had to lie; he had to. It would have been overwhelming for Eric to know Alex had snuck out of his house at 4 in the morning, got under Sean's Montero with gloves and a small bottle of a specific kind of acid, and coated the brake cable with it by 5. He was down the street and gone at 5:15, and back in his bed not even twenty minutes later. He'd dressed just right for the occasion- anyone who saw him dismissed Alex almost immediately. So what? He was just some kid out on a morning run. Something else Alex had to hide though, even beneath the fake shock and surprise, was real disappointment. Alex hadn't just been trying to hurt that asshole jock. He'd been trying to kill him. A special kind of fury had flared into life in Alex that day; when he'd gotten Eric home, ordered him to take his shirt off and seen the bruises already forming, Alex had nearly punched a hole in the wall of his room. He'd been more than pissed, far worse than furious. Alex had never even imagined a single person could feel that much hate at once- and survive. But that Friday at lunch, with Eric's bruises slowly starting to fade and Sean Parson's accident behind them, Alex made Eric an offer. Well, not so much an offer as a promise. He promised Eric that he would always be watching after this. He'd always be there, close up or at a distance, and he'd always protect Alex from jerk-off's like Sean. It was just what Eric deserved. Eric had smiled shyly, immensely grateful but not sure how to say it. He didn't say no, though, so Alex had just smiled and nodded. \"It's a deal,\" he said. Those words, more than anything else, had on two occasions that week in junior year sealed the friendship between them. \"It's a deal.\" ","Summary":" Chapter I- After School Alex was one of the best piano players at his high school.

Now he just sounded tired. Randall pulled into Dante's driveway and shifted into park. \"I'll walk home, I don't really want to deal with bringing it back to you in the morning,\" Randall sighed, cutting the engine. \"Just sleep here,\" Dante muttered before climbing out of the car. The flow of blood from his nose had stopped. \"What, with you in your bed full of crumbs?\" Randall quipped, locking the car doors. \"I was thinking you could take the couch, but if you need someone to sleep with since you're not at your mom's house then I guess my door's open,\" Dante joked as best as he could. He was exhausted as he led Randall into the house. Randall hung back while Dante kept going in the direction of his bedroom. Dante tiredly changed out of his blood spotted clothes, trading his sweater for an old t shirt, and he didn't bother putting pajama pants on. He crawled into his bed and under the blankets. He was almost asleep when the bed dipped rapidly and creaked, and there was a solid weight next to him. \"What the hell are you doing?\" Dante groaned. \"You said your door's open.

Dante (offended): Why do you bother asking me, if you already have a pre-determined and expected response? Randall(amused): Because, I like to listen to your input into the sell-out land of cheap sakes, remakes, sequels and homosexuals that is Hollywood. Dante(defensively): Regardless of your opinion, the public has now all agreed that James Cameron is the best director in cinematic history,(snotty-toned)if I am up to date with my film-related media. Randall: Are you fucking crazy? Half of the general public slammed Cameron. Dante: What? Randall: Avatar was nothing more than a recycled, shit-dry plot covered up by what I say to only be impressive effects and violence. Dante (baffled): Avatar was genius. The effects were superb to T2 itself, the story was intriguing, the characters were as real as I can possibly fathom, and the 3-D was used to a proper and immersively amazing effect. Randall: Cameron is not the best filmmaker. He didn't even win the fucking best-directing Oscar like everyone fucking thought he would, his fucking ex-wife took it. I think that says something. Dante: Did Ben Stiller dress up like an army soldier? No. He wore a Na'vi costume to the awards. Randall: Ya, and looked like a faggot doing it.

But, Elias really could not hold himself back. \"Randal, seriously are you alright?\" Elias waited to be yelled at, or even hit. \"Want me to give you a long story short, Elias?\" Elias nodded, Randal turned and looked at him. \"I think I fucking love you.\" ","Summary":" \"Do you ever think about the fact that your life can make a huge turn, and you don't know if it's "},{"Movie":"Clerks","Title":"Unexpected","Author":"moltar2006","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12285699","Passage":"[Chapter 1] It was unexpected.

One proposed the idea of theft, and the unidentified mind-altering substance that corrupted them made the otherwise idiotic idea seem entertaining. It also made them clumsy, and as the pair ran away from the blaring alarms, they held nothing of value but a red gem. Through some twist of fate, the young men escaped without the regular consequences in the legal department. The Next Morning Nathaniel James woke up with a splitting headache. \"Owww\" he groaned, \"what the hell did we do last night?\" \"I don't know, man, but I think drugs were involved\" his partner in crime, Mitchell Zizzio, responded. Nathaniel groggily got out of bed, noticing something hard in his back pocket. As one would expect, he reached in and pulled out a red gem. \"What the hell? How did this get here?\" \"What is it?\" Mitchell asked, walking over. \"I don't know, probably a jewel of some sort. Let's see it in the light\" He placed the jewel on a table near the window, which was almost always open, putting it in direct sunlight, where it proceeded to shine brighter than it should have. This illumination caused the boys to step back in fear, an action that they soon found to be a life-saving one, for the object exploded quickly after. Mitchell and Nathaniel stared in awe, not at the explosion, but at the creature it had left behind. It looked similar to a human in build, but with gray-green-yellow skin, which was highly wrinkled, no hair, and two curling appendages descending from its head to just below its shoulders, which could be observed as either horns or tentacles, depending on the viewers angle. Nathaniel asked what was probably the most obvious question to ask in the situation. \"W-What are you?\" \"A Djinn, young boy. What do you wish for, for it is my command,\" the thing, which was apparently a Djinn, answered. Mitchell wasn't sure where, but he was pretty sure he had heard that 'Djinn' was another word for genie. This information was enough basis for him to unleash his inner greed. \"I wish for gold.\" The Djinn smiled. \"Very well.\" I'll kill one for his soul, but these idiots should suffice. I'll save the other for my army. With that thought, he sent out the magic within him, without directly controlling it, to take gold, with the condition that it would be from someone who misses it, and would kill to have it back. He wasn't really concerned whom. At least, not at that point. Later, he would very much regret granting the wish in the manner he did.[Chapter 2] Author's note: The city will be left generic to avoid geographic inconsistencies . Ch. 2 Somewhere in a home that was bored into a tree a Leprechaun woke up, noticing that something was missing. \"WHERE'S ME GOLD!\" The Irish creature grumbled, getting up. \"Whoever stole me gold, will soon be naught more than mold.\" He closed his eyes, feeling his gold calling to him. While he couldn't place an exact location, he could find a general one. In this case, it happened to be in the southern part of an American city. \"A man in that city is going to find tomorrow quite shitty.\" While anger was the thing that clouded his mind to its largest extent, a little confusion made its way through. How did whatever worthless lout did this get from here to there so fast? Distance was irrelevant to him, since he could simply teleport there, but he wasn't aware of any humans able to perform such a feat. Could it be another of me kind? Thievery between Leprechauns wasn't unheard of. In fact, in the olden days it was a way of showing supremacy. But the last time this had ever occurred was at least 200 years ago (he couldn't remember the exact date), and Leprechaun, as he unimaginatively called himself, wasn't even sure if any of the others were still around. Of course, there may be more than just Leprechauns and humans. After all, he was a leprechaun, how ridiculous would it be for a fairy or mermaid or genie or something to exist? Sittin' here en' thinking about it won't solve the puzzle. Nay, me must go to the city. With that, he vanished, popping up inside of some sort of Oriental restaurant. He expected screaming at his sudden appearance, which came. \"Demon! Demon! You go away! You go away!\" an old woman screamed, while sprinkling some sort of liquid on him. The other workers, normally more scientifically minded than the screaming elder, ran away from the tricky blighter, dropping pots, pans, and hot soup everywhere as they did. \"What is going on!\" the manager yelled, running into the kitchen. While he was shocked to see the oddly-dressed short man standing in the middle, he did not fear him the way the others did. \"Get back here, you idiots! This weirdo won't stop you! And I would rather take a knife to the stomach than stop now!\" \"Okay, me laddy. Ye wished for a knife through the stomach, and what kind of person would me be to deny such a wish,\" a strong Irish accent proclaimed. The reader can assume what happened next. The rest of the staff had left, for obvious reasons, excluding the old woman, who was now shrieking in her native language. \"Wass that, lassy? I don understand ye.\" Leprechaun laughed, simultaneously teleporting in front of her, forcing the small idol she held for protection out of her hand, and bashing her head in with it. I luvvit when they rely on those things. Though it does take out the fun of the chase. He left. Although the decorations were colored like gold, his gold was nowhere in the restaurant. The tables were empty. Apparently, the place had been evacuated. This would have been fine, except for the police cars that had pulled up. Great, I really don't need this. Rather than face them, he teleported to where they couldn't see him, with the intention of continuing his search. The filthy lad or lass will never see me comin'. He grinned. Whoever's helpin' 'im will suffer as well. He didn't fully realize the enemy he was to face at this point.[Chapter 3] Ch. 3 Mitchell eyed the sack greedily, wondering whether or not his roommate would notice the absence of the gold when he returned. Of course he would, you idiot. He's not blind. He sighed. They had agreed to vote upon how to use the money later, as well as the remaining wishes. Speaking of wishes, he hadn't seen the Djinn, or whatever he called himself, for quite some time. The thing had asked for time to perform some other duties while they decided their second wish. Mitchell wondered where he was, and what duties genies had to perform. Shrugging the thought off, he turned the TV on. The news came on, showing some story about murders in an Asian restaurant. Mitchell, unconcerned, went to sleep as the story played. The Wishmaster, as the Djinn had come to be known, no longer appeared as one of his race. Taking on the body of some dead man he was certain no one would recognize, the monster stalked the streets, looking for victims. A fourteen-year old boy walked a bike, alone, on the opposite side of the road. \"Hello, there, my child, what would you like?\" The boy, observing the man who just walked across the street, was confused. \"W-What do you m-mean, sir?\" \"You see, I possess, let's say, some special abilities. I can grant you a wish, and you don't have to give me anything in return.\" The boy didn't believe him, but decided to give it a try. Noting how tired he was from walking with the broken device, a wish appeared in his mind. \"I wish my bike had new wheels\" (for it was the wheels that the damage appeared in). After a crackling of energy, the boy stared in awe as the rusty, shattered spokes were replaced with shiny, fully repaired ones. \"Thank you, mister. How can I repay you?\" The man smiled, in a way that most would have interpreted as sinister. \"You will repay me in good time. Don't worry, it won't cost a penny.\" The boy rode away, happily, until the spokes found themselves magnetically attracted to a sewer line. This travesty was somehow avoided by the rider, and, glad to have escaped death, wasn't paying to the car that flew down the road he had just touched. The Wishmaster watched this, at first with no emotion, but then with a tinge of joy. He could feel the power from the kid's soul fill him, making him stronger. The feeling passed, and the monster moved on to find another victim. In a different part of the city, a smaller monster was working his magic on a larger victim. The man in question was noticeably obese, probably due to his habit of watching television and playing video games all day. He was particularly interested in Dwarves for some reason. \"So, ye claim to know nothing of me gold, eh laddy?\" as the little man, if it could be called that, in green. \"No, I don't know anything about any gold! Why are you doing this to me?\" \"Honestly, lad, me dun' know where in Ifreann me gold is, or who has it. Ye just 'appened to be 'ere, so I decided to punish ye for it. Me 'ear ye take a fancy t'wards dwarves, is me right?\" \"Well, yeah, but I don't know what that has to do with anything.\" The Leprechaun pointed at him. The man shrieked as his bones started folding in on themselves, painfully decreasing his height. Hairs sprouted from his chin, not simply growing like normal hairs, but bursting out of his skin, followed by a trickle of blood. His pain, while lived much longer than any man could want, didn't last too terribly long, for he died after several minutes. At this point, he looked like a distorted version of the stereotypical fantasy dwarf. \"Eh, 'e probably din't know anythin' anyways.\" Soon after the little demon finished his statement, a door opened. It was the murder victim's roommate. His description is lost to the writer of this story, as are his hobbies. In another room, this person accessed a computer, completely oblivious to the events that had just occurred in that very building. Leprechaun snuck to the doorway, observing the intruder's (at least as he saw it) actions. All he could discover was that this person used the screen-name Rurrlock-God of Power. \"Me dun' s'pose ye know where to find me gold, do ye?\" \"What?\" he asked, startled. \"Me gold 'as been taken from me, and if ye can't tell me where it is, eh'll 'ave to kill ya.\" Scared, 'Rurrlock' racked his brain for any knowledge of gold. After a while, it hit him. \"Mitchell and Nathan had some.\" \"Mitchell en' Natan? Who be these louts?\" \"They live at the college, room…um..243..I think, yeah, that's it!\" \"Thank ye. For bein' the only one to show interest in me story, eh'll spare ye.\" With that, the green-clothed man left, leaving the self-proclaimed God of Power speechless. Wishmaster chuckled as the shopkeeper crushed the bee under her finger. He wished that he could fly, and I let him fly. A feeling of foreboding came over him. He sensed that the college idiots who freed him were in trouble. It seems that the gold's owner has come for it. I should make sure they only kill one of the kids. I don't need one, as I could always find someone else, but that could be quite annoying. Upon returning to the campus, he soon found something else that would be quite annoying.[Chapter 4] Ch. 4 Leprechaun stared at the door. Room 243, where two guys kept their stolen gold. The Leprechaun was certain that the gold in that room was his. He could sense it, practically hearing it call to him. The thievin' loughts will pay their due. Now, to figure out 'ow to go about it. Should I simply pop in, slice them to wee bits, get me gold, and go home, or should I make 'em suffer? I should get 'em to tell me 'ow they went about takin' it, for I'm still scratchin' me head over that 'un. A boy and girl arguing across the hall interrupted his train of thought. \"But Aenya-\" \"Stop, Nathaniel. If you can't keep your head clear, then I want nothing more with you.\" \"Aenya-\" \"Diabhal thú, is fuath liom tú, cén fáth nach mharaíonn tú díreach tar éis do theaghlach, do chairde, agus go bhfuil píosa pathetic an cac a ghlaonn tú 'Nathaniel'!\" With that, the girl left. The boy obviously didn't understand a word of what the girl just said, but the as of yet unnoticed Leprechaun did. It was, after all, his native Gaeilge , albeit of a newer dialect than he was used to. The lass was a wee bit 'arsh, but me dun' think 'e was offended much. Something clicked in his head. Did the lass just say 'Nathaniel'? Luck of the Irish, I found 'un of me lads! 'Opefully the other is inside. Waiting, in hiding, for Nathaniel to enter his room, which he did, the Leprechaun melted into the cracks on the wall, still working out what to do in his mind. \"So, sounds like Aenya's happy,\" Mitchell commented, laughing as he did. \"It's not funny, Mitch. She's seriously pissed this time.\" Nathaniel spat back. He sighed. \"Where's the genie?\" \"He left. Said something about duties to perform before our second wish.\" \"A genie, aye? So that's how ye bastards did the foul deed! Don't ye know, it's not nice to wish away the gold of a Leprechaun.\" A short, bearded, man in green formed in front of the cracks in the wall. It is doubted that the reader needs an introduction. \"What did ye want from the genie? I see ya've already got gold. What about silver?\" With that, the two boys' kitchen silverware began to float, turn their sharp ends toward them, and fly in the direction their sharp ends were pointing. As the boys screamed in pain, Mitchell falling to the floor, the knives, spoons, and forks started wiggling, amplifying the pain significantly. \"Or maybe ye'd like some bronze, or maybe the fame of Fonz?\" One the boys possessed a third place trophy from some competition he had partaken in some time ago. The trophy moved to be above the pair's heads, where it split in half and melted. One can imagine the pain was quite significant, as searing hot liquid metal dripped down their faces. They figured out what the monster's plans for the 'fame of Fonz' were, for the Djinn chose that moment to show up. \"I wish these painful things would get off of me!\" one of the boys screamed. It really didn't matter which one. The melted bronze peeled off, taking skin with it. The silverware pulled itself out. The wounds they left behind were painful as well, and so, on Mitchell, they were removed. Nathaniel was exempt from this, as he was to be kept alive. The area around the chunks of flesh experienced pain from the previous removal, and were, well, the reader can figure it out. Wait, didn't the one I'm killing now make the first wish? It doesn't matter, they both benefited from the wishes, and therefore I count both towards the three. Now, to make sure this thing, whatever it is, doesn't kill Nathaniel. \"This wasn't me plan, yet I find meself congratulating ye, genie. If ye 'adn't taken me gold, we might've gotten along. As it is, ye must die now.\" The Wishmaster was surprised to find himself thrown back by an unidentifiable force. He stood up again, this time prepared for the creature's tricks. Another force began to pull on him, which he was able to dissipate. While the Leprechaun focused his magical energies on something else, the Djinn fired a bolt of red electricity. As the Leprechaun writhed in an electrocuted frenzy, the Wishmaster stood over him, gathering energy in order to finish him off, when a fishing line and hook stabbed him. The hook, inside of his body, enlarged and spread out. The metal, much to his surprise and chagrin, immobilized him. He found that, with only three souls, he wasn't strong enough to fight off the device. With extreme effort, the Djinn transported himself away from the university. The opal followed soon after. Hopefully, the thing will take its gold and leave. I just have to find the guy I didn't kill . Despite his thoughts, the Wishmaster knew he that he in fact did want to meet the green-clad thing again. No one defeated him. Nathaniel, who had watched the fight from under a table, now watched the writhing Leprechaun. He then performed two intelligent actions and one very stupid action. The two intelligent actions were to leave the place before the Leprechaun regained mobility and to avoid making another wish with the Djinn. The stupid action was to take the Leprechaun's gold. It is completely unknown what possessed him to do that. It is also unknown whether or not the Leprechaun chose to let him go or couldn't stop him. The fishing hook incident showed that he had some magical power, but letting a kid go was inconsistent with his known character. Maybe the fishing hook was his last burst before going out cold. No one knows, and it is unlikely that anyone ever shall know.[Chapter 5] The hook had drained the Wishmaster. He required a rest, and therefore took one. When that was done with, plotting was initiated. Two goals formed. The first was the same as his original goal, gaining power and freeing his brethren. The second dealt with the thing in the green clothes. What was it? Why was it so obsessed with that gold? How can he defeat it? The last interrogative was, for obvious reasons, of particular interest. Unable to contemplate the location of any form of informational source, the Djinn went out to work on goal 1. Leprechaun was cursing, using every word of that sort he knew. For the sake of clarity, he was no longer in the college, but in a random alley. While motion was restored to the greedy fairy, his body would still involuntarily twitch every now and then. \"With all me wits, eh'll work to tear 'em to bits! Me dun' know much 'bout genies, but under me power, the'll be but weenies! And that Nathaniel bastard, the thief of me gold, pretty soon 'is blood 'ill run cold!\" When his temper had cooled down to a sufficient amount for clear thoughts, Leprechaun realized that a successful battle with this new foe would require information. Lessee, genies be Arabs or such, methinks. Not much that me can go on. Eh, there's probably a museum or library or sumtin' around this trash heap. A scared, fidgety boy asked a man, both of whom were located in the street by the alleyway, where he could find the Museum of Arabian and Mesopotamian History and Culture. That was convenient. The leprechaun followed the human. A feeling of familiarity itched in the back of his mind. Nathaniel couldn't shake the sense that he was being followed. Knowing that in his situation pursuit was a genuine fear, he looked around. To his joy, he saw no one. To his dismay, that didn't shake the feeling. This sensation followed him to the museum, and refused to leave when he was there. Nathaniel, upon seeing evidence of a crime taking place sometime in the past, inquired of it. The curator informed him that the Fire Opal had been stolen. \"The artifact itself was quite small, and its historical impact was minimal. It had mythological importance though, and therefore was a very important piece.\" \"What was the mythology?\" \"An old Persian tale about an emperor who freed a 'Djinn', what us in the West call 'genies'. For his second wish, he wanted to be shown wonders, and therefore was shown images of people being tortured. Don't ask me what his first wish was. Before he made his third wish, a sorcerer stopped him, informing him that a third wish would allow the Djinn to open the portal between our world and theirs, and an army of them would destroy the world. The sorcerer proceeded to trap the Djinn in the Fire Opal, where, according to legend, he is still trapped.\" Well, I happen to know that the story is true, Nathaniel thought smugly. It then occurred to him that, without the Leprechaun's interference, he and Mitchell would probably have unwittingly doomed the world. \"The story isn't well known, even though it's most likely one of the first myths to have the 'three wishes' legend, which isn't as prominent in Arabian legends as most Americans think. In fact, other than this, I might have said that westerners ripped that idea off of leprechauns.\" \"Leprechauns?\" \"Yes, the Irish fairy. They were generally no good troublemakers and ne'er-do-well's, who only offered wishes in exchange for their own freedom.\" \"Why, ye motherless lout! 'Ow dare ye insult me folk!\" Leprechaun, who had been using his magic to hide himself until that point, popped up in front of the two, claws bared, with an expression that showed seething rage in a noticeable amount. It was not a long period of time before the curator was lying on the ground, screaming, with slash marks covering his torso. The leprechaun who caused this distress was on top of him, adding additional slash marks that went into his stomach. He was dead before the first security guard managed to get close enough[Chapter 6] Ch. 6 \"So, I can wish for anything?\" the young woman asked a Jinni who should be familiar to the reader. \"Mostly. My powers are slightly limited, but I'm quite you shall find yourself satisfied.\" After some moments of contemplation, she came to a conclusion. \"I wish my younger sister was still alive. She died in a fire several years back. I, I, could've saved her, b-but I was scared, you know, and-\" \"I didn't ask for an explanation. Your wish is my command.\" A crackle of energy surrounded the pair, energy that, upon fading, revealed a girl covered in burns. She wore an angry expression on her face, which remained constant as she pointed at her sister. \"You. You did this to me. Why didn't you help me? You should have helped me. WHY DID YOU LET ME DIE!\" Before the wish maker found herself able to respond, the burnt girl attacked her. It was a rather violent attack. As the young woman lay pinned on the ground, being pummeled to death by a maniac, she begged the Wishmaster for assistance. \"Sorry, only one wish allowed.\" He left her to her fate. Within a few minutes, the wonderful feeling that came from a human soul being absorbed to increase one's power came over him. Wishmaster's next victim was a 12-year-old boy who wanted a dog. The intention may or may not have been for a rabid one, but beggars can't be choosers, so that's what he got. A poor man asked for a 'million bucks'. Male deer weren't always known as the most dangerous of animals, but they proved lethal for this man. An old man wanted to stay in his house for all eternity, and was melded into the walls. There were a few other cases such as these. The Djinn eventually stopped to relish in his newfound strength. The green clothed thing couldn't trap me with any fishhooks now! Nathaniel watched the television set that the bar used to entertain customers. He had stopped here for food, and wanted to see if either of the monsters had made the news. The murders at the museum had, apparently. The ghastly descriptions of the corpses were told in detail, and those at the museum who weren't killed were interviewed. The stories were consistent, though the common man would have dismissed them as wild tales of the supernatural brought about by fear. The others in the bar made comments that confirmed this sentiment. The story ended with the mention that this was the third murder case where witnesses talked of leprechauns. \"Loons. The whole lot of them.\" Muttered some random person. \"I don't believe in leprechauns, either. But those killin's are certainly real.\" Nathaniel was about to leave. How can I convince them? I have no proof. The news changed to a story about a killer who was apprehended. She claimed to be Julie Green, who had died a few years ago, and was arrested for killing Sylvia Green, the sister of the dead girl. The woman said some magical creature had resurrected her, but she didn't know what it was or why it had done it. Let me guess, the genie's work. Nathaniel actually left this time. Unfortunately for him, the Wishmaster saw him on the sidewalk. Pursuit was chosen as his game for the time being. The monster was somewhat curious about Nathaniel's destination. When it became obvious that the boy's goal was someone's apartment, the thing that was definitely not a boy opened its mouth. \"Could you please stop, my friend.\" Nathaniel froze. He recognized the voice addressing him. \"I just ran away from the leprechaun, and now I run into you. Do you two take turns tracking me?\" \"That isn't relevant. I was wondering if you intended to make your third wish anytime soon.\" \"I wish you would die.\" That was the response from the person who had just come up with what he perceived as an ingenious plan. \"My apologies, master, but I am not able to grant such a wish. When you have decided on your actual final wish, I shall return.\" Nathaniel expected some sort of resistance, so this came as a shock. I could have wished to know how to kill the leprechaun, but the risk of the whole 'army of Djinn taking over the world' thing being true is too high to take. Besides, Aenya's grandmother should know something useful. Slightly annoyed that that Nathaniel idiot had seen through him, the Wishmaster had come to an alleyway to think. How can I trick him? His thoughts were interrupted by an individual he hadn't expected to see. \"Genie, where've ye bin? Me dun' s'pose ye know where me gold be, do ye?\" Both gathered their energies, preparing for combat.[Chapter 7] Ch. 7 Leprechaun wasn't expecting the incredible burst of energy that flew towards him, knocking him through the wall behind him. The woman in the room, who had evidently been sleeping in the middle of the day, was awakened by the noise. Upon seeing the green-clad man that matched the description of the killer in the news, she predictably screamed and ran out of her apartment. The Irish demon might have followed her, but he had bigger problems to worry about. The genie's gotten tougher. No matter, me knows 'bout the stone, and me powers can't be beat by this brittle bone. Brittle bone? Damn, me rhymes are gettin' stale. He melted into the wall, planning a stealth-based attack. Wishmaster was wondering where his opponent had gone. He didn't entertain the idea of such an early retreat. The creature is tricky. I can't trust outward appearances while facing him. Sure enough, sharp, blade-like claws cut into his back without any form of warning. The cutting was short-lived, as a burst of kinetic force knocked Leprechaun back. Wishmaster was noticeably irritated by the fact that his enemy's assault had left wounds. In fact, he was flaming, in multiple ways, as he had summoned fire to destroy the creature. The heat-based chemical reaction spread everywhere, excluding its target, for Leprechaun easily protected himself. Flames increased in intensity, and, under the Djinn's direct control, were able to bypass the Irishman's defenses. He screamed in pain as his clothing burned, forcing him to teleport to the bathroom of the apartment he had smashed into not long ago. The water that coursed through pipes now coursed towards his flesh. Not wanting to lose his advantage, Wishmaster turned the water into oil. This had the expected result, and the genie smiled at his victory. Said smile turned out to be jumping the gun, for the flaming oil was removed from the leprechaun and tossed to the genie, where it enveloped him. He tried to extinguish it through magic, but his opponent used all of his power to prevent that from happening. It may have seemed hopeless when he couldn't stop the flames, but he realized that with the leprechaun's powers focused thus, it wouldn't be able to prevent an attack by the burn victim. A lightning bolt burst from his fingers, and their target tried to avoid it, forcing the flames to die out. \"What do you want?\" the elder man at the door asked, obviously displeased with the visitor. \"I would like to do an investigation into Irish lore, particularly that pertaining to leprechauns.\" Nathaniel responded, using what he hoped was a respectful tone. \"I was wondering if you or your wife could help me. And before you ask, no, this has nothing to do with your granddaughter.\" The expression on the elder's face showed mistrust. \"Why da hell d'ya want ta learn 'bout leprechauns?\" There was a moment of pondering following this question, as the truth was definitely out of the question as an answer. \"College paper,\" he lied. The door holder clearly didn't believe him, but reluctantly let him in. \"Teamhair! Some kid wants ta ask ya 'bout leprechauns!\" he called. Teamhair descended the stairs. \"Okay. What d'ya want ta know?\" Wishmaster's lightning bolt was retaliated against with another lightning bolt, this one from Leprechaun's fingers. After firing, the Irish creature melted into the ground, going to heaven only knows where. Searching frantically, the Mesopotamian monster tried to avoid another surprise attack. Little did he know, his adversary was also searching frantically, but he was looking for a certain red gem. \"Where could ol' desert skin be keepin' his pretty jewel? Me needs it to destroy 'im!\" A kid passed by the pair, or the one as he saw it, and would have ignored them if the visible one hadn't called out to him. \"Wish to find a short man dressed in green!\" \"What?\" \"Just do it!\" \"Uh…I wish to find a short man dressed in green\" the said, obviously confused. The Djinn's magic forced the leprechaun to the boy. \"Damn ye, ye ruined me plan! Ye idiot, why dun' ye find yer way to 'ell?\" The boy didn't breathe for much longer, leaving the Wishmaster stronger than before. The empowered one renewed his magical assault on the fairy, and that fairy decided to retreat. \"Ye may 'ave won this round, genie, but next time eh'll find yer opal, put yer soul in it, and erase any hopal!\" Wishmaster might have tried to finish the fight, but the leprechaun's knowledge of the opal disconcerted him, giving him just enough time to escape. Wishmaster decided to check on Nathaniel. Nathaniel had just listened to a complete history of leprechauns and chulluchauns, from their incarnations in old Ireland to their reformation into Irish stereotypes by the modern American media. \"Now, how does one kill a Leprechaun?\" \"Well, a four-leaf clover should do the trick. Just touch it to the li'il bastard, if me remembers correctly.\" \"Go raibh maith agat,\" Nathaniel responded, the only Irish he had learned from his time with Aenya. Then he left. A certain Mesopotamian creature had heard the last part, and was particularly intrigued with it.

This is my first fanfic so go easy on me. I made this fan-fiction so I can see if I'm ready to make stories or not. (cant wait to read reviews). Anyways, one-shot comedy. Dante Hicks and Randal Graves are sitting in the Quick Stop, waiting for customers to come in and order something. Randal has been wondering about something for the past 5 minutes and decides to tell Dante this. \"Hey Dante, You know what I've always wondered?\" Randal asks. Dante raises his head from the counter and tiredly replies \"what?\" \"Have you ever wondered if our life was like some sort of story or whatever?\" Randal asks, \"Like what if there was some guy up there writing our every movements and making us say what we are talking about right now?\" Dante then stares at Randal, with a tired expression on his face, \"You mean like fan-fiction?\" He asks. \"Exactly!\" Randal replies with a grin on his face. \"If this is fan-fiction, then this is written by some ugly loser with no life or somethin'. Then, both Dante and Randal's faces suddenly turned blank and wide-eyed as Randal yells in a loud monotone voice, \"I was just kidding about what i said earlier, trollskullkid69 is the best fan-fiction writer to even exist. Do you agree with me, Dante Hicks?\" \"Yes, Randal Graves!\", Dante says in a loud, monotone voice. \"i worship trollskullkid69 every day and i think he's so much a better person than everyone on the face of the Earth.\" Then, everything turned to normal. Dante and Randal have confused and shocked looks on their faces. The duo then get up and run outside. They then find something that shocks the two of them: Jay and Silent bob making out in front of the store. \"I love you, lunchbox!\" Jay yells in a loud, monotone voice. \"You are my life partner and I shall now perform unspeakable sex acts that trollskullkid69 will post on rule 34.\" Jay and Silent Bob walk to the sunset while holding hands. After the two clerks stop puking, Dante then figures everything out. \"Randal, i think we are in a fan fiction!\" Dante states with a worried expression on his face. \"Ha! i knew it!\" Randal gloats and starts congratulating himself on his prediction. \"You knew we were in a fan-fiction?\" \"No, I knew those two were gay!\" A/N: So that's my very first fan-fiction. Like i said, please go easy on me. I hope you enjoyed it and depending on whether or not this story was good, another Clerks fan-fic will be on the way. Thx for reading! :D ","Summary":" Author's note: Hey guys. This is my first fanfic so go easy on me.

If it hadn't, maybe he wouldn't be as happy as he is now, or maybe he wouldn't have been happy at all. Maybe, he wouldn't have met Becky. ","Summary":" Dante sometimes thought about it.
