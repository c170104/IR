[{"Movie":"Sky Captain and the World of Tomor...","Title":"Magnum Opus","Author":"paganpunk2","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8232763","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Joe desperately wanted to stop him, but he knew that saying something would only lead to another fight. So he just watched from across the room, leaning unobtrusively against an old fuselage and trying not to wince every time he saw Dex's mouth tighten in agony. The engineer limped from under the wing of the plane to the part- and paper-strewn table nearby, consulted a blueprint, and hobbled back. The arm that wasn't encased in plaster reached up, did something Sky Captain couldn't discern at his distance, then withdrew and pushed the outer panel back into place. He struggled for a moment, trying to set the bolts without dropping the metal sheeting on his own head, and finally resorted to holding the cover up with his cast so that his good hand could tighten it down properly. He flinched visibly as he hugged the broken limb back against his body, and then glanced around as if he were afraid someone might have seen him evince pain. Spotting Joe, he sighed and made his way over, well aware that a showdown was imminent. Knowing that he'd been discovered, Sky Captain moved forward quickly, not wanting the other man to have to travel any more of the distance between them than was absolutely unavoidable. They drew to a stop when they were face to face, both wearing determined expressions. \"How long have you been standing there?\" Dex asked, attempting to cross his arms out of habit and failing. \"Since I tried to take you dinner and found you not in bed. Which, by the way, is where nine out of ten doctors would agree you should be.\" \"I had work to do. The wiring in your starboard wing was completely fried. I wasn't comfortable with the idea of you flying it like that, and I know that you'll go up before I'm back to work.\" \"You do remember that you're having surgery tomorrow, correct?\" \" Yes . That's why I had to finish this tonight.\" \"You're hurt, damn it, you shouldn't be working!\" \"If I don't work, you'll be the one hurt. Or worse,\" Dex countered hotly. \"Besides, I'm not in pain.\" \"Oh, right, and I suppose the limping and the pained faces are all part of your new Igor impression?\" \"You know they won't let me get any real work done in the hospital. At least let me go under the knife in the morning having done everything in my power to keep you safe while I'm out of commission. Let me have that little bit of consolation, all right?\" Sky Captain was shamed into silence for a moment. \"And if I let you do that, Dex, then in what manner am I keeping you safe?\" he asked finally. \"That's not your job, Cap. It's the other way around and you know it.\" \"It is my job,\" he growled. \"Especially since it's my fault you're hurt.\" \"It isn't your fault,\" the engineer insisted. \"It was the other driver's fault, he was the one who ran the light.\" \"I should have seen him. I should have been able to avoid him.\" \"Joe, he was on my side and I didn't even see him coming. It wasn't your fault,\" he repeatedly gently. \"We're both alive, and we're getting a massive settlement out of it. Everything's fine.\" \"No, it isn't. If it was, you wouldn't have to be…\" he flailed wildly, \"… cut open in twelve hours to have your arm screwed back together. You wouldn't be limping, and we wouldn't be fighting about this. We could just have a drink, have a laugh or two, and go on with life. Like normal.\" \"We can still do that. Nothing's changed, except that you've been angry ever since the accident. I can't figure it out, so I vote that you just tell me. What are you so worked up about?\" \"I'm not worked up about anything, I just don't want you taking unnecessary risks.\" \"I'm not . I'm just working, like I always do, every day. It's no riskier than it was before. Yes, there are dangers, there are always dangers, but they're inherent to the job. They can't be completely controlled. That's life , Joe.\" He half-shrugged and smiled. \"It's just life.\" \"You could have been killed,\" the pilot whispered back miserably, no longer caring whether the level of despair that thought caused in him was inappropriate. \"Yeah, I could have been,\" Dex agreed. \"But do you know what?\" he added, leaning forward conspiratorially. \" I wasn't. I'm right here, right now, with you. And we're fine. A little banged up, I'll admit,\" he lifted his arm slightly, \"but functional. So a doctor has to put a few screws in my arm to make it heal right. So what? I think it's pretty amazing that we can do that with people. A hundred years ago they would have just cut my arm off, do you realize that? And they would have done it without anesthetic, without post-operative painkillers, without sterilized instruments. If this had happened a century earlier, I could very well have died from it. But it didn't. It happened now, and it happened with you. Now that surgeon tomorrow can knock me out, put me back together, and let me go home with a bottle full of happy pills guaranteed to make me utterly oblivious to pain. Trust me, those are all really good things.\" \"They wouldn't be needed if I-\" \"More importantly,\" Dex interrupted him, stepping closer until they were mere inches apart, \"when I'm getting antsy and don't want to stay in bed anymore despite doctor's orders, I will have someone who is equally as bad at following the rules to keep me where I belong. Someone who will do everything in his power to keep me amused in spite of my misery at hearing work going on all around me and not feeling involved. Someone who, if I pouted just the right way, would probably put off a meeting with God himself to keep me company. Someone who my life would be meaningless without and, therefore, someone I will do everything in my power to keep safe, even if that means working when I'm supposed to be resting.\" He stared up at him wordlessly for a moment, hoping his message had been conveyed clearly enough. \"Do you get it now, Joe?\" \"I get it, Dex,\" he whispered back, disbelief mingling with ecstasy in his eyes. \"But that doesn't answer my question of how I'm supposed to keep you safe if you insist on being so damned belligerent.\" \"I guess that's up to you to figure out,\" the engineer replied. \"I mean, you say I should be in bed, but I'm not tired. Maybe if you came up with a creative solution that would make bed more interesting for me…\" Sky Captain gasped slightly, steeled himself, and then grabbed the man in front of him and pulled him into a hard, needy kiss. \"I don't think you have to worry about your bed being uninteresting ever again, Dex,\" he promised when they finally broke off. \"Good,\" he answered, nuzzling against the pilot's neck as his feet were lifted off of the floor. \"I've got some ideas I've been working on just for some time when I'm stuck in bed.\" \"Been saving them for something special?\" \"Yeah. Problem I've been having is, they're all two-man jobs.\" He grinned at the moan his words drew out. \"I think I know someone who can help you with that.\" \"Let's get started, then. You know I can never wait to dive into new projects.\" \"Is that what I am? A project?\" He frowned down at the other man. \"Not just any project, Joe,\" he whispered with a soft smile. \"My life's work.\" ","Summary":" Joe desperately wanted to stop him, but he knew that saying something would only lead to another fi"},{"Movie":"Sky Captain and the World of Tomor...","Title":"Golden Afternoon","Author":"FrUKing Awesome Canadian Hero","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11352535","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: A piece I dug up from a couple of years ago and finished this evening. A first attempt at this fandom; any reviews over characterization would be very much appreciated! Warm, hazy light filters through the windows of the hangar, glowing golden with the sunset across the minute slope of Dex's nose, the smack of bubblegum pausing as he sinks deeper into thought. He leans out of the beam of sunlight, catching another one across his cheekbones as he marks another sighting of Totenkopf's robots on the map. Really, what Joe should be worrying about is the fact that they'd taken Totenkopf down less than a year ago, and yet here his creations still were, reviving themselves from the dead to hunt something else entirely unknown. Rather, what Joe is worrying about is the way the brilliant specks of dust spin about in the air whenever Dex releases a quiet breath. He's also worrying about the exact amount of faint freckles smattered across Dex's cheeks, lit by the soft, unearthly glow of the sunshine. Gum smacks and a bubble pops with a satisfying crack, before Dex leans lazily upright again, out of the light, and the spell is broken; reality's icy water drags foreboding fingers down his spine and Joe tries his utmost not to shiver. Dex's chest heaves when he sighs, face tight with fatigue in the absence of beaming shadows to cascade across it. He casts Joe a wry smile and gives a surrendered shrug. \"Can't do an equation without all the variables, Cap,\" he declares apologetically. Joe nods, lost in his own thoughts, scrutinizing the map before them with a defeated sort of contemplation. They've chased these things across the world and back, and just when they should've been destroyed—and Sky Captain been able to rest for at least a couple of weeks— a whole new disaster is only beginning to snowball, and the only man who could've helped them lays rotting in his office. ' Forgive me '; Joe snorts derisively. Had Totenkopf wanted to talk about forgiveness, the sniveling prick should've stuck around to suffer his work as the rest of the world had nearly been forced to. It's a dismal train of thought without the sunbeams on Dex's face to stare unseeingly into, and with effort he drags himself back to the surface as Dex stretches after a long day hunched over the desk, shoulders un-knotting and back cracking. The sides of his palms are slick with graphite and his forearms spattered with ink and grease. \"You need a towel?\" Joe asks, already moving across the workstation to get one and dampen it. Dex holds out his hands and Joe tosses it into their grip. He watches as his friend scrubs at the grime until the damp towel is black and his skin shines pink in the light. He's watched Dex far too much since they've returned alive from Totenkopf's island; only now does he finally notice the details that have begun to commandeer his life—dark eyelashes, eyes that shift from deep brown to golden-rimmed with the time of day, deeply embedded callouses and lines in slim hands from days upon days' work. And for six long years now, every single pencil stroke or calculation or experimental disaster involved in that work has been for Joe. The notion evokes equal measures of guilt and warmth when he allows it to linger. \"God damn, where's Polly when you need her?\" Joe chuckles, shaking his head. Dex shoots him a quizzical glance. \"She'd dig up that last variable for you if it cost the universe, just to satisfy her curiosity,\" he clarifies, fond exasperation undisguised in his voice. Now it's Dex's turn to smile. It doesn't reach his golden eyes. Joe feels the small frown crease between his own eyebrows. \"Something wrong?\" he asks quietly—and sure enough, his palms begin to sweat. He's terrible at things like this, but damn, Dex is usually the sunniest person he knows. Dex is the one he always runs to, because he's the only one who can cheer Joe up simply by existing in the earnest way he does. \"Nah, just need a night off,\" Dex shrugs, turning his back on Joe. \"Take tomorrow, too,\" Joe tells him. \"You've earned it.\" Dex looks pleasantly surprised when he crosses the work station to rinse the remaining grime from his forearms. \"If you insist, I ain't gonna argue.\" He smiles, and this time it's a little more genuine. He hesitates for a moment, then turns to Joe with cautious eagerness in the dimming sunlight. \"You got plans for tonight?\" Joe shouldn't feel like such an ass for wanting to spend a night with his lover for the first time in almost a month, but he does when Dex is looking at him with a gaze like that. \"Polly,\" he mutters. \"I'm taking her out tonight.\" Dex's gaze hardens and he shrugs, but it's stiff and Joe immediately wants to grab his words back out of the air. Of course we can go out , he'll say. Polly can wait another few days. We need some guy time. Let's get tipsy and go see the latest documentary about the Sky Captain's fantastic army-for-hire. But he's already spoken, and Dex smiles again, saying something about it being fine before he walks away, sunbeams dulling and fading across the back of his worn blue shirt. So Joe takes Polly out. He listens to her complain about the restrictions her boss imposes upon her and chat about her friend's birthday last week. He vents about the virtually indestructible design of the latest of Totenkopf's attacking creations and voices his worries about Dex. Polly sighs, a sadly knowing look in her eyes, and pats the back of his hand with her delicate palm. \"You know you should go to him, Joe,\" she tells him matter-of-factly, as though she's not a relatively possessive woman telling her lover to terminate a (long-awaited, mind you) date, in favor of checking up on a friend who's probably fine anyway. After all, it's not as though Dex has been having problems since his abduction. Is it? Joe apologizes to her, pays for their half-eaten meal, and hurries to Dex's minuscule apartment. Dex is not fine. When Joe arrives, Dex is far beyond drunk in the sitting room, in tears with a nigh-empty vodka bottle in hand. Joe feels sicker than any amount of flying could make him at the sight, but his milk of magnesia is under the pilot's seat of the plane that Dex built for him—too much of his friend, panic—and his heart is pounding, too big, and his breath comes short and shaky. How didn't he know? Why didn't Dex speak up? They've saved each other's lives time and time again, and yet Dex doesn't know that Joe would do nothing short of kick down the doors to Heaven or Hell for him? The air Joe breathes is ragged grit and he doesn't give a damn, because Dex is crying alone on the couch and god damn, the guilt is a fucking torrent of ice water and glass down his back, and it doesn't stop falling even while he's struggling to stay above the surface. \"Y' shldn't've come,\" Dex slurs, staggering to his feet and running a hand through his hair, only succeeding in mussing it further. \"Thought y' were with P'lly.\" There are nail marks on his forearms, as though he's been clawing at himself. And that's it; Joe doesn't bother to hang up his coat, just drops it on the floor and rushes to embrace the best friend he's ever had in his life. \"What the hell , Dex?\" he whispers, shaking his head as the younger man collapses shaking into his arms. \"Christ, what did they do to you?\" Joe's eyes are pricking, nearly watering. He tells himself it's because of the low light. Dex drops the vodka bottle and Joe doesn't catch it, doesn't bother trying, before it lands with a hollow thunk on the carpet and the little remainder of its contents drain, unnoticed by either of them. He clings to Joe like a dying man, and when his legs give out, Joe eases him down on the creaky sofa, sitting next to him awkwardly but never looking anything less than totally distraught at the tears Dex feels flooding down his face. His throat burns from alcohol and crying. He loathes himself for making such a scene of this. \"T'ld me you were dead, Cap,\" he rasps, smiling grimly. He looks a haunted man. \"T'ld me I'd failed, thought I w'ld never see you again—\" His breaths pick up and then hitch, choke, golden eyes growing wild, becoming panicked black pits, and Joe doesn't think, just takes his face in his hands, wiping tears from his cheeks with his thumbs, and forces Dex to look at him. \"Dex. I'm here, you didn't fail at anything. I would never stop searching for you. Never .\" The crackle in the air holds them both motionless, breathing each other's air, neither daring to blink nor pull away. \"Joe, I.. I think I—\" Dex's eyes are sliding into focus for the first time this evening, face falling deadly serious. Noses brush. \"Coffee,\" Joe says abruptly, cutting him off with a rough finger to his lips. He pulls roughly away. \"I'm making coffee. No more talk until you're sober.\" He's up off the couch as fast as he came, the loss of his presence cold as ice. Dex passes out before Joe's finished making the coffee, but it's alright, because if Dex had finished his sentence, he may have run from the apartment and been unable to come back for the tangle of heartstrings ripping him apart. Joe both longs for those words and dreads them with an unspeakable terror. Dex is Joe's sunlight, his art, his intellect and his delight in the world. His happiness. Joe owes everything to Dex, and he knows it, and he doesn't mind at all. And that scares him absolutely shitless. He sighs, watching his friend breathe deeply in sleep, positioned awkwardly on the sofa, and abandons the pot of coffee in favor of slipping off his shoes. Padding over, sitting, and gently moving Dex's head into his lap, Joe leans his head back and falls into a restless sleep. In the very early morning, Dex stirs and Joe jolts awake. Dex's eyes are glazed, but his gaze is focused, and when he meets Joe's eyes, Joe breathes a quiet sigh of relief. No alcohol poisoning. No hospital. He hadn't thought it would happen, but damn him if he ever stops worrying about Dex. Weak moonbeams shatter the darkness and paint the apartment floor. Dex gives a chuckle that sounds more like a cough than a laugh. \"I vaguely remember somethin' about coffee,\" he rasps. Joe smiles. \"It's bound to be cold by now.\" \"I also remember you cuttin' me off in the middle of a something important,\" Dex continues deliberately. \"Until I was sober. Which I happen to be now.\" Joe's stomach lurches into his throat and his blood suddenly feels very hot and very cold. Dex fixes him with a stare that's all resolute affection, and it feels like those bright sunbeams from the warehouse are buried in his eyes. And then they dim. \"I'm jealous of Polly.\" Joe blinks. \"What?\" he sputters, utterly bewildered. \"Why?\" Dex shuts his eyes and scowls. He's biting the inside of his cheek. \"I wasn't done, you fucking idiot,\" he groans. \"I'm jealous of how you talk about her, and how you look at her. How happy she makes you.\" \"Stop, Dex,\" Joe says suddenly. \"Stop.\" He leans down to take Dex's face in his hands again, thumbs brushing over the cheekbones and chin rough with stubble. Dex looks upset like he wants to speak again, but Joe stops him, jumps in, dives in to the myriad of things he's been thinking and not saying without letting himself pause for a breath of sense. \" You make me happy. Happier . You're so... I just, when I look at you, I see all the good in the world standing right in front of me. And whether you're drawing or building or chewing that bubblegum, there is always something about you that fascinates me. You're always so bright, Dex. You remind me that good things exist. I don't know how you do it. I...\" Joe falters, and realizes with sudden, painful clarity what he's skirting around, trying to say without really saying it. \"I want to know how you do it.\" Silence. \"You want to know how I do it?\" Dex whispers, frozen beneath Joe's stare. Joe takes a shaky breath. \"Yes.\" Dex sits up and kisses him. Both of them have their eyes wide open and it's brief and hard and neither is prepared, but a moment after they break Joe chases Dex's lips when he lies back down and kisses him properly—long, languid, heating. Joe's heart throbs against his ribs. Right. Right. Right. Dex makes a soft sound beneath him, and he kisses harder. The pressing of lips turns to the soft click of teeth and the brushing of tongues; there is no breaking for breath. Deep, full pants come in unison, rushed exhales pressed into one another's cheeks. Joe slides into place beside Dex on the too-small sofa, pulling him close, a quiet murmur escaping him when Dex rolls on top of him and traces the intricacies of Joe's ear with calloused fingertips. When they come up for air, the gray beginnings of a sunrise are starting to permeate the horizon. The two men have become entwined, legs tangled, holding each other close. Dex tucks his forehead against Joe's throat, kissing the skin there as an afterthought that makes Joe shiver. \"So,\" Joe murmurs, nuzzling Dex's mussed hair. \"So,\" Dex mumbles against his neck. \"Are we a... well, are we a 'we'?\" Joe stumbles over his words. \"If you want us to be,\" Dex smiles, looking up at him. Joe knows that he's holding the most precious creation in the universe—he's always known, but now, the truth of it is so clear that it almost hurts to admire too closely. Joe kisses his forehead. \"Coffee?\" he offers. Dex laughs, then winces with his newly-realized hangover and buries his face in Joe's chest. \" Coffee .\" ","Summary":" A/N: A piece I dug up from a couple of years ago and finished this evening.

Mainly Polly stops talking to him as she figured out that he had a affair with Franky Cook, and doesn't want to know him. Sitting in her room, at home, Polly listen to some music, mainly sad but it's something that just reminds her of him and well she wished she found out of what Franky got that she hasn't. She sighed as one of her favourite songs came on: Can you feel me when I think about you? With every breath I take, Every minute no matter what I do, my world is a empty place. Like I been wandering the desert for a thousand days…. Listening to the words carefully, Polly felt her eyes feeling up with tears as she couldn't believe that she misses Joseph and wants him back. Thinking more deeply, Polly actually thought that the words in this song done by a young artist, means a lot and well she thinks that it's well presented. I need you by my side, I don't know how I will survive It's like a year without rain Feeling more tears coming from her eyes, Polly got up, kneels down so her hands reached under the bed, pulling out a box which she put away a year ago when she fell out with Joe. Sitting on her bed once more, she pulled the box open and started going through the things of what she collected while going out with him at the time. The stars are burning, I hear your voice at my mind, Can you hear me calling? My heart is yearning from the ocean that is running dry. Pictures here and there of them, away to places, adventures like going to friends, even going in his plane which Joe doesn't like but then he also enjoys himself as she looked through the memories of what the photo's held and wish she really was the only girl in his world, no one else. I missing you so much, Can't help it I am in love, A day without you is like a year without rain. This is the time to do something right now so she got up from the sofa and headed towards her bedroom to get some of her stuff together before walking back out and this time heading towards the door. Once opening the door, her eyes scan the streets before walking down the steps and now walking down the street, towards Joe's place to do some explaining. I need you by my side, I don't know how I will survive It's like a year without rain She arrived at Joe's place at least half an hour later, her heart beating like mad as she knocked on the door softly.

Joseph I still in love with you and without you is like a year without rain in my life.\" She explained. He listened before a small smile appeared on his face as he held his arms out. She jumps at him as her tears that been buried for the past year suddenly started pouring out of her eyes. \"It's okay Polls. I love you too.\" A Year Without Rain.

A/N: I love this pairing and it appears that a few of us are trying to pump back some life into the Sky Captain section. Hopefully I may be able to assist. Please read and review kindly, if at all. Warning: This is a slash fiction between Cap'n Joe and Dex, so, if you're not into two men liking each other, please exit the fanfiction. I wouldn't like a review saying 'I hate blah blah blah, etc.' just as much as you don't like slash pairings like these, so let's both just go our separate ways and get on with the show. Chew, smack, pop. Chew, smack, pop. The mantra that currently echoed throughout the hangar as its sole occupant sat, working on one of the world's best aircrafts since the Wright Brothers first took flight. Chew, smack, pop. The song that Dex's gum sang as he chewed it regularly, signifying that the grimy creature that sat staring glumly at the plane was indeed the young genius. Chew, smack….Dex paused, his monotonous melody halting as his mouth stretched into a wide yawn, his gum falling from his mouth unnoticed. \"Gee whiz, Cap'n….of all the night's to go out on, you had to pick this one? When I haven't got the right parts in for my newest invention? When I don't have anything to work on? When I can't start thinking about planes because all I'm thinking about is what floozy you're going to bring back to the base to show a good time-?\" Dex cut himself off, stopping as he noticed the subtle clenching of his fists, his nails making it a point to dig into his skin. It was then that he finally noticed his gum lying on the concrete ground below him, causing him to pause in his angry thoughts of his Captain to try and construct a plan for how he was going to get a new piece of gum. Dex's brow furrowed as he stared at the offending piece of pink that had run out of its flavor and had escaped from his mouth at the first chance it got. \"Traitor.\" Dex mumbled, standing up and brushing his dust covered jump suit off, not caring that all he did was get more oil on his hands. He had been tuning up the 'Polly', or the 'nosy reporter', as Dex liked to call it, before he had realized he'd run out of things to fix on the aircraft. He'd literally fixed everything in one night; one night that the Captain wasn't there. Again, Dex cut himself off from his own thoughts before giving the gum one last glare and stalking off to his office to get another pack of gum. Then, maybe afterwards, he'd throw himself onto his cot and sleep away all of his fury at the supposedly 'committed' Sky Captain. Admittedly, Dex understood that Joe had an appearance to keep up, but he didn't have to bring them back to his apartment. Hell, he didn't need to bring them to the base either! They had top secret stuff here, for Christ's sake! Huffing in annoyance, Dex continued his forward advanced towards his office, only to stop abruptly as he heard a very familiar giggle from Joe's office. Dex's whole body froze for a matter of seconds, his heart beat racing as he quietly stood stalk still, waiting for the woman to speak. \" I was beginning to worry, Joe, that you didn't want to see me again.\" \" You know me, Polly, always working.\" POLLY. The name of the aircraft he'd been working on, the bane of the mechanic's existence and supposedly the Captain's too, and the nosiest reporter since-well, since ever! Dex's anger returned full force, muscles from all those years of loyally working by Joe's side tensing as his body went into offensive mode. He stayed still like that for what seemed like ages, until he heard laughing from inside the room and his body deflated, the anger flowing out of him like blood would a wound. They started to talk again, inside the room, but Dex didn't want to hear any of it. 'I'm sure they're laughing about something only the two of them know about. Some adventure that the 'Good boy' Dex doesn't get to know about.' Never had Dex been so jealous of Polly Perkins in his life; he hadn't needed to early in his and Joe's relationship. The Sky Captain had been nothing but an adamant lover; never letting Dex want for anything. These days, however, he'd taken to going out on the town, just like he used to do before they'd gotten together after the Totenkopf incident. Now, to top it all off, Joe was back with Polly Perkins, the buxom blonde that Joe had cleverly named his plane after. The one that Dex had been working all night to fix up for the Captain so that he'd be ready for his mission tomorrow, so that he wouldn't have something happen like the Manchurian death camp incident. The sudden urge to go destroy the plane hit him like a ton of bricks, nearly knocking him backwards and away from his office's door, which he had absent mindedly walked to. His hand gently grasped the doorknob and twisted, just as the door to the Sky Captain's office next to his opened to reveal none other than the blonde bombshell Polly Perkins looking… perkier than ever. \"Goodnight Dex!\" She called to him, no hint of malice, no hint of her knowing that she'd helped the man he loved to break his trust, just the usual oblivious at times Polly. \"'Night, Polly!\" Dex gave her his best lopsided grin, trying his best to cover up the pain that her being there caused him. She waved politely in response, which he returned, before click-clacking off to wherever people as perky as Polly spent their nights. \"Dex?\" Joe called from his office, surprise evident in his voice as if floated out through the still open doorway. \"'Night Cap'n.\" Dex called, opening his office door quickly and shutting it, his search for his gum automatically becoming the forefront problem in his mind. 'No, best not to think of anything other than the gum, Dex.' Repeated itself in his mind before his oil covered, shaking hands found the wrapper of a piece of gum. Quickly he made his way to his cot, throwing himself on it in his haste to be at rest, his quivering hands depositing the newly unwrapped piece of gum into his mouth. Chew, smack, pop. Chew, smack, pop. \"Dex?\" There was a soft knocking at the door. Chew, smack, pop. \"Dex, she just wanted to know what my next mission was. I promise.\" Joe again. Chew, smack, pop. \"Please Dex, may I come in?\" Chew—Dex paused for what seemed to be the umpteenth time that night. \"Sure, Cap'n.\" Somehow Dex's voice handed wavered as he spoke. Joe immediately let himself in, barely managing to close the door behind him before he was at Dex's side, brushing the mechanic's tears he hadn't noticed he'd been crying away. \"I'm so sorry Dex. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I love you so much. I'm so sorry. It won't happen again.\" Joe repeated over and over, like Dex's own mantra from earlier, before the Sky Captain lay down beside the mechanic and held him. He continued to apologize, asking, pleading for Dex's forgiveness. Dex hesitated a moment, but only a moment, to head his last 'Chew, smack, pop' before turning so that he could be held by his Sky Captain. \"Please Dex, forgive me, again?\" And like all the other times before, Dex was inclined to forgive him.

The handle of a teaspoon protruded from his lips. The spoon's business end had been loaded with peanut butter a minute earlier, but a gentle bobbing suggested that this was no longer the case. Sure enough, when the utensil was withdrawn it had been licked clean. Joe smiled faintly as the spoon was lowered back into the jar clamped loosely between Dex's crossed legs. \"You know you're halfway, don't you?\" \"Huh?\" Cinnamon-tinted eyes tore themselves from the page and trained themselves on him. \"The book?\" \"No. The peanut butter.\" \"...Oh.\" There was real disappointment in the sigh that followed this acknowledgement. \"Guess I'd better save the rest for next weekend.\" \"Here.\" Joe reached forward from his seat behind his desk. \"Give it over. You won't be as tempted if it's in the drawer down here instead of in your room. And you know I wouldn't touch that sludge with a...\" He trailed off, his forehead crinkled with thought. \"A ten-foot pole?\" \"I was trying to come up with something better than that.\" \"There isn't anything better than that, Cap. That's why it's a cliché.\" Dex screwed the lid back onto the jar he'd been eating from and tossed it carefully into Joe's waiting hands. \"How's the budget look in terms of rebuilding the hangars?\" \"Awful. Your peanut butter habit is bankrupting us.\" \"Oops. I could switch to whisky?\" \"After peanut butter ?\" Joe shuddered. \"That's sacrilege.\" \"Sorry. Must be my New England Anglican upbringing.\" \"You use peanut butter and Scotch for communion, do you?\" \"Sure. I mean, that was all we had at the first Thanksgiving. It's kind of a tradition now.\" The pair smirked at each other until Joe shook his head. \"At least go wash your mouth out.\" \"You think soap will go better with the booze than peanut butter?\" Joe could barely suppress his mirth. Moments like this one were why he rolled his eyes when people labelled his chief engineer 'serious'. \"Rinse with water, Dex. Just water. Not soap. Unless I'm treading on another cherished Dearborn family tradition?\" \"Eh, you know how old Puritan stock is. We don't give up on soap until about thirty seconds before we lose our faith.\" Dex made to leave the office, then paused at the door. \"It's a good thing, though,\" he said over his shoulder. \"What you said.\" \"When?\" \"Just now. About not having to use soap.\" \"Why?\" \"Been out for twenty-odd years.\" \"Is that why your jokes stink so terribly?\" \"Aw.\" How Dex could make such a sad noise whilst grinning so broadly, Joe couldn't imagine. \"Hurtful.\" \"Will a double kiss it and make it better?\" \"Only one way to find out.\" And with that, Dex disappeared into the hallway. Chuckling, Joe bent down and opened the bottom drawer of his desk. The space had been intended to hold files, but there wasn't room for much paper once you put a bottle or two of Scotch and a jar of peanut butter in. It was a design flaw, for sure. Not for the first time, Joe thought about asking Dex to build him a more intelligent workspace. But then there were so many more important things to do. After all, he couldn't fly a desk. Although... \"Thinking about the flying desk again?\" \"It's not an impossible idea,\" Joe answered defensively as Dex occupied a chair across from him. \"You've said so yourself.\" Dex took a sip from the generous pour in his glass, swallowed, and winced. \"The papers would go everywhere.\" \"Then make heavier paper. Or paper with a higher mass, or...however gravity works, Dex.\" \"Harder to get off the ground with a heavier paper load, Cap.\" Another sip, another swallow, another wince, but less intense this time. \"I did have an idea the other day, though. About paper reduction.\" \"Any scheme that would make your office less of a fire trap has my approval.\" \"Office? I thought that space across the hall was just a filing room.\" \"Well, at this point we might as well re-label it as such.\" Dex smiled and shrugged at that, the motion half bashful, half amused. \"Anyway, what's your idea?\" \"It's nothing major. Just a screen where you could view and edit different papers. Like a typewriter, but without actual paper. There'd have to be some way to share your work – some way for one person to make a document and get it to someone else without any paper paper coming into play – but that can't be too different from what we do already with telephones and radar. Like...telephone calls for your eyes.\" \"Telephone calls...for your eyes?\" \"Something like that.\" Dex was frowning, his gaze trained on the wall beyond Joe's shoulder. \"Only...it's not permanent. Like a conversation, that's permanent. You can't take it back. But if you type something out, you can throw it away before you send it. Or erase it, if it's on a screen. Is that the right word, though, if there's no eraser...?\" Joe leaned back in his chair and listened. The cinnamon of Dex's eyes was darker now than it had been. Toasted, maybe, by the heat of his intellect. Joe didn't generally think of himself as the poetic sort, but he liked that line. He liked this, too, this moment, this setting, this genial schedule they'd fallen into so many years ago. Last Friday, when Dex had still been missing, had been hell. They were supposed to be together on Friday nights. Fridays were theirs, theirs to spend indulging their own bad habits and cheerfully tolerating each other's. Joe needed their little tradition, and the thought of it ending had brought tears to his eyes more than once. It was alright, though, now. Half a jar of peanut butter was gone, and soon half a bottle of Scotch would be, too. The former was in Dex's stomach already, and the majority of the latter would find itself in Joe's within the next hour. Happy days were here again. Never happier, in fact. All the world saving in, well, the world had yet to make Joe feel quite the level of joy that came over him during these quiet evenings. What Dex was doing now, voicing his stream of consciousness, was the single most intimate activity that Joe had ever been a party to. Sex was delightful, of course, particularly when the woman in question was skilled or attractive or – better still – both at the same time. But not even the most daring of his bedroom partners had ever bared themselves to him as completely as Dex did every Friday. In truth, Joe knew why everyone else thought of Dex as a serious man. Dex hadn't poked fun at his Mayflower and Massachusetts Bay roots earlier just for fun. Reserve and self-reliance were deep-seated in the Dearborn line, and he possessed both traits in abundance. Had his mother's mother not been a wry Shropshire-born debutante capable of finding humor even in her noble father's penury, the portrait of Dex currently hanging in his family's antique mansion might well have been as dour as all those beside it. As it was, his upbringing and his youthful precociousness had conditioned him to stay silent until he was sure of both what he had to say and the social acceptability of sharing it. This was why one-sided conversations like the one going on about the document screen were so precious to Joe. They revealed the rivers of thought that fed the sea of Dex's genius, and that was a topography that none but the most trusted could ever hope to have a glimpse of. \"...Anyway, it's an idea. And something like that would make a flying desk almost realistic. Almost .\" \"Hmm.\" Joe met the frank gaze that had come back out of the ether to connect with his own. \"Well, this screen of yours sounds completely impossible. Which means that when you inevitably do build it, it will be incredible.\" He tipped his glass in Dex's direction, a miniature salute of recognition. \"I can't wait to see it.\" Then, bringing the whisky to his lips, he drank. Funny – he thought he'd poured himself a double, too, but there wasn't much left to down. A refill was in order. \"Another?\" he offered Dex first. \"Nah. I'm good. But thanks.\" \"Suit yourself.\" He'd known that would be the answer. Add sobriety to Dex's list of laudable family traits. Jealousy flashed through him. No, that wouldn't do. Drown the bastard emotion, and pour out another measure in case it reared its head again. \"...You know you're halfway?\" \"What?\" Surely not. And yet, sure enough. \"Damn.\" How had that happened? He must have been refreshing his glass unconsciously while he was watching the fractals of Dex's mind unfold before him. Dex stood up, covering a yawn with one hand. Joe glanced at his watch. Midnight had come at some point, stealing up without him knowing it. \"C'mon, Cap,\" Dex said. \"Bed time for both of us.\" \"Your English is coming out,\" Joe remarked as he gained his feet unsteadily. When Dex blinked at him, he went on. \"Imperious.\" \"Oh.\" That same sad inflection as earlier, but this time there was no grin to mark it as a ruse. \"Well, you know. Old family habits die hard.\" Joe couldn't keep his eyes from sliding, just for a moment, to the bottle still sitting atop his blotter. \"...Right.\" To cover for his brief distraction, he waved a hand towards the door. \"Lead on.\" They crossed the dark, robot-pitted flight line without speaking further. When they'd climbed the barracks stairs to their respective quarters, which like their offices were located directly across the hall from one another, Dex gave him a tiny smile. \"Night, Cap.\" Nightcap. That did sound good. Except... \"Dex. Wait.\" Dex paused. \"...You had too much.\" \"It was the same amount as always.\" Joe could hear a whine rising in his own voice. He hated it, hated it like he hated the demons that were suddenly crawling out from the crevices of his psyche. But he couldn't do anything about either enemy. \"It was less, actually. I don't usually have a double. But you still had too much.\" \"Don't say that.\" If he'd really had too much, then that meant that he oughtn't want another round the way he did. So badly. \"It's...not the whisky.\" \"It's not just the whisky, you mean.\" \"...Yes.\" It was other things, just like always, too many other things, and now this new thing on top of it. \"Dex...\" A warm hand, soft in spite of its calluses and work-toned muscle, closed around his wrist. \"Okay. Relax. Let's get out of the hallway, for starters.\" Out of the hallway. So practical , so conscious of how things might look to others who didn't, couldn't, understand. The door of Joe's room shut behind them. \"Dex?\" \"Hush.\" A nudge started him in the direction of the bed. \"Lay down.\" \"You're not...I mean-?\" He couldn't leave. If he left, even to just across the hall, Joe would lose it. He knew he would. Ever since he and Polly had walked through Dex's smashed-up workshop – god, there'd been blood on the floor, how had he forgotten about wanting to puke when he saw that? – he'd felt the old helplessness, hopelessness, hovering in the background. But it should have gone now, should have gone as soon as he had Dex back. It should have gone, but it hadn't. And he'd had no idea until just now how close he was to giving in to despair. \"I'm not going anywhere, Cap.\" Dex was in front of him again, his tie already missing, his cuffs unbuttoned. The cinnamon was toasted again, but this time it had gone too far. Black around the edges, black with anger. Comforting, though, because Joe knew that the anger wasn't directed at him. Old foes: Totenkopf, Franco, all of Japan. \"You remember?\" Remember? He remembered everything. Nanjing. Manchuria. No; don't stop there. After . Remember after. When things had been better. When Dex had been beside him, just like now. Manchuria, like Totenkopf, was past. This was the after. So long as Dex was here, he thought he could hold onto that fact. \"...Yes.\" \"Okay. Then lay down.\" Joe stripped slowly to t-shirt, boxers, and socks. Familiar rustling told him that Dex was doing the same thing on the far side of the bed. When they were both under the covers, Dex turned off the lamp on his side and plunged them into darkness. A whimper was ready behind Joe's lips. Before it could more than half escape, though, the fingers that had killed the light were on his wrist once more. \"Dex?\" \"Right here. And not going anywhere.\" \"...Dex?\" \"Mm-hmm?\" Half asleep already. Joe felt guilty, but he needed to talk. \"It's Friday.\" \"Saturday, now, but...close enough.\" \"It's not supposed to be like this.\" \"What do you mean?\" Dex's confusion was understandable. There had been plenty of Friday nights, plenty of every nights, just like this, after Nanjing. But that didn't excuse things in Joe's mind. \"This wasn't supposed to happen again,\" he ground out. \"I would have preferred it that way, too, Cap. But it is what it is. It's not your fault.\" \"But Fridays are ours , damn it!\" No room for the demons. Not tonight, of all nights. God, how they pissed him off. \"That hasn't changed. They're still ours. This is just an unusual one. In a way, that's a good thing. It means that this isn't par for the course anymore.\" He couldn't argue with that, so he stared towards the ceiling and combed through emotions instead. Dex's breathing was deepening back towards slumber when Joe spoke. \"If you hadn't been here-\" \"Stop.\" A gentle order, but firm, knowing, certain. \"Don't go there. You know it won't help.\" \"I have to say it.\" \"Cap-\" \"Dex, if you hadn't been here tonight – if you hadn't been there, on that island, and alive, and sound – the world wouldn't have been worth saving.\" The fingers on his arm stiffened. \"Listen, I'm sorry if that bothers your Puritan sensibilities, but...I had to say it.\" Silence drew out. Then the darkness in front of Joe's eyes – not, thank goodness, the one that lurked behind them – laughed. \"...Dex?\" The laugh came again. Relief, amusement, catharsis; there were a thousand sentiments in the sound, but Joe could only parse out the most obvious. A weight materialized on his shoulder as Dex pillowed his head there. \"My 'Puritan sensibilities',\" he said quietly, \"don't apply when you're involved. I thought you would have figured that out by now.\" \"Well, I don't have your brain for figuring things out with.\" \"You do have my brain. It's just not inside your head.\" \"I'm not so sure about that, sometimes, Dex. That you aren't in my head all the time.\" Like earlier, when Dex had just known what was needed. They hadn't shared a bed like this is nearly two years, and yet here they were, without the need ever being spoken out loud. \"I still thought it was pretty obvious.\" \"...Maybe it is. I don't know. Anyway...I meant what I said.\" He pulled his wrist free, then took Dex's fingers into his own and held them tightly. \"There wouldn't have been a point to any of it, if you'd been-\" Blood, blood on the floor. So much, so fresh. Someone else's, he knew now, but then there'd been no telling. \"You know.\" \"Yeah. I know. And now you know.\" \"Know what?\" \"How I felt. Before. And for a lot longer, Cap.\" Dex's voice had gone husky. \"For a hell of a lot longer.\" Ah. Yes. Always Nanjing. Always Manchuria. Some things were inescapable. Joe couldn't even be upset about the implication that Dex's worries over all those long, desperate weeks in China had been greater than his own, more recently banished fears. If it had taken six months to track down Totenkopf, could Joe even have done it? He doubted it. He liked to think that he would have held on to sanity so long as the search was active, but he knew himself too well to really believe it. Not when it might still have been Dex's blood on the floor. \"...Dex?\" \"Mm?\" \"You know you're incredible.\" \"That's what everyone else says.\" There'd been disappointment in his tone. \"You don't like it?\" \"It's alright coming from them. They don't know me.\" A sigh ghosted along Joe's throat. \"I guess I just expected something better from you.\" \"You didn't earlier, with the cliché. You said I couldn't improve on that.\" \"I'm not a cliché.\" No. He wasn't. People made him out to be, but they were wrong. \"Fine. You're amiable enough, but you hide your real emotions so thoroughly that you come off as work-obsessed and a little cold. You have a demanding streak. Nothing's ever completely done for you – you're always going back, tearing things down, rebuilding them. You eat entirely too much sugar. And you can't take a compliment when it's really meant. Is that better?\" \"...Yes,\" Dex whispered. \"It is.\" \"But why ?\" Joe's own flaws were obvious to anyone who'd known him for five minutes. He couldn't fathom why Dex, so seemingly perfect, would want to have faults assigned to him. \"Because it means you really see me. You see me, and you accept me for who I am. I'm not an example to you. I don't fall under one label, 'boss' or 'genius' or things like that. I'm just a person, with problems and pet peeves and quirks that aren't cute. With you I'm allowed to be that way. To be myself. And I need that, Joe. Because I've never felt that I could just be a person, just be my real self, with anyone else.\" Joe closed his eyes against sudden dampness. \"I still think you're incredible. An incredible person.\" \"You're pretty incredible yourself, Cap. At least, I've always thought so.\" \"I'll accept that, since it's you saying it.\" A wicked smile curved Joe's lips. \"And since I'm actually capable of taking a compliment.\" Dex laughed. \"Oh, that's nice.\" \"I thought you wanted me to admit your shortcomings?\" Teasing. It was Friday night, and they were back to teasing. Full circle. What demons? \"I do. But I had to say something, you know. Even if it wasn't very good.\" \"Yes,\" Joe chuckled. \"I know.\" A long minute passed. \"We are an odd pair,\" he remarked eventually. \"Polly said that. I about let her have a piece of my mind for it, but...\" But she'd been right. Dex slid a little closer. God, he was warm. How did the world not see all the heat that was constantly being generated, restrained, and recycled behind that cool workday exterior? \"Like peanut butter,\" he murmured. Half asleep again, now that the moment of crisis had passed. \"Peanut butter and whisky.\" Joe's smile softened. \"Well, I can certainly see why Thanksgiving caught on.\" There was no answer. \"...Dex?\" Out like a light, his head still atop Joe's shoulder, their fingers entwined. Joe wondered what shade of cinnamon had been present in the instant before Dex had fallen asleep. Too late to find out. But he could live with that, he thought as his own eyes closed, at least for now. Next Friday would be soon enough for such questions. ","Summary":" Dex sat hunched over on the sofa, a thin paperback in his hands and absorption writ large on his fa"},{"Movie":"Sky Captain and the World of Tomor...","Title":"Eclipse","Author":"paganpunk2","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8024597","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Dex had been waiting for this night for weeks. Flipping on the radio as he hurriedly changed into civvies and grabbed a few supplies in his quarters, he kept his ear cocked to the weather report. A chill raced down his spine as the announcer informed him that the skies were completely clear. Perfect , he thought giddily. Shoving his blankets and an extra sweater into a bag, he swung it over his shoulder and headed towards the motor pool. Dusk was falling; the faint light of a star in the east made him quicken his step. His eclipse viewing spot was a half hour away, and the main event was supposed to begin shortly after full dark. Don't want to miss this, he urged himself on faster. It's going to be amazing. The motor pool was entirely empty, and Dex frowned. Usually this particular building was humming until late at night as men hung around talking after hours or worked on personal vehicles. Tonight, though, the place was abandoned. Maybe I actually managed to interest a few of the others in seeing the eclipse tonight, and they've all gone to watch it, he reasoned. It seemed a little unlikely - no one had reacted when he'd mentioned it that afternoon - but perhaps it had piqued their interest more than he'd thought. Shrugging off his discomfort at the unusual silence, he made his way to the key box on the far wall and selected the set for a car he knew could make it up rough back roads. Walking briskly towards his transportation, he finally spotted someone. \"Hi, Cap,\" he greeted the figure leaning against the car. \"What's up?\" Please, please don't have something that has to be done tonight, he begged wordlessly. I won't be able to say no, and I've been waiting for this night for weeks. His agitation must have shown, because Joe grinned. \"Don't worry, no last minute chores,\" he said. \"I was looking for you, though, and someone said you'd end up here before dark. I thought I'd see if they were right.\" \"You were looking for me? Why, is something up?\" \"What are you doing tonight?\" Another grin. The tone of the words was casual, non committal, but they sent shivers through Dex's entire body. The huge bay they stood in suddenly seemed too warm. \"I, uh…well, there's an eclipse. I was going to go check that out.\" \"Not in town, with all those drunken idiots?\" A look of concern crossed Sky Captain's face. \"No. I know a spot outside of town, where there won't be anyone.\" \"Is that where you're going now?\" \"Yes. Unless you need something?\" Something must need done, or he wouldn't have stood down here for who knew how long waiting for him to show up. Surely the illustrious Sky Captain had somewhere better to be. Joe looked down at the ground, suddenly feeling like an intruder, but asked his question anyway. \"May I come with you?\" Dex was confused. \"Don't you have a date with Polly?\" \"She cancelled, and it's too quiet around here, so I thought I would see what you were up to. I would go for a ride, but I know how much you hate it when I fly in the dark.\" \"Never stopped you before,\" Dex mumbled, opening the rear door of the car to load his things. \"Sure, hop in. I don't mind company.\" He really didn't mind, provided it was Joe. It wasn't like they'd had any chances to just go out and do something together in the six months since Totenkopf, so tonight would be a nice break. \"Do you know where everyone is?\" he asked as they crossed the bridge and turned onto a narrow paved road that skirted the water. \"I didn't see anyone on my way over to get the car.\" \"It's Friday,\" Joe answered, looking at him quizzically. Oh, right. It is Friday . The one day of the week when no one except Dex hung around base any longer than necessary. Even the men who lived in the barracks left for the evening on Fridays. No wonder there was no one around , he thought, shaking his head. How did I lose track of what day it was like that? At this rate, he was lucky to have remembered the eclipse. \"Oh, right,\" he said finally, trying to sound like he'd already known as much. \"You've been working too hard,\" Joe said flatly. Dex opened his mouth to retort, then closed it without speaking, not wanting to mar their rare evening together with an argument. There was a long silence before either man spoke again. \"Where are we going, in any case?\" \"There's a place I know up here in the hills. It used to be an old hunting camp or something, but no one uses it anymore, so sometimes I come out and look at the stars. There's a stand, about twenty feet tall, in the middle of a big field. The view from the top is great. I hope it's still up,\" he added. \"I haven't checked it all summer, we've been so busy rebuilding. Sometimes it falls down, after big storms or over the winter, and I have to rebuild it. I meant to come up last weekend and make sure it was ready for tonight, but there wasn't time.\" \"This tower doesn't sound very stable to be climbing around on,\" Joe commented, frowning at him. \"Does anyone else know where this place is?\" \"Not that I know of, Cap. I've never brought anyone else up here.\" \"Dex,\" Joe said as they stopped at a weed-ridden crossroads. \"Don't go up that thing anymore unless someone knows you're out here. It can't be safe, if it falls down so often.\" Shrugging, Dex turned the car onto gravel. \"Whatever you say, Cap,\" he agreed, then fell silent once more. The air went wordless again, and Joe felt guilty about being the cause of the quiet. How could he express his feelings for the man beside him any way besides being over protective, though? He simply didn't know what else to do. Even if what he wanted so badly hadn't been utterly illegal, he was certain that Dex wouldn't agree to it, couldn't possibly feel the same way. How could he? he wondered as they hit a particularly deep pothole. He sees me with women all the time. If I told him I wanted him, not them, he'd probably think I was playing some nasty joke on him. Damn it… The trees narrowed as they went on, reducing the lane to a rutted track, and soon branches began to tap on the windows on both sides. Joe was about to say something about scratching the paint when Dex wrenched the car onto a hidden road. This route was slightly wider but bumpier by far, and their teeth chattered over the rocks. A quarter mile after the turn, the only sign of humanity was a set of faint tire tracks that led off into a meadow tall with late-fall grass. Dex stopped the car and shut off the engine. \"Is this it?\" Joe asked. \"Yup.\" Climbing out, he headed into the brush, and Joe had to hurry to catch up. In short order they found the tower, lying morosely in the dry yellow foliage with one leg of its tripod form broken. \"Ah, crud. I don't have time to fix it.\" It was nearly full dark now, and the bright moon was rising, well on its way to a rendezvous with the shadow of the Earth. \"We can't lay on the ground, we'll freeze. I guess the hood of the car will have to do. At least we'll get some residual engine heat.\" As they spread the blankets across the car hood, Joe realized that he was glad the platform had been too broken to fix tonight. He'd shivered looking at it, realizing that Dex had spent nights up here by himself on the fragile-looking structure with absolutely no one knowing where he was. What was left of the thing looked like a breath of wind would blow it end over end across the field. If that had collapsed while he was on it, I would never have known where to look. He might have lain out here for days before anyone found him. He tried to shake the image of an injured Dex stranded in this forgotten field with no food, water, or blankets from his mind, but it clung eagerly to his psyche, digging in with sharp claws that made his stomach ache in fear. They retreated beneath the blankets as the air grew chill, tossing the occasional comment back and forth as they watched the moon climb. \"How well do you know them? The stars, I mean?\" Joe asked eventually. Dex laughed shortly. \"Didn't you ever wonder why I spend so much time working on plans for planes that could go a lot higher than they need to?\" \"Well, yes, I did at first. But I can see how they could be useful for reconnaissance, so I never really questioned it.\" \"I guess they could be used for that, with the right cameras, but that's not why I work on them so much.\" \"Well, why then?\" He sighed heavily. \"When I was a kid, I always thought the neatest thing in the world would be to be able to walk on the moon. You know, see what it was like. To be able to touch it, to look down and see the earth, not like from a plane, but against the backdrop of space. So you could realize just how tiny we really are, in the grand scale of things. That's why I work on them; I guess I've never really given up on that dream. Even though the odds are extremely slim that a person will walk on the moon in our lifetime, it's nice to go to bed feeling like maybe I've pushed humanity a little bit closer to that goal. That someday, someone will get to go there, will get to see everything from there. Maybe they'll come back a slightly better person because of it, even. It's kind of a silly thing to aim for, but…\" he shrugged beneath the blanket, \"I like to think it'll happen someday.\" Joe stared at him in the dark, feeling stupid for not guessing that some grand scheme was behind it. There was a grand scheme behind everything Dex did, he was sure – he had often thought during the past six months of asking whether Dex had had a premonition of how useful the metal-melting gun would be to them, certain that it had to be more than just coincidence - but at the same time he couldn't berate himself for not seeing the bigger picture. After all, when had Dex ever intimated that he even noticed there was a moon, until tonight? \"I never would have guessed that,\" he said finally. \"And I don't think it sounds silly.\" \"Well, you know me. It's a weird dream, but I'm a little queer in some ways, so it's not so far out there.\" Joe froze. Does that mean what I think it does? It could have just been a slip of the tongue. He swallowed at the thought. Slippery. Tongue. Dex… God, I hope you meant to say that the way you did. The ride back is going to be very, very painful otherwise. \"It's starting,\" Dex said suddenly. A note of breathless excitement had crept into his voice, and Joe could barely stifle the moan of desperate passion that the tone excited in him. Trying to distract himself from how uncomfortable his pants were becoming, he stared up at the vanishing moon. They watched the darkness eat the moon, piece by piece. When the last sliver of light disappeared, the world seemed to freeze. Everything stopped moving…except that Joe realized that Dex was shivering under the blanket next to him. Examining the way his eyes were riveted to the spot where the moon had been a moment before, the set of his jaw, and the way the faint starlight played across the delicate features he'd fallen so hard for, he simply could not be silent another moment. \"Dex?\" he said quietly, watching him. \"Hmm?\" \"I'm going to tell you a secret.\" \"Okay.\" His gaze didn't waver from the sky. \"Polly didn't cancel our date tonight.\" A look of consternation crossing his face, Dex turned to him. \"But then what-\" \"I cancelled on her.\" He paused. \"Permanently.\" Dex gaped at him for a moment, understanding dawning in his eyes. \"What are you telling me?\" he whispered, shivering harder. Joe wasn't sure if it was from shock or because the temperature was dropping further under the moonless night. He wanted to make the motion stop in any case, wanted to sweep him into his arms, warm him up, cradle him until they both fell into dreamless, contented slumber. Smiling softly, Joe pulled him close, enveloping him in heat. \"I'm telling you that I love you,\" he whispered. A second passed without movement, and for an instant Sky Captain began to think he'd made an awful, irrevocable mistake. Then Dex's lips rushed to meet his and they kissed hungrily, both trying to sate the hunger they had lived with for much too long. At the exact moment when they finally pulled breathlessly apart, a thin line of light reappeared around the shadow. \"I love you, too,\" Dex whispered back, stealing another kiss. \"It's Friday night,\" Joe reminded him. \"Yeah. So what?\" \"So the base is deserted. Including the barracks.\" Their mouths met again. \"Can you get us back quickly? I don't want our first time to be in a back seat. That's so cliché, and you deserve better.\" \"I can get us back quick.\" They were already sliding off the car, grabbing blankets and throwing them haphazardly inside, taking full advantage of every opportunity to touch one another as they did so. Dex drove back as fast as was safe, steering with only one hand because the fingers of the other were wrapped into Joe's. They parked in the motor pool and separated, just in case there was someone who hadn't felt the call of the city on a Friday night who might find the sight of the pair walking towards the barracks holding hands questionable. Joe waited impatiently in his quarters and practically tore the door off of its hinges when the expected knock came. The instant it was closed and locked behind them Dex found himself pressed against it, warm hands speedily disrobing him. \"Joe…\" \"Mmm…my God, Dex, how do you taste so good?\" Sky Captain moaned against his throat. \"I cannot get enough of you, do you know that?\" \"I'm starting to get the idea, Cap…\" Fingers brushed his crotch. \"Bed,\" he gasped. \"Hurry.\" Feeling Dex's legs wrap around him, Joe swung about and carried him easily to the poorly made up four-poster. Nails trailed down his back as he walked, making his knees weak. \"This is going to end much too soon for both of us,\" he lamented as he laid his partner down and licked a path from navel to neck, detouring for the briefest of moments because he simply couldn't ignore the taut nipples that begged to be sucked. Slender, skilled digits wrapped around his cock and squeezed gratefully, driving him so close to the edge of release that he had to pull away. \"I don't think there's time to prepare you,\" he managed between clenched teeth. \"We could just-\" \"No,\" Dex interrupted him, the determination in his voice forcing Sky Captain to look up at him. \"Take me, Joe. Now.\" His voice trembled slightly as he repositioned his legs. \"I like it rough.\" The pilot let out a low, keening wail. Where had this glowing, tousled, and painfully sexy version of his chief engineer been hiding for so long? Hearing the normally calm and laid-back man beneath him practically demand to be taken in a fashion that was borderline to rape sent a shot of lust through him like he had never imagined, and without waiting for so much as another blink to pass he shoved himself forward and in. It took a couple of thrusts for him to be ensconced fully – despite the fact that Dex was clearly not new to this, he was almost obscenely tight – but his graceless entry didn't seem to bother the other man. After a cry of mixed pain and pleasure that made Joe both quail and delight, his partner settled into a series of tiny gasping moans that made the speed with which he was approaching orgasm quite clear. This must be how angels sound, the pilot thought deliriously as he gripped the hard member rubbing against his stomach. The engineer's eyes fluttered with each stroke, teeth sunk into his lower lip, until Sky Captain pushed into him with a massive groan and a flood of warm liquid. The shot was perfectly timed, perfectly aimed, and as it hit a sensitive spot deep inside of him Dex, too, came. For what felt like an eternity Joe couldn't stand to pull out. He held himself up on shaking arms, feeling his pulse pounding in his softening cock, it's rhythm backed up by a more distant throbbing that he suspected was his lover's heartbeat. Finally he summoned the strength to pull back and slowly extracted himself, keeping his eyes closed because he knew there was blood. Letting himself down onto the bed, he pulled Dex close against him, smiling as the other man pulled the blankets over both of them and rested his head against his shoulder. \"I adore you,\" he whispered. \"I know. I love you too,\" the engineer replied. He trailed a hand across Sky Captain's stomach, stopping with a grimace when he felt the still-warm stickiness that he himself had deposited there. \"I'll get a rag,\" he said quietly, kissing his neck before rising and heading for the bathroom that let off of one side of the room. Letting the water run until it steamed, he wiped himself off, searching in the medicine cabinet for something to coat his ravaged passage with. Depositing a liberal dollop of antibacterial ointment on his fingers, he slipped them into himself with a wince and wiped the medicine as far up as he could reach. There. No more bleeding, no infection, no questions. The cloth was still warm when he cleaned Joe with it, using gentle swipes that had the man groaning again before he was half done. Lobbing it carelessly toward the laundry hamper, Dex slipped back beneath the covers and was immediately enveloped in arms and legs. \"Don't you ever leave me,\" Joe whispered, squeezing him tight with a desperation that he didn't have to speak aloud for Dex to fathom. \"I would die without you.\" \"Don't talk like that. You know I'm not going anywhere, at least not by choice.\" \"I thought I'd lost you, do you know that?\" \"Totenkopf?\" \"Yes.\" \"I know.\" He kissed the skin beneath him reassuringly. \"I'm right here now, though. And we're fine. We're more than fine. We're golden.\" \"Golden…you're worth more than gold to me, Dex…\" The engineer smiled hearing the tired notes in the pilot's voice. \"Go to sleep, Cap. I'm not going anywhere.\" It wasn't a lie; it would take something on par with another robot attack to make him crawl out of bed right now, and even then he would complain mightily. They'd been keeping their love in the dark from one another for too long, and now that the eclipse had finally ended Dex had no intention of letting a single moment of light slip away. Settling himself more comfortably against his partner's shoulder, he sighed and let his eyes slip shut, content in the cocoon of blankets and musk they had made together.

To his surprise, the cabin Dex's parents had left him some years earlier had proven to be modern enough to meet his rather stringent requirements for camping. In spite of the other man's almost perverse love of hiking, the vacation had turned out to actually be relaxing. They'd needed a break after months spent rebuilding the base, and his genius engineer had come through brilliantly. Not even Polly had dared the rough landing or the long horseback ride required to get up here and bother them, a fact for which the pilot was exceedingly grateful. He leaned now against the porch railing, staring over the treetops at the termination dust that had marked this section of the Rockies a few nights earlier. No wonder he likes it so much out here, he thought for the millionth time. It's breathtakingly gorgeous. \"I told you you'd like it,\" Dex commented as he came up beside him. \"You were right. You always are.\" \"Mm. Sometimes. I'm glad I was this time, maybe I'll actually be able to convince you to come back again.\" \"I can't imagine turning down an invitation. Especially now that I've seen how miserable the landing approach is. I don't want you coming out here alone, not with that strip of garbage for a runway.\" \"Hey, I'm a competent pilot. I've been here plenty of times without you, you know.\" \"I'm well aware of the fact that you can fly, Dex. The point is that if you crashed, there wouldn't be anyone to help you. The odds are that no one would even realize anything was wrong until you didn't show up at base two weeks later.\" \"I have an emergency radio, Cap.\" \"Yes, in the cabin. A mile away from the airstrip. What will you do, crawl here on all fours?\" Why do I do this? He wondered to himself with an internal sigh. Berating him for coming to a familial haunt isn't going to make him realize I'm in love with him, it's just going to piss him off. Damn it, though, I don't know how else to say it without coming off as incredibly creepy. It's not like I can just blurt out that I want him, where the hell would that leave us? \"You're assuming an awful lot,\" Dex interrupted his thoughts. \"What if I ended up with just a broken arm or something? I mean, it wouldn't be a fun walk, but I don't think I'd need to crawl.\" \"Again, not the point. I don't like the idea of you being up here by yourself. It's too…\" \"Soothing? Peaceful? Introspective?\" Dex suggested teasingly, throwing adjectives that the other man had used to describe the area back at him. \"It's too dangerous,\" Joe finished, shooting him a look. \"There's getting here, there are bears and snakes, there are those sketchy lanterns inside – I still can't believe we haven't been blown up trying to light those things – there are too many things that could go very wrong. What if you fell while you were out hiking? What if there was a freak snowstorm? What if-\" \"I thought you liked it here,\" the engineer interrupted, sounding a little miffed. \"You haven't been worried about all those things all week long, have you?\" \"No, because I've been here with you. If something had happened to either of us, there would have been help available.\" \"So what, you aren't going to let me come here anymore because you think it's too risky?\" He straightened, crossing his arms defiantly. \"Because that's not going to go over very well, I've got to tell you.\" \"Come here all you like, Dex, it's your cabin,\" Joe said gently. \"But do me a little favor and always bring someone with you who can handle a crisis. All right? Knowing you won't be here alone will let me sleep nights.\" The shorter man smiled at that, shaking his head slightly before leaning against the rail beside him. \"You know something, Cap?\" \"What is it?\" \"It's kind of cute when you get all protective. You're like a mother bear.\" \"Just doing my job.\" \"Oh, really?\" Dex met his eyes knowingly, raising one eyebrow. Joe had been acting oddly ever since the whole Totenkopf incident, and it hadn't escaped his notice. He goes out with Polly, but he checks on me every night after he gets back. He never did that before. I've asked him out here a million times, and he's always had something else on his plate; this time, he cancelled on other people to come with me. He's done nothing but go along with things and compliment me and give me weird looks all week. If he really does feel the same way about me that I do about him, I wish he'd just spit it out so we can do something about it before we leave. \"Just doing your job, huh?\" Sky Captain watched him for a moment, then sighed and looked back towards the snow-capped peaks. \"Maybe not just that,\" he admitted quietly. He was secretly triumphant, but he knew better than to continue pushing the issue. When Joe wanted to say more about it, he would, and that was fine. It was best to let the issue rest for now. \"Just don't start carrying me around by the back of my neck with your teeth,\" he joked easily, bumping into him slightly with one shoulder. \"That would hurt.\" \"Oh, God, I can see the headline now,\" Joe moaned. \"Do I really have to go back to that wretched woman tomorrow?\" \"We have to go back to work tomorrow, but that doesn't mean you have to go back to Polly,\" Dex shrugged quietly. \"That's entirely up to you.\" He took a deep breath of the cool mountain air, holding it in his lungs for a minute before releasing it slowly and turning away. There, I said something to encourage him. Maybe that will coax it out of him. \"Either way,\" he went on, \"you can eat at least one last dinner in peace. I know they don't serve elk at those trendy restaurants she likes, so you should probably enjoy it while you've got it.\" Flashing another quick grin from the doorway, he vanished inside. \"Mmm…\" Joe sighed, rubbing his hand idly over the spot where his engineer had nudged him. A whiff of the promised meal made his mouth water. Polly can't cook to save her life. Every single thing we've had since we got here has been phenomenal, and he looks so damn good with that tan…does he already know what I want to say? Why else would he have told me I don't have to go back to Polly? I don't want Polly, I want Dex. I just…I have to have him. \"Oh, bloody hell,\" he whispered, closing his eyes. \"I'm in trouble.\" ","Summary":" Joe had to admit that it had been a good week.

She's just in it for the story. I thought she wanted something else, but…\" the pilot shrugged a little morosely. \"Nothing's happened for two months now, action-speaking, and she seems bored. I can't help but think the two are connected.\" Snap…snap…pop. \"Do you want something else with her?\" the engineer queried finally. Sky Captain let his hand hang off the back of the chair he sat in. \"I don't bloody know , Dex,\" he moaned. \"I should love her, I really should, the whole world expects it, but…\" \"But she annoys the hell out of you.\" He smiled hearing the other man utter a curse. \"Yes, she does. Constantly. Is that odd? Does she annoy you, too?\" \"I don't really see her enough for it to get to me,\" he answered moderately. \"De-ex…\" He spun the chair around with one foot so that his still-dangling head faced the paper-laden table and gave the other man a knowing look. \"Yeah, okay, she's pretty ridiculous.\" \"Thank god you agree,\" Joe sighed, standing so suddenly that Dex glanced up at him. \"If she bothers you, quite possibly the nicest person on the planet, then I don't have to feel bad about her bothering me.\" \"Nice people generally don't spend their afternoons building things designed to kill people,\" he pointed out as the pencil in his hand traced a neat row of digits. \"You're an exception to the rule, then. What is this, anyway?\" he inquired as he drew nearer and studied the complicated lines on the page. \"It's a jet engine. Frank Whittle – he's research and development for the RAF, we worked on the Manta project together – came up with it about ten years ago. He's got a working prototype in his lab, but he's not very happy with it. He asked me to look at it and see if I had any suggestions.\" \"Is it any good?\" \"It's amazing. I'm putting a pair on your plane as soon as I figure out how to make them stop exploding.\" \"…Exploding?\" \"I'll give it plenty of test time first, Cap. You know that.\" \"Just making sure you aren't planning your revenge, that's all,\" he joked, plopping back down into his seat. His jovial tone didn't match his mood; his engineer had been acting oddly for weeks now, seemingly finding excuses to be near him but then giving off an aura of mere toleration at his presence. His determination to figure out what was going on in the other man's head, coupled with his recently renewed distaste for a certain reporter, was what had driven him into this back corner of the hangar. He had to know what was going on, and he knew the best way to do it was to keep talking until he could decipher the problem. \"Revenge for what?\" Dex asked, arching an eyebrow. \"Polly, of course.\" \"Oh, that.\" He laughed shortly. \"You had to chase her. It would have looked weird for you not to, after the way she presented the Totenkopf thing. Besides, I was busy here.\" \"Busy here…\" Joe mused at the offhand way Dex had said those words. \"You did all of the work practically. I barely raised a finger, did I? You pulled everything back together, corralled the men, juggled the expenses, fielded phone calls. When did you sleep?\" Now that he thought about it, the other man seemed to have pulled off a miracle in rebuilding the base as quickly as he had. \"I mostly didn't,\" the engineer admitted. \"But it was kind of fun, you know, getting to watch all the new buildings go up.\" \"I should have been here more to help. It's not fair that it all got dropped on you. You don't even get the credit for it, at least not in the wider world.\" \"I don't mind, Cap. Everything's running like it should be again, and I'm working on new projects. You know that's all I need.\" \" All you need, Dex?\" Sky Captain asked in a low voice that left nothing to question. He glanced up and around, making sure no one had come into earshot during the last few minutes. \"I have you. That's all I really need. The rest can fall into the ocean for all I care.\" He tapped the blueprint with the eraser of his pencil. \"All this other stuff…they're just perks.\" \"And you're really not jealous about Polly?\" There was a note of wonder in his voice. \"I thought you might be.\" \"I know you, Joe,\" Dex said seriously, meeting his eyes. \"You're attracted to her because she pushes back from time to time. You respect her because she's very, very good at what she does. But that's all there is. You'll never stay with her long-term because she doesn't really make you happy.\" \"You make me happy, Dex.\" \"I try,\" he shrugged. \"You succeed. Constantly.\" Leaving his chair once more, Sky Captain strode the few steps back to the other man's side and stared over his shoulder. \"How fast do you think it goes?\" \"Mmm…this engine has a lot of potential.\" \"How much potential?\" The engineer straightened, shook out his writing-cramped hand, and glanced around conspiratorially once more. \"I think you'll be able to break the sound barrier with it, once I've made a few other modifications to your plane,\" he confided, his eyes gleaming with an eager light that had been missing of late. Joe gaped at him. \"You're joking,\" he accused quietly, his mission forgotten at this news. He leaned in until their shoulders brushed together, curious to hear more. \"Would I tease you like that?\" \"I know exactly how much of a tease you can be, thank you. But…the sound barrier? Seriously?\" \"Seriously, the sound barrier. Poof!\" He wiggled his fingers in a bad imitation of a magician making something vanish. \"Another conquest for the illustrious Sky Captain.\" \"Courtesy of the absolutely brilliant Dexter Dearborn,\" Joe murmured back, not having missed the dark sarcasm lurking between the other man's words. \"Not that anyone will pay attention to your part in the whole thing. You'll get swept under the rug again, like always. I loathe that, you know.\" \"I don't do this for fame, Joe. I hate the limelight, it makes me look jaundiced.\" The taller man smirked. \"Then why do you do it?\" \"You already know the answer to that,\" the engineer chastised gently, shifting around the table so that no one who might be observing could say they stood close by one another for too long. \"Maybe I just like to hear you say the words,\" the pilot pushed, his hands splaying over the blueprint as he bent towards him, his eyes insistent. \"I do it for you,\" Dex confessed shortly. \"Now back up before you get us in trouble.\" They stayed frozen for a moment, each giving the other a piercing stare, before Sky Captain resumed his full height. He watched his friend, his partner in everything that mattered, pick up where he'd left off. Only when a new column of figures became necessary did he speak again. \"I haven't had a chance to really give all the things I missed the last couple of months a thorough going over yet,\" he announced. \"I'm going to need your help with that.\" Snap, pop, and he finally looked up. \"Okay, Cap. Whatever you say.\" \"It could take some time. Can you clear your schedule?\" \"If you can clear yours, mine's as good as empty.\" The pilot flinched slightly. Dex could cancel his plans so easily for him because all of his plans were for Joe, so the only task left was to ascertain the order. Sky Captain suddenly felt how neglectful he'd been of late, and he couldn't help but lean back over the table to whisper his next words. \"A thorough going over, Dex,\" he hissed into his ear. \"It could take a very, very long time to complete, so I suggest you pencil me in indefinitely. Do you understand?\" \"I get it, Joe,\" he said a little exasperatedly. Balancing on the edge of uncertainty, he pushed just a little harder. \"…You don't mind, do you?\" The secret smile he gave only to Joe slipped across his lips as he considered all that a ' thorough going over' implied. His ire at the other man's recent absences slipped away more easily than he'd expected, and he shook his head, laughing a little. \"I don't mind, Cap,\" he answered, warmth creeping back into his voice. \"I don't mind at all.\" ","Summary":" \"So what's the problem?\" Dex asked without looking up from the line of figures stretching down th"},{"Movie":"Sky Captain and the World of Tomor...","Title":"The Remains of Today","Author":"Handful of Silence","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6755708","Passage":"[Chapter 1] AN/ Seeing how few fics there are in this otherwise wonderful little fandom, I thought I would add my own humble attempt to the pile. I have no idea whether this was meant to be slash or not, being quite undecided about it (but really Joe is better with anyone who isn't Polly =]), which probably wont last long, as I'm usually quick to slash canonical characters. So if you like Joe/Dex, you can read it that way, and if you don't, it can just be read as a post-film friendship fic. Summary: Tomorrow is another day, when things are to be patched up and rebuilt, but right now Dex and Joe can drink to how things could have turned out so differently. Friendship/Pre-slash The Remains of Today The hangar bay is still in the process of being rebuilt, and it shows. Most of the destroyed partitions of the building have been removed out of the way by many hands and labour, but that's really only the larger pieces, and the floor is littered with the debris that is left, what hasn't yet been picked up and cleared away; ashes and dust and smaller calamities in the overall disaster of broken tables and chairs, lamps thrown on their sides. The fire died down not long after it rose up, the rescue procedure going on with a smooth transition from workers and mechanics scrambling out of the collapsing frame of their operations base to the swift and efficient assembling of forces returning with the correct equipment to tackle the blaze. All without the presence of the Flying Legion's errant leader of Sky Captain – off saving the world from Totenkopf, the man who dared attack his base and steal his friends. But while he shot off to tackle the big important matters, the rest of the men on the ground were faced with trying to return to some semblance of order. To Dex, the place still looks as broken down as it had when he had been taken away. In the light of day, without the distraction of giant mecha and the whole place crashing down on him, the building looks smaller with so many people ferrying to and fro with personal errands to run; the fly-boys of the Flying Legion wingless and grounded to aid the efforts of the mechanics and technicians with clean-up. Dex isn't the most physically imposing of men, nor does he have great strength of muscle to be of much use to those who are gathering in groups to lift the large pieces of roof with their combined strength, but he diligently helps none the less in his own way; coordinates where the rubble should be taken, crawls into tight spaces constricted by fallen beams still not moved to reach power couplings that have been damaged. It takes a long time to fix all that has been knocked out by the assault, squirming and wriggling about in enclosed spaces and a fair bit of muttered cursing, so much dust and dirt clinging to his uniform that it comes off in drifts when he brushes it off with a distracted hand, but with a bit of jiggery-pokery and with the aid of having a certain mechanical-genius working on the issue, by the time the sky outside begins to darken, light has been partially restored to whatever the electrics are still connected. Some overhead lights have been knocked from their moorings, sent down to the ground for workmen to crush the glass of the broken bulb into powder underfoot, but it's as much as Dex could have hoped for. It's hard work, but Dex has always relished a challenge. So he works on well into the night, passing on orders to teams that have joined themselves for greater effectiveness instead of sparse individuals all trying to do each job by themselves. There are no clocks in the room for them to tell the time, but luckily Dex is still in possession of a working watch that he found into the rubble, slipping it onto his wrist. Maybe when they've got everything else sorted, he'll set about finding its owner, but for the moment he allows it to serve out a useful purpose. At ten, he calls a halt to the proceedings, taking in how the replacement structures to the roof have already been manoeuvred in place and the iron ridge of the roofing has already started to patch up the holes that have been left. He tells everyone to take a break, and he watches as some of them smile in relief at those words, lean back to stretch out ligaments in their back from the hours they've spent hunched over, and he congratulates them in his own quiet way that comes from not being a very good public speaker, ordering them with a reassuring expression to all to go home and to come back tomorrow. He knows if they work any longer, tiredness will begin to impede progress, that the work load will get to them if he pushes too hard. At the moment they're all doing well at focusing on the jobs that need done, taking each one as they come, not thinking and worrying about the shear amount to accomplish overall. Dex seems to be in command here, and although he isn't good at communicating as such, having little real authority in his voice. The rest of them probably only listen to him because he looks like he might know what's going on. It's Dex, they'll think, good boy Dex. He'll know what's happening. And although he has little experience in command, he had to learn fast in Totenkopf's Shangri-La; rallying together a number of tired and frightened scientists all well into their elder years, unwilling to try for escape or simply too scared to. It had been hard work convincing them all; he being in their eyes an impulsive and reckless yank with little experience due to his younger age, and it had taken a few days quietly conversing with each in turn (and considering between the eight of them; six spoke purely German, two French and the other two thankfully bilingual in English and German.) to convince them all that they could make it out of there. Some of that latent concern for others rather than himself has lingered even though he is out of danger, and in charge he finds himself worrying over the men he's working with, considering their emotional states and deciding it's something he needs to keep a weather eye on. They've all been through some roller-coaster in the last few days, and he imagines that a few of them will still be getting over the shock of their base nearly collapsing around them. They appear grateful at his gesture of sending them home, and they all trickle out of the building slowly with a thankful wave or acknowledgement in his direction; the family men first, eager to see their wives and children after such a long day, some technicians straying to finish what they've been doing before Dex's prompting has them also making their way out, shoulders slumped lower with the hours they've worked but smiling as they envisage the beds waiting at home for them. And Dexter Dearborn is left alone again to his own devices. He doesn't have a family to return to, and sees no need to finish up the day even when he's already sent everyone else home. It's just his way, the first one in at the beginning of the day, and the last to shut the lights off when the sun has long submitted to a pale risen moon. Popping a new piece of Double Bubble in his mouth, scrunching the wrapper up and returning it back to his pocket, he carries on. Dragging out a broom that seems to have appeared on site, starting on the dust and debris that stain the floor grey. After a while he's managed to clean up a sizeable patch, clustering it all in an ashen pile that he'll dispose of at some point. His actions are on automatic, unthinking and precise. Clearing the floor in squares of clearance and moving onto another defined area. Systematic, something tangible in the contingent world he has inhabited of late. He comes to the area where his desk would usually stand, and stops his ministrations to right it, picking it up off the floor. One of the legs has snapped, the lower end hanging forlornly on a hinge of remaining wood, so he takes pity on it and snaps the whole leg from its moorings, leaving it unsteady with only three supports. Dex's not much of a craftsman when it comes to wood, but he manages to find another intact length of wood lying around near where a joiner has brought materials to patch up the beams and roofing with, the size of which he fixes with a saw that has been left lying around in a metal carry-box of assorted tools. With a hammer and a few nails affixing it into place, the new leg still looks odd and out of place, but for the moment, it is practical at least. Getting a new desk will have to wait until the Flying Legion is completely back in operations again. The world doesn't stop just because they hit a spot of bother, and there is always need for the help of Sky Captain and his boys in some sort of crisis or another. The sooner the place is workable again, the better. There are still the structural issues to be completed, but for the moment, Dexter focuses on the minutiae, allowing himself to be a little selfish in clearing up his own space – or what remains of it. The lamp he returns to its position on his desk, and with that follows the speaker which was thrown to the floor when the beam came tumbling down and trapped Dex's leg. His comic books he finds in a scattered spread on the ground, and although he laments the issues that have not survived, the heat of the fire and the general destructive too much for their fallible pages to withstand, many he manages to salvage, brushing the dust off their covers to again see the face of the hero of the stories proudly displayed in some death-defying pose. They are returned to a pile on his desk, along with maps and papers that he hunts down, including the map in which a hole over Nepal has been torn; the clue he left for Cap before he was taken. It's probably moved on into the early hours of the next day when he stops, his gum long having lost any hint of flavour, and he pulls himself up to full height and stretches, cracking his back – a bad habit he's never quite been able to give up. His body is telling himself he's tired, and he's in a good mind to listen to those signals for once. Going home sounds like an intelligent plan tonight. It's rare he ever does take that option and grace his small rented room with his presence for a few short hours, but as long as he continually pays the fees the landlady sets, it's still there waiting for him whenever he needs some rest-bite away from work. He notices that there is still a light on above in another area of the base, and it's no surprise that when he goes to investigate, it's the office of Sky Captain Joseph Sullivan that the light illuminates from. Taking the time to deposit his gum back into its packet and wrapping it back up with the intention of throwing it into the nearest bin he finds, he pushes open the unlocked door to find the man himself, reading some official document or other, eyes getting tired and beginning to squint at the small printed words. When he sees Dex however, he smiles widely with that open grin of his, and Dex is compelled to smile back. \"Dex!\" Joe sounds his name like he hasn't seen the man for a long time, like he missed him. The two haven't really seen much of each other since the clean-up began, Cap off sorting official things, filing reports and mass-organising the higher ups into returning the animals from the rocket ark back to their homelands and the scientists back to their families, with Dex dealing with more on-the-ground stuff. In fact, Dex hasn't really gotten the chance to talk to his friend in a long while, not since he was kidnapped, not even when the two of them were reunited at Totenkopf's fortress. A proper talk, the one full of joking banter and familiar chat, and so thinking about it, they haven't really talked properly since Polly Perkins turned up demanding information from them. \"Sit yourself down. Want a drink?\" Dex can't bring himself to stay no, tiredness pushed to the back of his mind in favour of spending time with Cap. He looks like he could use the company, and to be honest, Dex doesn't really relish going home and spending the night alone just yet. He spent too many nights alone in a singular cell when he was ushered out of the laboratories, forced to work long hours on the rocket by Totenkopf's machines, all the scientists separated outside of working hours so as to reduce the chances of them launching an escape, and quietly Dex craves a bit of downtime with someone he trusts to get his head around the last few days. \"Go on then\" he replies, and Cap – no, it's Joe now, Joe his friend when it's just the two of them, Cap when he has taken on the persona of the man has everyone else is expecting him to be, the person people rely on for instructions and command – gives another easy smile, pleased Dex picked up on the offer, and from the draw in his desk he pulls out a bottle of something Dex knows will be alcohol, bringing up with it two small glasses. This scene is a well-known one, and many nights when they've been working late Dex retires to Joe's office to share a drink and just talk. They talk about a lot of things, and over the years very little hasn't been said between them. They're close, and Joe knows Dex as well as Dex knows Joe, recognises his mannerisms and thought-processes, when not to say anything or when to intervene. It's based on instinct now, and sometimes what is needed is merely a joke about what is on at the picture house, or it's something that's been bothering Joe that Dex can pick up on and coax into the light. Rarely does Dex bring his own issues into the forum, and that's just his way, but Joe can read them too sometimes when the mechanic is obvious enough about it, and through this process of guessing and intuition, they've mulled over many topics with the aid of alcohol to loosen their tongues. \"What shall we drink to?\" Dex asks as a measure is poured for him, watching the volume of amber liquid grow inside the cup, taking the glass as Joe moves to pour his own. Joe thinks for a moment, a frown creasing his forehead before fading as it comes to him. Dex notices he hasn't removed his brown leather bomber jacket yet and smirks fondly, knowing that he never remembers to take it off, even when he's back safely at base. \"Being alive\" he states resolutely as an answer, and Dex clinks his glass against the Captain's to those words. They seem as good a sentiment as any, considering everything. \"So, why are you still up?\" Dex enquires, taking a sip – he's not a big fan of alcohol but he can appreciate it at certain times, and whatever he's drinking isn't that bad, Cap always having the good stuff– and leaning back in his seat. Joe holds up the folder of papers he was perusing upon Dex's entry with an affected sigh, waving the offending article \"Paperwork. I managed to ignore it all while everything was going on, but... it catches up with you once real life sets in again.\" Dex laughs, \"Joe, you've never done paperwork\" He comments with knowledge that comes from many years experience, and at Dex's reaction Joe laughs back, humour seeping into his eyes. \"You're right. Hate the stuff. S'why I usually give it all to you, you're the one whose better at dealing with these bureaucratic official types...\" he trails off like some thing's caught his mind, made him stop, staring to a point past Dex's head as though he's seeing something there in the blank patch of wall. There is an awkward pause, then; \"Franky says hi\" Dex raises an eyebrow, giving him a look that tells him he doesn't believe it. Franky is a close personal friend of his, and the two worked well together when they were designing her beloved mobile airstrip. He learned a lot from her, and when his contract was up with her, she had offered him a permanent place on board; as both an technical advisor and a mechanic, surrounded by fascinating new machinery and the chance to create and experiment with new ideas. She had promised him that she would never consider consigning him to a desk job, not when he clearly had a talent for inventing. But despite the fact that it appealed to him greatly, he had declined the job with a polite thank you, telling her that his place was with the Flying Legion. With Joe, went his unspoken reply and Franky had understood his loyalties with a smirk curving up her lips as she wished him the best. But however well they get on with each other, Franky isn't the sort of person to offer hello's to those she hasn't heard from in a while. When Dex needs her assistance, she'll be there for him, but other than that there is not much contact between the two of them. \"OK...\" Joe recognises the glance Dex is shooting him and he gives a short laugh guilty, caught out \"Well, I'm sure she would have passed on hellos if we weren't too busy getting shot at\" Another pause, and then something delivered in an altogether quieter tone of voice, constrained, tentative almost ; \"I'm glad you're back Dex\" \"You weren't worried were you?\" Dex says it aloud as a joke, envisaging the great Sky Captain being worried about anything as small and unimportant as the safety of a mere mechanic but the expression on Joe's face is far from humorous. \"Yeah, I was.\" His eyes aren't focused on Dex now, but again are staring beyond, like looking into a bleak world wherein he failed his mission and his friend, a future he shies away from being reminded of how possible it was \"When we saw the hangar from above, I...\" He gives a sigh, remembering how he came over the ridge and saw the smoke from the building, then takes a chug from his glass to calm himself \"I thought you were dead. And then when it turned out Totenkopf's people had taken you, I worried I wouldn't be able to get you back\" \"I never lost faith in you\" Dex gives a quick smile. And he means it. Cap is his friend, and he trusts him, trusts him with his life. It's a thing to trust someone with, a life, especially his own considering how attached he is to it, but he would trust Joe with it if needs be. \"I knew you'd do something, if not for me, then to save the rest of humanity\" \"Of course it would have been for you\" Joe appears insulted that Dex hadn't imagined that would be the case. That Dex would even think that something would be more important than the rescue of a friend. There is another lull in speech in which Dex stares at his glass and the liquid within , and Joe is uncharacteristically quiet for a few moments before speaking again. \"You mean a lot to me, Dex. How long have we been friends, what eight years?\" \"Nine\" Dex swills the drink in his glass, a ghost of a smile playing on his lips. Cap's never been good with dates. \"You forgot about those those couple of months on that mission in Taiwan.\" Joe appears thoughtful, and Dex wonders whether Joe has been drinking from that bottle even before he came in and joined him. The Cap's not big on feelings and talking about them; partly from being the sort of man who doesn't talk about stuff like that with other men, and partly because it's just his way and always has been. It's taken all those years working together to build up what they have today; the jesting humour and praises of 'Good Boy Dex', a wayward joking comment once made for reasons that now Dex can't bring to mind which has become Cap's catchphrase to Dex. \"Long time\" Joe finally says, and Dex nods in agreement. Then he breaks himself out of his reverie, drawing himself out from thoughts he doesn't want to dwell on and returns to the Sky Captain – the Joe that Dex knows, the carefree smiling one who throws himself into dogfights with unmatched aerial skill, who flashes the mechanic a grin, all trace of upset disappeared from his face; \"Just don't do that to me again, Dex? I don't want to chase half-way around the world to drag your sorry behind back to base\" \"I will endeavour to do so, Captain\" Dex responds with all the sarcasm required, and Joe seems to appreciate it, appreciates how normal things are returning to from the unreality of Totenkopf and Shangri-La and a land of mutated creatures of unnatural making. Despite the fact that the whole world was nearly destroyed, burned away as a by-product of Totenkopf's dream of a World of Tomorrow, despite the bombing of their base and the ornithopter chases through the concrete-laden heights of Gotham, despite the fact that Joseph Sullivan had to fly to Nepal to rescue his closest friend because he was not going to give up on him that easily. A drink between friends is about as normal as things can get, and Joe doesn't want to break the moment just yet. \"Another glass?\" he offers, \"I want to know how you and your scientist friends got out of there. And don't spare any detail mind, I want the full nail-biting adventure. Complete with murderous robots, derring-do from the great Dexter Dearborn, and of course any beautiful ladies you seduced along the way\" Dex rolls his eyes, but despite his tiredness, he's tempted. Joe obviously wants some closure on the whole thing; and Dex knows him enough to know he's probably creating all sorts of horrible ideas in his mind about how Dex was treated on that island – regardless of the fact that robots turn out to be less malicious than real people as far as Dex's experience of the two go, and made sure all the scientists were all fed and left in a relatively comfortable working environment (there was the small fact of the threat of death should they not work on Totenkopf's project, but Dex would rather not dwell very much on that). Joe's always been the one to stick up for Dex, to believe in the shorter slightly geeky man who prefers his machines to socialising with real people when no-one else does, and there is an edge of protectiveness there in wanting to know what happened. Joe wants to talk, and Dex will most likely find himself more comfortable in spending the night here, maybe camping on the couch later for an early start tomorrow, than going home alone and counting away the seconds in the silence. Because he missed Joe too. Worried about him in his own introverted way every day he was in that place. Because that's just how he does things. \"Go on then,\" he proffers his glass out for another measure, shooting Joe a fond expression \"just one more\" ...Thoughts?

In a small corner office the lighting was dim; heat turned up because of the harsh winds outside. The radiator made a light chugging noise, but it served as no distraction to the man working tediously at the desk in the corner. Chewing on the end of a no. 2 pencil, Dex Dearborn reviewed the new blueprints on the desk once more. He had been here all night, and he planned to be here as long as it took to get the work done. Naturally he was working on Joe's plane; it was always Joe's plane. If it had been anyone else's he would have just gone back to it in the morning, but not if it was for Cap'n. Running a hand through his slick hair, Dex sighed in frustration. This was supposed to be simple, his design that is. He was just trying to alter the wings a little, that's all really. There wasn't necessarily a flaw in his original design, it was just…they could be better. After making a few quick changes to the blueprints, Dex glanced up at the clock on the wall. 3am, he had lost track of time again. Rolling the paper up, he placed it carefully on the corner of the metal desk next to the previous day's newspaper. Dex smiled sadly as his eyes roamed over the article he had cut out. It was a commentary and picture of the infamous Sky Captain, yes, his Cap'n. Unfortunately, it wasn't only about the Captain, it was also about Polly. For some reason he felt like cutting the blonde out of the picture entirely before he posted it on his bulletin board next to all his maps. No, that wasn't right; Polly was nice to him. Besides, Joe would wonder about it. This way, everything was how it was supposed to be. Tacking the news article on the small tan board, Dex gave a forced smile. It was for the best. Lifting his brown coat off of the back of the swivel chair, Dex turned the lights off completely. \"G'night Cap'n.\" Yawning and stretching, Joe Sullivan strolled tiredly through the hanger. Even though he seemed a little sleep deprived, he was in a good mood. Waving to the few men that were up and working this early, he passed them by with a single target in mind. As usual he was going to Dex's office to see what the boy genius had come up with this time. It was just a couple of days ago when he had gone away with Polly, and come back to find Dex with a new robot toy built. Supposedly it was to help make repairs faster, but Joe knew it was just for fun. Dex and his toys. Shaking his head while smiling, Joe increased his pace and stopped short of Dex's door. Not bothering to knock, he turned the knob and pushed open the door. \"Dex!\" Looking around, his smile faltered as he saw no sign of his friend. \"Dex?\" Taking one more quick sweep of the room, the Sky Captain concluded that he definitely wasn't there. Stepping into the office, he shut the door slowly behind him. His eyes glanced around the room, taking notice of the large stack of papers and rolled up blueprints on Dex's desk. Moving over and sitting in the reclining chair, he unrolled one of the blueprints. Joe's eyes traced every line and measurement on the page. Even though this was pretty foreign to him, by the drawing he could tell that it was a wing modification on his plane. Soon he found himself once again shaking his head and smirking. \"Dex, that little rascal, must've been up late too.\" No matter how many times Joe had told the kid to get more sleep, he never listened. It was always, \"But I'm working on something important!\" or \"It can't wait until tomorrow!\" Moving aside the prints, he propped his feet up on the desk and closed his eyes, figuring he'd just wait. The soft click of the door opening didn't go unnoticed by the resting man. Shoulders jerking upward, his glassy eyes shot open. Looking back, now glaring eyes rested on a ruffled, gum chewing, boy genius and softened immediately. \"Dex, you look awful.\" After opening the door, Dex's eyes widened at the sight of Joe. \"Oh! Cap'n, I apologize. I didn't mean to be so late, honest. I just- lost track of time is all.\" Clicking a wad of gum in between his teeth and scrambling to get through the doorway, Dex quickly discarded his coat on the small couch against the wall. Excitement quickly fluttered across his features as he glanced from Joe to the rolled up blueprints. \"I've got something for ya.\" Moving over to the other side of the sky Captain, Dex picked up the print. \"Now before you say anything, I just wanted to point out that this is just an idea.\" Rolling the paper out in front of Joe, Dex looked back to him eager to show his work. \"It's an updated version of the current wings on your plane. I took the liberty to plan out-\" Dex was cut off by a partially listening Joe, \"Good boy, Dex. I knew you'd think up something great.\" He stood up, stretching and moving over to the couch. Lying down, he watched the boy with half lidded eyes. \"Is this why you were up so late? What did I tell you Dex?\" The pink gum making a squishing sound between his teeth, Dex clenched and unclenched his jaw. \"You don't want to hear it, okay, I understand.\" If there was one thing Dex had learned from comic books, it was that the Hero often doesn't listen to all the sidekick has to say. It seemed to be no different now. Knowing if he fully explained, the man wouldn't understand anyway, Dex was able to hold his tongue. Eyes focusing on the picture pinned to the bulletin board, he internally grimaced. \"How was your trip with Polly?\" Sighing, Joe was not particularly pleased with Dex's clever deviation from his question. \"You're not answering the question Dex. I told you not to over do it.\" Dex's head bounced up and down. \"Uh huh, got it Cap'n.\" Seeing that the boy really wasn't in the mood for discussion right now, Joe sighed in defeat. \"It was fine. The country was nice, really warm actually.\" Crossing his arms across his chest, Joe remembered something. \"Hey, did you see the picture in the newspaper? It was taken when we got back.\" Nodding, Dex pointed to the bulletin board behind Joe. Watching the Captain roll over and see the article, he sat down on the chair in front of him. Fumbling with the papers on the desk, the boy refused to look at Joe as he turned around. \"You and Polly look good together.\" Watching Dex's slim fingers file through the papers quickly, Joe thought about how to respond to that statement. Really, he just wanted to know how the shy engineer in the corner would react depending on what he said. \"Yeah… we do. Everyone else seems to think so too.\" Faltering in his filing, quick hands clumsily spilled the many papers on the floor. He hadn't expected something like that to come out of Joe's mouth. Sure, it made sense and all, but he just didn't want to believe it. Hurriedly moving behind the desk, Dex bent down to pick up the papers, only to find his companion already mostly finished. Grabbing the last handful of pages, Joe stood up, followed by Dex. Holding the sheets out of reach from the boy's outstretched fingers, he towered over him. \"What's wrong, Dex?\" \"No-nothin' Cap'n. I'm fine really.\" Even when he said the words, he couldn't look the man straight in the eyes. Clicking the gum in between his teeth nervously, Dex quickly thought of an excuse. \"I have to go work on your plane; I'll be going now Cap'n.\" Turning around and moving toward the door, he was stopped by a hand on his shoulder. The taller man moved quickly in front of him, and Dex felt that his friend was just a little too close to him. Peering down at Dex, Joe found the side of his mouth twitching up into a smirk. \"What do you want to say? Come on, tell me. What is it?\" They were so close to each other, he could feel the boys hitched and shallow breaths. Swallowing nervously, Dex now felt very uncomfortable. Thoughts that he knew he shouldn't be having, were almost becoming a reality. Out of habit, he started to chew even faster. \"I- I…\" Nodding, Joe himself swallowed hard. Feeling the heat rise to his face, he was anxious to get Dex to say something. He had figured it out a while ago that he felt something more than friendship towards the quiet engineer. It had taken a little talking to Franky, but Joe thought he understood his own feelings now. Naturally, it was a little awkward around Dex for a while, so he took more trips with Polly. Franky said that he was subconsciously trying to make the Dex jealous, but Joe had argued that he couldn't take being that close to Dex while he didn't know how he felt. But now, he just couldn't help himself. \"Yes?\" \"I….\" Sighing, Dex's hand found its way around Joe and onto the blueprints. Taking them out of the man's hand, he waved them in the air. \"I have to go work on the plane.\" Sidestepping the Sky Captain, he picked up the goggles that were on the hanger near the door. Turning to look at his seemingly disappointed friend, he bit his bottom lip. \"Call me if you need anything Cap'n.\" With that, Dex spit his now unflavored gum in the trash, and left Joe standing in the middle of his office, eyes glaring daggers at the door. Damn it! He could have anything he wanted, anything at all! He was the fucking Sky Captain! He had people who got him whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted. He had girls fawning all over him every time he stepped off base. He could have anything...but not Dex. Letting out another string of curses, Joe stormed angrily out of Dex's office. He didn't know what else to do. The confident Captain practically threw himself at the boy and he got nothing in return. Why? What would it take? Joe felt like he should call Franky or something, anything to help the situation. Maybe he needed another trip, or was that making it worse? Joe rubbed his temples in confusion, not knowing what to do. All he did know was that he had to do something . Getting an idea, Joe walked through the chilly hanger, and over to where Dex was gathering the parts needed for the modifications. \"Dex, I was wondering-\" He was cut off by his own coughing, and quickly excused himself. Wiping the invisible sweat from his brow, he continued. \"I was wondering if you-\" Once again he was cut off by coughing and a slight shiver. \"Cap'n, you're sick!\" Dropping the tools in his hands, Dex hurried over to him and went to rest his fingers on the man's forehead. Before he could even touch the skin, Joe grabbed his wrist. \"No, its okay Dex, I'm fine really.\" With that he looked away from the boy's worried eyes, surprised that he had tricked the boy so easily. \"I just need to lie down.\" Feeling a warm hand grip his own, Joe's eyes followed its owner. \"Dex-\" \"C'mon, let's get you lying down.\" Pulling his friend to come with him, Dex guided the man back into his office and pointed to the largest piece of furniture. \"On the couch; I'll bring you some hot cocoa.\" Dex went to let go of Joe's hand, but was unable to. Joe wouldn't let go. \"Cap'n-\" \"Stay with me.\" It was now Joe's turn to pull Dex over to the couch. Sitting down, he yanked the boy to sit down across from him. \"I don't need hot cocoa.\" Dex bit his bottom lip, wishing he had his piece of gum right about now. He became slightly fidgety as a warm blush spread across his cheeks. \"I'll go call Polly then, she'll keep you company.\" Going to stand up, he was pulled back by Joe. \"Damn it Dex! I don't want Polly!\" For once, the infamous Sky Captain almost felt helpless. \"I don't…want Polly.\" The hand that wasn't holding anything, traced the outlines of Dex's face. He could hear the boy's breath hitch in his throat, and he inched ever closer. \"I want you.\" With that he closed the space in between them. Dex's eyes had widened as he felt heated lips press up against his own. He tried to say something, but the opening of his mouth proved to be a perfect opportunity for the Joe's tongue to slide in. Growing weak, he found his arms grabbing hold of Joe's sleeves. It was slow and sweet, just what he would've expected from the infamous Sky Captain. He knew it was wrong, it was so wrong. He had tried to be the one to control himself, knowing nothing good could come of it. But then again, the warmth spreading across his body stemming from Joe's heated mouth, felt close to indescribable bliss. Needing air, the Captain broke off the kiss, planting a gentle one on the side of Dex's mouth. Leaning slightly away from him, Joe watched the boy in front of him turn slightly away. \"Dex, I-\" \"Don't you lie to me Cap'n, I couldn't take it. You can't just do that…you just can't!\" Not being able to look at him in the eyes, Dex felt like curling up into a ball. It seemed like everything had turned surreal, but he really didn't want any of it to end. He had wanted this so bad, but the man had gone about it so easily, like it was nothing. And this was definitely not nothing. \"What are you talking about Dex? I'm not going to lie to you, I love you.\" The Captain's desperation and a slight hint of aggravation were evident in his voice, and he prayed Dex would just believe him already. He had been telling the truth the whole time, he had just expected a different reaction than this. \"Don't say that Cap'n; I know you don't mean it.\" Shaking his head, he felt calloused fingers run across his chin and move it to face its hurt owner. Closing his eyes, Dex sighed heavily. \"What about Polly?\" \"What about her?\" Giving Dex a slightly rougher kiss, Joe smiled. \"I'll tell you as many times as it takes to convince you. I don't want her, I want you Dex. I love you .\" Pulling Dex into his chest, he felt the boy's body fall limp against his own. He rested his chin atop his companion's head, letting his fingertip trace calming circles on his back. Breathing in the Joe's unique scent, Dex now felt this is where he rightfully belonged; in his arms. Moving so he could look up, Dex curled his own arms around Joe's larger frame. \"Cap'n, it feels different…being like this…with you. I've always- been the one standing in your shadow.\" Planting a quick kiss on Dex's forehead, Joe held him more tightly than before. \"All I want is for you to be right next to me, that way I'll never lose you.\" With that, he couldn't help the upward quirk of his lips as he looked down at the boy in his arms. With all the calculations Dex could have done, he could've never calculated this. -Fin ","Summary":" In Your Shadow It was dark and snowing, the blowing white only visible from the faint lights outsid"},{"Movie":"Sky Captain and the World of Tomor...","Title":"Balm","Author":"Almyra","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3244282","Passage":"[Chapter 1] AN: The songrnherein is \"To A Nightingale (An die nachtigall)\" by JohannesrnBrahms, Op. 46, no. 4 Nurse Cherry comes fromrnthe Cherry Ames series by Helen Wells and Julie Tatham; most specifically, Cherry Ames, Veterans' Nurse.

The song drifted away,rnmelting into the dusky purple horizon, and slowly, sounds of a worldrnreadying itself for sleep made reality apparent. Polite applauserncame from overhead, and the piano began once more, but this time itrnwas a sprightly dance of some kind. Still slightly dazed,rnJoe failed to hear the footsteps coming along the gravel path untilrnthe person stood right next to him. \"Captain Sullivan?\" a gentlernfemale voice inquired, and Joe started.

Reviews always welcome! \"Fifty seven,\" Dex announced as Sky Captain drew to a stop beside him, Polly fast on his heels. \"Fifty seven what?\" she asked curiously. Joe merely grinned. \"Oh, hi, Polly. Fifty seven screws. That's how many I'm going to need in order to put this plane back the way it supposed to be.\" \"There were that many broken pieces?\" she gaped. \"You said it was perfectly safe to fly it back up here!\" she lectured, giving the beaming pilot beside her a shove. \"It was okay to fly,\" Dex intervened, shrugging and popping his gum mildly. \"It's just gonna need that many screws to make it one hundred percent again, that's all.\" \"You're going to have to collect most of those from off the floor, judging from how the base looked the last time I saw it,\" Sky Captain informed him. \"Hey, so long as they're complete, that's all I ask. I don't need them all at once, you know. I can do things piecemeal, here and there, while we rebuild.\" \"Wait a minute,\" Polly interrupted. \"I didn't even know there were that many screws in a plane. I thought there were more nuts and bolts, things like that.\" She was more than a little out of her realm of expertise, discussing mechanics with Dex of all people, but that seemed like an awfully high number of things to be broken inside a plane for it to still be safe to fly in. \"Oh, there's lots of those too,\" the engineer agreed with her. \"And there are more than fifty seven screws in this plane. I just only need that many to fix it this time.\" \"Watch, you'll find you need a few more than that before you're through with it.\" \"Maybe. Depends on what I find once I get started. I haven't even really looked at the wiring yet.\" \"…There are screws in the wiring?\" Polly inquired, wrinkling her nose and trying to ignore Joe's laughter beside her. \"Not in the wiring, no, but sometimes you need a couple to get them all back where they're supposed to go.\" \"So all these different things are wrong, but it was still okay to fly?\" she asked skeptically, crossing her arms. She was beginning to think that the two men were putting her on in some kind of prank, but part of her found it hard to believe that the engineer would be party to such a thing. \"Sure.\" \" Sure? How can you be sure, Dex? What if something else had broken while we were on the way up here from getting this stupid thing off the island? We might have been killed!\" She was shouting now, upset at the unconcerned attitude that was being exhibited, and heads looked toward her as her voice rose. \"How can you just arbitrarily know it was okay when there were that many things broken?\" Suddenly she was certain that she had gone too far. Sky Captain's chortling ceased, and Dex stiffened as he turned to stare at her. \"I know because I built this plane, Polly,\" he explained. His voice was quiet, but she could hear the steel in it. This was a Dex she had never had reason to suspect existed, and to have him opposing her without warning sent a wave of disquiet through her. She swallowed heavily as he leaned slightly forward and went on. \"I know every piece that has ever been added or taken away. Provided that she had two working engines and the ability to be steered, I would have bet money on the safety of anyone riding in the back seat, so long as Joe was behind the stick.\" His gaze moved from glare into jest as it shifted towards the man he'd just complimented. \"Besides, I didn't say fifty seven screws were broken. Just that that was how many I needed to fix the things that are.\" \"It's true, Polly, that is what he said,\" Sky Captain backed him up, amusement entering his voice again as the engineer returned to the panel he was removing. \"Besides, if you were that worried about it, you could have ridden back with Frankie. Dex would have ridden with me, wouldn't you have?\" \"Yup.\" \"Ride back with-with-\" The thought of having to endure even a minute locked in an airplane with the woman she was absolutely positive had been her competitor in Nanjing was enough to make her cheeks redden with anger. \"Ugh!\" she exclaimed, stomping her foot before storming off, steam practically pouring from her ears. Once she was gone and he had managed to stop giggling, Joe took a few steps forward and rested one hand lovingly on the dented hide of his plane. The fingers of his other hand landed with equal emotion on his engineer's shoulder. \"Dex?\" \"Hmm?\" he replied from where he was bent over and half buried in the guts of Sky Captain's beloved aircraft. \"I won't make you get all of the screws you need from the floor.\" \"I'll take them where I can get them, Cap.\" \"You deserve quality, Dex. I intend to give it to you.\" He straightened up and brushed his hair out of his face with one hand, giving the taller man a discreet look that couldn't cover the passion burning in his eyes. \"Is that a promise?\" he half-whispered. \"That much quality, all to myself?\" \"You have given me quite the tall order to fulfill, it's true.\" \"Think you can handle it?\" He licked his lips. \"Why don't I make the first payment right now?\" Joe suggested, mimicking the other man's action as heat flooded him. \"I think I have time to take your deposit, Cap.\" \"Meet me in your quarters in…fifteen?\" \"That long?\" \"Anticipation is half the fun, love.\" \"See you there.\" \"Right.\" Sky Captain practically skipped away, and Dex turned back to his project with his hands shaking in anticipation.

SweetnSurrender SkynCaptain… the Sky Captain… He was absolutely amazing, one of thengreatest heroes of all time… Or was he just thinking like hisncomics again? Either way, he wished that for once, just once, Joenwould realize how many times Dex watched him… How many times he'dnjust sit there and stare at him while pretending to be reading hisncomics. Dex sighed and looked up at Joe, amazed to find that Joe wasnlooking back at him. \" Whatnis it, Dex?\" Joe questioned with a smile. Dexnjust shook his head from side to side, \"Nothin', Cap.\" Henlooked back down at his comics, finding that the next page hadnnothing but a large picture of a hero and his sidekick, and of coursenthe damsel in distress. Damsel in distress… nah, Polly was more ofna heroine… Either way, she was the one who had stolen Joe'snheart. Stolen Joe's heart… yes, she hadn't just taken it, she'dnstolen it. \" Dex,\"nJoe spoke, interrupting Dex's thoughts, \"I'm going to go seenPolly.\" Dexnrolled his eyes, which he soon regretted. He looked up at Joe,npraying that he hadn't noticed. To his disappointment, it seemed asnif Joe had. \" Dex,ndid you just roll your eyes at what I said?\" Joe questioned,nsounding confused. Dexnlicked his lips nervously and looked up at Joe. \" Um,\"nhe muttered, biting his lip, \"yes, I did, Cap.\" Joengave Dex a quizzical look, pondering the reasons as to why he hadnrolled his eyes. After seemingly finding no reason he decided onnasked Dex, \"Why?\" \" I…nI just,\" Dex found that he couldn't quite get the words out, \"Indon't…\" \" Donyou not like Polly?\" Joe suggested. Dexnhesitated before shaking his head, \"No Joe, I don't.\" Joenwas clearly taken aback then, \"Why don't you like her, Dex?\" \" I...nAw, come on Cap, you're killing me.\" \" Inam, am I?\" Joe countered, \"What could possibly-\" \" Injust don't like her!\" Dex shouted, and then murmured, \"I guessnI'm just jealous…\" \" Whatnwas that last sentence, Dex?\" Joe persisted. \" I'mnjust jealous of her, Joe!\" Dex responded. Joe'sneyes widened considerably. Dex clasped a hand over his mouth andnmuttered a small, \"Shoot!\" He looked to the ground in anguish,nwishing that it would just suck him down into it and make himndisappear, for forever perhaps. Then he felt a hand on his shouldernand looked up. Joe was staring down at him with a look of sympathynand hurt. \" I'mnsorry, Dex,\" he tried, \"I didn't know that you… Do you wantnme to spend more time with you than her, or…?\" Dexnsighed, \"Nah, don't worry 'bout it, Cap'n.\" \" ButnDex…\" Joe continued. Dexnsighed and hopped off of his desk and made his way to the door. \" Dex,nwait!\" Joe called after him, \"I didn't know, all right? I'llndo anything you want, just don't get upset.\" \" Joe,nit's…\" Dex pronounced, \"It's not what you're thinking.nIt… It's more than that…\" \" Whatndo you mean, Dex?\" Joe questioned. \" Joe,nI… I l-lo-I can't say it, Cap, I can't!\" Dex cried. \" Dex,nit's all right,\" Joe tried reassuringly, \"Just calm down.\" \" No,nit's not all right!\" Dex shot back at him, \"You don't get it,nCap!\" Dexnreached for out for the doorknob, trying to leave the room as soon asnpossible. Once his fingers had merely brushed the door handle, Joenwas standing in front of him. \" Joe,nget out of my way!\" Dex commanded. \" Quiet,nDex,\" Joe ordered. Dexndidn't have a chance to protest, for his lips were soon locked withnJoe's. His eyes opened wide at first, but soon closed as the mannpulled him into a deep embrace. Their bodies were so close now, sonclose that Dex could feel Joe's warmth piercing through him likenfire. Joe had kissed him partly to shut him up, also to make him feelnbetter, for he'd finally understood what Dex was trying to say, andnsimply because he'd found himself wanting to. Joenpulled away slowly, leaving Dex showered in disappointment. Dex keptnhis eyes closed for a while longer, practically begging for Joe tonkiss him again. Eventually, he opened them, finding Joe staring backndown at him, his face blank. \" There,nDex,\" Joe nearly whispered, \"Is that what you wanted?\" Dexnmerely nodded and then a thought struck him, \"What about Polly?\" Joenshook his head, \"No. No Polly, Dex, just you and me.\" Dexnsmiled and licked his lips, \"You taste like… like sugar almost.\" Joensmiled, \"And you taste like gasoline.\" Andnthen he bent down and once more seized Dex's lips.

It's pure Id—hokum and painfully sappy in parts. I hope you like it anyway. A note on the history: I've been reading a little about Republican Shanghai for the purposes of my senior thesis, so I got to throw in some of my historical know-how, which was quite fun. I've played a little fast and loose with dates and dictators, since Sky Captain is itself a bit of an alternate history. As for the names of people and places, I went with the Wade-Giles system for an older feel. The Hatchet Man is Dai Li, and you can read all about him in Frederic Wakeman's book Spymaster: Dai Li and the Chinese secret service . Disclaimer: Saying we own Sky Captain & the World of Tomorrow is like saying sharks walk on two feet and hail from the planet Neptune. Rated PG-13 for several snogs up against walls and doors and entirely too many em-dashes. 6.1K. It's midnight on a Thursday in 1931, and Joe Sullivan is twenty-three years old and pressed against a wall with the embroidered front of a black silk dress and the slim soft body of Squadron Leader Francesca Cook pressed against him. She stumbled, he remembers dully—at least, he thought she stumbled, was losing her footing and about to run the entire length of her beautiful black dress into the Shanghai mud—so he threw out his arm—which is of course when she grabbed him by the shoulders and manhandled him into the wall. He chokes as she aligns herself flush against him and looks intently into his face. Her eyes are very—well, he can't really see the color of them—it's so dark. \"Good lord,\" he manages. \"Francesca—er—Francesca. I.\" \"Good heavens,\" Franky returns archly, \"don't tell me you've never done this before, Joseph?\" She grabs his hand with her own—cool, soft skin— God —and places it on her left breast. \"Go on, man. We haven't got much time. And—\" a clinical dry press of her mouth to his \"—seeing that we've progressed to this level already, do call me Franky.\" This level—which would be—the level of necking against walls—? In July—in Shanghai? \"You never call me Joe,\" Joe points out. He feels like he's strangling, and thinks he probably is, considering the grip Squadron Leader Cook—Francesca Cook— Franky, damn it —has on his collar— \"Franky— Jesus Christ! \" \"Hasn't got quite the same ring to it, 'Joe,' \" she says, and squeezes his arse again. She leans in for another kiss— He twists his head away. \"Dear Franky, with all due respect, what the hell are you doing? \" \"Saving both our necks, I suspect,\" Franky says, cool and crisp. \"Now, will you kiss me like you mean it, or do I have to do all the work—?\" Shanghai, 1929 . \"Good morning, Lieutenant Sullivan,\" Francesca Clarisse Henry Rowena Cook says, offering a hand matter-of-factly. \"You've read my dossier already, I expect.\" The accent is crisp Oxbridge: Left -tenant Sullivan. Joe shakes the extended hand. \"I have,\" he says. \"A pleasure to meet you in the flesh, Squadron Leader—\" \" 'Francesca' will do,\" she says. \"Francesca, Franky, or simply 'Cook' if you've only the time for one syllable, Joseph. May I call you Joseph?\" \"My friends call me Joe,\" Joe says. A smile—sharp white teeth. \"Certainly. But we're hardly friends just yet, Lieutenant Sullivan.\" May, 1931. Joe's never been one for being on the ground; out of an aeroplane he feels intolerably young and unsteady. He's never been one for parties, either, and he feels especially stupid tonight, standing by the punch table at one of Albert Morrow's bimonthly galas, stuffed into an expensive tuxedo HQ foisted on him at the last possible moment, nursing a flute of champagne and listening to Jasper Green mouthing off about certain members of the Kuomintang party. \"—thrown out on my tail. Goddam KMT, some republic, they don't know the meaning of transparency—all I wanted was a goddam interview— kidnap my source instead—\" \"Uh-huh,\" Joe says. \"Outrageous.\" \"Yowza!\" Jasper says suddenly, stopping mid-tirade. \"Joe—over—up there, who's that ?\" Joe looks. There's a woman at the far end of the first floor, talking to someone Joe can't see. Her back is to them—her bare back. Dark hair, dark dress, and a rock the size of an egg on one finger. \"Hell if I know,\" Joe lies. He's never seen Francesca Cook in a dress before. She looks about a million dollars. \"I've never seen her here before—you think she's new in town? Some White Russian dame, maybe? Jeeesus,\" Jasper says, in an awed hush, \"just look at her. Joe, baby, I think I'm in love.\" Joe shrugs. He tilts the champagne flute back for one last inelegant swallow and stops as the crowd shifts and he gets an eyeful of the man Francesca's with. Dark, slicked-back hair, dark, well-cut suit, red bow tie, and real cute , as Jasper might say; he looks every bit as uncomfortable as Joe feels, and even from this distance, Joe can see he's got a beautiful mouth. Joe realizes with a start that Francesca is looking directly at him—she meets his eyes and flashes him a wicked smile. Jasper notices. \"You do know her!\" he accuses. \"Never seen her before in my life,\" Joe says, watching the boy, who's watching the people around him like a nervous rabbit unexpectedly surrounded by a pack of dogs, eyes darting from one person to the next, tensed to spring. \"She must be looking at you, Green.\" \"You think?\" Jasper says, hopeful. \"Positive. Be right back,\" Joe says, and finishes off the champagne—for luck. \"Going to see a man about a horse.\" He takes the stairs two at a time, but by the time he reaches the bottom, Francesca and the real cute boy have gone. Joe drinks three Bloody Marys in rapid succession and is on the verge of ordering a fourth when Francesca appears in the hotel restaurant in white linen—looking cool and refreshed and not at all like she spent part of last night bludgeoning two men into unconsciousness with a suitcase, a bottle of champagne, and a bathrobe tie. He doesn't regret it until he stands to greet her and the restaurant floor is tilts under him just the slightest bit. \"Steady on,\" Francesca murmurs. Joe eases back into his chair, and she slips into the chair opposite him, folds the napkin careful over her lap. \"Sleep all right, Joseph darling?\" \"Just marvelous.\" He hasn't slept a wink. He's not thinking about the third man—the one whose head he broke a chair over, poor bastard. Or helping Francesca tie all three up and gagging them and tucking them into bed— his bed —like Mother and Dad saying goodnight to their little lambs all in a row. \"Our mutual friend is concerned for your safety,\" Francesca says. \"Full English,\" she tells the waiter. \"No—nothing else for me, thanks,\" Joe says. He's about to be very, very drunk, and he welcomes it, quite frankly. \"If by 'our mutual friend' you mean Colonel Butler, he must be happy I've come round to his view of things at last,\" he says, once the waiter has gone. \"I'm concerned for my safety, too. I always am when you're around. And about what the maids will think when they—I mean, when they—there are men in my bed. Three men— three men tied up and covered in blood —in my bed!\" he finishes in a hiss, as another waiter comes round with a vacuum flask and fills their teacups to the brim. \"And an entire chair in splinters on the floor. Christ.\" \"A pity, I agree, and I'm sorry to have called on you so late at night,\" Francesca says, pouring milk into both their cups and stirring counterclockwise. \"But you needn't worry about your reputation, dear Joseph—someone will be over to tidy up very shortly. As for the rest of it, what you do in the privacy of your own room—\" \"Francesca.\" \"—with whatever number of consenting—\" \" Francesca .\" She sips and smiles at him over the edge of her cup. \"Your secrets are safe with me, Joseph.\" Time to change the subject. \"What brings you to these parts, anyway?\" he says, a little balefully—Christ, the room's gone all wobbly. He focuses on his tea and the little foamy circle swirling at the center of the cup. \"I thought you were adrift in the Atlantic. Or was it India. Yes—India.\" \"Nepal, actually,\" Francesca says. \"Over the Sutlej. Gorgeous skies there. Ever been?\" \"No. Someday,\" Joe says. \"But—\" \"But I haven't answered your question.\" \"No,\" Joe says to his teacup, \"you haven't.\" \"Well, Joseph,\" Francesca says. \"I just popped over the Himalayas to say hello, that's all. It's been years , darling.\" \"It stinks,\" Joe snaps. \"It stinks of intrigue and sneaking around and general stinking sneakiness . You were at Albert Morrow's party—just last week!\" he remembers. He scowls at her. \"You could have popped up the stairs to say hello then. And even after, you had an entire seven days. I know for damn sure you knew where I was staying—given—I mean, last night—I mean, when I'm—\" \"His name's Dexter,\" Francesca murmurs. \"You're drunk, Joseph.\" \"—drifting off to peaceful slumber, the last thing I ever expect is Francesca bloody C. H. R. bloody Cook bursting into my hotel room being chased by—I'm not drunk— Dexter ?\" \"Yes,\" Francesca says, smile widening. \"My eligible young bachelor at Mister Morrow's, of course.\" \"Dexter.\" \"Dexter. I'm sure you're eager to—shake his hand. And he's eager to meet you too,\" Francesca says. \"Hates parties as much as you do, but a mention of the magic words 'Mister Joe Sullivan' and he was diving for a bow tie—\" She checks Joe's wristwatch. \"I'm meeting him at the edge of the French settlement later today—don't suppose you want to tag along? Of course you do. Oh, lovely,\" she coos at the waiter, who grins and sets the separate elements of her Full English down with more flare than is strictly necessary. Beans slosh and one unfortunate mushroom is catapulted over the edge of the table and lost forever. Francesca bites into her toast. \"You'd better sober up, Joseph; we wouldn't want to disillusion him about famous Joe Sullivan—\" The sun is blazing down on him. Joe adjusts his hat, mops at his face with an already dripping handkerchief, and is bitterly aware that he stinks: of sweat and alcohol and too much cologne, applied hastily and liberally over the sweat and alcohol. But maybe the ripe smell rising off the Huang-p'u will disguise the smell rising off famous Joe Sullivan. \"There he is,\" Francesca says. There he is —the boy Dexter, jogging down the avenue toward them, the outlines of him wavering in the summer heat. \"Franky!\" He reaches them red-faced and gasping for breath. \"Sorry I'm late—mess in the lab, small—chemical spill—fire—nothing serious—oh!\" He breaks off and goes even redder, until the color is blazing down his neck and ears, and Joe knows what it's like to be stared at like he's the answer to someone's prayers. \"Hullo,\" he says, swallowing. \"Dexter—right?\" Dexter gapes at him and is silent. \"Joseph,\" Francesca says, coming to the rescue with a look of fond exasperation on her face, \"this is Dexter Dearborn. He's USAF R. and D., China division; we're borrowing him for a bit. Well, Dex, here , as promised, is one Joseph Sullivan, in exchange for the pleasure of your company at one formal event—\" \"Pleasure,\" Joe says. He holds out his hand and, after what seems to be a moment of paralyzed indecision, Dexter seizes it and begins pumping it up and down. Calloused hands, Joe notices, and about as slick and sweaty as his own, for which he thanks God. \"Dex!\" Dexter bursts out. \"Uh—my—that is—you can call me Dex!\" \"Dex,\" Joe says, trying it on for size. \"Pleasure to meet you, Dex.\" \"Same here—same here!\" Dex exclaims. He's still shaking Joe's hand like a piston. \"It's great to meet you, Mister Sullivan. I mean, in person and everything! You're a legend back the base—at my old base—back in the States, I mean. In Hawai'i. I mean, hell, even the boys in the lab have heard of you and that's saying something. Everyone's still talking about the maneuver over O'ahu, and how you saved the balloon boy—and that time you landed on one engine in the Bay of Biscay to drop off supplies and got out before Franco even realized you were there—\" \"Good lord,\" Francesca says dryly. \"He knows you better than you know yourself.\" Joe ignores her. \"Thank you, Dex,\" he says, lowering his voice and looking deep into the boy's eyes. Somewhere to his left, Francesca snorts with derision; he ignores that too. \"But all this 'Mister' stuff gets old real fast—I'd love it if you would call me Joe.\" \" Joe ,\" Dex says, reverently, gazing back. \"When you're quite finished,\" Francesca says. There's a gun on Dex's coffee table, but it's a gun unlike any other that Joe has ever seen, easily the length of his forearm, bulbous and gleaming. He bends toward it— \"No—don't touch that!\" \"I'm not, I'm not!\" Joe holds up his hands: don't shoot! \"I was just looking. What is it?\" Dex grins at him. \"Ray gun. Or it will be—this one's just a prototype. I finished it this week. But it's very unstable. Colleague of Tom's—one fourth of my et al. , Tom—lost his fingers yesterday when he tried to pick it up. He's fine—we sewed 'em back on in five hours, full mobility expected to return in six months to a year, and he's on paid leave in the meantime—but you can't be too careful. I'd put it away but I'm a little afraid to touch it myself right now.\" \"I see.\" Joe backs away from the table. Francesca clears her throat. \"If you would be so kind, Dex—\" \"Oh, right—sorry,\" Dex says. \"Just a sec. Um—have something to drink while you're waiting, why don't you? The water's been boiled and I think Tom's got some pop stashed under his bed. Oh—and don't go near my cabinet—'s not very stable now either.\" He disappears into the adjoining room. \"Well, what is it?\" Joe asks. \"What is it he's made for you—a ray gun? A beam sword?\" \"Hardly,\" Francesca says. \"You must think I've come here to kill someone. It's a bug—of sorts. Two, actually.\" \"Let me guess—one of them's for me.\" \"Very good, Joseph. Consider it an early birthday present.\" \"You'll forgive me if I don't thank you yet,\" Joe says. \"Especially if it blows off one of my arms.\" \"No danger of that,\" Dex says, reappearing. \"Well, an ear , maybe— \"These,\" he says, offering his left hand and the two crystalline beads rolling in the center of his palm, \"are the bugs. Put 'em in your ears—they should fit. Let me know if anything's uncomfortable. \"And these,\" Dex goes on, raising his right hand and showing them a pair of wedding rings, \"are your speakers. We tried to get them to work on necklaces and tiepins, but they don't really pick up unless you're speaking right into them, so—as per your request, Franky—here they are in matching rings. Go on, try them on. And then we'll do a test run.\" Francesca pushes the bug into her ear, nods, shakes her head, and then bends forward, backward, and sideways. \"Fits just right,\" she says finally. \"Joseph, will you—\" \"Oh, all right,\" Joe says. He takes her offered hand and slides the smaller ring onto her finger. \"You're ridiculous.\" \"Indulge me, darling.\" Francesca seizes his hand and returns the favor. An exact fit—of course it is. \"There. Splendid work, Dex.\" \"Thanks,\" Dex says, looking uncertainly between them. \"Er—okay—one of you needs to exit this room and walk to the other side of the compound. Just keep talking into the rings until the signal peters out. You wanted a forty yards at best, and we've given you a hundred—in theory. Let's see how far theory goes.\" \"Indulge me, darling,\" Joe says. He's never met anyone able to roll their eyes as expressively as Francesca Cook. \"Oh, very well,\" she says, making an outrageous face at him over Dex's shoulder. \"Hope to hear from you soon, boys.\" \"Oooops,\" Joe drawls, after the sound of her footsteps fades to nothing. \"Sorry, Dex—having a little trouble with this bug of yours—keeps falling out.\" He plucks the bug from his ear and holds it out for Dex to examine. \"Huh, that's funny. Maybe the fit's wrong—let me see—\" Dex presses the cold bug back into Joe's ear and prods at it, his eyes trained so intently on Joe's face that Joe can almost feel the heat of his stare. \"Hm,\" Dex mumbles, leaning close, with one hand still curled absentmindedly around the shell of Joe's ear and the other cradling his jaw, \"seems all right to me. How's it feel?\" His fingers are warm on Joe's earlobe and he smells of sun and sweat— Joe swallows. \"Dex—\" \" Joseph! Stop flirting and answer me. \" Francesca seems to be speaking directly into his brain. \" Can you hear me? Joseph Sullivan! For God's sake—! \" \"Oh—is she talking? Can you hear her?\" Dex says, seeing the look on Joe's face. \"Here—raise the ring, press the—yes—say something.\" \"This is Joseph Sullivan,\" Joe says, into his knuckles. \"Receiving you loud and clear. What's your position? Over.\" \" I'm at seventy yards—there's no need for radio jargon, Joseph—scratch your nose and speak normally. Seventy-five yards. \" \"Well—all right then.\" Obediently, he scratches his nose. \"Um—hullo, Francesca. It sounds like you're taking inside my head, you know—absolutely terrifying.\" \" Just what I like to hear, Joseph. Eighty. Drink a glass of water. \" He gestures at the pitcher; Dex brings him a glass. \"How far has she gone?\" Dex asks. \"How's the signal?\" \"Eighty yards,\" Joe says. \"Signal's great.\" He raises the glass to his lips. \"I've got the water now, Francesca. Can you hear me?\" \" Perfectly. Listen, Joseph, I know you hadn't planned on it, but I need you to get yourself invited to Yang Liu-t'ung's birthday party, \" Francesca says. \" Shouldn't be too difficult; she's one of your many admirers. I'll be your plus one. Tell them I speak very little English— \" \" 'Some White Russian dame'—?\" \" Or French, I haven't decided. As to why you've got me on your arm, I'm a close family friend—or madly in love with you—or using you for your American connections—or your family fortune—whatever you like. Ninety-five yards. \" \"You're absolutely after my money. Ninety-five,\" Joe relays to Dex. Dex makes an exaggerated show of crossing his fingers and smiles at him. \"Still there?\" Joe says, a trifle breathlessly. \" Yes. One hundred. One hundred one. \" \"One hundred,\" Joe says, and Dex punches the air in delight. Joe makes up his mind. \"Say, Francesca—I just remembered—I think I'm going to have to abandon you for the rest of the evening.\" \" Joseph Sullivan—take him to dinner first, at the very least, before you tumble him into bed. One hundred five. One hundred six —\" the first crackle \" —one hundred seven. \" \"You're walking very fast.\" \" Oh yes. I have to—I have an innocent American scientist to rescue from your clutches. One hundred eleven. One hundred twelve. One hundred— chrr pkt!— een —crrh— dred— \" \"Francesca?\" Static. \"Out of range?\" Dex says, deflating. \"Darn. I was hoping she'd make one-thirty.\" \"One hundred thirteen yards,\" Joe says. \"That's nothing to sneeze at—it really was like she was standing beside me, speaking right into my ear. Good work, Dex.\" He removes the bug and ring and holds them out. Dex doesn't take them. \"Uh—Joe. I wanted to ask—if you don't mind—do you, would you—if you would—\" \"Yes?\" Joe says, smiling at him, 'Yes, dinner would be lovely, Dex,' ready on his lips. Dex seems to be squaring his shoulders. He takes a deep breath. \"Can I have your autograph?\" \"My autograph,\" Joe repeats. There is a strangled silence; Dex looks like he wants to sink into the floor. \"No, of course , Dex—it's been a while since anyone's asked, that's all. I'd be happy to—\" Dex is already thrusting a pen at him, a pen and a notebook and—dear God, it's a newspaper clipping printed with a picture of a young grinning face and a USAF plane behind it— Pilot rescues balloon boy — \"Good Lord—this must be four years old!\" Joe exclaims. Dex's face is fiery red. \"I—I'm a huge fan, Mister Su—uh, Joe. Could you make this one out to Samuel Lee? That's my best pal from grade school, we were at the base in O'ahu together when it happened—\" Francesca's probably turned around by now. He has five minutes, maybe six. \"So how long have you been in town, Dex?\" Joe asks, scrawling To Samuel Lee, Aim High, Joe Sullivan . \"Oh, six months, give or take. Since Christmas, so.\" Dex is watching the progress of the pen. \"Can you—can you sign the front cover?\" \"Sure thing, Dex.\" To Dex Dearborn— To Dex Dearborn— Keep up the good work. Joe Sullivan Shanghai 1931 \"—there.\" He folds the pen and clipping into the notebook and holds it out in one hand, bug in the other. \"Thanks—Sammy's gonna be so happy about this—\" Joe closes his hands around Dex's for a fraction of a second. \"Like it here?\" \"Uh—\" Dex blinks down at his fingers. \"Yeah. Hotter than I'm used to, but the food's great, people are mostly friendly—\" he wanders into the next room, shouting over his shoulder \"—and I get to be in charge of my own team here—do my own projects on the side! All in all, it's a swell deal!\" Joe waits until he reemerges. \"Are you doing anything tonight, Dex?\" Dex meets his eyes, quick and uncertain. The rabbit again. \"Uh—some of the guys were going to hit the town, get a little action, I don't know.\" He's still blushing. His eyes are on Joe's lips. \"Oh—too bad.\" Joe licks the corner of his mouth for good measure. \"I was going to ask you if you wanted to—well, never mind. It's all right.\" \"No—\" Dex exclaims. \"Uh. What I mean is—I was gonna tell 'em no, anyway—seen enough of 'em for a week—\" He gives a nervous little laugh and Joe feels his heart squeeze in his chest and give in. Sorry, Francesca! \"Really?\" Joe says. \"That's fantastic —\" Thursday, eight o'clock. Madame Yang is delighted to see him. She exclaims over the rings and Francesca, who is gorgeous in black and clinging to his arm like a limpet. Joe conveys their best wishes and a small wrapped parcel, and bundles his erstwhile fiancée toward the ballroom. \"What a delightful little bird of a woman,\" Francesca sings, in throaty Russian-inflected English. \"And so charming! Darling, you have such lovely friends.\" Whispered, now: \"What did you get her, anyway?\" \"Er—I don't remember, exactly,\" Joe says, steering her toward a closed door. \"Gloves? A shawl?\" Another powerful roll of the eyes is sent his way. \"Joseph Sullivan. Don't tell me you had Dex —\" \"What!\" he protests. \"You were busy—what do you give a woman who's got everything, anyway! Dex said he had just the thing—\" \"Oh, God,\" Francesca says, looking genuinely alarmed, which is alarming in and of itself. \"He's gone and wrapped one of his own gadgets, hasn't he—I hope to high heaven it isn't explosive.\" \" Not everything Dex makes is explo —oh never mind —\" Joe clears his throat. \"No one's looking, you'd better go now. Through this door, up the stairs, third room on your left. Remember—they're cutting the cake at midnight. Good luck, Francesca.\" \"Cheers.\" Francesca kisses the side of his mouth and turns the Russian on full force. \"Do not worry your little head , darling. I will not be two seconds .\" He shuts the door behind her and walks toward the music, his stomach turning over and over. Last Friday. The new picture being shown at the Grand Cinema is hokey science fiction—robots and slimy creatures coming out of the sea and something about Atlantis. A reluctant hero this time, the kind who looks to have had his nose broken four times and is always scowling into the dark, tormented by his memories. Whatever those memories are, Joe will never know: he dozes off and misses an entire forty minutes of the film, including whatever it was the beautiful blonde love interest said to galvanize the hero to action—it doesn't matter, anyway, because his arm is finally around Dex's shoulders, and Dex is leaning silent but boneless into him. Dex has taken off his uniform jacket. Joe slides his hand down until Dex's T-shirt sleeve ends—on screen, the hero confers with a team of scientists. Dex mutters something. \"What's that?\" Joe whispers. \"That's not going to work,\" Dex whispers back. \"They just told him to cut the red wire. People always think it's the red wire. Red wire, red buttons—\" \"Dex,\" Joe murmurs, \"we are watching a movie about underwater robots—it could very well be the red wire.\" \"It's not,\" Dex whispers. \"Trust me. He cuts the red wire in the comic book too, but all that does is—\" They're enveloped in a cloud of slogans and student protestors the moment they exit the theater. It's a little harrowing but provides Joe with an excellent excuse to grab Dex's hand to lead him away. \"Sorry,\" he says, when they've made it back to Dex's room. \"That was probably a lot more action than you were looking for.\" \"Nah,\" Dex says. He seems to realize he's staring into Joe's eyes and abruptly looks away. \"Uh—Tom's here.\" Bloody Tom . \"Those students,\" Joe says. \"What were they shouting?\" \"Huh?\" Dex lets go of the doorknob. \"Oh—I have no idea. I don't speak or understand Shanghainese.\" He grimaces. \" 'S not very convenient. When I put in that I was interested in our China division, I was hoping they'd post me to Kwangchow.\" \"Well, I'm glad they didn't,\" Joe says. Dex ducks his head, shy again. \"Yeah. Anyway—\" \"Probably 'down with government corruption,' \" Joe muses. \"Or something really rude about Chiang Kai Shek.\" Dex giggles. \"Probably.\" \"Don't let the Hatchet Man hear you laughing,\" Joe says, grinning at him. \"Thanks for coming out with me tonight, Dex. I had fun.\" \"Me too. Joe—\" \"Dinner again sometime?\" \"Huh?\" Dex says. He looks up, lips parting. An inch of space between them, now. \"Oh—sure. Joe—\" \"Dex.\" He closes the gap. Thursday, 11:21 p.m. \" Joseph— \" Francesca sounds somewhat out of breath. \" Hullo there, Joseph. I've just run into a spot of trouble, I wonder if you could spare a moment to help your wife-to-be tuck someone else into bed— \" He very nearly drops his champagne flute. He takes a sip instead. \"What's happened?\" \" Rotten bad luck. I couldn't drop him before he radioed for back-up ,\" she says, in a rush.\" Don't know how many are coming, don't have the papers yet. I need you to bloody hurry up and get over here, Joseph. \" \"Christ,\" he mutters. \"Okay. I'm coming now. Be careful, Francesca.\" He pauses to drain the flute. Fifteen minutes later, they've left five bodyguards unconscious on the study floor and are crawling unceremoniously down a trellis into Madame Yang's gardens—with a sixth man crawling after them and a seventh standing at the study window, shouting into his radio. \"Did you—\" Joe swallows and tries to regain control over his breathing. His knuckles are bloody and the communicator on his ring finger is, he suspects, busted up beyond repair. There's a lump the size of an egg on his head where a member of Doctor Yang's private army belted him with a nightstick. \"Did you get—what you—were after?\" \"Not now, Joseph —oh, hell! Bloody undercover work! \" Her dress catches on a rosebush; she frees it with a hard tug. Joe gives her a leg-up onto the garden wall. She hangs there on her belly, reaches down to help him clamber up and over—he lands more heavily than his knees would like—and then they're pelting down the deserted lane. Ten minutes later, Francesca is kissing him into a wall, hands in his hair, doing all kinds of magic things with her tongue, the stolen dossier pressed between their bodies while their pursuers vanish around the corner. She kisses him again, a half hour later, when they've made it back to the British quarter, walking slowly and arm in arm—this time on the cheek. \"Until we meet again,\" she says. \"Thanks ever so, Joseph. Give my love to Dex—protect the rabbits.\" He laughs. \"I will. Good-bye, Franky,\" he says. \"Take care.\" In retrospect, Joe supposes he could have walked up the stairs and knocked like any other reasonable person. But it's one in the morning and he's almost giddy with the excitement of the previous hour, blood thrumming in his veins—and anyway, he wants to see what Franky finds so fun about coming in through the window. It complicates things somewhat when Dex's roommate sees him first and screams bloody murder. Dex doesn't come running. Either Dex's roommate screaming bloody murder is a regular occurrence, or Dex is out on the town and Joe is probably going to get in a lot of trouble, if Dex's roommate doesn't brain him with a monkey wrench first. \"I know what this must look like,\" Joe says. \"I can explain.\" The roommate's eyes flicker toward the ray gun and back to Joe. Joe swallows. \"Thomas,\" he says. \"Thomas, right?\" \"Tom, everything okay?\" Regular occurrence, then— Thank God. \"Bleeding hell—get out here, Dex!\" Thomas shouts. An English roommate. \"It's a burglar, or something—is the ray gun safe? Can I blast him?\" \" NO —whatever you do, don't touch that thing!\" Dex shouts back. \"What's going on? Why'd you—\" He stops dead between rooms. \"Joe!\" \"You know this lunatic?\" Thomas says. \"Dex—he came in through the window!\" \"We should really lock that,\" Dex muses. \"That's impressive, Joe—this being the third floor and all.\" \"Hi, Dex,\" Joe says, hands in his trouser pockets. He feels himself beginning to smile, smiling irresistibly, quite unable to stop. \" The window ,\" Thomas insists. \"Tom—go for a walk, will ya?\" Dex says. \"What? It's one o'clock in the morning, I was about to go to bed!\" \"Go for a walk,\" Dex snaps, eyes fixed on Joe's face. \"I have to talk to him—it's classified. I said it's classified . Get the hell out of here, will ya? Get you when I'm done. Sorry.\" \"Coldhearted bas—\" The door shuts with a quiet snick . There's another snick as Dex locks it. \"How'd it go?\" Dex asks. \"Swimmingly,\" Joe says, grinning at him. \"Only shot at once. Sorry about the whole—\" he gestures vaguely at the window behind him \"—slightly unorthodox, I realize—\" he's crossing the room before he knows what he's doing \"—I wanted to see you.\" Dex turns pink. \"Where's Franky now?\" he asks. He leans against the door. \"Don't know. Don't care. We said good-bye at the river. She sends her love.\" He traps Dex with one arm on either side of his head. \"Your bugs were great.\" \"Glad I could help,\" Dex whispers, and Joe bends to kiss the smile on his lips— —and jolts back. \"Hang on—that thing you picked out—for Madame Yang,\" he says urgently. \"It wasn't—it's not going to blow up, is it?\" Dex's head snaps up. \"What? Of course not!\" \"Just checking. Good boy, Dex,\" Joe murmurs. Dex frowns. \"Not everything I make is explo— mmh —\" Tomorrow Sometime between 1931 and the next time he sees her—September, 1933, Nanjing, dropping in unexpected for a nightcap—dropping in through the window —Joe's met Polly and Dex has stopped answering his letters—Franky's managed to lose an eye. \"You should have seen the other guy,\" she says, in a piss-poor imitation of an American accent, and, coming to sit on the bed beside him: \"Don't fret, Joseph. I'm promise I'm as good a shot with one eye as I was with two.\" \"I don't doubt it,\" Joe says. He's quiet a moment, thinking of Franky in Doctor Yang's study, in the frozen moment before reinforcements arrived and all hell broke loose, crystals dangling in glittering strings from her ears, her eyes—both eyes, then—artfully lined in black. \"No more undercover work for Franky Cook,\" he murmurs, tracing the lower edge of the eye patch with his thumb. \"About which Franky Cook is damned pleased,\" Franky replies. \"It's back to the skies for me.\" Sirens and shouts outside. KMT rounding up students again—or maybe something to do with why Franky's come in via window again and is sitting on his bed at two in the morning. Joe gets up to draw the blinds and turn off the lights. He goes to his little cabinet and fumbles for the brandy. \"Heard from Dex,\" Franky says behind him, and Joe's heart sinks. \"Just recently. Had a letter. He's doing quite well—experiments progressing, results encouraging, superiors pleased. Not a single mention of you, though, Joseph.\" \"Cheers,\" he says, filling a glass and holding it out to her. Franky doesn't take it. \"What happened?\" \"Recalled to his old base in—oh, last October, I think,\" Joe says. \"Americans wanted him back. I was up north when the orders arrived. Came back to a telegram and a note—I wrote him once or twice, but you know how these things— really , Franky, wipe that look off your face. We—we only had a couple of months, it was just some fun—I've met someone else now.\" \"Of the female variety.\" \"Yes, of the female variety —her name is Perkins.\" He sets her glass on his nightstand and drinks. \"Polly Perkins. Reporter—friend of a friend. Very pretty.\" \" 'Just some fun,' too?\" \"Uh huh. Nothing serious. You know me. Drink up, will you?\" \"So she won't mind if I spend the night.\" \"Dear Franky,\" Joe says, \"I think you'd spend the night whether she minded or not. Anyway, she's in Soochow for the weekend—something about tracking down a warlord on holiday—so do as you please. I'm quite happy to shelter you from the Hatchet Man and his secret police, or whoever it is in the Russian quarter whose evening you just ruined.\" She falls asleep beside him, curled under his arm on her side, and is gone in the morning. He doesn't hear from her again until November of 1937. A USAF man runs the telegram to him as they're helping him limp off the runway in Kowloon— JUST GOT THE NEWS STOP V DELIGHTED STOP GOOD SHOW STOP WAS ABOUT TO COME IN AFTER YOU STOP CONGRATULATIONS ON THE PROMOTION STOP MONTANA FULL STOP December, 1937. It's snowing in sheets in Montana. Joe's bundled himself into an enormous white parka, so that against the swirling whiteness no one can see where the snow ends and Joe Sullivan begins. He rather resembles a yeti, or an enormous snowball; he's not sure his own mother would recognize him at this point, let alone— He's fairly certain Dex is living by himself this time, but he stays clear of the window all the same. There's a doorbell. He presses it. After what seems an eternity, the door creaks open, and there's Dex, with a mug of steaming cocoa in hand, wearing the most wretchedly ugly Christmas jumper Joe has ever seen. \"Oh my God,\" Dex says. His mouth drops open. He must be reacting to the parka. \"I—Captain Sullivan.\" Captain —Franky's been in touch. \"Happy Solstice, Dex,\" Joe says. \"Can I come in?\" It's warm and bright inside. Joe wrestles off his sodden boots and peels off the yeti skin and follows Dex to his kitchen. He sits at the table and Dex pours him a cup of cocoa, all the while staring at him like he's grown a second head. \"Awfully cozy for a mad scientist's lair,\" Joe says finally. \"Lair?\" Dex says. \"This is my house, Cap.\" He smiles: hints of the old Dex. \"The lair's under the basement. Not so cozy down there.\" \"Ah. I see.\" Joe sips his cocoa in silence while the uncertainty rises higher and higher—Shanghai was long ago and far away—and manifests in the form of shaking hands and a lump in his throat. He feels Dex's eyes on his face. He can't look up. \"You're probably wondering why I'm here,\" he says to the cocoa. \"A little,\" Dex says. His voice is strange—thinner than Joe remembers, and a little watery. \"Franky—Franky told me you'd escaped. Telegram ten days ago. I thought—I figured you'd be in England by now. Or—or Chungking, with Polly and the boys—\" \"What, the Air Force?\" Joe says. He drinks. \"I resigned.\" England, now there's a thought—why didn't he think of it before—his sisters must be worried sick. \"You—you what? \" \"I'm tired of being sent from this end of the earth to another on someone else's orders. I was thinking—I had a lot of time to think, in Manchuria—anyway, there was an airfield on sale in New York, and I bought it. I want to start my own private squadron. I—I came here to offer you a job. If you'll have it.\" He swallows hard. \"If you'll have me .\" Dex's knuckles are turning white around his mug, Joe notices. \"All the equipment you need,\" he says. \"You can have it. Your own lab. Any assistants you want. I'll hire them. You can build all the ray guns you want.\" Dex laughs, shaky and wet. \"Ray guns,\" he mumbles. \"I thought of you every day,\" Joe says. \"I thought about you when the plane was going down, you and that ridiculous ray gun—please, Dex, say you will.\" \"I can't believe you're actually sitting here,\" Dex says. \"In my kitchen. In Montana . In a—there's a blizzard outside. Has anyone ever told you your coat looks like a yeti?\" Anything to stop shivering. \"Dex.\" \"I built a super digger,\" Dex says. \"I quit my job to build it. It's in—in the room under the basement. Was gonna airlift it to Harbin—meet Franky—dig you out of there. I—\" He can't breathe. \" Dex, please .\" \"Yes,\" Dex says, \"yes, I will,\" and he's pushing his mug away and reaching for Joe over the table, grabbing his hands and holding on to them for dear life. He's smiling so hard there are tears leaking out his eyes. \"Yes. Yes. Yes—yes—I will. I can start tomorrow. I can start today . Yes.\" ","Summary":" THE NANJING DECADE I have truly massive amounts of papers I should be writing for school, but it wa"},{"Movie":"Sky Captain and the World of Tomor...","Title":"Coming to a conclusion","Author":"Snowaayy-Cazziiee","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6691122","Passage":"[Chapter 1] After when everything was finished with the report of the invasion of New York City, Polly Perkins smiles as she just done the last sentence and thought she done well, conceding she didn't got a lot of pictures, thanks to Joe back at the mine when it was full of mines and that her film got left there when the place blew up. Sitting in her place, her eyes looked up and notices some shadows coming towards the doors. Seeing one of them, her heart missed a beat as she knew one of them but then confusion set in as she got up and watched as the door opened and there was Sky Captain standing there, smiling towards her. Well his name isn't Sky Captain but in-fact it's Joseph Sullivan. Standing there with her boss, laughing before he left them to it. He turned, made himself over towards her as he closed the door behind him. \"We meet again then Captain.\" Giving her a half smile, he just shrugged his shoulders as he leans against her desk, leaning forwards. \"Let's just say that a little bird told me that you got a article coming out about this whole thing. So thought to check it out and see if my handsome name is in it. Dashing Hero that is.\" Polly rolled her eyes but then she started walking towards the door, thinking for a moment before turning back to him. A smile playing on her lips. \"Well it certainly got you in it but you are under a different name.\" \"Different name? Like what?\" \"Film destroyer, nearly killing us a few times, near death experience. You name it.\" Joseph rolled his eyes as he sat on the desk now, arms cross across his chest. \"Not this again Polly. Why do you always complain? You sound like my Mother at times.\" Polly looks towards him, raising an eye brow to him. He looks back, tipping his head to the side as thinking of what's going on in her mind but then pulled a face. \"Polly why think that? No ways you're not my mum….arghh anyway why complain all the bleeding time!\" Polly looked around the room before making her way towards the window and watched the people below them before looking to him. \"That's who I am. Accept it or more on.\" She smirks. The man rolled his eyes before getting up himself and headed towards the door but then his eyes caught the article so he walked over and started reading the front page before laughing. \"You the hero of the day? Please Polly and I thought that I was bad but this is just stupid.\" Polly pulled the pages out of his hand, walked back over to her desk and sat back down in her seat as she sorted the story out once more before placing them to the side for the time being. \"Well that's a different story.\" \"How is that a different story? The line that I just read was that you save me! And that you saved the day from the robots. I am sorry but I have to laugh because you and I…well Franky and Dex also know full well that I saved the day.\" Joseph isn't happy now. He started pacing around the room with a hand under his chin while Polly watched him with her eyes as her mind kept telling her to say sorry and change the story. \"Well maybe I want some heroic time in-stead of you all the time. Now may you go as I need to get on with some work?\" Polly got her pen and started writing a letter to her friend. Joseph stopped pacing; watching her but then an idea came to his head so he left her to it and walked out of the room with a slam of the door. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow Later that night, the newspaper is closed as Polly was the last to leave and yet she left her story in her room, locked up in the draws as she needed to do some more writing to it before punishing it to the public of New York. What she doesn't know that Joseph went back in there as the place getting locked up and waited in a closet, watching her doing her work before leaving for the night. When she left, he waited for a good few minutes as he knows what she's like, intending to leave things behind before going home for good but luckily she didn't so he walked out of the closet and started searching the area for the storyline. Looking in draws, he soon stop as he looked up and smirks as his eyes set on the locker draws by the door. He got his radio and hope that Dex is still at the airport. \"Dex, come in, Dex its Joseph here.\" \" Hello Cap'n. What is it you needed?\" \"I need to know a way to break in to a set of draws. Locker draws.\" He added. \" Well is there a paperclip near by? If so pick it up and bend it so it got a little hook on one side.\" He instructed to him. Joseph looked around the room for a moment before his eyes set on a tub full of paperclips and just rolled his eyes but smirking at the same time. He made himself over, picking one up and started bending it, following Dex's instructions. \"Also there….done. Now what?\" \" Now use the screwdriver I gave you earlier, put them together and start lock picking.\" Reaching in his pocket, Joseph pulled out the screwdriver but then frowned as his eyes looked towards it. \"Er Dex? Why did you give me the screwdriver?\" \" As you needed to fix your radio a while ago while I was sick but anyway Cap'n, why are you asking me about lock picking? What are you doing?\" \"Because the stupid woman of Polly Perkins is doing a story of her saving New York…plus I want to see if she put anything else in there about me.\" He explained as he placed the radio to his ear and started picking the lock on the draws. \" Oh right. Well I am here if you need something else Cap'n.\" \"Thanks Dex.\" A smile appeared on his lips as he now focusing on his job of breaking the locks. Blimey Polly didn't made this easy now. He almost made it and once he made it, he smiles to himself as he pulled the draw towards him. Looking in-side, he saw some photo's of him, her, both of them and thought that she still got feelings for him as he does for her also. Sighing, he places the pictures to the side before putting his hand back in there and pulled out the bundle of papers before pulling a file which contains the story. Walking over to the desk, Joseph placed the radio to the side as he place the story on his lap and started reading without her interrupting him this time. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow After a hour, Joseph smiles softly as she lied to him about calling him the names that she mention and yet he resumes that when he left her earlier, she changed the header and everything else to Joseph being the hero. He thought that the story is worth printing along with the pictures she got as well, even though it was impossible to get pictures after her film got blown up in the mines but apart from that, she got some worth pictures. \"Polly you little teased.\" He guess that his feelings is coming back to him once more about Polly so he's regretting of cheating on her for three months with Franky. Putting everything back together, he got up once more, heading towards the draws and placed the story back of where it belongs before locking everything back up and smiles as he walked back to get the radio. \"Coming back home now Dex. You can leave and thanks again.\" He placed the radio on his belt, writing something on a piece of paper and leaving it on the desk as he turned the lights off and left the room to it. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow Polly walked in to her office early next morning with her usual coffee and went to her desk, drinking. She didn't notice the note that Joseph left her as she took her coat off and place it on the coat hanger by her side before looking out of the window and watched the morning city waking up. Smiling to herself, she turned but then frowned as she saw the note there. That wasn't there last night. She thought as she picked it up and started reading. Dearest Polly, Thanks for everything, even with the story, it was lovely. I was wondering if you ever fancy going out for dinner some time to catch up on good times. Once more I am sorry for everything that I put you through, I truly understand of why you wracked my plane up after the trip. Please forgive me and hopefully start again. Your dearest, Joseph xXx Smiling as a few tears came down and spill on the ink on the paper, Polly is quite shocked but then she's glad that he apologize to her about what happen with Franky but then she guessed that she needed to stop being annoying. \"Thank you Joe.\" She said as she placed the note to the side, got up and started doing her usual things. This day certainly left a couple thinking for the time ahead. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow Random as I watched Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow for thee frist time and I thought that Polly is annoying but then a okay person. And this just popped in to my head. Enjoy. R&R; please.

If you don't like it, don't read it and don't review it. Just maneuver away from the fanfiction. This is just something I thought up at 12:43 AM. Please don't viciously point out mistakes if there are any. I'd like to think every once in a while I'm a good writer. Also, I'm kind of new to the fandom but I've seen Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow several times before. I now own it and look for hints to Dex x Joe at any turn. I also dislike all that is Polly Perkins...well, except that Gwyneth Paltrow plays her. She's the only upside to her character. Disclaimer: I do not own Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. If I did, no matter how much I like Gwyneth Paltrow, her character would not have survived and a certain two would be together. Emotion. Joe remembered the first time he ever let it show; let someone see that he could actually display it. It had been when Totenkopf had taken Dex and Polly had come along for the ride, bringing along with her the reason for his mechanic's disappearance. He hadn't even meant for her to see the salty liquid fill his eyes, but she had, and that's when he guessed she began to realize that her infamous Sky Captain was still human. \"We'll get him back, Joe.\" She'd said, or something along those lines, and she'd placed an unwanted comforting hand on his shoulder. Had she thought that she could provide that comfort? Or had the reporter in Polly once again taken over and thought to pry out information as to why the Sky Captain was going to cry over the kidnapping of his friend? Wasn't he supposed to be some hero? Wasn't he supposed to be incredibly strong, brave, and sarcastic? Joe hadn't talked to her since they had returned to the base. She had gone on her merry way and reported on all that Totenkopf had done and what had happened. For some reason, Joe wasn't hurt by this; in fact, he was incredibly glad that Polly Perkins wasn't around; she had been annoying enough for a while. No, better she go bother someone else and leave him to his own musings and devices. Shaking his head to clear his thoughts once more, Joe again fell back onto the subject that he'd been trying to decipher. Emotion. He'd seen it expressed by Franky and that was no small feat. When he'd said \"They've taken Dex\" Franky looked as if she were about to cry. Her eyes had widened and a strange look had appeared in her eye, like she knew something that Joe should've known or about Joe that he didn't quite comprehend yet. She had agreed to help him after that. A sigh fell from the Sky Captain's lips, a headache suddenly making itself known as he sat behind his desk, his head resting lightly in his hands. The thought that he should've left all the thinking to Dex crept up into his already addled mind before he brushed it off, feeling the explicit need to drown himself in some form of alcohol; whether it be beverage or….well, was there any other way to drown oneself in alcohol? Joe shook his head, nearly laughing at himself before he slowly drug his tired body from his chair and stumbled to the door. \"Cap'n, I think we need to discu—\" Dex's voice filled his befuddled mind as his face connected with the door. A small shout of surprise flew from Joe's throat as the force of the door broke his nose and he stumbled back in a clumsy act of dodging the rest of the object. \"Cap'n! Oh god, oh god….Cap'n I'm so sorry, I didn't even think I just flew in-!\" Dex rushed to Joe's side as the Sky Captain fell not so gracefully on his rump and managed to hit his head on the desk. If he hadn't been in so much pain, Joe would have laughed at the way Dex became flustered and how he blushed so prettily. Joe's eyes widened at that last thought before brushing it away quickly. \"Calm down Dex, it's only broken. Just help me set it.\" Joe spoke, his brow furrowing as he tried to focus on the pain in his nose instead of the road his mind currently tried to go down. Dex was only wearing the white undershirt he wore underneath his usual work shirt and the sleeves had been rolled up to reveal a little more arm that the Captain was used to. It also didn't help that Dex's body heat was rolling off him in waves and his lips looked so inviting at the moment—Joe mentally shook himself. This was Dex he was talking about! Not Polly! \"Okay Cap'n, I'm gonna fix it real quick. Don't be mad at me if I don't do it well. This is my first time fixin' a nose, you see.\" Dex spoke, only receiving a slight nod from Joe in return, which he took as a 'tough guy' moment instead of how the Sky Captain really felt. With shaky hands Dex held the other man's face lightly before gathering all his courage and focus as he quickly grasped Joe's nose and set it back into place. A loud cry ripped from Joe's mouth, but was soon silenced by his teeth as he ground them together to stifle the noise. Dex's face seemed to transform into the epitome of worry as he leant forward an inch more, his eyes checking over the Sky Captain's face for any more injuries. \"Are you alright, Cap'n? I put it back into place, but you seem like you're in pain….tell me what to do, Cap'n.\" Dex's eyes searched the Captain's face, looking for anything he missed before. \"Spit out your gum, Dex.\" Joe said, bowing his head so that he could effectively wipe the blood on his lips and chin from his face. Dex moved to help, but Joe swatted his hands away. \"Why should I do that, Cap'n?\" Dex questioned the Sky Captain's motives, his genius mind quickly thinking up that the older man had a concussion. \"Just spit it out, Dex.\" Was Joe's only reply. Dex did as he was told and spit out his gum into the wastebasket nearby before turning his attention back onto Joe. In a split second afterwards he felt Joe's lips connect with his, the utter softness of them surprising the younger man so much that he gasped. Taking his chances, Joe once again took the initiative and deepened the kiss. Dex, after the initial surprise, finally understood and began to reciprocate. Slowly they kissed, taking the time to explore each other's mouths before Joe broke away and softly began to kiss down Dex's neck. Dex moaned in both surprise and pleasure. \"Cap'n….?\" Was Dex's only coherent word, spoken like a question to Joe's actions. \"Yes, Dex?\" Joe replied in between light kisses on Dex's collarbone. \"I….I don't understand.\" Came Dex's breezy voice, its volume nearly a whisper as he spoke, his head lolled back in pleasure. Joe took that time to lean back, holding his companion slightly closer to him and taking his time to formulate his answer as he enjoyed the sight before him. Dex's lips were slightly reddened from Joe's kiss and the porcelain skin on his neck was slightly pink around the areas where he had kissed Dex. A grin spread across the Sky Captain's face as his thoughts of earlier and his knowledge of now mixed together in his mind, formulating an explanation for his companion. \"Emotion, Dex. I barely display it….until my world revolves around you.\" Dex's eyes widened in surprise and his head snapped up, but Joe was prepared, and he silenced any question Dex had of him with another heart-stopping kiss. Again they separated, this time though, Dex's head finding its way to Joe's shoulder where it rested as Joe took Dex in his arms. \"I'm glad, Cap'n….'cause, I feel the same way about you.\" A true, genuine smile made its way onto the Sky Captain's lips as Dex spoke, his voice muffled by the signature jacket Joe wore. They stayed that way for what seemed like hours, each lost in their own thoughts, but enjoying the way the night had suddenly turned out. \"Cap'n?\" Dex was the first to break their companionable silence. \"Yes Dex?\" \"I'm not going to worry about Polly anymore, Cap'n.\" Dex mumbled, his voice thick with sleep as he moved to find a more comfortable position against Joe. A smile crept up onto Joe's face once more. \"Yeah? And why is that, Dex?\" The Captain asked humorously. \"'Cause, I'm gonna never let her back on the base ever again.\" Dex spoke, his voice laced with humor and sleep. Joe grinned. \"Good boy, Dex.\" Please review kindly, if at all. Thank you for reading! -Aimze ","Summary":" A/N: This has Dex x Joe slash. If you don't like it, don't read it and don't review it.

It all began with a telegram, written as follows: Dear Miss Hanna Lance stop I have wonderful news stop I have found a deserted Viking village in a part of the island that I have not yet discovered stop I suggest that you get here as soon as possible as we want to beat the competition full stop Best regards Mr Edward Johansen The island was Iceland in the Atlantic sea and I went to the only person I knew who had flown a Tiger T-3A that far a distance. He was not up for it in the beginning since it was the second year of the Second World War and he felt that he had to defend his country, the lovely shores of Britain, but after some persuading, he came around and flew me to Iceland. We landed on a cold May morning and Mr Johansen was there to greet us. \"How do you know him again?\" Joe asked Hanna as they walked to the car where the man was waiting. \"He wrote to me a few months ago and asked for my opinion on a find he had discovered. I don't know him personally, in fact this is the first time I have heard of him. He must have written a paper on Vikings but I haven't read it. Since we don't know him, you be nice this time.\" \"What do you mean \"this time\"? I was more than nice to that brat you where working with last year. It was he who couldn't take the ale, I only happened to help him into a police cell…\" \"What do you mean by that?\" Hanna wanted to know but before Joe could answer, they had reached the car and Mr Johansen. \"Welcome to Iceland, Miss Lance, it is a pleasure to have you here… and who is this?\" he asked and as he turned to face Joe, he barely hid the expression of dislike that crossed his face. \"Captain Joe Sullivan and the feeling's mutual.\" Joe said and gave Mr Johansen a big cruel smile. \"What you would want to do on this bit of ice is beyond me,\" he continued looking round, he eyed the scenery with its open landscape and the distant hills. \"We are looking for Viking artefacts that are said to be in the area. So if you would come this way Miss Lance, I will show you the dig and the Village\". \"This is the village,\" Mr Johansen said spreading his arms wide to the wooden buildings that where raised there. The Longhouse, which was the main house, was about eight feet high and the houses looked like normal houses except from the way they were built; the structure was rectangular with only one room, the smallest house with the roof nearly touching the ground. \"The buildings are nearly new, that's the strange thing, it is as if they where built yesterday.\" \"But that is impossible!\" Hanna exclaimed and started to inspect the wood on the closest house. They were built in the stile of the early Vikings but archaeologists do not know much about the period. \"Miss Lance, this is what you are here for, I need your expertise as a fellow archaeologist to decide the authenticity of these finds and to discover why they where not found before. I will leave you now, so look around and I will be by the dig which is to the north of here,\" he said and pointed to the left of the main building. When he had gone, Joe started to scrape on the wood with his penknife. \"That's odd; if you scrape of the surface-wood then it is new wood underneath not old and rotten as it should be if it was over a thousand years old.\" \"Let me see that,\" Hanna asked coming closer to see for herself. \"Yes, your right. And now that I think about it, these are the wrong type of buildings for Iceland. The first Viking settlers didn't have much wood so they built parts of their houses into the earth in order to keep the warm air in. I wonder if Mr Johansen knows this?\" Hanna was now getting puzzled. There had been a feeling of wrongness when she first landed on the island but she had dismissed it as nerves. Now she felt that the whole scene was wrong, the buildings and Mr Johansen. Why had she not heard of him before? Since Hanna was preoccupied by her own thoughts, Joe started to wander. He walked round all the buildings but found nothing out of the ordinary, well it looked normal to him, he didn't know about Hanna. He never liked history when he was in school; he had always been planning a new prank. He shook his head to clear his thoughts. He liked Hanna but history seemed to come between them. She was from a richer family than Joe was and it seemed to matter to her parents, who had a firm grip on the girl, still, even if she had turned 26 and lived on her own. Joe stopped to tie his shoelace on his worn army boots when he noticed something on the ground. It was halfway out of the earth and covered with mud. He picked it up and cleaned it on his sleeve. \"Hanna, get over here! I've found something!\" he shouted and she came running over. \"Look at this, isn't it lovely?\" he asked in amazement, the thing that he had found was a small silver figure of a woman. \"Well, that is neat; Joe Williams actually thinks something historical is \"lovely\". That is a silver pendent of the goddess Freya. She represents fertility but she was also the midwife's guardian. When there's a battle half of the amount of fallen go to her home, Folkvang, where it is supposed they live in happiness, and the other half to her husband Odin, who is the wisest and most powerful Asagod,\" Hanna said realising that she had talked without being interrupted, not even once by Joe, who did not like history. \"What? Why are you so quiet?\" she asked and blushed. He stared at her with a twinkle in his eyes. \"You seem to know a lot about her,\" he commented, sending another blush to her cheeks. \"She is the topic of my paper which I'm writing at the moment. It is about whether she and Thor, the Thundergod, in an earlier period of the Viking era were real people who later became the gods we know today. Where did you find this?\" she asked giving the pendent back to him. Joe showed her the place and described the way it had stuck out of the earth. \"It looked nearly like as if it had been dropped and the trod on.\" \"Well, there doesn't seem to be any more finds here, this must have come from the dig but that is a few yards from here. It didn't just grow feet and walk here itself. Why would anyone be carrying this around?\" Hanna asked, frowning. Joe walked off to see if he could find more artefacts that someone might have left behind, when Hanna called out in rage. She had entered a house and found modern equipment and furniture inside. The walls were the kind that you built the modern houses with and the floor was not earth as she had expected but cement. When Joe came running to see what all the fuss was about, he found her going through the papers that were laid out on the table. \"This is incredible!\" she exclaimed, \"This is a record of the area and it says here, that they haven't found any artefacts at all. That means that the dig is just a set up, a fake!\" \"But why then have they brought us here?\" Joe asked coming closer to stand next to her, \"and why isn't the pendant recorded as a find?\" \"Let's gather all the facts we know: the pendant is a real find, but they haven't recorded it in their logbook,\" he continued. \"The village that they brought you here to inspect is a fake, and so is the dig. That leaves us with one question. Which side is this Mr Johansen on, is he a part of this or can we trust him?\" \"No time to answer that, someone's coming. Quick, run!\" Hanna whispered and they bolted for the door that was on the opposite side of the room. Joe closed the door at the same time as the person opened the door they first entered by. They were catching their breath when Mr Johansen came round the corner of the house and found them. \"Ah, there you are. I have been looking for you for some time. Find anything interesting?\" he asked as he was walking towards them. \"What is it you are holding, Captain Williams?\" He had noticed the silver pendant that Joe now tried to hide but too late. He had to hand it over to Mr Johansen who looked shocked to see it, but then again tried to hide his true feeling without great success. \"Ah… I-I'd better take a closer look at this…. I'll keep it in my lab for the time being,\" he muttered and walked away, he had already forgotten about Hanna and Joe who took their chance and made their escape to the airfield. Resting against Joe's plane Hanna closed her eyes and tried to stay calm. She could not bare that creep having the pendant of Freya. \"How are we to get it back?\" She yelled to the distant hills as Joe climbed out of the cockpit. \"We need a plan, and I think I have got one. Let's call it operation Rescue Freya.\"[Chapter 2] The Village lay in darkness when Hanna and Joe finally got into action. They had been waiting for darkness to come and now that it had come, they felt a chill down their spine as they sneaked past the row of houses, the silence amplifying even the smallest sounds to become deafening to their ears. Hanna reached the final house and peered round the corner to see if the coast was clear. As she strained her eyes to see in the darkness she caught a faint light moving away from the place where she was standing. \"They are moving… should we follow them?\" Hanna asked Joe, her voice strained to a whisper. \"We need to see what they are doing and where they are hiding whatever they actually find, because they are finding something. Let's go!\" he said as he moved past her and after the lights in the distance and Hanna followed him. The line of light, torchlight in fact, vanished suddenly and Joe ran the last few yards to close the gap between them and the torchbearers. When Hanna caught up with him, he whispered to her to keep low and follow him. They had come upon a cave entrance. The lights continued inside but when Joe was about to follow Hanna called him back. \"Are you sure about this? Should we just follow them inside? We don't even know if there is a way out once we're in!\" \"Relax, they don't know we're following them,\" he said and gave her a confident grin showing off his white teeth. \"You'd rush into anything, wouldn't you?\" Hanna remarked. \"Yeah, and you will never get anything done if you don't take a chance and do it.\" \"There is no harm in thinking before rushing into something that's all I'm saying. And I do get things done! I just take my time doing them,\" she snapped at him. \"Well now we're doing them in my pace, because they are leaving and this might be our only chance. Now!\" Joe whispered and grabbed Hanna's arm and pulled her to the entrance to the cave. The entrance was in fact the entrance to a tunnel, leading deep into the mountain. They followed the wall, having no light to go by, walking crouched under the low ceiling. Joe, who led the way, entered the cave first and stopped dead in his tracks. Hanna, who was following behind Joe, walked into him. In front of them lay an open cave, lit by torches, about half the size of a football pitch in width and about the same in height. Stacked in rows against the walls were stones runes carved on them and boxes filled with jewels. Hanna started to look through the nearest box, and found to her amazement the jewellery and armour that was rumoured to be owned by Freya and Thor. \"Hanna, have a look at this!\" Joe said standing a few feet away, looking at the rune stones. \"I can't believe my eyes!\" she gasped after examining the runes. \"These runes tell the story of Freya and Thor!\" Hanna walked from stone to stone reading the messages that where carved on them. She rummaged in her bag, looking for her camera. When she found it, she took photographs of the stones, the jewels and the armour. \"Hanna we'd better go, they will be back soon,\" Joe said and came over to her. \"I hate leaving it all here,\" Hanna said with a sigh and put the camera back into her bag. They ran back down the tunnel but this time something had changed. The floor of the tunnel was slippery and hard to walk on, as if it suddenly had turned to ice. Hanna slipped and her bag fell out of her hands, her camera falling out and skidding across the floor. \"Hanna, get up!\" Joe yelled and ran back for her. He pulled her up and pushed her forward, forcing her to run the few yards to the entrance and out into the light. \"My camera, Joe!\" Hanna shouted back at him and he hesitated. Did he have time to go back for it? Mr Johansen was waiting for them when they came through the tunnel and into the first light of dawn. \"How long were we in there?\" Hanna asked Joe but Mr Johansen spoke before he could answer. \"Far too long. I am afraid that you two have become quite a nuisance to me, so I have decided to get rid of you. Karl, Fredrik, take them to the cliff and shoot them.\" Mr Johansen said and gave Hanna an evil smile. \"I am sure that Captain Williams will be a gentleman and offer to be shot first, don't worry dear. Life goes on or in your case, not,\" he said and walked off laughing. \"That insolent little-... \" Joe began but came to his senses. \"Hanna, here is our chance. When I say go, run for the airfield.\" \"What about you?\" she asked but at that moment, he rammed one of the men and shouted at her to run. She ran as fast as she could, trying not to think of what Joe was doing, letting her get away. Well she didn't get that far. Hanna raced up to the Tiger T-3A and found that the canopy wouldn't open. Typical! she thought and tried to force it open, without any success. \"Hanna, get in!\" Joe shouted as he came running towards her with the two men after him, one limping badly and the other supporting a broken arm. \"I can't. It won't open!\" she said her voice breaking with panic. \"Get out of the way!\" he shouted and she moved to let him open the canopy to the cockpit. He did so by banging the left corner twice and the hitting the top with his fist. \"A little force and anything will open. Now, get in. Let's get away from here.\" Hanna climbed in and he came after her, closing the canopy and starting the engine. They flew into the air with a roar and sailed into the blue sky. \"Let's never go there again.\" He muttered relived to be on his way back home to England, when Hanna put her hand on his shoulder. \"Look, there to the left, two o' clock.\" Five planes were coming their way and as they flew closer, Joe saw that they were in attack formation. \"Uh-o, that doesn't look good,\" he muttered under his breath. \"Hang on!\" Joe turned to his right and the enemy planes flew past them. He flew in a half circle, turning to face the planes that were between him and England. \"No one gets between me and England!\" he yelled and charged, his machineguns firing at the planes and they returned fire. After flying round in circles without any great victories against the enemy planes, Joe realised that he could loose them by drawing them in to British airspace. The RAF in the area would then deal with them. After a few hours of flying, he finally saw the shores of England; he never had appreciated that sight as much as he did now. True enough, when he drew closer to land a group of ten airplanes rose into the air from below and he got radio contact with the leader. \"Identify yourself Tiger T-3A,\" the voice said in the intercom. \"This is Sky Captain, just taking a turn. Could you help me loose these bugs I've got on my tail?\" \"Of course, Sky Captain, this is Wing Leader, formation Delta and fan out.\" The leader said and flew past Joe, who headed towards land. They landed at Suffolk airfield. \"Now, really this airfield does not exist to the public...\" Joe remarked trying to smile at her. \"Well, as far as I'm concerned, I'm not here and can therefore not be seeing what I am seeing.\" Hanna answered tiredly. Joe drove the plain to its hanger, where he parked it and got out. \"How are you feeling, Hanna?\" he asked with a worried look in his green eyes. \"You've been in worse mix-ups the last times you flew with me and then you were still the fire-y- self you usually are.\" \"Thanks a lot!\" Hanna muttered sourly. \"I'm just bitter that I lost my camera. Without it, Mr Johansen will still be free and not behind bars, that should be his natural habitat.\" \"Are you sure you lost it…\" Joe asked with a knowing grin. \"What are you not telling me?\" Hanna enquired moving closer, forcing Joe to back up against the plane. \"Right you've got me. I went back for the camera.\" He said razing his arm to shield himself from the rage attack that Hanna would have for him not telling her. But it never came. Instead, he felt her arms around him, hugging him, and felt that she was shaking. \"Hanna, what's wrong?\" he said worried and made her look at him. She wasn't crying as he first thought but laughing. \"You- You are you, and I love you for it,\" she said and looked lovingly into his eyes. \"Well, how to answer to that? It is so unexpected. How about: I've loved you from the first moment I met you.\" \"Did you really?\" \"Of course I did. Are you questioning my reasons? Let's just stick to I love you and you love me.\" \"Fine by me,\" Hanna agreed and they walked off hand in hand across the airfield. \"How about I teach you how to fly?\" \"As long as you are in the plane with me.\" \"I wouldn't be anywhere else.\" There might be some of you that are wondering if the story ends this way, too sloppy for you? Well Hanna and Joe expose Mr Johansen as the villain he really is. As for Hanna's paper on Freja, she returns to Iceland to finish her discovery and this time Joe actually was interested in history. Or as he said it: \"Shut up and continue discovering.\" ","Summary":" The character Joe Sullivan in not my own character but Hanna Lance and Mr Edward Johansen are. It a"},{"Movie":"Sky Captain and the World of Tomor...","Title":"Facade","Author":"paganpunk2","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7014593","Passage":"[Chapter 1] To everyone who knew him, he was the epitome of control. He was the one who was calm, collected, logical, loyal, and utterly unflappable in a crisis. Mr. Nice-to-Everyone, even nosy reporters poking in where they weren't needed, wanted, or welcome. Mr. Fix-It, Mr. Build-It, Mr. I-Can-Always-Make-Another when Sky Captain dropped it or lost it or let the enemy of the month blow it up. The darkest anyone had ever seen his expression was when they caught him scowling at a tangled bundle of wires or glaring at a mangled pile of machinery that had, until a moment before at least, been very promising. He was the base mascot in a way, sweet and adorable and socially naïve. He was also utterly, completely miserable. No one ever saw that side, though. He made sure of it. It wasn't all façade, or at least he didn't think it was. He really did believe that most people were basically good, underneath all the scratches and chips that the world inflicted on the surface of their personalities over the course of a lifetime. Being nice to people came almost as naturally to him as putting screw A into hole B so that engine C would run like it was supposed to rather than exploding or dying in midair. Comic books and gum were precious not only because they gave him half of his ideas and protected his teeth from the grinding damage years of having other people's lives in your hands tended to inflict but because they were things he truly enjoyed. He had wondered once if his love of such items was an attempt to make up for the childhood he'd never really had, but the thought had made his Dubble Bubble turn to bile on his tongue and he had immediately cut off that line of reasoning. In the end, it was the \"immature\" aspects of his character that caused him to hide the other facets. His supposed innocence made him into a sort of beacon of – what? Purity? Decency? – something, something that meant something to the people around him, the people he cared about, the people he cherished. The people he would give his life for in an instant. The people he wished some nights would fall into the degree of danger that was necessary for him to prove that he would take their place in a coffin. He represented something that they needed to believe in, and recognizing this he had long ago stuffed his monsters into the darkest corners of his mind, bringing them out only when he was alone and could ignore their clamoring no longer. Tonight was one of those nights. It didn't matter that he hadn't seen his father in fifteen years, didn't matter that the bastard had no way of getting to him here, at least not directly. All that mattered at this very moment was that the specter of Phillip Dearborn had decided to rear its ugly head, and that meant that the public side of Dex was busy thinking of ways to explain his injuries in the morning while the private side propelled his fist into his jaw again. It's Friday, no one will hear anything, they've all gone to town… A hard smacking sound as his knuckles met his cheekbone. You pathetic little fuck, always locked in your room. When are you going to get a friend already? Or are you too good for other people? He picked up an empty beer bottle from the nightstand – he always tried to down a couple before the memories took over, it lessened the pain – and smashed it across the fingers of his left hand. A few shards stuck in the skin, blood welling up around them slowly. Say you were working on the telephones and accidently broke a transformer cover. You can't live in a dream world. Dreams don't come true. Figure it out. Stand up on the bed now, close your eyes, waver a little. The chair's there – fall so you miss it, or someone will notice it's gone and ask, his rational self murmured. He started to go over, tried to save himself out of pure instinct, and then punched out again in pure rage at his attempt at self-preservation. Goddamn coward, afraid of a little tap or two from your old man. Going to have to man you up. The cold, hard boards of the floor bruised his shoulder, but nothing else. He'd learned too long ago to go limp before he hit the ground, and the vague pain wasn't enough to satisfy the black maelstrom in his head. What're you going to do if you have to fight a war like I did? Just curl up and die? No son of mine- Piles of texts and comics crashed to the floor as he threw himself sideways into the dresser. His side hit a half-open drawer, knocking the air out of his lungs and making him grope at his chest. The breaking glass surprised you, made you fall off of the ladder. That's it. You just fell. His first degree had been on the dresser top, hidden among the stacks, and as he launched himself against the drawer again it succumbed to gravity. The corner of the frame caught the back of the head as he bent forward, gasping for oxygen, and he cried out for the first time during this session. Copper from where he'd bitten down on his lip too hard filled his mouth, and he moaned low in the back of his throat. What are you screaming for? You think this is pain? You think this hurts? I'll give you something that will hurt, cry-baby. Fell off the ladder and hit your head. Maybe it tipped backwards, kind of threw you a ways. That seems more plausible with these injuries. Yeah. They'll believe that. Still whimpering slightly, he dragged himself into his chair and considered the articles on his desk. The hot plate – that would have to be next, wouldn't it? He plugged it in and, while he was waiting, gave himself a few more smacks across the face, his skin growing super-sensitive before numbing entirely. Burns are nothing, you dumb asshole. You remember that 'B' you got in English last week? Yeah? You know what starts with 'B', don't you? Let's see if you do. It was ready now, nice and hot. Rolling up his sleeve, he laid his forearm across the top, smelling burned hair and flesh almost immediately. A hiss escaped him, but he didn't move. Bet you don't go visiting 'B' territory again, do you? I didn't think so. Say you burned yourself earlier, before you went to look at the telephone. Probably no one will even see it, if you keep your sleeves rolled down. Your face is what you'll have to explain. Caught your chin on a box as you fell off the ladder, that's it. He persevered in his self-castigation, practically feeling his father's hard grip pressing his arm to the burning metal. \"Please,\" he whispered, mouth tight against his elbow. \"Please, daddy, let me up. 'M sorry. Please. It hurts.\" A second more, and the weight holding him down vanished. He yanked the scorched limb back and cradled it, rocking back and forth slowly as a thin sob fled his cracked lips. A suddenly knock on the door brought him bolt-upright, eyes wide in horror. They didn't hear, he tried to comfort himself as the demon that was his father fled back into its midnight corner, well aware that when others were about it stood no chance of defeating his iron will to keep his secrets to himself. \"…Yes?\" he queried, hoping his voice was semi-normal. \"…Dex?\" Joe. Shit. If anyone will notice something off, he will. \"Yeah, Cap? You need something?\" \"...Your door is locked,\" the voice noted curiously, the handle turning slightly as the man on the other side tried to open it. \"Oh! Sorry. I was kind of in bed already. Did you need something?\" \"Catch you in middle of something?\" His tone was joking, but Dex sensed a layer of suspicion underneath the friendly joviality. \"Well, like I said, I was in bed.\" Still outside and frustrated as hell, Joe decided to go for broke. \"Whoever she is, she must be quite the rough little minx,\" he said. Dropping any pretense, he went on. \"Either that or you're taking an ax to your furniture, judging from the noises I've been hearing.\" \"I thought you went to town with Polly,\" Dex shot back at him. \"I did. Then I came back, because she was annoying me.\" \"Isn't that usual for her?\" \"Yes, it is. What's not so usual, however, is for you to do the same thing with equal aplomb. Like you are right now,\" he added acidly, crossing his arms and leaning against the frame. \"Open the door.\" \"Do you need something, or are you just aiming to keep me awake all night?\" \"All night seems a bit premature, seeing as how it's only eight o'clock.\" \"So you don't need anything.\" \"Yes, Dex, I do,\" he sighed wearily, sick of the game. \"I need you to open this door immediately, before I kick it in and find out why you sound like you're talking through a mouthful of cotton balls.\" Every fiber of his being froze at those words. Play it cool. You were working on the phones, caught a little shock that threw you off the ladder. Smacked your face, crunched the transformer glass in your hand. End of story. Tell him you stumbled coming back from the bathroom a minute ago, maybe he'll believe that's all he heard. Gulping, he sat up as straight as he could manage with his still-throbbing ribs and flipped the lock without leaving his seat. \"It's open,\" he said finally, trying to steel himself up to lie to the man he loved as the door swung open. Got to get this right. He can't know, it'll hurt him too much. He'll send me away, I know it. I have to lie. I have to. I hate to.[Chapter 2] Sky Captain was in the room instantly, observing his obvious injuries with a raised eyebrow. \"Well? Who do I need to kill?\" \"It was an accident. Nobody's responsible.\" \"Oh, all right then,\" he agreed sarcastically, staring at him for a few seconds before continuing. \"Don't lie to me, Dex. I can tell.\" \"I'm not lying,\" he said, trying to sound somewhere between calm and annoyed. \"I was working on the phones. I put my finger in the wrong place, caught a little electricity, and fell off of the ladder. I had the glass in my hand, you know, because I was working on it, and it broke when I hit the floor. No big deal. Really, it's nothing to worry about.\" Joe shifted from foot to foot. Every ounce of him wanted his best friend to be telling him the truth, but he knew better. Something was very wrong here. The other man's voice, the rigid way he sat in his chair like he couldn't wait for him to leave, the flitting gaze that wouldn't meet his…none of that was Dex. He shook his head slowly. \"I really wish I could believe you, you know. I really do.\" \"It's the truth, Cap.\" He looked him up and down again, and this time caught something he hadn't before. \"All right. So say it is the truth. You were working on the phones, got shocked, fell down with some glass in your hand. Then you came up here to dress it, right?\" Dex nodded a little too eagerly. \"Then where did that burn on your arm come from?\" \"What?\" Buy time, buy time, think, stupid, think! \"What burn do you mean?\" \" This burn, Dex,\" he growled, grabbing his arm and twisting it as he pulled so that they could both clearly see the three-inch-long section where there was virtually no skin left. \"This god-awful thing that looks like you've been fighting a dragon without a shield. Did you light the telephone room on fire as well?\" \"Oh! Uh, no. I did that earlier today.\" He hated this, abhorred lying to this man, loathed telling untruths to his Sky Captain, to Joe, to the only real friend - with the possible exceptions of Frankie and a puppy he'd had for three days before his father kicked it down the stairs and killed it – he had ever had. It was necessary, though. He would lose everything if anyone knew about the darkness his worst tormentors lurked in. \"Ah. I see.\" He sat down on the edge of the mattress and leaned forward interrogatively, Dex's arm still caught in his grasp. \"Tell me…is there a special reason that you decided to go work on the telephone system with an open lesion? You might have at least gotten it bandaged first.\" \"I, uh…I don't know,\" he attempted. \"It didn't seem that bad at the time. The phones were down, though, and I thought you might try to call for a ride if Polly got annoying and you'd been drinking. I didn't want you to drive home drunk, so I figured I'd fix the phones first.\" It was a good try, Joe had to admit. If he hadn't known him so well, he might have believed it. He could still smell a hint of burned flesh, however, and a fleeting glance over the desktop gave him a good idea of where it was coming from. \"Well, I guess that's believable enough,\" he conceded, releasing the wrist he'd been holding. \"I'll let you get back to bed. Sorry I bothered you, Dex.\" He swung his hand purposefully towards the hot plate as he spoke, acting as if he were only going to push himself up from the bed. \"Careful! That's hot!\" Dex warned him without thinking, knowing only that the pilot was about to fry his palm. He pushed him away from the offending heater an instant before he realized that he'd given himself away. \"Ah, crud,\" he whispered as Joe's eyes drilled into his knowingly. \"Do you always leave that on, then? Seems like a good way to torch the building, especially with as much paper as you've got lying around.\" He spoke quietly, gently, attempting to fill the silence as the man across from him tried to collect himself. \"Why, Dex?\" \"It doesn't matter, Joe. It's past.\" \"Which is why you're still beating yourself up over it.\" \"Sure. Whatever.\" \"You hide it very well, whatever it is,\" he complimented him. \"Better than I do.\" Dex's head shot up. \"Huh? If you mean the nightmares-\" \"Yes, the nightmares. I can't hide them, at least not from you. From the others, yes, because I don't trust them with that knowledge. You, though…well.\" He shrugged. \"It's different. At least I thought it was.\" \"It is different…Joe…I didn't mean to…I mean, I never told…please…\" \"Please what? I'm not mad at you, Dex.\" \"Please don't make me tell,\" he begged, his eyes brimming over. He reached out with his thumb and wiped the single tear that fell onto his cheek. \"Tell what?\" \"You know what.\" \"No, I don't. Only you do.\" He paused. \"I think you should tell me.\" \"It's not really any of your business, you know,\" he tried to retort, hoping that anger would push Joe off the topic. \"You've made it my business.\" \"How so?\" \"By letting me be your friend.\" \"That's lame, Cap. It's lame and you know it.\" \"No, it isn't. You and I are both painfully careful about who we let into our lives, who we let really see us. I know you've told me things before that you have told no other living soul, and that you probably never will. I've shared in the same way with you. In that way, we've made ourselves responsible for each other, by choice . So when I walk down a hallway and hear you beating yourself to a pulp, I think I have a right to know why. Even if I didn't have, you would still need to tell me, for your own good.\" His voice dropped. \"You can't keep doing this to yourself, Dex,\" he pleaded. \"I imagine you've been doing it for a very long time now, but you have to stop. What if you really hurt yourself next time? What if you kill yourself next time? Well?\" \"The world would move on, and probably be better for it.\" \"Fuck the world.\" \"Exactly. They wouldn't care. I'd be a sidebar at best.\" He smirked wryly. \"The guy you hired to replace me would probably get more press.\" \"Fine. So let's say they turn a blind eye. Forget the rest of the world for a moment. What do you think happens to me?\" He looked up at him from beneath his eyebrows. \"You're Sky Captain, for Christ sake, Joe. You'd move on, because it's what the world would expect you to do, would tell you to do. And you'd do it, for reasons of sheer survival. You've lost plenty of friends before now, and you're fine. You would be fine if you lost another.\" \"None of them were you,\" Joe said simply. \"And if it ever is you that I lose, I will be far from fine.\" He grabbed the hand that didn't have pieces of glass sticking out of it and applied pressure. \"Just imagining the torture that living in a world without you in it somewhere would be is worse than anything that haunts my actual memories, Dex.\" He watched him for a long time, neither one speaking. \"I'm sorry,\" he whispered finally, closing his eyes. \"I don't want to do this, you know. I just…can't control it sometimes.\" \"You've never shown it in front of anyone that I'm aware of.\" \"It's different in front of people. I have this…this goody two-shoes, perfect little sidekick image that everyone expects me to keep up all the time, and I don't dare damage that. It would be bad for everyone involved, and I don't want anyone to get hurt by it. Least of all you.\" \"So you hurt yourself instead, when no one's around to see or hear.\" \"I guess. Yeah. Better me than someone else. No one ever questions my excuses, and I can usually stop before it gets too bad.\" \"And tonight? Is this 'not too bad'?\" \"…No,\" he admitted. \"But it hadn't popped up in a long time, either, so I'm not surprised.\" \"Is this the worst it's been?\" He almost laughed. \"No. No, I got away with the worst one. Do you remember when I got run off the road coming back from that conference in Boston?\" \"Yes. You were in surgery for three hours and in the hospital for weeks afterwards.\" He shuddered as he recalled how pale, how fragile Dex had seemed lying on that impersonal gurney, eyes closed in a coma the doctors refused to guarantee he would come out of. \"It was awful.\" \"Yeah, well…There wasn't another car.\" A pained expression crossed Joe's face. \"You drove into that tree on purpose,\" he murmured. \" Why , Dex? For God's sake, why?\" \"Part of me meant to do it. Another part was screaming like crazy to hit the brakes.\" \"You could have been killed. You nearly were killed.\" \"That was the point, I'm pretty sure.\" He shrugged and smiled wanly. \"It didn't work, though.\" \"…Why?\" \"Simple physics. I wasn't going fast enough, and I forgot to unbuckle my seatbelt.\" He cringed. \"You know I meant why did you do it.\" \"Look…\" Dex shifted in his chair, biting at his already punctured lip. \"Did…did your parents ever hit you?\" \"If I deserved it, yes, my parents believed in corporal punishment.\" \"But only if you really deserved it.\" \"Yes.\" \"Must have been nice.\" Their eyes met, but after a second Dex tore away and concentrated on turning off the hot plate. Sky Captain watched to make sure he didn't 'accidently' brush against it in the process before speaking. \"Mother or father?\" he asked finally. \"Both. Dad was the really bad one. Mom was silent when she hit me, and it wasn't so bad that way for some reason, but he'd call me every name in the book. It was like the more he talked the angrier he got, too. Mom would shove me around some and get bored, but Dad…he was different.\" \"How did you get away?\" \"I didn't. They left me alone in the apartment one night when I was thirteen. Told me they were going to a movie. They did that sometimes, so I didn't think anything of it. That night it just so happened that they never came back. They vanished. They pawned everything with any real value, then…poof. Gone.\" \"Surely you were too young to be left to your own devices. Didn't anyone intervene?\" \"I'd been given early admission at M.I.T. right before they left. I had a scholarship for once school started, and there were only a few weeks of summer left, so they let me move into the dorms early. It was easier for everyone to just not ask why my parents left in the first place.\" \"My bloody little genius,\" Joe whispered affectionately. \"Literally and metaphorically, as it were.\" Dex just shrugged. \"I didn't ask for it, you know.\" \"I know.\" \"I think that might be why they did what they did. My parents, I mean. I think I was scary to them, always tearing things apart so I could put them back together differently. When I was eight, all mom could talk about was getting a radio. That's all we heard all summer long, was how great it would be if we could afford one. Dad said we couldn't, but I wanted to make her happy. So I built one for her for Christmas. It wasn't pretty to look at, but it worked.\" Sky Captain gaped at him. \"You… how? \" \"There was this alley a few blocks away that was always full of old junk. I found a couple of broken ones there, and took them apart so I could see how they worked. I looked at a few books down at the library, too, and just kind of faked it from there. Like I said, it wasn't very nice looking, but it did what it was supposed to do. I thought she'd like it.\" \"Didn't she?\" \"She wouldn't touch it. Her and dad gave each other this weird look and mom kind of choked out a thank you. She wouldn't go into the living room so long as it was there. That night after I went to bed and I heard dad say he was going to take care of it. It was gone the next morning.\" \"Didn't you ask what he'd done with it?\" \"I was afraid he'd hit me.\" \"My God. Dex, that's a terrible story.\" He smiled sadly. \"It got better after I started college. At least there no one beat me up. I learned how to read who would appreciate the stuff I came up with. Most of the other students were jealous of the attention I got from the professors, so I didn't really have any friends, but it wasn't so bad. Having no social life gave me a lot of time to study.\" \"What about that Robbie fellow you introduced me to once? Didn't you say you two were friends at school?\" \"Yeah, Robbie was okay. I always got the idea that he hung out with me because I made a good study partner. That, and I let him copy my homework sometimes.\" \"Oh. So…not really a friend.\" \"I didn't tell him anything, if that's what you're wondering. I did a year or so of freelance work – that's how I met Frankie - and then she introduced me to you.\" He smiled. \"Someone who actually understood me.\" \"I don't understand this, though, Dex. I don't understand why you hurt yourself. You're free of him. It's over.\" \"We're never free of our past, Joe. You of all people ought to know that.\" Sky Captain's shoulders slumped. \"I hate hearing you say that with such conviction.\" \"Sorry.\" \"It's not your fault, I just…\" Standing, he paced the small room in agitation. \"I'm going to tell you something I swore I never would,\" he announced finally. \"All right.\" He knelt before him and gently took both of his hands up. \"The whole time I was in that hell of a prison camp, do you know what I kept thinking?\" \"What?\" Dex whispered back. He hated the haunted look the other man always wore when he talked about those months, but he didn't dare stop him, not when he seemed so determined to speak. \"I kept thinking, thank God you got held up by that visiting General and didn't make it to the flight line in time to leave. I've never forgotten that you were supposed to go with me that day, and I have never been more grateful for anything in my life than for the fact that you didn't end up there with me. I thought…I thought I had been spared the pain of watching you be hurt like that. But I was wrong.\" He laid his head against the seated man's knees. \"The damage was already done, long before, and I never knew. You've been punishing yourself for someone else's crimes all this time. I can't stand it, Dex. I really can't.\" \"I'm sorry. I can't help it. It just takes over, and I…I can't stop it.\" \"You stopped it tonight.\" \"Only because you came in. It hides when other people are around, especially if it's people who might actually give a damn.\" \"I want you to make me a promise, Dex,\" Sky Captain requested, meeting his eyes after a moment's thought. \"What is it, Cap?\" \"From now on, when you feel it starting, you find me. If I'm not here, you find someone , anyone, and you stay near people until it gives up. Please, please don't do this to yourself anymore. Don't let it control you.\" \"I can't promise that, Joe. I'm sorry, but I can't always stop it. I wish I could.\" \"Will you try, at least?\" \"Sometimes it's better to just let it out,\" he explained. \"If I let it build up, if I force it back into its box, it's worse when it finally does take over. That's how I ended up crashing the car.\" \"But you never had anyone to talk to about it, right?\" \"Well, no.\" \"Now you do. Maybe that will take away its power. Will you try that for me? Talk it out with me when it tries to overwhelm you?\" He nodded slowly. \"Okay. I don't think it will work, but…\" \"Yes?\" \"You know I'd do anything you asked, Cap. I'll try.\" \"Good boy, Dex,\" he murmured, cupping the side of his face briefly. \"Now,\" he went on, straightening as his attitude switched back to business. \"Do you have any bandages in here?\"[Chapter 3] \"Ow,\" Dex complained as Sky Captain dabbed at his broiled arm with an alcohol-soaked cotton ball. \"Hold still, damn it.\" \"I'm trying. That hurts.\" \"Well, don't hold your arm against a hot plate again and this will be the only time you have to worry about it.\" He grimaced as dead skin peeled off beneath his ministrations. \"What were you planning on telling the others when they asked what happened?\" \"What I told you. Why, is it no good?\" \"It will probably work on them.\" \"It didn't work on you.\" \"I know you too well.\" \"Mmm. True.\" He tried not to flinch as the other man taped a piece of gauze securely over the burn. \"Thanks.\" \"Don't thank me yet, I'm not done. Let me see your hand.\" \"Maybe I should just go to the infirmary for that in the morning.\" \"No, you'll drive the glass in deeper while you're sleeping. You could nick a tendon.\" He looked up as his engineer swallowed heavily at the thought of disabling his hand. \"Now you see why I don't want you doing things like this anymore.\" \"It's not exactly my idea of a fun night either, Cap.\" \"I know,\" he sighed. \"Lie down on the bed.\" \"Huh?\" \"This might bleed a fair bit. I don't want you to fall if you pass out.\" \"Yeah, I guess that makes sense.\" He stood up to move to the bed, giving Joe an odd look when he stopped him. \"What?\" \"Take this off,\" the pilot ordered as he began to unbutton his shirt for him. \"It'll be hell to get the stains out otherwise.\" \"Jeez, how much blood do you think you're fixing to see?\" Dex joked half-heartedly as agile fingers tripped down his stomach, untucking as they went. He shoved away the pleasure that rippled through him at the touch, having a bit more difficulty controlling himself than he normally did when the Captain was near. What the hell is wrong with me, thinking like that when he's just trying to help? Christ. I'm such a pervert. He shook his head sharply, trying to clear his mind of the fact that he was being undressed by the man he'd desired for years. It's no use. Just let things be as they are. It's good enough this way. \"Much more than I'd like to see, I'm sure. Now lie down.\" Once he'd been obeyed, Joe pulled the chair up to the side of the bed and directed the desk lamp's light onto his task. Cradling slender, blood-splattered fingers gently in one hand, he gripped the first shard of glass with a pair of tweezers and pulled it smoothly out. \"Son of a bitch !\" He almost laughed hearing an expletive in that voice. \"I'm sorry, but it's going to hurt, love.\" He hid his shock at having let that final word slip by yanking out another sliver, flinching along with his patient. Dex didn't answer, silenced partly by a desire to not look like a baby and partly by the term of endearment that had just fled the other man's lips. Taking a deep breath and letting it out in a sigh, he closed his eyes and tried to ignore the way his pulse quickened every time Joe squeezed his fingers in preparation for another removal. \"I think that's all of it,\" Sky Captain said eventually, turning the shredded limb under the light to be certain. \"Do you feel like there's anything else in there?\" He flexed his fingers cautiously. \"It feels okay. I mean, as okay as it really can right now.\" He looked up at him warily. \"You're not going to stitch it, are you?\" \"I'm terrible at sutures.\" \"I know. That's why I asked with such dread.\" \"That part will wait until morning, I think,\" Joe conceded, rolling his eyes at Dex's comment. \"It isn't bleeding as much as I thought it might.\" He bandaged the wounds as he spoke, then placed the hand on his patient's stomach with a soft pat. \"What's next?\" \"Everything else is just bruises, mostly.\" \"You didn't hit your head on anything, did you?\" \"Yeah, but not hard.\" Joe's mouth tightened. \"Well, you're not acting concussed, so I won't worry about it. I'm not leaving you alone in any case tonight,\" he added as he began to untie his boots. \"…You're not?\" Dex queried, lifting his head slightly to watch him. \"Of course not.\" \"Cap, you don't have to-\" \"Dex, have you ever left me alone after I've had a nightmare? Or, at first, after a flashback?\" \"Well, no, but-\" \" I'm not leaving you alone ,\" he repeated in a tone that left no room for argument. \"So slide over, would you?\" Dex lay absolutely rigid as the blankets were pulled up over him and an arm rested along his waist. Resisting the urge to roll onto his side and just begin smothering the other man with kisses took every ounce of strength he had. He was fighting his body's attempts to react to the warm figure beside him so consciously that he nearly fell out of the narrow bed when muttered words brushed against his ear. \"Relax, Dex. It's not like I'm going to rape you.\" He bit back a moan. It's not rape if you like it, he lamented silently. Joe's consoling words only made his predicament worse, and he found himself grinding his teeth in a last ditch effort to keep from betraying his arousal. Sky Captain hoisted himself up on one arm and peered down. \"What the hell is going on? You're as stiff as a board. If you're in that much pain, I'll go get you something stronger than aspirin. Just say so.\" \"I'm fine, Cap. Really,\" he ground out. His jaw was going to be cramped beyond all belief in the morning at this rate. \"Don't worry about it.\" This makes no sense, Joe puzzled. He's lain next to me until I fell asleep after nightmares at least a hundred times, so it can't be that he's disgusted by sharing a bed with me. We're wearing more clothes than normal, for heaven's sake. Unless… An understanding grin suddenly lit up his face. Not turned off. Turned on . \"…Why are you smiling like that?\" Dex asked nervously, staring up at him. \"The roles are reversed, aren't they?\" \"Huh?\" \"You're used to being the consoler, the one giving comfort, not receiving it.\" He slid his hand up and dug his nails suggestively into the other man's chest. Unable to miss the tiny gasp the action caused, he smirked knowingly. \"It's nice to be on the receiving end once in a while, isn't it?\" he went on, nudging himself forward until he knew Dex could feel his hardness. \"Joe…this is bad…\" \"It's very much not bad. Trust me. I know. It's very, very good.\" In an instant he was straddling him, leaning forward until barely an inch separated their mouths. \"Is that something else he would hit you for? For looking at other boys?\" The instant the words were spoken he knew he'd struck a nerve, because his engineer closed his eyes and turned his face away. \"No,\" he whispered sweetly, levering his head back to where it had been. \"It's all right. Forget him. Forget that bastard. Look at me. Look at me. I love you.\" \"You can't…\" \"Why not?\" \"This could ruin everything.\" \"It won't.\" \"If someone finds out-\" \"They won't. I promise.\" \"You can't. If Polly-\" \"Leave Polly to me. She's annoying, yes, but I know how to make her squeal. She'll never know. No one will.\" \"Believe it or not, the thought of you sleeping with Polly doesn't help,\" Dex said archly. \"She's a reporter, Joe, she's not stupid.\" \"Then let her find out, if she cares that much. I don't. We're both painfully well-off, Dex. In the absolute worst case scenario we buy an estate in some Godforsaken poor country and the rest of our lives fucking in every corner of it. Forget everyone else. I love you, and I will be with you now that I know you want it too.\" \"…You would really do that? Leave everything we've built here just to be with me?\" \"Why do you think I've come home all these years? It's always been you. Always. I just never thought you'd feel the same.\" \"I felt that way, too. Ever since the first day, Joe. All I ever wanted was you.\" \"Mmm. All those wasted opportunities.\" He bent down into the sweetest kiss he'd ever imagined possible. The fingers of Dex's good hand trailed down his jawline, broadcasting passionate heat as they went, then lingered on his collar when they pulled apart. \"You taste amazing,\" Joe breathed, slipping one knee up between the other man's legs before he returned to the assault on his mouth. \"You're mine, Dex?\" The words came out as a question rather than a statement, and his engineer smiled up at him brilliantly. \"All yours, Cap. Always and forever.\" It was going to be a good night, after all. ","Summary":" To everyone who knew him, he was the epitome of control.

I was his next door neighbour but we saw each other about once a week. I did happen to take up quite a few contracts that my sister passed my way though so I wasn't home a lot. How Frank managed the whole domestic living thing I don't know. I couldn't survive in my house with nothing to do all day. Luckily I still retained a membership to the Contract Killers Society. Contract Killers Weekly was such a great magazine. I could brush up on my technique and it relieved boredom. \"I need some gardening tips\" he said. \"Gardening tips? Since when were you a gardener? How am I supposed to know anything about plants?\" I said in disbelief. What on earth? Frank never expressed an interest in gardening before. I certainly didn't know anything about plants apart from how to hack them apart. \"Your sister's a keen gardener\" he retorted. \"That doesn't make me one\" I replied. While Victoria was content living in high society, I was not. Not that she could hang up a gun as much as I could. Even an English lady needed to have an outlet. \"Why are you suddenly obsessed with growing a plant anyway?\" I asked. Something must have sparked this interest in him. He certainly had no green fingers before. \"I wanted to have a hobby. You know to relieve boredom\" he lied. No no no. Frank Moses couldn't lie to me. I have an in-built Frank Moses lie detector. You relieve boredom by going to a shooting range. Not waiting for a plant to grow for hours on end. \"You're lying, Frank. Don't try to deny it. Why are you so interested in horticulture?\" I asked. \"There. There may be. There may be a girl\" he slowly admitted. Oh god. Not another Katya. Katya Petrokovich was an utter bitch. Damn her Russian suave that ensnared Frank. He was utterly clueless about the fact she was KGB. I did try to warn him but of course he didn't listen. Love was Frank's greatest weakness. I loved him myself but I could never tell him that. His interest in me was only platonic. He never made any advances towards me like he did with his other girlfriends. I satisfied myself with keeping him safe. Well as relatively safe as anyone could be if you were an operative. I will admit I did and do project my hate onto any of his admirers. Katya, I admit is adept at ensnaring men. \"Who?\" I demanded to know. I made it my business to vet his admirers. I did my best with Katya but he wouldn't listen. \"Her name's Sarah. Sarah Ross. She works in pension services\" he said. \"What? A civilian? You're in love with a civilian?\" I asked in disbelief. I couldn't believe this. He'd fallen for an ordinary run of the mill woman? He'd allowed his romantic fantasies to cloud his judgement. He was an operative through and through just like me. He might do a good job now of giving up his occupation but I could tell how restless he was getting. How long before he would snap and pick up a rifle? He would never be able to tell his girlfriend what he actually did for a living. The CIA laws prevented it. He would be hunted down and killed otherwise. We were RED. Retired: Extremely Dangerous. Not that the CIA was in habit of letting secrets out. There were a clandestine agency after all. If we let one secret spill then we were dead. Simple as. We were too good to be comprised. We may be retired but part of the contract we signed up for was to be able to be called upon in the event of a national emergency no matter what our condition. That code was still in effect now. \"Yes, I am. You have a problem with that?\" He asked, angrily. \"Yes. As a matter of fact I do. Your whole relationship will be based on lies, Frank. They say honesty is the best policy in them. You will never be able to pick up another contract or go to the shooting range. What happens when someone tracks you down and tries to kill you? You'll be putting Sarah in danger everyday but being with her and she'll never know. Even if you tell her, which you can't, she'll never truly understand the risks\" I ranted. A relationship between an operative and a civilian was doomed to fail. There would be so many secrets and a whole part of your life you could never tell you partner and that they would never understand. A relationship couldn't withstand that. \"I can see whoever I damn like. Stuck sticking your nose in my private affairs, Tare\" he demanded. \"Fine, I will. Goodbye\" I shouted. I always tried to look out for him and look where it got me. He wouldn't be seeing me anytime soon. I was taking a long extended holiday. One with murder, mystery and intrigue. Also one with hopefully a large pay check. ","Summary":" \"Frank, what is so urgent and why do you have a bonsai plant?\" I asked.

As always dedicated to my lovely RED muse, Katie, and to Miniatures who dragged me out of the house today and got me to write! Enjoy! \"We're going under cover,\" Frank announces, on what Cooper had thought was shaping up to be a promising afternoon, before dumping a pile of worn and dog eared paperbacks on his pristine desk. \"Sorry, what?\" He eyes the books as though they may be a figment of his imagination, a hallucination from too many hours of work and not enough sleep. They don't change, they don't disappear, and Frank continues to watch him expectantly. \"Undercover. Ivan wants our help and I owe him,\" \"What about Maldovia—\" \"Different favor.\" \"Still not sure how I'm being dragged into this.\" Cooper protests and Frank grins at him, wide and completely unnerving. \"You're cute .\" Cooper chokes. On air. It's an embarrassing element to add to a surreal conversation. \"With the cute hair,\" Frank continues, not even trying to hide his amusement. \"And ass.\" \" What .\" \"It's how the junior agents gossip about you in the break room.\" Frank continues, completely oblivious to Cooper's crisis. The blush blazing across his face is enough to keep him distracted from the swoop of disappointment that this is coming from his coworkers and not Frank. It's more bizarre to consider Frank calling his hair cute of his own volition. \"I don't.\" He cringes. \"How the hell did you find out about it?\" \"I hear things.\" Frank slumps into the seat across his desk. He grabs one of the paperbacks idly flipping through it. \" How . You're not even supposed to be here!\" Franks grin is shark like. Cooper ignores the thrill he gets at it. \"I visit you all the time and no one's noticed.\" Some people have. Like his assistant, but that's because she thinks Frank is Coopers 'older hot boyfriend'. Cooper hasn't told Frank. For many reasons. He runs a hand over his eyes and sighs. He doesn't have the kids this weekend so it's not like he's booked full. It wouldn't kill him to hear Frank out, right? \"So how do you fit into this then, if I'm the cute one?\" \"Marvin suggested sugar daddy .\" \"Please tell me you're joking.\" Frank chuckles at the horror clear in his voice. \"Don't worry kid, Ivan decided against that one. You're a little old for a sugar daddy.\" Honestly Cooper is torn between relieved and offended. \"Which leaves…\" \"Older boyfriend, retired military.\" Frank grabs one of the books and tosses it to him. If not for his reflexes he'd probably have dropped the book. His mind is still stuck at the beginning of the conversation and struggling to catch up. The cover of the book has an older man, sans shirt, with his arms (bulging muscles included) wrapped around a petite red head with breasts falling out of her dress. Love's torrid affair is scrawled across it, followed by the authors name. Pen name he's guessing since he's not sure who would name their child Constance Tempte. \"And the books are for,\" \"Research.\" Frank confirms what Cooper had been dreading. He's already nose deep in a slightly less worn copy of something that looks suspiciously like pirates. \"To come up with a back story.\" \"How deep under cover are we going ?\" Cooper has long since passed the point where he should be questioning what he's gotten himself into, but Frank Moses has a way of blinding him to the obvious. Then he really takes in the dog eared pages and cracked spine and realizes something. \"You've read all of these already haven't you?\" He demands. Frank props the book on his chest and rubs the back of his head, sheepish. \"Sarah was into them and I had nothing better to do.\" He shrugs. \"And I got a little…addicted. \" \"So you really came here to start a book club.\" Cooper grins, teasing. \"I could call in Amelia from down the hall; I think she's into this kind of erotica too.\" \"We all have our vices.\" Frank defends, very clearly sulking. \"I think we can come up with a believable backstory without resorting to,\" he glances over a few of the other titles. \" The Dukes healing touch- really? Did they just pin up a bunch of words and throw darts at them?\" Frank scowls. \"Sarah liked them.\" \"I can't believe you flirted with Sarah via sappy romance novels.\" \"The point is that they're so bad they're good .\" Frank protests but Cooper's brain is stuck once again on the pile of books covering his desk. There's a hopeful little voice at the back of his head that's pointing out what is suddenly rather obvious. \"You know,\" Cooper says slowly, toying with the spine of the book. \"These would be terrible backstories.\" Frank looks like he's ready to argue, but it's solely for show because Cooper is onto him. \"There are easier ways to flirt with me.\" He continues before Frank can interrupt. The older man's mouth clicks shut and he's suddenly having trouble meeting Cooper's eyes. \"Instead of making up a favor you owe Ivan.\" \"Hey,\" Frank protests. \"That's real. You agreed to help me out kid; you're not getting out of it that easy.\" \"That's fine.\" He tosses the book back on his desk, checking his watch. It's a decent time to take his break; he doubts anyone will miss him if he slips out now. \"But if you want to flirt with me I'd rather it be over a beer and a burger at the pub down the street.\" Frank's gaze is hopeful when it finally meets his own. \"Yeah?\" \"I think I can spare some time for the infamous Moses charm.\" He teases. Frank rises to his feet as he comes around the desk and for a moment he swears that the older man is about to step into his space and show him the Moses charm. Instead he smirks, like he knows what Cooper is thinking, and holds the door open for him. \"I'm a complete gentleman on a first date,\" his grin widens. \"Yeah I heard about how you kidnapped Sarah and drove cross country.\" \"Just for that you're paying for our second date.\" \"Second date? You seem pretty sure of yourself.\" They head out the door.

Short, sweetm and to the point. Disclaimer: I own nothing, but the plot. \"Eleven million people are gonna die if you don't help me,\" Moses informs before throwing the gun to his enemy. Han immediately points the gun towards the one that betrayed him so long ago. He hesitates and at first he doesn't know why, but then he thinks about it. Eleven million is a large number and to apply that to people is very large. Sure, he's killed plenty of people, men and women, so it's no big deal, but children, he hasn't killed a child. He was never in that business, he could never be. He mentally shakes his head and focuses on the man in front of him. He's the cause of Han losing everything that mattered to him. He was engaged to a beautiful woman that he met when she was shopping, buying herbs for her next dish. At first he thought she knew nothing of his dangerous world, but after merely a few weeks assassins came. At first he thought it was for himself, being in the risky business he was in, and did everything he could to protect her when she came in firing guns like a pro. He didn't know he could fall more in love with her, but he did. Then Frank Moses happened and she broke it off with him and he truly became alone due to losing her. He was made a pariah. Eleven million people... that includes men, women, and children. Children who don't know the evils of the world, that play the day away without any worries to burden their minds. Children that don't deserve to die. Babies that haven't even taken their first steps, said their first words. Newborns that bring mothers and fathers joy. If he had a chance of preventing that and they died, how could he live with himself? He would never be able to shed the guilt with all of this weighing on his mind. 20 million dollars for killing one man and cause those deaths or save their lives and keep those children from dying unnecessary deaths? He had a younger brother who was merely 12 when he died. He doesn't want anyone to feel that pain. He betrayed you! Screams a part of him. 11 million people! Shouts another part of him. With a shout he brings the gun down before lifting his gaze. Frank's eyes holds a sort of triumph and respect. HAT: That's a wrap!

It was such a hard decision. I knew if I spurned Tare, Victoria would kill me for breaking her sister's heart. She'd probably succeed. No one had underestimated Victoria Winsler and lived to tell the tale. Sarah was so kind and caring. She made me think I could actually have a normal life. Tare, on the other hand had been my friend for years. We'd saved each other's lives countless times. I always knew I could count on her to have my back. Really it was a toss between the lives I wanted. I couldn't be a contract killer and stay with Sarah. She wouldn't be able to deal with all the violence and I would be putting her in harm's way. Tare couldn't handle a normal life. She was a warrior and hooked on the adrenaline rush. She was incapable of adjusting like Victoria had and I knew it. She would get too restless and eventually snap or would get a mundane job which would kill her spirit. Ultimately it was a question of who I loved the most. Deep in my heart I knew it was Tare. I loved the idea of having a normal life and I knew Sarah could give me that but I didn't love her. I would just be condemning myself to a live of what ifs. I had been with the CIA nearly all my life and I wasn't going to stop being a killer now. Victoria was right. It wasn't like you could switch a button. I'd been trained as an operative and I couldn't just stop being one. Being with Tare would make me happier than Sarah ever would. Tare knew that. I guess that's why she'd been warning me away from Sarah. I'd been trying to change for her. Restraining myself nearly got ourselves killed by the CIA. I would get us all killed if I kept Sarah with me. She deserved a normal life where people weren't trying to kill her because of her association with me. Tare would be ecstatic when I told her. She'd never been discreet about her hatred towards Sarah but she always protected her. If you were an operative then there generally was two things you needed in a partner. One was for them to be an operative too. Civilians never understood our lifestyle and the reasons why we risked our lives. Two was for them to have a heart. Being in the business of death took its toll in the worst way. It could turn the most caring person in the world to an emotionless killer. One was easy but two was not. Tare was both. A rarity.

Based on a man I saw on my way to school last winter, standing atop a pile of snow and shovelling into an empty drive way. This probably isn't what he was doing, but I like my version more. For Katie cause I rarely get to see her and she is my Frank/Cooper muse. Disclaimer: Nope, don't own. Cooper stands in the doorway, mug of coffee clutched in his hands to keep them warm, steam rising up from it in curling, wispy streams. There's a cool breeze going this early in the morning, picking up the loose bits of snow off the ground and swirling them around the street. A few people are out, shovelling their walks, climbing into their cars to head to work. It's his rare day off and he should still be curled up in bed beside a grumpy, retired Agent. Instead his bare feet are threatening frost bite from where he's balanced on the door step wrapped up in a pair of sweat pants and one of Frank's old wool sweaters, watching the man in question. He's fairly certain Frank has lost his mind. Cooper continues to stand there and watch as Frank stands atop a large pile of snow, easily four or five feet high, and shovels snow from their drive way. Directly into their neighbours drive way. He's pretty sure Frank is muttering angrily to himself. \"What the hell are you doing?\" Cooper finally calls out, curling his toes in an attempt to get the circulation going again. He's pretty sure they've turned blue but he doesn't want to pull his gaze away from the crazy man standing on the mountain of snow lest he fall, or do something even crazier. Frank calls something back but with his back turned it gets swallowed up by the wind. Cooper huffs and goes back inside, shoves his feet into the nearest pair of boots and wanders outside. \"What?\" He asks once he's balanced precariously next to Frank on the mountain of snow. His coffee is safe inside in the hall and he misses it already. \"I said,\" Frank pauses in his shovelling and presses a quick kiss to Cooper's cold cheek. \"What are you doing up?\" \"I was looking for my life size heater.\" Cooper replies. \"Who had disappeared on me; that doesn't answer my question though.\" \"What was your question?\" Frank asks, distracted as he starts shovelling again. He scoops up a large pile and, with a slight manic look in his eyes, tosses it over the fence into their neighbours drive. From here Cooper can already see the growing pile. He's clearly been at it for a while. \"What the hell are you doing to Mr. Duvals yard?\" Frank grins, all teeth, and Cooper is reminded eerily of a shark going in for the kill. \"Woke up this morning and he'd tossed all his snow into our drive.\" He hefts another bunch over. \"Fourth day in a row. Figured it was time for some payback.\" \"So you're inciting a snow shovelling war.\" Cooper says slowly just to be certain he understands what's happening. Frank doesn't even pause. \"Yup.\" \"You're going to throw out your back.\" He points out. \"I'll be fine.\" \"And then you won't be able to do anything strenuous like one of Victoria's jobs,\" Frank keeps shovelling. \"Or fucking me against the table.\" Frank pauses. Cooper tries hard not to laugh. \"Hell,\" he continues. \"You're not that young anymore, so it would probably take a while to heal and we wouldn't want you to put any further strain on it so that probably means sex is out of the option entirely.\" Frank narrows his gaze at him, pushing the shovel into the snow and resting his weight on it as he studies the younger man. He knows exactly what Cooper is doing and the best part is, is that he's letting him. Cooper has him right where he wants him. \"What are you suggesting?\" Frank asks and Cooper grins, sly. \"I'm suggesting that you come back to bed and let me warm you up.\" He slides a hand around the back of Frank's neck, curving his palm around his skull and tugs him in for a brief warm kiss with the barest hint of tongue. \"And then,\" he continues, pulling back only far enough to speak. \"We sit down and plot out our revenge properly. I think two CIA agents can come up with something a little better than passive aggressive snow shovelling.\" Frank barks out a laugh and gives him a light shove. Cooper slides his way down the pile (somewhat gracefully) and waits for Frank to grab the shovel and follow him inside. \"I like the way you think kid.\" The older man crowds him through the door way, stripping off his winter gear as he goes. \"Now, let's get back to bed.\" Cooper grins and races him back upstairs. His coffee sits there for the next few hours, completely forgotten. ","Summary":" A/N- Rated for language and suggestive themes.

She feels the pain rip through her stomach before it even registers in her mind that she's been shot. She presses her palm to the wound, the dampness of the blood seeps through her fingers and she realises this is the end. She can't go any longer, she's injured. It bothers her slightly but at the same time it doesn't. She's prepared herself for this for years. She always knew this moment would come, it was all part of the job description. Yes she was good at her job but she wasn't immune to the injuries she could sustain sometimes, getting shot was something she had to deal with. She reflects as she walks away, the crimson stain getting bigger on her white dress how the team got back together. The day Frank turned up out of the blue, his lady friend in tow and their old friends Joe and Marvin. It felt strange all being together, like they'd gone back a couple of years. It was funny how Frank turned to her when he was injured because he knew she'd be able to help. It was ironic she found herself in the same situation but unable to do anything to help herself. Seeing the lock gate ahead, she braced herself. The end was near, the end was here. She swallowed hard when she heard the sound of a gun click. She told herself that she wasn't afraid, she wasn't scared of what might happen. She was going to die and she was okay with that, she'd taken on the CIA and this was her punishment; death. \"Anything I could help you with?\" The familiar voice of Ivan trailed through Victoria's thoughts and broke her out of a trance. Seeing him makes her feel quite emotional and as he picks her up and carries her away, she wraps her arms around his neck, \"I love you.\" She means it and perhaps she always had loved him from the moment they met (regardless of how cliché the whole thing sounded) She was thankful it was Ivan who came to her rescue, the only male she trusted enough to show her vulnerable side too. He takes her home where she changes into something loose fitting and tells her she'll be okay, he'll look after her. He cleans the wound gently, the touch of his fingers sending a small shiver down her spine. She gasps slightly in discomfort as he applies anti-septic to the wound and she bites her lower lip slightly. He apologies and for a minute there's nothing exchanged, the sound of their breathing filling the silence between them. \"Ivan,\" she whispers, their eyes meeting with each other, \"yes?\" There's a silence again, Victoria collecting her thoughts, \"thank you.\" He smiles at her before he presses his lips to her cheek and answers back; \"you're welcome.\" Ivan goes to move away before Victoria grabs his hand. Neither of them say anything to the other, they're just happy been in each others company. Happy they've got each other and nothing has to be said in order for them to feel something.

A pretty saucy young girl was staring at the red violin outside the shop window. Her eyes was as gorgeous as the black pearl. The antique shop is made of rosewood. It would make a super annoying noise if you wander on it. The steel bars had already rusted and looks like it was besmirched with blood. The grunge wired antique shop seems incompatible with trendiest Shanghai. The antique shop owned by an old black man. No one knows who he is, and no one knows why he came to China. People here are fear of him and nobody would like to talk with him except this girl. This girl is the regular, or we can say the only customer of this antique shop. She almost visits his shop everyday after class only to see the red violin. Entering the antique shop, the door creaked open and the soles of her beautiful red boots were squeaking on the linoleum. The heavy mahogany table and sideboards, the massive silver, the bright rag tugs on the shining floor were all in their accustomed places. The jewelry of inferior quality decorated the faded saffron-colored table cloth. The blue and white porcelain vast covered with a layer of ash randomly placed in a corner. Only the red violin was spotless and she could even see the gloss on the surface. The gramophone was playing some blue songs. The old black man was mopping the floor and waging his head with the music. \"Oh, come on! Would you generously give me just one day time without seeing you!\" the old man said as a steed is troubled by a horsefly. \"I will only if you sell it to me.\" the young girl said as a gold digger who would never stop until she get the buried treasure. \"I don't sell it because...because it will bring bad luck to its owner. Everyone who owns it will end up with miserable tragedy.\" the old black man said, and he was not looking at the girl but beyond her over her shoulder. \"I don't believe it! I love dancing with all my passion, my soul and heart. And I believe dance won't hurt me at all. If someone loves playing violin with all his passion, soul and heart, even the red violin won't hurt him. I'm sure the violin will bless him!\" Her face turned as a beetroot. \"Him? It seems like you have already chosen a owner for it. He loves playing violin with his passion, soul and heart?\" the old black guy chuckled and imitated the girl's tone. He tried hard to keep from laughing, the wrinkled face was twisted. She turned aside to hide her blushes, and said \"Believe me or not, he loves playing violin more than his life. But he stopped playing because of some reasons. He was meant to be an extraordinary violinist, and I have to help him.\" \"Oh?\" the old black man said, as he heard some interesting things. \"Sounds like an interesting story. If it's touching, I may consider selling the red violin.\" He stopped mopping, and seated on the opposite of the girl. \"His name is Gu Fan. We knew each other at a very young age because our parents were best friends and neighbors. His parents could be said to be the best violinists in China, and he was born with talent. And he practiced violin everyday not because his parents asked him to, but because of passion. The sound of his violin is like the twittering of sparrows. And when I heard the magic sound, I can see the clear spring running between the gorgeous mountains and the Milk Way in the vast universe. I love dance, and I can get the inspirations from his violin. Sometimes I can hear his violin in my room, and I would dance with the company of his violin. He was not very handsome actually, but he looked really charming when he played the violin. He told me violin was his life, and he was so determined.\" Thinking of the boy, she smiled as a child got her candy. The black man opened his mouth but didn't say a word. He listened, and the girls voice was like the spring flows in his heart. \"However; fate is often like to catch up people.\" she cleared her throat and her eyes lost glory. \"One day, when he competed in the national violin contest, his parent involved and died in a car accident when they hurried to see his performance. He was totally devastated and cannot help immersing himself in endless guilty. It's ridiculous for him to think if he didn't play the violin, his parents would not died. And since then, every time when he played the violin, he could see his dead parents and their miserable ending. He destroyed his beloved violin and I never heard his beautiful sound again.\" her sound was a little raucously now. The shining girl lost herself in the painful memories as she've cried her tears dry. \"It sounds like you fall in love with him, right? Just admit it.\" the old black man tried to enliven the atmosphere and kept her from the darkness of sorrow. \"I like him because he was my goal. I practiced hard and expected one day I could be as charming as him on the center of the stage to show my dream. I dreamed that one day I could dance with his violin.\" Ignored the little joke of the old black man, she said sincerely. Her eyes sparkled like the most shining star was in her eyes. \"I'm his only friend except violin, and I must help him to go through with this.\" She said as the climber sees the next mountain to conquer. \"I'm sure he will love this violin and it may help retrieve his life. Please, sell it and in return I will give you as much as I have.\" Her beautiful black eyes looked forward straightly as if she was thinking of something. \"OK, puss. You win, and it's yours. But it's not my duty if something goes wrong. Remember if something happens, just give it back to me!\" The black man said as if he is the strictest teacher in the world. \"Thank you! Mr. Morritz. I, I don't know what to say! But I really appreciate it! Thanks! You're really a nice man!\" the girl said as she finally found the love of her life. Her words are utterly incoherent because of the huge surprise. She ran to home in the midday sun, and the sweaty cloths made her uncomfortable. But now she could ignore everything except the violin. He lived in a three-bedroom villa in the countryside. It was not much of a place, a small, modernized, stucco villa, with a hot pebbly garden, and in it a stone basin with torpid gold-fish, and a statue of Venus against the wall. In the garden, she could see the azure blue sky, the colorful flowers blooming in profusion, and hear the sound of wind. She stood still before his house, calmed down and took a deep breath. Then she just knocked the door and came in. His room is clean and tidy; it's rare for a boy especially for him-he has to handle everything by himself after his parents died. But this room made her wants to escape, because there was nothing but furniture. It seemed like he left nothing in this room and his life: no magazines, no recreation equipment and the point is, no violin. The wall is white, the ceiling is white and everything in his room is white just like his pale face. But Lin likes bright colors, and she remembered Fan liked red when he was very little. Fan was standing wistfully by the window and gazing at the sky when she came in. \"A friend gave me a beautiful gift generously, Fan. And this is the most precious gift I have ever accepted. I want to give it to you, and I mean it.\" the girl said in a pretty low volume. Her eyes were twinkling like stars. Fan turned round and noticed the red violin. \"You haven't quitted yet, Lin. Why you're so stubborn. Why you still believe I could play it again even I don't believe myself? I cannot play it and I just cannot!\" \"You were just lost yourself in guilty and sorrow. I insisted because you're the most brilliant violinist I have ever seen. We grew up together and I knew you more than everyone else. I know your passion and I understand your sorrow inside. Your heart was once broken and there's a scar in your heart no one could touch. But let me help you heal this scar, please. Everyone will suffer the frustrations some day. Only by striding over this obstacle, can you move on to the bright future. I'll be with you, Fan.\" Lin said with sobs. She increased the volume spontaneously and she looked him in the eye as she could see through him. \"Mind your own business, please. Stop bothering me and I don't want to repeat it again and again,\" the boy said. He said calmly as he didn't have any emotional changes, and just stood still as if the girl was talking to a statue. \"Fan, you cannot waste your talent and let yourself down. Your parents wouldn't want to see you like that because they love you and wish you a happy life!\" the girl said loudly as she was using all her energy. \"Get out of my house, now!\" the boy shut like an aggressive lion. He goggled at the girl as she is a guilty criminal, and his body was slightly shivering without control. It's been a long time since the last he lost his temper, and he almost forgot how to shut. In his inner heart, the girl is like the treasure from the deep ocean which everyone wants to cherish. However; when she said 'parent', the words utterly routed his psychological defense line, and thus he could only use anger to protect himself and cover his fear. \"I will go as you want. On a last note, I registered for a professional dance competition. And the competition requires musical instrument accompaniment, so I told them I will perform with a violinist and I signed up for you. If you don't come, I'll lose the chance as well.\" the girl stated with a calm voice as she was saying something irrelevant to her. \"Think about it!\" the girl yelled and just left without hesitation. She turned around and closed her eyes in one second, took a deep breath and walked with long steps. She tried to be calm, but her fluttering eyelashes sold her out. With the sound of her feet dying away in the corridor, the boy lost himself in thoughts again. He took up the red violin, touched it discreetly as it is the most delicate gem in the world, then just laid it aside and run. The next day, Fan didn't come to school. The girl felt her heart was racing but performed as if nothing happened. She kept telling herself: you cannot bother him today. But she didn't know, Fan locked himself at home only to prepare a special song for her at that time. He cannot prevent his hands from quivering, so the sound he made was desultory and scrannel. The noise was just like sawing the woods, he thought with self-mockery. His parents occupied his mind as long as he played the violin. He was scared and sad, but he tried hard to control his mind and body this time. \"Don't let yourself down, Lin.\" he remembered the girl said that. And she also said, \"I'll be with you.\" He still remembered her voice, so sweet and smooth like his mother's voice. When thinking of that girl, Lin felt his fear was going away. She made him strong. \"Maybe I let myself down, but I cannot let you down.\" even Fan didn't know these words was to Lin or to the red violin. Then he stared at the red violin as he looked at the girl. It cannot be denied that the red violin is really beautiful and exquisitely sculpted. \"Could you hear the voice from my heart, friend?\" this question was for the red violin. And the violin replied him: he could finally play a song without tremble and fear. He kept practicing secretly and he composed a song for Lin. But Lin knew nothing about it. Finally, the competition day arrived. Lin still didn't sure Fan will come or not. But she went to the performance area because of her trust for him. \"You make me wait so long!\" Fan complained. He pretended to be angry but his canthus is curved of more convey badly. She smiled and she had never been happy like that, but why the tears kept dripping? She finally heard his violin again. The sound is like the twittering of sparrows, and she can see the clear spring running between the gorgeous mountains and the Milk Way in the vast universe. She danced freely as a bird, as the little girl heard the violin from neighbor and danced with wonderful music alone a long time ago... The story of red violin just starts.

He's still groggy, uncoordinated, from whatever they gave him. The cloth in his mouth makes him want to gag; the smell of oil left over from its previous use reaches him. He doesn't think about it. \"There was a time when no one would have been able to get a hold of the Great Frank Moses .\" Hastings has a manic glint in his murky brown eyes; there is sweat beading along his receding hairline. The room they're in is warm, but with the flushed, ruby red cheeks, it's a fairly safe bet that it's due to excitement. Coopers fingers slip on the knots. \"Keep talking sweet heart.\" Frank slurs eyes unfocused. There's a cut on his temple still freely bleeding. The crimson tracks a sticky trail down past his eye, his cheek bone, to his jaw where it sits momentarily before collecting on the collar of his shirt. Cooper blinks, tears his focus away. He rotates his wrists slowly, trying to loosen the ropes, searching for some room to maneuver- he hasn't found anything in the past twenty minutes. A bead of sweat rolls down his spine to settle uncomfortably in the dip of his back. He's down to his undershirt and pants; they've taken the rest of his clothes, up to, and including his socks, and the knife he'd kept concealed in his belt. It could be the humidity that makes it hard to draw a breath- but more likely it's the beating his ribs had taken when he'd come to in Robert Hastings green house. Waking up to the sight of Frank bleeding had never kept him very calm. Hastings laughs loud and ugly, smug in a way that makes Coopers skin crawl. Once he's out of the bindings, he decides calm and level headed, he's going to wrap his hands around his throat and cut off that laughter permanently. \"The more you talk, the faster we get out of here.\" Frank continues, and Cooper wants to rage that there shouldn't be two of them there, that Frank shouldn't have followed him on the op in the first place. He's a fully grown man. He's a CIA Agent ; he's not a civilian. He's not Sarah. And isn't it sad that Frank's fears that he'd had when he'd been with Sarah- that she would be hurt because of him- are what have gotten Frank into this situation with him now? Because Frank worries, and Cooper loves him for it, but now he has to live with the fact that he's gotten Frank killed. At least he won't have to live long with the thought. \"I can't wait to watch you bleed.\" Hastings leans in close to Frank, his grin wide and sharp. Cooper seethes and tries to convey without words what will happen if he lays a single finger on Frank. \"Can I get a last request?\" Franks asks, gaze off somewhere in the distance. Hastings hesitates, for a moment unsure. He recovers quickly. \"A last request from Frank Moses?\"\" He pauses, considering. \"I suppose I could grant you a request- after all, the idea of killing you has put me in a rather generous mood. What is it? Will you beg me to spare the life of your Agent perhaps? He must be important for you to come rushing in here and get yourself caught.\" He steps away from Frank, tied to a chair a few feet away, and comes to stand before Cooper. He imagines all the possible ways he could kill Hastings, but then he'd have to deal with the seven guards scattered around the room. Incapacitate Hastings, kill the guards and then go back and finish the job- slowly. \"Your Agent wants to kill me.\" Hastings muses, producing a Glock from a shoulder holster under the tailored cut of his suit. He addresses Cooper this time. \"You do, don't you? And after you caused so much trouble for me too. If I were a better man I might even let you say goodbye.\" Hastings trails a casual hand across Cooper's cheek to the gag there. His skin crawls with the touch. He holds himself perfectly still and stares up at the man, anger receding suddenly leaving Cooper with the clear thought: he's going to be the one to kill Hastings. \"I am not a better man, however.\" He finishes and takes the safety off. The ropes binding his hands finally give a bit. It's not enough. \"Actually,\" Franks voice, missing the notable slur from before, pauses Hastings as he presses the gun to Cooper's chest where his heart is beating rabbit quick. Cooper doesn't look at Frank, resists the overwhelming urge to do so. \"I was going to ask you to take a breath mint. Mouthwash- anything. I'm begging you, it's like something crawled in there and died .\" Hastings makes the mistake of looking at Frank and the RED Agent is up and out of the chair they'd secured him to, ropes in a heap on the floor, in a flash. He freezes- like so many do when faced with the force of nature that is Frank Moses- and before he can pull the trigger Frank is on him. Hastings lands with a thud on the floor, neck broken. Cooper hears a series of familiar pops and his guards drop, one after another, before they even have a chance to reach for their weapons. Neat little entry wounds decorate their foreheads. It's over in seconds and for a moment Cooper is at a loss of what to do. And then Frank fills his vision and the world refocuses. \"Coop.\" Big hands, rough with familiar callouses cup his cheeks gently. A thumb traces his cheek bone- probably trying to permanently erase Hastings touch. He grunts, half to let Frank know he's okay, and partially to let him know that if Frank doesn't remove his gag in the next few seconds he's sleeping on Marvin's couch for the next few weeks. Frank seems to understand as a moment later he's unfastening the cloth as he says, \"I'm taking it off- just try to keep the yelling to a minimum?\" Cooper finally gets his hands free as Frank pulls the gag away and he reaches out, grabs the older man by the shirt and tugs him into a spine melting I can't believe we survived again kiss. There's a smug grin tugging at the corner of Frank's lips when Cooper finally lets him up for air. Cooper remembers why he was mad. \"You followed me onto an op.\" His voice is hoarse, mouth still dry from the gag and his breath probably doesn't smell minty fresh either but Frank doesn't mention it. He narrows his eyes. \"I had a bad feeling about this one.\" Frank drops down to quickly untie the rope around Cooper's ankles. \"Looks like I was right.\" Sometimes he really wants to hit him. The smug tone makes its way into Frank's voice. Cooper, now free, gets to his feet and steps around Franks outstretched hand, still angry. \"You promised.\" He seethes, too many emotions swirling around, too much energy with no outlet. \"After last time you promised not to interfere Frank- I'm a god damn Agent. I am not Sarah.\" A bullet imbeds itself in a potted plant less than a foot from him. He sighs and scrubs a hand over his face. \"Her aims gotten a lot better.\" \"Yeah,\" Frank nods, holding himself like he isn't sure how to approach Cooper. It makes something in his chest tighten. \"Victoria and Marvin have been training her.\" The idea of Sarah and Marvin bonding worries him. \"Listen Coop,\" Frank takes a hesitant step forwards and Cooper relaxes his stance, forces some of the anger to be pushed aside. \"I knew what I was doing letting Hastings catch me.\" He knows that; it's not entirely what's bothering him. \"Give me one good reason why I shouldn't kick your ass to the couch for making me think you were going to die.\" And that I would have to watch. It's meant to be a demand but it comes out more pleading. The adrenaline is starting to fade, leaving him feeling worn. If he's honest with himself he needs Frank to give him a reason he should forgive him. \"Because we made it out of this one alive.\" Cooper glares and Frank tries again with, \"Because I promise to try and be less obsessive about following you on jobs?\" \"Marvin's been giving you advice again.\" Cooper accuses but he finds himself giving in anyways. \"You owe me- you nearly gave me a heart attack Old Man .\" \"Who you calling old, kid?\" Frank scoops up two guns – the guards won't need them anymore – and leads him from the room. \"I hope your back can handle that spring in the couch you refuse to fix.\" Cooper threatens cheerfully, the knowledge of a job complete seeping in to replace the anger from before. \"What I meant to say was: how about a blow job followed by life affirming sex?\" Cooper grins. \"Throw in breakfast in bed and we're going to the next Mets game.\" Frank grimaces but nods. \"Great- who's our exit?\" \"Ivan and Marvin.\" \"Ivan's in the country?\" \"Yeah,\" Frank leads the way through the silent mansion – probably courtesy of Marvin. \"We've been invited to dinner at Victoria's.\" Outside there's an old rusty Chevy with Ivan behind the wheel. Marvin waves from the passenger seat clutching his stuffed pig tight to his chest. Cooper eyes it with distrust and climbs into the back seat, Frank sliding in next to him. \"I have to check in with Langley.\" What does it say about him that he's only just remembering to check in with his bosses to let them know the op was a success – barring a few minor details. It probably says he spends too much time with Frank Moses and his rag tag group. Or at least that he's become one of them. \"Later.\" Frank says, threading their hands together. \"Right now home and some life affirming sounds better.\" Cooper pretends not to hear Marvin's snort or Ivan's chuckle from the front seat.

Frank turned to walk back. \"Frank, you're no good to her dead \" she tried to reason with him. \"We've gotta move,\" Marvin pointed out,loading his gun as a car came to a stop in front of them. A stocky Russian man hops out from the car, \"Now is not the time to waste.\" \"Ivan?\" Victoria questioned. \"ZAchik Moy.\" \"Nice to see you too Ivan,\" She stated with slight surprise. \"Did he just call you bunny?\" Frank looked at Victoria with confusion. She gave Frank a glare and shook it off, \" Life sometimes is complicated...\" Victoria,then climbed up the snowbank in front of them and quickly walked to the car. As she walked past Ivan,she heard him whisper her name. A small sadness overcame her as she unloaded and packed away her gun,before climbing into the car. Frank climbed into the front and Marvin sat beside Victoria. \"Any closer and i will kill you,\" Victoria threatened,as Marvin squished into the back seat with her. Marvin looked to Frank and Ivan,who had amused expressions on their faces. Ivan then stepped on the gas and quickly drove off. \"You know how i said we were all going to be killed if we went to see her?\" Marvin asked. Frank nodded. \"Now we are all going to be killed being squished into this car with her,\" Marvin received a slap to the face by Victoria. \"No,just you,\" she smirked. A few seconds later,they pulled into a drive way to a beautiful log house. Marvin climbed out of the car,Victoria following. \"I have already picked up your bags and everything,they are in your rooms,\" Ivan said. \"Thank you,\" Frank said. Slowly,they all walked to the front door. \"I am going to change,\" Victoria said,walking into the house. Frank and Marvin stayed out on the porch. \"I will be back with drinks,\" Ivan smiled as he walked through the door. A big white winter coat fell from Victoria's shoulders,Ivan stared at the woman before him. Victoria still had a cream sweater on. Although her back was turned at him,he could tell what she was feeling. He was about to walk up to her and wrap his arms around her,but instead he chose life. Ivan then continued on into his kitchen to get the drinks. Out of the cupboard he took four small glasses,filling them each with his favorite drink. He then walked out to find Victoria,Frank,and Marvin in an awkward quiet silence. \"A toast?\" the russian man suggested. Everyone took a small glass and raised it. \"To Joe...\" Frank said sadly. \"To Joe...\" Marvin answered. \"To Joe...\" Victoria whispered softly. Everyone put the glasses to their lips and drank it. Frank sat worrying about Sarah. It didn't help that Marvin was going on and on about what they had probably done to her. Seeing that Frank was upset,Victoria turned to Marvin and sharply whispered,\"Marvin!\" Frank stood up and walked into the house. Everyone watched sadly. \"You idiot!\" Victoria exclaimed. Ivan slightly smiled at her beautiful voice yelling at the coo-coo man. A feeling came to him,that he should go and talk to Frank. He did just that. The Fundraising Gala Victoria stood in the middle of the dance floor alone, scanning the surrounding area when Ivan came behind her and spun her around. He pulled her into a slow dance. \"Moves like that could get you killed,\" she warned. \"Your radiance tonight renders me almost speechless,\" he looked into her eyes. \"Almost,\" she repeated. Dipping her backwards slightly with the music,he watched as her elegant head lifted. \"What are you grinning at?\" she looked at his very pleased expression. \"I've always dreamed of killing an American president\" he stated proudly. \"Vice president,\" she reminded him softly. \"Mmm whatever,\" he shrugged, looking at her fondly. With a smile,he said, \"Having you in my arms once again, I get carried away.\" \"Really?\" She implied sarcastically. \"Tell me you love me,\" he whispered into her ear. Victoria looked at him then looked down again uncertain as to his answer, \"It's been a long time, Ivan.\" \"Blink of an eye,\" came his response. Victoria heard the music stop,but Ivan didn't let go of her or stop dancing. \"Ivan...the music stopped.\" Ivan let go of his love and smiled. \"Oh it has...\" He kissed the back of her hand and began to walk off. \"Oh!Ivan!\" Victoria suddenly remembered. Ivan returned to her. He watched as she opened her purse and took out a rectangular spray bottle-like object. Smiling,he took the spray and then Victoria's hand. Bringing it to his lips,he kissed the palm of her hand. Victoria smiled lovingly back. Ivan then went around spraying the spray and Victoria went to meet Marvin down the stairs. As soon as Marvin came into sight,Victoria took her shoes off and slipped her feet into the black boots Marvin left for her. Victoria Is Shot \"Marvin,go.I will only slow you down,\" Victoria panted as she slowed to a stop. Marvin nodded reluctantly and ran off. Victoria looked for a way out,praying that she wouldn't meet anyone in this underground room. If she was found,it would not end well. She was wounded,unarmed,and would be outnumbered. Finding a door,she tried jiggling it open. It was locked. Backing against the door,she sighed. \"Bunny?\" came a familiar deep voice from behind her. \"Ivan,\" Victoria breathed. \"I believe i could be of service,\" Ivan said,unlocking the door. Victoria collapsed into his arms. He picked her up and carried her towards a door leading to his car. \"I do love you,\" she whispered to her love. \"I know,\" Ivan said simply.

Summary : Cooper returned to his office late one afternoon to find the door slightly ajar and the lights already on inside. 2700 words. Spoilers : RED (2010) Notes : Written for casinoquality in Yuletide 2010, and posted there in December. Two months after the epic clusterfuck that ended with a dead handler, a wounded Vice President, a costly series of public relations coverups, and a nice step up the corporate ladder for CIA agent William Cooper, he returned to his office late one afternoon to find the door slightly ajar and the lights already on inside. The blinds were as he'd left them - three-quarters closed, occluding any visitor he might have - and a quick glance around the blandly busy office behind him turned up no carefully watching co-workers. In any ordinary office, that might have been enough checking to justify blithely walking on in and assuming his assistant had simply been careless. Cooper's office - and his job - were rather more than ordinary, though; and the sharpest of the CIA's current crop of assassins felt his skin prickle with sudden caution at the thought that it wouldn't even be the first time that year someone with mayhem in mind had trespassed on his turf. His pulse picked up a few notches, then settled into a steady background drumbeat; his focus narrowed down, picking up in clarity and speed what it sacrificed in wider perception. He took a calm breath, eased his service weapon out of its holster, then pressed his fingertips against the glass, shifting his weight for maximum readiness. Nothing happened; no sound, no evidence of who might have entered, and his nerves tightened another notch. In his line of work, less sign of obvious danger was often cause for more worry - especially since he'd made the acquaintance of a certain group of his trainers' trainers' generation who still hadn't figured out what the word 'retirement' meant. He took another breath, then shoved the door open and entered the office in one fluid, sweeping movement, shifting the SIG-Saeur to cover each section of revealed space from the likeliest position of an intruder to the least. Nothing moved but the blinds disturbed by the swift movement of the door, swishing slightly back and forth as they settled again. Cooper allowed himself to relax infinitesimally as he shook his head at his own caution, then turned back to push the door closed - and froze, the muscles of his thighs and forearms tightening like overwound springs. He didn't know what had warned him: some indefinable trace of awareness, probably prompted by a subtle scent out of place or the susurrus of restrained breathing. He shifted his grip on the SIG and swiveled again, aiming at the space directly behind him - and let out an explosive breath as the cause of his paranoia lifted calm, empty palms and raised coolly arched eyebrows at his expression. \"Jesus,\" Cooper said, shifting his finger a fraction off the trigger. \"I could have shot you. What the hell are you doing here?\" Former agent Frank Moses, designated R.E.D. and the most troublesome target ever to evade his designated fate at Cooper's hands, looked much as he had the last time he'd stood in that office. Bald, smooth shaven, crows'-feet and smile lines gentling a face that otherwise could have been carved from stone, casual business wear draped over a fitter body than most men half the guy's age could claim, even in the CIA - he was hands down the deadliest 'old' man Cooper had ever met. He was the reason half the furniture and accessories decorating Cooper's office still had that factory fresh scent. Up until the moment Cooper had pressed that cuff key into Moses' hands at the end of the Dunning mess, he hadn't been able to decide which emotion he felt more strongly toward the former agent: fierce loathing, or grudging admiration. There were talented agents in the CIA, and there were old agents, but there were very, very few old and talented agents on Cooper's playing field, and if Henry down in records was to be believed Moses was by far the best of them. He'd certainly flattened Cooper faster than any other hand-to-hand opponent had managed in years; and if Cooper hadn't got his hands on his weapon that day to even matters out - well. The results spoke for themselves. They'd both walked away from that encounter considerably the worse for wear. But they had walked. Subsequent events had eventually put them on the same side; and Cooper'd thought they'd evened the scales and gone their separate ways in peace. What the hell had he done to deserve the pleasure of another visit? Moses eyed him with cool amusement, then reached out with a casual hand to nudge the barrel of the SIG out of alignment. \"That's cute,\" he said, a wry curl at the corner of his mouth. \"How've you been, Coop? Or - sorry, never asked. Do you prefer Bill? How 'bout Willy?\" Cooper sighed, then holstered the SIG, irritation boiling up in his veins to replace the ebbing flow of adrenaline. Legend he might be, but Frank Moses could also be an utter pain in the ass - and if he had any real reason to attack him this time, Cooper had no doubt there'd already be blood on the carpeting. \"Cooper will do,\" he said, firmly. \"And I suspect you know as much about what goes on around this place as I do.\" He gestured vaguely toward the world beyond his office door. \"Yeah, well,\" Moses shrugged, a touch of sheepishness softening his expression. \"There's only so much exercise and maintenance a guy can do in a tiny apartment like Sarah's, and I'm not exactly a green thumb, so the community garden's a bust. I've got to keep busy somehow.\" Cooper narrowed his eyes his eyes at that, mistrustful of the light undertone to Moses' words. \"Don't tell me you're here because you're bored ,\" he said. Moses grinned at him by way of reply, deliberately baring his teeth. \"Not exactly,\" he said. \" What , then, exactly?\" Cooper replied warily. \"More like - in the mood for a spar? My training bag doesn't exactly fight back, and it's been a few weeks since the last time I had to really work for it.\" Moses flexed his fingers, then braced the knuckles of one hand against the palm of the other and popped them, the sound like a cluster of ordnance going off. Cooper opened his mouth to reply - then closed it again as memories of their last fight flashed back in slices of vivid texture and color. The heft of the paperweight in his hand before he threw; the give of flesh under his fist as he landed a solid hit; the burn of muscle pushed to its limits; the crack of the flatscreen against his back and the smack of smooth tabletop mashed against his cheekbone; the searing pain of a dislocated shoulder; and the sweaty warmth of another strong body straining against his. The raw thunder of survival instincts blotting out all higher thought; the hot, metallic taste of his own blood; the buck of the weapon in his hand. It had been a few weeks on his side, too, he realized, thinking of all the time he'd wasted cleaning up Wilkes' mess since he'd handed a slightly damaged Vice President back into the care of his Secret Service detail. And even if it hadn't been - a gauntlet had just been thrown down. An offer of a rematch. Moses flexed his other hand, repeating the treatment, and Cooper snorted, then reached for his tie and started loosening the knot. \"If you think you can keep up with me, Grandpa,\" he drawled, deliberately exaggerating his accent as his pulse began to pick up again in anticipation. \"It has been awhile since I had a good workout.\" Moses' grin shifted to something darker, lids drooping lower over green eyes, a smirk all sharp edges and satisfaction. \"We'll see, kid,\" he replied readily. \"We'll see.\" Cooper stepped out of his car that evening wrung out, sore, sporting the beginnings of a truly nasty black eye among other souvenirs - and still riding the trailing edge of an intense adrenaline rush. He smiled at his wife as she opened the door, then leaned in to greet her with a kiss, heedless of his scratched face and split lip. \"Hey,\" he said. Michelle accepted the press of his lips against hers, then pulled back a little, scrutinizing the evidence of his injuries. \"Hey yourself,\" she replied, shaking her head slightly at him. \"I see you had fun today.\" He gave her a sheepish shrug, still feeling too good to be very apologetic. She'd thought he'd had a normal job - at least as 'normal' as a guy who worked for the C.I.A. could be - until Moses had broken into their house and disabused the entire family of that notion. Since then, she'd paid a little more attention to the condition he came home in - and started reserving her concern and sympathy for more severe signs of injury. It had felt strangely good to know that his wife knew he was a badass now, and respected him for it. Still, she seemed a little - less dismayed than he would have expected about today's damage? He followed her as she turned and led him down the entry hall, wondering what else was on her mind that day. The answer became apparent as soon as they stepped into the living room. Michelle stopped just inside the door, shaking her head at someone else seated by the coffee table. \"He's home; and it looks like you were right,\" she said, a rueful tone in her voice. Cooper furrowed his brow at the lack of introduction - then froze, for the second time that day, at the identity of his unexpected visitor. Sarah Ross looked up from the half-empty mug of tea in her hands and gave him a thorough once-over, gaze skimming from the scuffed toes of his work shoes to the loosely re-knotted tie at his throat. Then she gave him a luminous, unexpected, knowing smile. \"I suppose I'd better head home and feed the conquering hero,\" she said, \"if he looks anything like you do.\" Then she set down her mug and stood. She approached right into his personal space bubble, then reached out to skim along one stinging cheekbone with soft fingertips. He let her, not sure what she wanted but sure he wasn't going to do anything to upset her; he remembered very clearly how confident she'd been in Moses' ability to make him regret it even when they'd had her securely in custody, and also knew all too well why a man like Moses would value a civilian partner in the first place. He glanced up over her head at his lovely and long-suffering wife, who stood with her arms crossed over her chest and an amused smile on her lips - and at that moment, it occurred to him for the first time that with their dark hair, pale skin, similar features and near-identical height Michelle and Moses' girlfriend could pass for relatives. Sarah's eyes were darker, though - and crinkling up at him at the moment, even more amused than his wife's at his befuddlement. \"It was nice to see you again, Miss Ross,\" he managed to say, falling back on politeness. At least with her , he didn't have to worry about whether he was taking his life in his hands, just talking to her. \"You too, Agent Cooper,\" she said, smile widening in response. Then she stretched up and replaced fingertips with whisper-soft lips in a quick, impersonal kiss. \"And - thank you,\" she added. \"He's been impossible for days. He says he wants a normal life now, but just between us? I think he's even less suited for that than Victoria and Ivan. It's good for him to get out and play with the other children sometimes.\" She sounded very satisfied with herself. \"...You're welcome?\" he replied, choosing the least loaded of the available responses that came to mind, and turned to watch as she sashayed down the hall and out the front door. He frowned a little as it shut firmly behind her, and raised an inquisitive eyebrow at Michelle. \"You do know who she was talking about, don't you?\" he asked, wondering just how much Sarah had told her. She waved an aimless hand at that as she picked up Sarah's discarded mug and carried it toward the kitchen. \"Yes, she explained all about the misunderstanding,\" she said calmly. \"I have to say, I feel a lot better now, knowing there isn't some enemy agent still out there who knows the layout of our house.\" Cooper swallowed his astonishment at that bald-faced lie, and gave Michelle a reassuring smile. Damn; Sarah was getting even better at that. He'd never automatically dismiss suburban housewives with a love of adventure/romance novels again - at least without checking to make sure they didn't have a reckless streak and a deadly significant other hidden beneath their floral-drapery exteriors. Not that Sarah had ever, apparently, been exactly a model suburban housewife, any more than Michelle was. \"Good,\" he said, drifting after her, stepping up to frame her body against the counter with his arms as she paused to drop the mug in the sink. \"So what else did you two talk about?\" he asked casually, stooping to brush a kiss against her pulse-point. She turned in his arms and threaded her arms around his neck in return, leaning up for a proper hello kiss. Then she shrugged, eyes soft and warm with affection. \"She wanted to know how I did it,\" she said, threading the fingers of one hand through the soft, short hair at the back of his head. \"Living with someone with your kind of training and experience. Whether you were always tense and paranoid like her Frank gets sometimes, since he retired again, and how I dealt with it. How it affects us as a family.\" There was so much indescribably wrong about that. 'Retired again?' As if Moses had ever been un-retired at all: which was the only reason Sarah knew so much about his occupation to begin with. As if he had ever been a burden on his wife and kids: he'd made a deliberate effort never to let the job affect them. And as if she and Moses could be currently described as a 'family'... His brain threatened to break at the implications of that thought, and he decided to ignore it. \"And what did you tell her?\" he asked. Michelle's smile widened, bright with amusement. \"A girl can't spill all her secrets,\" she said, teasingly. \"But I did agree that you get a lot worse when you've been spending too much time indoors.\" He winced at that. \"Have I really...?\" he asked. \"Mmhmm,\" she nodded, apologetically. \"I appreciate it that you try not to bring it home to us, you know; but I always feel like I'm failing you when that long-suffering stoic expression starts making an appearance at dinner.\" There was no other apology for that but a thorough kiss. Then he gave her a rueful smile. \"So - she sent him after me to keep him busy, huh?\" She nodded. \"Just because their relationship's still new doesn't mean he can't have other friends. She's suggested teaching, too, but he hasn't followed up on that idea yet.\" Friends. Teaching . Cooper spent a moment contemplating the full horror of that thought: the promise of repeated reoccurrences of Frank Moses in his life, fully enabled by well-intentioned significant others to pound the life out of him in the name of making him better . Today's spar would be child's play compared to what Moses got up to when he thought he was 'passing on his experience', Cooper was sure. Sneaking into his office while he was out would be the least of what he could expect to come his way. He had a sinking feeling that his life had just got a lot more interesting - and it had been more than interesting enough as it was. But that didn't change the fact that he felt a certain degree of inexplicable anticipation at the thought. \"I'm glad you get along with her,\" he said, then rested his forehead against Michelle's, contemplating the myriad possible intriguing shapes of that future. -x- ","Summary":" Title : Keeping Busy Somehow Author : Jedi Buttercup Rating : T Disclaimer : The words are mine; th"},{"Movie":"Red","Title":"Taken Care Of","Author":"Aelyna326","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9586329","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Taken Care Of We weren't all going to die, apparently. That sick feeling that comes with almost certain death was subsiding, it was a feeling I was very used to. The thing I hated most about that heavy fear, was not the idea of a long sleep (sometimes that seemed like a welcome end), but the weakness, the helplessness, the paralysis. I had covered it quickly, letting anger eclipse it as I shouted Moses down. My God Damn plane! Then the Winslow woman put an arm on my back, trying to calm me down. She did soft well, for someone I knew to be as hard as granite. But she gentled me away from the happy couple, revelling in the life they would go on to live together – the one I probably wouldn't cut short. \"Sit down,\" \"Get your hands off me!\" She was trying to force me onto some steps, and I was trying to bat her hands away. \"Oh for God's sake-\" She started muttering on and on about men and pride, and bleeding to death, so quickly I could barely keep up, finally I gave in and sat down. \"What are you doing?\" \"You're injured,\" \"You said it was nothing.\" \"It was nothing, when we were faced with the possibility of a Red Mercury bomb going off. Now it might be something. So shut up and let me look at it.\" I shut up and let her look at it. It was almost nothing, it just needed cleaning and bandaging, and a few stitches. Victoria called Boggs over with a First Aid Kit he had found from somewhere, and that drew Moses's girlfriend's attention, she dragged him over with her. \"Is everything okay?\" I was about to snap a retort back when she pulled back my shirt at the neck. These people were taking liberties. \"Oh! That looks sore!\" \"Sore but not dangerous, he'll be okay once it's clean.\" \"Can I help?\" \"No thank you dear, I'm just going to clean and stitch it, shouldn't take a minute.\" There were alcohol wipes in the kit, they burned, but it was a good, cleansing, pain. When she produced a needle, the civilian made a squeaky noise. \"Do you want to hold my hand?\" She was talking to me, I had to look at her to double check, but she really was. \"No.\" \"Are you sure? That's going to hurt.\" \"I've had worse.\" I turned away, waiting for the pain. As soon as it came, I acknowledged it, then released it, letting it flow away. My meditation was broken by a hand, slipping into mine. Perhaps a broken finger would teach her not to pet a wounded lion? But I never acted on the thought, rather choosing to ignore the impertinence. \"All done,\" Sarah released my hand, patting my arm in a gesture that managed not to be patronising. \"Up you get and let me look at it in the light, my eyesight isn't what it used to be.\" \"Bullshit! I've seen you take shots even I might not have made.\" \"Well, thank you.\" It wasn't a compliment, I was calling her a liar. But she looked genuinely pleased. Apparently the job was sufficient, she put a bandage over it, keeping her stitches in place. \"Thank you.\" \"Of course. You know you're a decent operative, it would be a shame to lose you.\" I inclined my head at the compliment, and she smiled, stepping away to talk with Boggs. Sarah was still by my side, \"It's nice, isn't it, being taken care of?\" \"I wouldn't know.\" \"I guess I'm lucky in that way, I've always had people around who'll take care of me.

Feel free to let me know if you see any. As always feedback is appreciated. Cooper had been working with Frank Moses as his unofficial partner for almost a year now, and he still felt that he didn't know the older man at all. Frank loved to talk, loved to tell stories, loved to share useless information and talked about other people, but he rarely shared anything important about himself. Frank taught him what he knew, but Cooper didn't know where he'd learned it from, didn't know anything important about him. In the past year Cooper had spent more time with his Frank than he had with this wife, which was probably part of the reason why his marriage was failing. He'd spent two months on the couch before he pretty much moved into a hotel room a couple weeks ago. He knew the divorce papers were forthcoming, but couldn't bring himself to file the papers himself. A small part of him still held hope that they'd work things off, but he knew they were well past that point, and he wouldn't put his children though that. That's one point they agreed on. They weren't going to put the kids through something ugly. Cooper didn't expect the knock on his motel room. He hadn't told anyone where he was staying, but it didn't surprise him when he opened the door and found Frank waiting outside. Not even bothering with a greeting, Frank ordered, \"Grab your jacket. We're going out.\" Cooper did as he was told, and followed Frank to his car, and climbed in the passenger seat. It was a surprisingly quiet ride, and Cooper finally broke the silence when they pulled up in front of a bar. \"What's the mission?\" \"We're getting you drunk.\" Cooper's brow rose before he could stop it. \"What?\" \"Did I stutter?\" Frank asked, clearly amused as he exited the car, slamming the door behind him. Cooper hesitated a moment before following, wondering what the hell was going on. When he met up with Frank at the bar, he already had a pair of shots waiting. Frank grabbed his and offering Cooper the other. He cautiously took it, wondering if this was some sort of test, if it had been drugged. But watching as Frank drank his, he figured what the hell and knocked his back as well. Another promptly took its place, then another and another. He hadn't drank like this since college and wondered why he was doing it now. Some part of him took note of the fact that Frank had stopped matching him a number of shots back. Sometime later, he stumbled to his feet, needing to use the facilities, and would have face planted if not for Frank's sudden steadying presence. Frank helped him stagger to the bathroom. Cooper struggled with his buckle for a good minute before Frank finally huffed in annoyance, and shooing his hands away, opened it himself. When Frank's hands suddenly got too close for comfort, Cooper drew the line there, shoving Frank's hands away, and took care of business. \"You drugged me,\" Cooper slurred right before he passed out. When he came to, he was greeted by a pounding headache, intense nausea, a mouthful of pills, and a glass of water being poured down his throat giving him little choice to swallow or choke. He did a little of both, neither of which helped the headache of nausea, and when he finally composed himself, and could focus his watering eyes enough focus, he glared up at Frank, not even bothering to pull on the ropes that bound him, knowing that Frank wouldn't have made a mistakes. \"Why?\" he asked. \"Because you need it. You're spiraling out of control, and at this rate, the crash isn't going to be pretty. We're taking a little vacation,\" Frank answered. It made more questions than it answered. When he was unceremoniously hauled to his feet, he swayed and would have fallen if not for Frank's hold on the ropes. He swallowed rapidly, but couldn't hold back the wave of vomit, and crashed to his knees, heaving on the floor. When he was done, Frank held the glass of water out to him. \"Rinse and spit.\" Cooper did as he was told, as the glass was pressed against him lips. A moment later when the pills were pushed into his mouth and the glass returned, he didn't fight it. And when Frank pulled him to his feet again, much slowly this time, Cooper was able to keep it down. He didn't fight as he was pulled to the car, or when the blindfold was placed over his eyes and he was secured to the seat. When the car started Frank switched the radio to some easy listening station and they were off. Frank didn't off anymore explanation, and Cooper didn't ask. At some point he must have drifted off because when he came to again, they'd stopped, and when the blindfold was taken off it was dark out. Frank pulled him into the cheap motel, and once inside cut his bonds. Cooper stood their flexing his arms and hands. Frank had known what he was doing, hadn't tied him tight enough to hinder circulation, but being in one position for so long, left his limbs stiff and achy. \"Not worried that I'll run?\" Cooper asked as Frank disappeared into the bathroom. \"You can try, but I wouldn't suggest it.\" Frank had left the door open and Cooper caught a glimpse of naked flesh before he stepped into the shower. Taking in his surround, he noted the two bags. Opening one, he wasn't all that surprised to find his own clothing. Frank had obviously planned this. But what this was exactly, Cooper did not know. A few minutes later when Frank appeared in the bathroom door, still wet from the shower and wearing nothing but a towel, Cooper could help but admire the imagine. For a man his age, Frank was in great shape. The scars did nothing to distract from the beauty. It was only when he looked into Frank's eyes again that Cooper realized that he'd been staring, and from the predatory smile that Frank wore, Cooper knew the other man had realized as well. \"The shower's all yours.\" Frank hurried past him, moving to close the door behind him, but Frank's words stopped him. \"Leave it open.\" Fine if Frank, wanted a show, he'd get one. Standing in the doorway his back to Frank, he stripped. He grinned at the sharp intake of breath, before stepping into the shower himself. When Cooper stepped out he found a set of clothes waiting for him on the closed toilet, and cringed at the germs before drying off and stepping into them. He might have won that battle, but there was still a war of some sort going on. Stepping out of the bathroom, he found the TV set on some old sitcom that he'd never understood the popularity of, and Frank lying on the bed apparently asleep. He glanced at the door, but jumped as Frank spoke. \"Don't even think about it.\" He'd learned a long time ago that appearances could be deceiving. Frank sat up, resting his back against the headboard and patted the side of the bed. \"Sit,\" he ordered. Cooper knew his eyes must have gone comically wide as he realized that there only one bed, and mentally berating himself for not having noticed as soon as he'd entered the room. Frank scoffed and signed in annoyance. \"Sit down. I'm not going to ravish you. Your virtue's safe.\" Cursing himself, as he felt the blush rising on his cheeks, Cooper sat on the edge of the bed, wondering why he felt a small sense of disappointment at Frank's statement. A glare from Frank, had him scooting back to rest against the headboard as well. \"So…\" Cooper drawled. \"Are you going to tell me what this 'vacation' is all about?\" \"You're burning out.\" Cooper opened his mouth to deny it, but Frank cut him off. \"Don't both denying it. You know it. I know it. Hell, I've been there myself.\" Cooper's eyebrow rose. That hadn't been in Frank's file. \"Don't look so surprised. Happens to everyone at some point, more than once for some. So you're going to sit there and start talking before you get yourself killed.\" Frank looked at him expectantly. Cooper just scowled at him, wondering why the hell, he thought that he was going to spill his guts to him. But as the seconds ticked by and turned into minutes, a niggling part of his brain wanted him to open up to revel in finally having someone to talk to. But he'd been well trained in keeping his mouth shut, and it was a hard code to break. He started himself when he suddenly began talking, and it was like a damn burst, everything pouring forth. He wasn't even sure if he was making since, but Frank seemed to be following as he made statements at the right places. When the flow finally lessened, his voice raspy from overuse, he didn't fight it as Frank pulled him into his arms. He hadn't had contact like this in months, and it was like a breath of air to a drowning man, he wanted more. His wife had never been a cuddler, and he'd never pushed the issue. Realizing he was about to nod off, he didn't fight it, but wondered what the hell was going on here.

Victoria did not look up from her assault rifle as she rose her slender shoulders in a shrug so slight that, if Sarah had not been watching her, instead of their targets, like a hawk, she would not have seen. \"Because it pleases him.\" \"What do you call him?\" \"Why should you care? Do you not have your own affectionate names for Frank?\" \"Of course I do,\" Sarah answered. \"I was just wondering, you know, if you, like, call him any animal name since he calls you Bunny. I call Frank sweetie, sweetheart, dear, you know, the usual stuff, but then, he doesn't call me Bunny.\" \"You have not found a particular name for him yet? What a pity,\" Victoria remarked dryly, reminding herself that the girl was Frank's latest pet. She would have put Sarah out of her misery long ago if her friend had not taken such a liking to her. Young love could be so droll, and yet the younger generations looked upon her own generation with disdain. Experience had taught Vicky that age only brought more sophistication and creativity, deeper dedication, greater ideas and love to a relationship. The blessed union she shared with her beloved Ivan was a thing far greater, truer, and more powerful than any of the younger generation could begin to comprehend. Sarah quirked an eyebrow at Vicky's tone of voice. She knew she was pushing, but she didn't like her implication that her relationship with Frank was a lesser romance than Victoria's own romance with Ivan. She had read more than enough romance books to know that age had nothing to do with falling in love or how great that love was. \"So? What do you call Ivan?\" \"Lhbim,\" Victoria replied, slightly distracted as she watched their targets begin to move and followed them with her finger pressed against her trigger. Any second now . . . Though she remained calm on the outside, she strained inside like a dog pulling against her leash, eager to break free and run wild again. \"That's just Russian for sweetheart,\" Sarah stated. \"You don't have anything 'special',\" she questioned, indicating the emphasis on the word by drawing invisible quotes in the air with her fingers, \"that you call him?\" \"Not that it is any concern of yours, Miss Ross, but he is my medved.\" Sarah's mouth fell open in surprise. Picturing Victoria calling Ivan her bear was nearly as hard to swallow as listening to Ivan croon over his bunny, Victoria. \"He's your bear?\" \"He is both as gentle and strong as the largest and wildest of bears in the world, and he is every bit as fiercely protective.\" Victoria's lips curved into a thin smile. \"Of course, if you ever repeat a word of this, I will kill you on the spot with your own tongue. Now,\" she instructed, \"do your life and my ears a favor and hush. The fun is about to begin.\" She fired her gun with a grin, and the game was officially at hand. A short time later, when the women met up with their men in question, Sarah was bouncing on the balls of her feet with excitement. Her eyes shone, and Frank grinned, recognizing the look his girlfriend wore when she had a secret that she was nearly bursting to tell. \"What is it?\" he asked, circling her waist with his arms and bringing her up close against him. She shook her head. \"I can't tell you,\" she answered, glancing at Vicky, \"or she'll kill me.\" Frank placed a finger gently against his love's upturned lips. \"Then you'd better not tell me,\" he directed her and silenced her with a sweet kiss upon her upturned lips. Victoria batted down the urge to roll her eyes as she looked away from the pair. Ivan was tugging on her hand, and she gladly let herself be swept into his waiting arms. \"You were beautiful and magnificent, as always, Bunny!\" he exclaimed, kissing her hand. \"Watching you play with your toys who are foolish enough to call themselves men always stirs my heart.\" Victoria grinned as she whispered softly to him, \"It is not just your heart that stirs, my medved, nor is it only mine that moves when you pull me against you like this.\" \"Then let us see,\" Ivan declared with a mischievous grin and the familiar sparkle in his eyes that always quickened Vicky's heartbeat and made her own blue eyes twinkle in response, \"if we can build the pounding of our hearts into one lovely chorus of thunder, shall we?\" \"Of course,\" she answered a heartbeat before he pressed his lips to hers. She wrapped her arms around him, letting him lift her off of her feet and sweep her up into his arms. Her mouth opened underneath his, welcoming his tongue and meeting his heated embrace with her own tongue. She met his onslaught of kisses and caresses with ever growing passion in her every touch, kiss, and nibble, and their hearts soared together as they celebrated their love. He was her Medved, she his Bunny, and nothing had ever been more perfect or beautiful in either of their worlds than the love they shared, which was both as old as time and would outlast even time itself!

When the relationship came to light, her loyalty was questioned: she should execute him. If ever there was a doubt… My love, she leans into me. They met each other to have dinner. Walking slowly through the empty street, she saw an opportunity: she stopped and gently hold his arm, making him stop in front of her. Confused, he looked at her, asking himself why. She swallowed hard, trying to avoid eye contact. He could see all the pain that was consuming her inside. He knew; he hold her hands and kissed them both. Nothing that he could say or do would've stopped her. And she knew that too. Will you or won't you be the one I'll always know? He walked into the nearest dead-end alley; she was following him. He stopped in the middle of it; he didn't want anybody to see her. She brought her gun up. Taking a few steps towards him, she attached the silencer in front of the barrel of her pistol. He told her he loved her. She looked him in the eye and told him she loved him too. I've began to feel like home. She raised her arm, aiming at his heart. She shot him. Three times. On his chest, on the right side. She had changed her aim in the last second. She ran and knelt on his side. She wanted so badly to touch him, to help him… She took the cases and put them carefully on her coat pocket. I'm leaving the one I wanna take. She hid her gun and ran out of the alley, making sure anyone had seen her. She stopped in the corner and, staring at the dark alley, watching him bleed, she called 911. A tear dropped down her cheek and she quickly washed it away. She turned around and walked away. My heart has started to separate.

I suppressed the urge to scoff, she hasn't bothered making contact with my family since mum died and only is now because I have know one else, she's now my legal guardian. My full name is Adriana Elizabeth Gepaiones since my dad (before he died) made my mum's last name mine. \"Hi Gramma\" I answered in a monotone voice putting an emotionless face to mask the hurt I felt for dad inside. \"Are you alright?\" She asked in a knowing voice that said she didn't buy it. \"Ya I'm fine\" I said lying the best I could possibly manage. I'd always been an exceptional lier and according to my dad I look just like gramma (or at least the pictures he said he saw of her) did when she was 14. I have long curly bleach blond hair, 5 foot 7, dark blue eyes (that, if you ask me really amplify the effect of a glare) and a thin frame. She just nodded and let the driver carry my bags upstairs. When he opened the door to let me in I couldn't help but forget about the reason I was here and concentrate more on how amazing my room was. \"Oh My Gosh\" I mumbled in aww as I loomed around the room. It was at least 6 times bigger than my old room; marble walls, a large four poster bed, the bedside table had a picture of Gram and me from 8 years ago at Halloween, complete with a balcony and a dressing room large enough to fit a football team. \"Do you like it?\" Gramma asked in her English accent. \"It's wonderful, thank you so much\" I thanked her sincerely. \"Would you like me too stay or should I leave you to unpack?\" She asked. \"I'll just unpack, thanks for the offer though\" I answered over my shoulder. \"Be down in an hour for tea\" she yelled as I heard her go back down the hall and down the steps to the living room. I heard the front door open and close and I knew the driver left too. \"What the hell does she mean by tea?!\" I asked myself as I began unpacking. I changed into my white tank top, black cardigan, and black skirt that went about halfway above my knees and had a belt with white flowers on it. Once I was done that I made my way downstairs for what I knew would be the mother or should I say grandmother of all awkward situations. Victoria's POV It pained me to see that hunted dead look in her eyes but to have her put on such a brave face. The only reason I didn't see them is because in this business you get enemy's, smart ones that know it'd be much easier to hurt who they love instead of them so I pretended I didn't love my family. The ringing phone made me instantly out of habit grab for the gun attached to my belt a second before I went to answer it. \"Hey, just a heads up we need to see you urgently, we as in Sarah, Marvin, Ivan and me, we'll be there in 5\" Frank said. \"Shit\" I whispered. \"What is it?\" He asked. \"My granddaughter is living here now, my son in law, her father, died and you know what happened to my daughter, anyway, you're going to have to establish a cover, she thinks I used to work as a high school teacher.\" I explained. \"Alright I'm Richard Dun gym teacher, Ivan will be Jarimia kozzeki foreign languages teacher, Marvin will be Arty Ward the secretary, and Sarah will be Gemma Rodgers the nurse all except Sarah will be retired\" He told me without skipping a beat. Dip-wads they don't get it,\"you don't need to change your names just use those professions\" I explained. \"Right, Gotcha\" he answered in an embarrassed voice then hung up. Luckily Addie made it down before they got here. \"I'm going to have some old friends and co workers over for dinner tonight okay?\" \"From the high school?\" \"Yes\" \"Awesome when will they be coming?\" Just when Addie asked as if on que there was a knock on the door. \"Hello, Frank, Sarah, Marvin, Ivan, this is my lovely granddaughter Adriana. Adriana meet Frank, Sarah, Marvin, Ivan\" I introduced them. \"Hello, nice to meet you Adriana\" Sarah said to Addie. \"You can call me Addie everyone else does\" she responded in a cheery tone I could tell was forced. Addie's POV Gramma's friends were definitely weird but not a normal 'my gramma's friends are weird' way, they seemed always alert but relaxed, closed off but relatable, and cautious, really cautious even for old people. I went into the kitchen and helped Gramma put all the fold together while I heard Sarah the nurse having a laugh attack over something Marvin said. \"What it's true and I took away the fact to never attempt CPR on a general of the United States Army if your not 100% sure he's not breathing\" Marvin yelled. What is he talking about? I didn't have much time to contemplate that because Gramma said loudly,\"okay can you just grab the tea pot and tray that's all I'll need\". So I grabbed the tea and brought it into the dining room where Marvin was balancing a spoon on his nose. Right as I walked past him the spoon dropped right off but the weird part was I caught it without thinking twice and set it on the table. Marvin's POV I knew it! There was only one more thing I had to test her with and I'd know for sure just how much of her grandmother she has in her, physical appearance not counting because it was plainly noticeable too anyone who ever saw Victoria at the age of 14. The first thing I tested her with, when I told the story that definitely sounded crazy to anyone who didn't know about us RED's or spy related stuff. She didn't freak out, assume I was crazy, or demand answers meaning if we tell her she'll handle it well. The second test was to test her reflexes and see if they were as fast as Victoria's and even though Addie didn't know I was testing them they definitely were. The third test was on her knowledge but all I have to do is ask her about school and how many languages she knows. \"So what are you doing in school these days? Learning a language or anything?\" I asked. \"Well I'm in advanced classes mostly so I'm doing grade 10 stuff instead of grade 9 stuff. And we learnt Spanish for a semester in grade 6 and I really enjoyed it so I learnt Russian, the rest of Spanish, French, Korean, and Chinese mandarin.\" She answered. This girl is as intelligent, fast, able to co, and beautiful as Victoria and she would make a hell of a spy if the time came. Then Victoria realized what I was doing and if looks could kill I'd be dead 1000 times over, in fact if her granddaughter wasn't right there I think she would've made a move to kill me. \"Addie dear why don't you have an early night you look exhausted\" Victoria suggested and I knew what was coming. Victoria's POV That idiot! He's dead as soon as Addie gets up those stairs and out of earshot because noway is he allowed to try and tell her what we were, or what we are maybe he's even planning on making her a spy, I don't know but he's dead! \"Goodnight\" she politely said and quickly made her way upstairs. I wasn't lying when I said she looked tired for a minute she almost landed her head in a soup bowl dozing off.

To be honest at this point I would like to be thinking about something different but IM not, IM sitting in a cafe, brooding. Wow my life is soooo boring but what can you do? You know what annoys me the most, it's not that he left me, it's the fact that he left me for a freaking socker mum/mom (Americans 'sign'). I guess I should start at the beginning. I was a marine when I met him. I was good at my job, the best some would say but I think it was because I didn't have anything to lose so I wasn't to bothered about getting hurt. It's not like anyone would care. William was and still is (I think) a CIA agent. When I walked into the CIA building that morning I was bored but as soon as I walked into that room and saw him there I deftly perked up. He had one of those smile you know, the ones that if you see it, you just have to smile back. \"well hello there\" yepp that where our relationship stated with my really bad flirting, I was never good at it but that didn't seem to matter to him. I still look back and cringe at my behavior back them but hey what yea gonna do. That was seven years ago, when I was young, well I say young 21 so not that young but not old, well... You know what I mean, well at least I hope you do. So here I am after seven years of hell I finally see him in this little cafe on the high street. He looked older but he still had that look about him, the one that just made me melt, and he had the voice to go with it, the one where you think its smooth and grainy at the same time. Confusing I know but that's how IM describing it. I really had hoped he wouldn't see me but I wasn't that lucky, but then I never had been so is houdlt have expected that to change at all. \"Hello Ana\" his voice hadn't change with age. It was the same gruff tone that I had fallen for years ago (not that IM sayings was with him for his voice he) \"hello agent Cooper\" I said keeping a stonic face, not even daring to look up at him. \"oh so your mad at me, that's the only time you ever call me agent\" he replied. Well what did he think idiot, after all this time he can just swan in and act like nothing changed. I didn't say anything like that, I had been thinking of stuff I could say for seven years, yea know something smart and cool but things didn't really go to plan. \"I can bake cookies too you know!\" \"what?\" \"I can bake, cook, clean\" I said still trying to sound like I knew why I just said something so stupid as I continued to stare at my coffee. \"I don't doubt it\" he was smiling now I didn't have to look at him to know this, he voice said it all. \"you know even after seven years nothing really changed, you still say the strangest things\" he chuckled \"why are you here?\" I asked knowing that I saw acting like a child. \"\"why are you here?\" he mirrored \"I'm drinking coffee\" I said stubbornly, still not looking at him \"you don't like coffee!\" he stated. Yea it's true, I never had and never will like coffee or tea or hot chocolate. I was sitting in a coffee shop staring at a cup of untouched coffee. I don't know why to be honest with you. My logic sucks. \"so...i'll Ask again why are you here Ana\" will asked. I had expected him to be annoyed with me by now but he wasn't his voice didn't change. It still had the laughter behind it from my childish behavior. I remember once he told me I was the only one who could make him laugh to the point that he couldn't stop. I know I sound like a sappy sod but hey I've never loved another so give me a break. But no matter what I still got left, left for that bitch. I know your thinking I thinks she's a bitch because she stole my man (yep my man) but she actually is a bitch. She is or was cheating on him, yep I checked her out, background checks an all. I know that makes me seem alittle, well a lot nuts but I just had to know what she had that I didn't. Yea yea IM a bitter bitch I know. Lets just leave it at that. \"well?\" his voice snaps me back to reality \"to be honest with you agent I don't know\" I said finally looking up at him. \"why won't you say my name Ana?\" he looked said as he said this \"answer me this, why are you here huh? Talking to me?\" I ask trying to avoid the question I don't know the answer to. \"I just want to talk\" he said like it was just that simple \"where's your wife?\" I was glaring at him now, leaning back in my chair. \"I don't have one\" I looked at him straight in the face, did he think I was an idiot, that I'm stupid but then I looked at him and saw he didn't have a ring on and there wasn't a ring of untanned skin that you would fined if he had just took the ring off to trick me. \"I couldn't marry her Ana\" then I realized something else. He wasn't wearing his normal suit and tie, he was wearing a tux. \"I ran\" \"you mean to tell me you've fought against some of the most terrifying men in the world and you ran because you were scared of getting married\" I said with a smile and a raise eyebrow. \"no, I wasn't scared of marriage\" he looked down and I pushed him my coffee. He looked at him and I just smiled at him. He took a sip and carried on \"I looked down the at her as the music started and I saw her and I just thought I can't do this, I can't lie to everyone\" he signed \"so I told her that I didn't love her, I apologized for letting things get that far and promised that I would pay for everything expense and as way of saying sorry to her family, I just couldn't do it, I couldn't look at her everyday knowing that I hadn't married my perfect love\" \"I don't think Angelina is available, and even if she was I don't think brad would be to happy to be honest with you will\" when I said his name he looked at me and smiled. He knew I understood what he had said. I was his perfect love. I loved him never stopped. He just leaned in and kissed me. OH GOD how I had missed his lips. Well what can I say now everything went well from then on, with some speed bumps but nothing perfect. Had I hope it won't ever be perfect, coz where's the fun on that ;) ","Summary":" disclaimer, i don't own William cooper in this story (i wished i did heheh ;)an can i jst say im re"},{"Movie":"Sky Captain and the World of Tomor...","Title":"Behind Enemy Lines","Author":"paganpunk2","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11764609","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Author's Note: Hello, all. It's been a while since I posted anything Sky Captain, and I've been playing around with this piece for a while now, so I thought I'd go ahead and start putting it up. For anyone who is following my original fiction as well as my fan fiction, I have a new short story up on my website (jleehazlett dot com) and will be posting some travel writing as well as fan fiction updates over the coming weeks. Happy reading! They were high above the gray clouds that had been blanketing western Europe for days, but Joe's mood was far from bright. \"Norton, where the hell do you think you're going?\" he radioed irritably. \"You're off your heading by thirty degrees.\" A beat passed before he received a response. \"Sorry about that, sir.\" Joe sighed and rolled his eyes. It was miserable work tagging along with cargo carriers between England and France. Usually he wouldn't have touched such a chore. Dex was on board the C-47 that Norton was piloting, though, and that changed everything. There hadn't been a Luftwaffe plane spotted near Paris in several weeks, but that didn't mean that Joe was going to let his best friend go winging across the Channel without an armed escort. Since Frankie was somewhere over the Mediterranean and there was no one else he trusted to ensure Dex's safety so close to the front, the task fell to him. \"Just correct it,\" he ordered now. The sooner they got on the ground the better. Once they touched down the directions from which an attack could come would be far fewer, and could be mitigated with less risk. Up here the enemy might appear from anywhere. Even if they stayed away, the dangers inherent in simply being airborne were numerous. Joe regretted for the dozenth time that he hadn't forced Dex to ride with him rather than with the top-secret force field generator that the engineer was taking to present to Allied command. Norton was good at what he did, but he was no Sky Captain. In fact, at the moment Norton wasn't being impressive at all. The nose of his C-47 was still pointed stubbornly off-course, and there didn't appear to be any reason for it. \"I presume you know where Paris is, Norton?\" Joe barked into his handset. \"Yes, captain.\" \"Would you care to explain why you don't seem to be headed there, then? It's just that you're more on course for Berlin right now. I'm sure you gather why that's problematic.\" The line opened from the other end as if a reply was imminent, but all Joe heard was a scuffle in the background. When Norton finally spoke, he repeated himself. \"Yes, captain.\" Joe's eyes narrowed. Was the other pilot saying that he understood the problem and wold fix it, or – god forbid – that he knew he was about to overshoot his target and head straight for Nazi Germany? \"...Norton,\" he said slowly, \"turn the plane.\" \"Sorry, sir. I can't do that.\" \"You can't, or you won't?\" \"I won't.\" An icy trickle of fear rolled down Joe's spine. \"Let me speak to Overmeyer or Dixon.\" Norton was clearly out of his mind, but maybe his co-pilot and navigator were still sane. \"They'll tell you the same thing, captain.\" It took Joe a minute to peel his suddenly-dry tongue from the roof of his mouth. \"Then let me speak to Dex.\" \"He's a bit tied up for that. So are the wrench-monkeys he brought with him.\" Joe thought fast. Norton and his crew had turned traitor and were busy carting Dex and two others into enemy territory. He was the only person who was free and not part of the plan who knew what was going on, but he could do nothing about it. There was no way for him to move from his plane to Norton's in order to take it back, and no way to force the other man to land without purposefully damaging the C-47 and risking everyone on board. Calling for back-up wasn't an option, as the rest of the Legion was too far away to help and the RAF and Army-Air Force would think opening fire was a grand solution to a rogue air crew. Telling them what and who was being held captive would only make them more keen to ensure neither man nor machine fell into German hands. He was stuck, and he saw no way out. \"Not much you can do, captain,\" Norton said. \"We've thought it all out. Your only options are to let us go or knock us out of the sky, and I know you won't shoot at us.\" \"Do you think so, Norton? Because you're wrong.\" It was a lie, but Joe made it sound like a threat. \"Turn around. I'm warning you.\" \"You're bluffing. You know we have Dex, and you won't touch us so long as he's on board and alive.\" \"And how do I know he's still alive? I haven't heard from him since we took off. You might have murdered him the instant you left the ground.\" Nothing came through for a long, terrible moment. Then, miraculously; \"...Cap?\" Joe gripped the radio so tight that his knuckles whitened. \"Dex. Are you-?\" The engineer cut him off. \"Cap, you've got to shoot us down.\" \"Watch your mouth!\" Norton commanded nearby. \"Dex-\" \"You can't let the Nazis have what we're carrying. You know what it is. You know it will change everything.\" His voice grew distant, and Joe surmised that he was being dragged away from the radio. \"Shoot us down, Joe! You have to-\" The transmission broke for a moment. When it came back it was Norton on the other end. \"There. You know he's alive, and that's all you're getting out of us.\" A beat passed. \"Your move, captain.\" The line went dead once more. Joe tried to get Norton to pick up again, but it was no good. Flummoxed, he buried his face in his hands. The three crew members on the C-47 were good men, known to both him and Dex; how could things have gone so wrong with them? That question plagued Joe as they slipped over the invisible line that marked the beginning of enemy airspace. He had no answer for it, and his indecision about what to do now deepened as he ran through scenarios in his head. If Dex was delivered to the Nazis and they managed to figure out his machine – or, he shuddered, if they managed to torture its function out of him – the Allies would be thrown back into the Atlantic for good. But at least in German hands Dex would be alive. They might try and force him to work on some dark project of their own, but they weren't likely to kill him. If the C-47 went down with him in it, though, Dex could easily end up dead or irreparably injured. Even if he walked away from the crash there was still a good chance that he would be captured, thus making the whole effort useless. One man versus the course of the war. It should have been an easy choice, but so long as Dex was that one man and Joe was making the decision it couldn't be. Dex had told him to take down the C-47, but that didn't matter because it was exactly what Sky Captain had expected him to say. No, he couldn't do it, even if it was what he ought to do. Not so long as there was even the slightest hope of getting his engineer back alive and in more or less one piece. The larger plane lurched without warning. For a moment it seemed as if it had meant to turn, and had then changed its mind. Joe watched closely, hope and terror mingling in his chest. Maybe Norton or his cronies had had a change of heart. Maybe the captives had broken free and were trying to take control. The thought of Dex trying to take on three men with guns in an enclosed space wasn't pleasant, but- Another twitch came, this one so violent that the C-47's wings went almost perpendicular to the flat cloud bank below. \"Watch you don't roll it,\" Joe advised through his handset. The sun's glare kept him from seeing through the windshield of the other plane, but he was now almost certain that there was a battle being waged inside the cockpit. Dex could fly well enough when he needed to; if he could just get behind the yoke, everything might still be okay. They could turn around nice and easy and get back to Paris, where Joe would ensure that Dex never left the ground in a plane piloted by anyone else again. There was no time for him to indulge in that daydream now, though. The C-47 had leveled out, and at its new angle the light's reflection off of the windows wasn't as bad as it had been. Someone in khaki had slipped into the pilot's seat, and Joe strained his ears towards the radio. He couldn't vouch for either of the technicians, but if it was Dex flying there would be a transmission as soon as the situation was stable. Let it be Dex, and let this nightmare be over... The person in the cockpit reached towards the handset. Before he could pick it up he was pitched forward onto the control boards. A broad splash of red hit the glass. Then the plane's nose tilted downward into a dive, and the body – it was a body now, not a living person, Sky Captain felt that much in his guts – tumbled backwards and out of sight. The hopeful breath that Joe had taken in rushed back out as a scream of denial. Surely, surely he hadn't just watched his best friend be murdered. Norton would be a fool to blow out the very brains he had promised to deliver to the Nazis. Alive or not, though, nobody was likely to walk away from the plunge to earth that had just been initiated. \"Pull up, damn it!\" he shouted uselessly. \"Somebody down there pull up !\" But the C-47 sank into the clouds and vanished.[Chapter 2] There were several reasons why it was madness to follow. Visibility might be nil all the way to the ground; there might be an entire battalion of German anti-aircraft gunners waiting below the weather; the C-47 might be wrestled back into obedience where he couldn't see and rise right into him. Joe knew all of those risks, but he bolted after Dex anyway. He couldn't turn back now, not after he'd dogged Norton's steps all this way. Not while he might still be able to salvage something of the situation. Not so long as there was hope. After all, if their roles were reversed Dex would never even consider leaving him . So Joe dropped down into the thick, wet wall of weather that had swallowed his quarry. Blankness that his desperate gaze couldn't penetrate closed in. It taunted him, thinning out here and there as if it were about to let him through and then swelling back to opaqueness. When his altimeter read four thousand he was forced to slow his descent. The odds were good that they were over the hills of eastern France, and while those weren't exactly tall they were much higher than the flat coastal airfield he'd set his gauges at. Lowering himself a hundred feet at a time, he made wide circles lest he miss something when the world finally came into view. \"Come on,\" he murmured as nothing changed. \"Come on, you've got to be here somewhere if you didn't pull up...\" It took six and a half cycles for his luck to kick in. Rolling hills and scattered forests spread out below as he broke through the ceiling. He pressed his forehead against the cold glass of his canopy and stared downward, searching for any sign of the C-47. For a minute there was no evidence that it had come through here at all. Then, suddenly, there was all too much. Someone had managed to level the aircraft out and point it towards a clearing, and as a result the debris from the crash was spread over an area a quarter of a mile in length rather than consolidated in a smoking crater. The more-or-less intact tail section lay forlornly at one end of the long, scarred field. Further along was a single wing that had snapped off and sailed away from the main wreckage. It stuck up from the ground at an angle, cantilevered into the dirt by its momentum. There were a hundred bits of scattered scrap after that, then a hulk of metal that reminded Joe of a giant crushed can. With a start he realized that he was looking at the remnants of the C-47's main fuselage. It wasn't the sort of disaster that was likely to yield survivors, but he had to know for certain. There was no room for him to land in the same clearing as the wreckage if he wanted to take off again, so he touched down instead on the far side of a thicket. \"Gun,\" he muttered, checking his sidearm before he rose from his seat. \"Watch,\" he said, and caressed the gadget on his wrist with one thumb. The timepiece had been his last birthday gift from Dex, and it had more tricks hidden in it than he'd yet had reason to use. He paused, then bent down and pulled a greasy canvas bag from under his chair. \"...First aid kit,\" he grimaced, and slung it over his shoulder. No one opposed him as he crossed the open field he'd parked in, but he kept one hand on his weapon anyway. Joe had no doubt that they were inside German lines, and possibly inside Germany itself, and he wasn't taking any chances. Glancing behind himself, he slipped into the trees. The world was dim beneath the late-summer canopy, and he had to take his time to keep from tripping over hidden roots. When he finally stepped out of the woods it was to find that thin wisps of smoke had begun to rise from the main body of the plane. Face pinching, he picked up his pace. If the thing blew up before he got to it then all of his efforts would have been in vain. Reaching the ragged hole where the tail had been attached, he stooped down and crawled inside. The small flashlight he carried as a matter of course revealed the extent of the damage inside the plane. Dozens of holes had been torn in the skin of the aircraft, and the resulting shrapnel had shredded everything it touched. Wires hung down in several places, sparking occasionally and threatening to electrocute anything that walked blindly into them. The ceiling, which had until recently been a wall, only allowed him to stand at a stoop. He straightened anyway, cricking his neck in order to save his hands and knees from the ragged floor. Dex's generator was still strapped down in the cargo area, but it had been shaken past its endurance limit. Joe tried not to step on anything as he picked his way through the litter of rods and components it had thrown. A corpse in a Legion air crew uniform drew a glare from him when he reached the machine's far side. Usually he felt remorse when he lost an employee, but traitors didn't deserve sympathy in his book. He moved past it without looking to see which of the three it was. All that mattered was that it wasn't Dex. A khaki sleeve caught his eye as he squeezed into the section set up for passengers. Pulse quickening, he pulled the figure from beneath a splintered bench. There was a low, choked moan, and the vaguely familiar mechanic he'd found looked up at him. \"Norton,\" the man spluttered, sending a thin trail of dark liquid down his chin. \"...Bastard...\" \"Yes, I know it was Norton,\" Joe said quickly. \"But where's Dex? Did you see what happened to him?\" \"Nuh-uh.\" A shudder. \"...'S cold in France, isn't it?\" It was plain that whichever one of Dex's helpers this was didn't have long to live. Joe usually wasn't bothered that he didn't know most of his engineer's lackeys – he memorized all the airmen, and that was enough to keep straight – but now it felt like a deficiency on his part. He would have liked to address this man personally, to make him feel cared for in his final moments. Before he could do more than open his mouth to ask his name, however, the fellow coughed up another glut of blood and drew a harsh breath. That single inhalation seemed to suck all of the oxygen out of the air, and Joe couldn't understand how the second gasp managed to be louder than the first. The noise continued for several never-ending seconds before the body under his hands arched up in a last bid for life. Then it settled back slowly, and the world went silent and still. Joe stared at the other man for a second, half-convinced that he might see the clue he was looking for flash by in the inky depths of his dying pupils. There was nothing there for him, though, and he eventually pushed himself away. He had to hurry; something was smoldering in the wreckage, and if it caught hold of a bit of fuel while he was still in here he would be left as dead as everyone else. A shattered pile of steel had partially blocked the cockpit. Joe climbed over it, cursing when he nicked his thumb on a sharp edge. The light was better up front, and he didn't need his flashlight in order to make out the three forms crumpled behind the pilots' seats. Dixon's red hair made him easy to identify. Sprawled opposite Dixon was Norton, his mouth open in a permanent scream. The third corpse in the group was half-buried, but it had clearly belonged to the person whose head had been splattered across the windshield. Biting the insides of his cheeks, Joe knelt beside the body and began to dig. \"Please,\" he murmured as he pushed debris out of the way. \"Please, don't be...\" An arm fell across his knees. Joe gulped as he picked it up and examined the hand at the end of it. Square fingers, meaty palms, dirty nails, and a wedding ring. None of those things were Dex's. He could have kissed the cooling paw with joy as a strange half-cry, half-laugh started in his throat. His happiness faded as fast as it had come, though. He had now walked the entire length of the plane without finding his engineer. It was possible that there was another body under the rubble around the decapitated technician, but that didn't feel right. There just wasn't much room for an object the size of a man to hide in the remnants of the C-47. Then again, he'd searched much of the wreckage in the semi-darkness and with five other ruined forms distracting him. Had he missed something on his first pass, perhaps? He worked his way aft again, shining his light into every crevice and reaching out a groping hand each time he couldn't identify what he was seeing. Before long he was back at the hole left by the tail. \"What the hell, Dex?\" he muttered as he climbed out into the progressively smokier clearing. It made no sense. Dex couldn't have vanished into thin air, yet there was no sign of him. A faint rustle sounded behind him without warning. Recalling that he was in German-held territory, Joe drew his pistol and whirled on the noise. It was his preferred practice to look people in the face before he shot them, and at such close range as this it was easy to keep to his habit. Meeting his opponent's gaze had never caused him to falter before; this time, however, he froze. The person he'd been half a second from killing limped to a halt, then stood gazing between him and the pistol with a pained expression. \"...I don't think a bullet will make my day any better, Cap.\" Joe lowered his gun and hitched his jaw back into place. \"Dex?\" he whispered. \"...Dex. You're...you're alive.\" His knees were weak as he closed the gap between them and pulled the other man into a tight embrace. \"Thank Christ. You're alive.\" \"Alive-ish,\" came back against his shoulder as Dex leaned into him. Joe pulled back and gave his friend a hard look. \"'Ish'?\" \"Kind of beat up. But I'll live.\" The corner of Dex's mouth twitched upwards, then flattened as he glanced towards the smoldering fuselage. \"...They're all dead in there, aren't they?\" Joe hesitated. Dex was friendly with most of his mechanics, and the odds were good that he would mourn the two inside. Joe wished there was some way he could protect him from having to cope with grief on top of everything else right now, but he knew it was pointless to try. His engineer hadn't really been asking a question; all he was looking for was confirmation of what he already sensed. \"...I'm sorry.\" \"Yeah...me, too.\" Dex turned his face away and blinked hard. \"They were good guys,\" he said after a minute. \"Tony and Reg, I mean.\" Which one of them, Joe wondered privately, had he watched slip away without knowing his name? \"I'm sure they were,\" he agreed. \"And as for the others...\" He trailed off. Dex was watching him in the sidewise way that he did when he knew exactly what was about to come out of his mouth, and it struck Joe how much Norton's scheme had nearly cost him personally. When he spoke again his voice was vengeful. \"I look forward to settling things with them in hell.\" A glimmer of satisfaction shone in Dex's damp gaze. \"You're not going to hell, Cap,\" he objected mildly, \"even if such a place exists anywhere but in people's heads. But I appreciate the sentiment.\" \"Right.\" They stood without words, their eyes locked on one another, for the space of a breath. Then Joe remembered that they were talking beside a potential fireball, and the same urgency that had earlier driven him to search the dangerous wreckage pushed him to now get as far away from it as possible. \"Come on,\" he said. \"I've left the plane in the next clearing.\" The limp he'd seen in the instant before he'd recognized his engineer rose to the front of mind. \"You can make it that far, can't you?\" Dex peeked down at his left foot, which he was holding mostly off of the ground. \"I can make it. I think it's just a sprain.\" Joe offered his arm. \"Here. There's no use in making it worse.\" \"Other side,\" Dex said. \"My left hand's not so hot, either.\" A faint smile appeared on his lips. \"Glad we've got your plane. Walking back to Paris isn't a very attractive thought right now.\" They advanced across the clearing at a crawl. Joe tried to help, but his efforts were largely useless due to his being on the wrong side. He consoled himself with a plan to put the medic's bag banging against his hip to use once they reached the plane. There had to be something in there that he could wrap his friend's twisted ankle in, and his swollen hand as well. The first order of business once they were safely behind their own lines would be a doctor and bed rest, but that didn't mean that Dex ought to suffer untreated until then. As they approached the tree line Joe broached the subject that had been plaguing him since he'd first seen the wreckage. \"Dex, in the crash…how did you…?\" He didn't have to finish the sentence for Dex to understand. \"I got lucky,\" the engineer replied. \"I was back by the generator and trying to get an upper hand on Overmeyer when we went into that second turn. I don't know who had made it up to the front, but I heard you telling them not to roll the plane. As soon as we leveled off I started after Overmeyer again. He pulled out a gun, and I ducked. The thing went off right next to my ear,\" he winced. \"It's still ringing, if you can believe that. Anyway, Overmeyer must have hit whoever was flying, because that's when we dove. I got thrown past the genny and into the wall, and the next thing I knew I was waking up in the tail. I peeked out, saw you disappearing into the rest of the fuselage, and...well...here we are.\" Joe glanced towards the remains of the C-47's tail. The section that had cradled the man on his arm through the hard landing was no larger than a broom closet. If Dex had been in the main cabin when it hit dirt, or if the tail had rolled and bounced like the rest of the plane, he would have been killed. His survival and relatively unscathed status appeared to be the result of nothing more or less than a fortunate combination of physics. Drawing a deep breath. Joe hitched his load a little closer. Just a bit more luck and they'd be out of here. A bit more luck, and everything would be fine. Navigating the strip of forest was far more difficult the second time around. The clouds had thickened overhead, and it was now dark as night under the trees. Joe kept his flashlight pointed at the ground and tried to follow the same path he had taken previously. There often wasn't room for the two of them to walk abreast, and after they'd struggled along for a bit Dex swore that he could manage on his own. Joe released him, then bit his tongue as he watched him half fall with every step. They'd find some spacious suite in the city, he mused as he followed close behind, a place far away from the Legion's makeshift forward base. Left to his own devices Dex would be back on the shop floor in a day or two, and Joe refused to stomach that. No, Dex would keep his foot up, sleep often, and eat well for two weeks at the minimum. It would take at least that long for Joe to recover mentally from this latest too-close call with his friend's life. Dex stopped just short of the next open field. \"Need a break?\" Joe asked, gripping his elbow. \"I want to look at your-\" \"Shh!\" He frowned, then followed Dex's gaze. Rain had begun to fall while they were under the forest's leafy umbrella, and their view was obscured. Peering through the haze, Joe managed to make out ten or twelve figures milling around his plane. The squad's dark gray uniforms, guns, and unfamiliar snippets of speech all added up to one thing; Wehrmacht. \"Damn.\" \"That's a problem,\" Dex agreed. \"If they don't recognize what they've got there then they're idiots.\" \"Well, they are Nazis.\" \"That doesn't make them stupid, Cap. Some of the smartest people I've ever met are working for the other side. And you don't often see a group of imbeciles with the kind of luck the Germans have had these last few years.\" Dex leaned against a tree and craned towards the distant gathering. \"I wish I could hear enough of what they're saying to translate...\" \"Would it make a difference?\" Joe didn't see how it could, since they were hard pressed to get to his plane regardless of what was being talked about. \"It might. If they know that's your plane, and if they find the crash, too...look, from what I heard Norton and the others saying they had a deal all set up with Berlin. High Command is expecting that C-47 to show up soon, and when it doesn't they'll want to know why. Here's their answer, and the fact that your plane is here too will verify that I was on board when the crash occurred. Unless everything behind us blows up before they can check it for bodies they'll know that you and I are still alive and on foot. The generator might be trashed, but I'm sure they'll take you as a substitute.\" \"What are you suggesting? Even if we were both armed and at one hundred percent, we're badly outnumbered. We can't very well fight them.\" \"Yeah...\" A look of regret crossed Dex's face. \"...I'm gonna need to borrow your watch for a second, Cap.\" \"What?\" \"Your watch. Can I see it, please?\" Bemused, Joe unfastened the timepiece and handed it over. Dex laid it across the palm of his injured hand and set the bezel to twelve. Then he pressed all three of the small knobs along the side at the same time. The face of the watch swung open on a hidden hinge, revealing a single black button. Joe gasped, and Dex shot him a little grin. \"Didn't know about that, did you?\" \"No. But what does it do? And why didn't you tell me about it?\" Dex's smile faltered. \"I didn't tell you about this part because I knew you'd never use it. To be honest,\" he confessed as he cast a sad look out at the plane he'd tweaked and rebuilt so many times over all the long years of their friendship, \"I hoped that I wouldn't ever have to use it, either.\" A twinge of suspicion pinched in Joe's stomach. \"Dex, what does that button do?\" \"I'll make you a new one, Cap,\" Dex apologized. \"A better one. I promise.\" Then he pushed the button down, and the fighter sitting in the field exploded.[Chapter 3] Joe stared as flaming pieces of his beloved plane fell back to earth. The fact that there were a dozen or so Nazis mixed up in the mess was little comfort, and when he turned to Dex it was with a look of disbelief on his face. \"...You blew up my plane,\" he said in the voice of a put-out four year old. Dex lowered his eyes and blushed. \"I know. I'm sorry. I had to. Um...don't kill me? Please?\" It was only half a joke. \"You're about the only person I'd let get away with doing something like that.\" \"Yeah, well...don't hate me, then. Like I said, I'll build you another one.\" A beseeching glance searched Joe's expression. \"...Friends?\" Upset as he was, Joe snorted at that. \"What a stupid question.\" \"Sure, but...\" Dex shrugged. \"I blew up your plane. It seemed prudent to check.\" \"Dex...\" Openness wasn't something that had ever come easily to Joe, but after the events of the last two hours he couldn't hold back the truth. \"I could count on one hand the things I would be more upset about losing than my plane. You're one of them. All right?\" A fleeting smile relayed that that was exactly what Dex had hoped to hear. \"Good. Here's your watch back.\" \"And where's the self-destruct button for it?\" Joe asked as he strapped it into place. \"Only I'd like to know so I have time to take it off my arm before it detonates.\" \"The plane is the only thing I've ever given you that has a self-destruct button. Honest.\" Joe studied his friend's earnest expression for a moment, then shook his head and chuckled. Yes, his plane was gone, and that hurt, but it was a pain that could be gotten over. He still had Dex, and as he'd said a moment before that was what mattered. \"All right,\" he allowed. \"You had to blow up my plane to keep it from the Germans. Now we're stuck walking, unless you have a better idea.\" Naturally, Dex did have a better idea. \"What about the radio in the C-47? We could call for help.\" As if on cue, a second blast sounded. Something had finally set off the remaining fuel in the broken airframe behind them, and judging from the magnitude of the explosion there wouldn't be much left when the flames died down. \"...No, I don't think that will work, Dex. Just a hunch.\" \"Probably a pretty good one. So...west, then?\" \"We might as well.\" Joe looked to the sky for directions out of habit, but between the leaves and the clouds there was no telling the sun's direction. \"Ah...\" \"You have a compass, Cap.\" \"...Right.\" Feeling like an idiot, he referred to one of the minuscule insets in his watch. \"It's that way,\" he said, pointing. \"Then let's go. I don't really want to be here when the next group of Nazis comes by.\" Before they were more than half a mile into their journey towards safety, Joe forced Dex to stop. \"We're out of sight of both clearings,\" he insisted when the engineer looked quizzical, \"and you can't walk all the way back to Paris on a sprained ankle. So sit down on that log and let me see your foot.\" \"Point taken,\" Dex sighed, and thumped down into his makeshift seat. He hesitated a moment, then extended his bad leg. \"Go for it, I guess.\" Joe exposed the damaged limb as gently as he could, but its owner still gave a hiss of pain. The pilot gave a tsk of his own once he could see the bruised and tender flesh. \"This looks terrible, Dex.\" The ankle cradled in his hands was still swelling, and Joe wasn't certain he'd be able to get it back into its boot. \"Are you sure it isn't broken?\" \"I don't know for sure, no. But I don't think I'd be able to use it at all if it was.\" \"Hmm...\" Sprained or broken, there was nothing they could do besides wrap the joint tightly in bandages and hope it didn't worsen. When that was done Joe turned his attention to the battered fingers of Dex's left hand. He was too afraid of causing further injury to the digits to try and set them, but he felt confident enough in his medical abilities to strap them together atop a tongue depressor. \"Anything else?\" he asked as he pressed down a final piece of adhesive tape. \"I'll know if you lie to me, so don't try.\" \"Just bumps and bruises, I think. Well, and my ear, but there's nothing you can do about that.\" \"Is it still ringing?\" All Legion air crew members were issued .45 caliber pistols as a matter of course, and Joe had no reason to think that Overmeyer had been carrying something different today. The .45s were painfully loud when fired at arm's length; he could only imagine what having one go off right next to your ear would be like. \"Yeah. It's getting kind of throbby, too. Inside, I mean. It's weird, I can't really explain it.\" Grimacing, Joe dug through the depleted first aid kit. \"Here. Take this. It's only aspirin, but it might help.\" \"Thanks.\" Dex made a face as he swallowed the pills dry. \"Ugh. You'd think they could make medicine taste better than it does. It can't be that hard, you know?\" \"Are you suggesting we expand into pharmaceuticals once the war's over?\" Joe teased. \"Boring. No thanks.\" \"Good. I can't fly a pill. Now stay here; I'm going to find you a crutch of some sort.\" \"Cap!\" He turned back. \"What is it?\" \"...Stay in sight, huh?\" Joe didn't answer, but he was careful to remain where Dex could see at least a glimpse of him while he searched for a solid stick. He would have stuck close even if the engineer hadn't made the request, for the sky was growing ever darker and there was no telling where or when an enemy patrol might come through. Urged on by that thought, Joe snapped a long, sturdy branch from a downed tree and hacked it clean of twigs with his pocket knife. \"It's not pretty,\" he said once he'd carried it back, \"but it should be about the right height.\" Dex peered at the pole in the dusk and hefted it in his good hand. \"Oak,\" he remarked. \"Good choice.\" Planting one end firmly in the loose forest soil, he leveraged himself up. \"Thanks, Cap. This'll work great.\" They covered three more miles by Joe's estimate before the last light leached from the world. He made no mention of stopping, but simply reached out to take Dex's elbow so that they wouldn't become separated in the moonless night. With the flashlight turned off they could cross the open fields without fear of being seen, and the going should have been easier. The rain that had started when he'd still had a plane fell steadily, though, and each patch of open ground they encountered was more slippery than the last. Joe thought of this as nothing more than an inconvenience until the man limping at his side collapsed with a faint yelp. \"Dex?\" he queried, kneeling in the muck and feeling about for him. \"Are you all right?\" \"...Yeah,\" a half-groan answered. \"I'm fine. I just lost my footing, that's all.\" Their hands found one another, and Joe pulled Dex back onto his feet. Only as he gripped his arm more tightly did he discover that his friend was soaked through and shivering. Guilt flooded him. He had been going along uninjured and warm all this time, almost sweating with exertion under the weight of his flier's jacket, while Dex had been catching a chill a mere six inches away. \"Bloody hell, man, why didn't you say you were cold?\" \"I'm okay. Besides, this way we aren't both handicapped, right?\" \"That's ridiculous. Here,\" he said, and began to undo the fastenings on his jacket. \"No. Keep it on.\" There was a hard note in Dex's voice that Joe heard rarely but recognized as nonnegotiable. His hand faltered. As little as he liked to admit it, the engineer was right. Like he was now, healthy and unhurt, he could make good time cross-country, fight off attacks, and even carry his companion if worst came to worst. That would all be much more difficult if he let the weather weaken him. He was the strong one at the moment, and he had to stay that way for both of their sakes. \"...Fine,\" he relented. \"But we're going to find somewhere to stop for the night as soon as we're back in the trees. We can't go on stumbling around in the dark like this.\" As much as he wanted to put distance between them and the crash site, halting would be for the best. He hadn't been able to check his compass since night had fallen, and there were no stars to guide them either. For all he knew they were backtracking without realizing it. \"I would have made your watch luminescent,\" Dex said ruefully, seeming to read his thoughts, \"but there's new evidence out about radium paint being toxic and I didn't want to risk it. It's bad enough that all the dials in your plane are coated in it. Well… were coated in it.\" \"And what will you do for the new plane, then, if radium paint is out?\" Joe pulled him forward as he asked the question, trying to keep them moving. \"Dunno. I'll have to put some time into that, I guess, and find a safer alternative. You can't fly in the dark without instruments, and I know nothing's going to stop you from flying in the dark, so...\" He trailed off, and they walked on. After a while they found the forest again, and when they had reached its inky heart Joe stopped. The pattering of the storm was still audible high over their heads, but his flashlight showed that the ground was relatively dry. There was plenty of open space between the massive tree trunks for them to stretch out and rest their tired bodies. The single thing wrong with the location was that it lacked any line-of-sight protection. Had there been brambles and bushes to disperse the light Joe would have liked to start a small fire, if only for long enough to warm Dex after their wet traipse. Without knowing how far the flames would be visible, though, he didn't dare. But the place would have to do for tonight, because he could feel the other man beginning to sag against him. \"Sit down,\" he bade, and helped him scoot back into a cradle of thick roots. That done, Joe occupied himself with wrapping the head of the flashlight in gauze so that he could set it aside without broadcasting their position to anyone who happened to glance through the trees. When he was finished the torch acted like a weak lantern, casting just enough of a glow to let him see exactly how dripping and muddy Dex was. Pursing his lips, he stripped off his jacket. \"Not a word,\" he ordered as he wrapped the warm garment around his engineer's trembling shoulders. \"I'm not going to get wet sitting here, so you have no argument to make.\" Dex didn't object. What he did do was flinch when Joe reached over to pop up the collar of the jacket and accidentally grazed his ear. \"Sorry,\" Dex apologized. \"That's the bad one.\" Joe would have just frowned and let the reaction go had the light not caught the back of his hand. A watery streak of crimson had appeared there, and his eyes widened as he deduced its source. \"You're bleeding,\" he ground out. \"Did a branch catch you as we walked? Do you remember?\" \"I don't think so, but maybe. I was kind of just putting one foot in front of the other by the end there. I must not have felt the blood because of the rain.\" \"Hold still.\" Joe lifted their makeshift lantern to see if there was anything he could do for this new damage. As he located the source of the problem, his face paled. \"You didn't get hit with a branch,\" he reported tersely. \"The blood's...the blood's coming from inside.\" Dex didn't look half as worried about that fact as Joe thought he ought to. \"It must be because Overmeyer fired his gun right next to my head. That ear's been bothering me ever since, remember?\" \"Yes, but...\" But Joe had never seen the aftereffects of auricular trauma before. What he had seen were two separate cases of people walking away from violent events with apparently minor injuries only to begin bleeding from their ears and noses a few hours later. In both of those instances the stricken individuals had grown delirious, experienced seizures, then passed into comas and died. To be fair those cases had shown signs of confusion and emotional instability hours before their cracked skulls had killed them, but Dex's lack of such symptoms didn't lend him much relief. \"Is there a chance you might have hit your head during the crash?\" \"Well yeah, there's a chance. But I really don't think I did. Not enough to count, anyway.\" Dex read his expression with a practiced air before giving him a gentle, if slightly exasperated, smile. \"Relax, Cap. We've both had our fair share of concussions before, and I don't have any of the usual symptoms.\" \"Except that your ear is bleeding,\" Joe countered. \"Which can be explained by Overmeyer's proximity when he fired his gun.\" \"But-\" \"But nothing , Joe,\" Dex cut him off. \"I'm not going to wake up dead in the morning, all right? Deaf, maybe,\" he said wryly, \"but not dead.\" \"It shouldn't be doing that, though!\" \"No, it probably shouldn't be. But it is, and there's nothing we can do about it except shove in some gauze and hope it doesn't get worse. So why worry, huh? You'll just work yourself into another tizzy.\" \" Another tizzy ? What does that mean, exactly?\" Dex's eyes flashed knowingly. \"It means that earlier you were more upset about the fact that the C-47 crashed with me in it than you were about your own plane blowing up.\" He paused then, and when he went on his gaze had softened. \"Come on; do you really think I'd have noticed a detail like that if I was fixing to check out permanently?\" \"...I think you'll still be noticing things five minutes after you're dead, Dex,\" Joe answered. \"That's just who you are.\" There was no heat in his words, since Dex had won and they both knew it. Neither of them said anything more on the matter as Joe cut off a small piece of clean bandage and handed it over so that Dex could press it gingerly into his own ear. \"Well,\" he said when the air had cleared, \"if you aren't going to die then we'd best get some sleep. I suspect that we have a long way to go tomorrow, and without your machine to help them our side isn't likely to make much progress in this direction in the meantime.\" \"Yeah...so much for getting the first force fields up and running by the end of the week.\" The same note of sadness that had tinged Dex's voice when they'd spoken of Tony and Reg was present now, and Joe shot him a curious look. \"Two of the greatest things I've ever created were destroyed today,\" the engineer explained. \"The generator, and your plane. When you pour yourself into projects like them – when you help them grow from a vague wisp of an idea into solid, material things – you get attached to them. They become more like people than objects. And it hurts when something bad happens to them.\" A beat passed. \"It hurts a lot, actually. Especially when you end up having to destroy them yourself.\" Joe watched him blink rapidly a few times, and wondered if he was holding back tears. \"...Dex?\" \"Mm-hmm?\" \"I know what you mean.\" Thinking about his plane made his throat thicken with grief. They'd had some good adventures together, him and his old h110d. Virtually every part of her had been replaced or revamped or upgraded at some point, but there had still been a feeling of continuity there that no new fighter would be able to evoke. It was the end of an era, and not even the fact that his girl had taken a squad of Nazis out with her could soothe the sting he felt at her loss. \"...Yeah, you do. If anyone understands what I mean when I say stuff like that, it's you. And that's why we're friends. Because the things that would make everyone else in the world start to think that I actually did have a concussion are exactly the things that let you know I really don't.\" With that Dex gave him a tired smile, leaned his head back against the tree, and closed his eyes. \"G'night, Cap. See you in the morning.\" Joe was too moved by the truth of the other man's statement to reply right away. By the time he'd regathered his wits and made to answer, Dex's slow, easy breathing marked him as fast asleep. \"...Good night, Dex,\" he whispered anyway as he settled down beside him and clicked off the flashlight. They were plunged into total darkness, but he was close enough to feel Dex's heat and that was enough to reassure him. \"And you'd better.\" Author's Note: I will be posting the next chapter of this adventure between now and the end of April.

Joe awoke as the first daylight began to brighten the forest floor. His muscles were stiff from the awkward position in which he'd slept, but feeling cramped was something he was used to. After a cautious glance told him that there were no Nazis lying in wait nearby he stood up. Then he indulged his aching limbs in a long, luxurious stretch, biting his lip to contain his groan of contentment. So long as the nights didn't get any colder, he thought, they could camp their way back to safety just fine. It was his stomach that reminded him that they needed more than a safe place to sleep in order to survive. The rumble it gave as he shook himself to full wakefulness surprised him with its volume, and he glanced at Dex to see if the sound had disturbed him. But Dex slept on, so Joe stole away to search for something edible in the open forest nearby. The rain had stopped during the night, and now the low trickle of a creek could be heard. Joe struck out in that direction first, knowing that they would need water even if he couldn't find any food. A small, swift-flowing course presented itself a hundred or so yards from camp, and to Joe's satisfaction there was a tangle of wild berry plants growing near the water's edge. Untucking his shirt, he made a small bowl of excess fabric and filled it with as many of the bright fruits as he could carry. \"Dex,\" he grinned as when he returned to find his friend blinking blearily about for him. \"I brought breakfast.\" \"Great.\" Joe frowned. There had been no real enthusiasm in that one-word reply, which was uncharacteristic for Dex. His pained expression was out of place, too, especially considering his history of pushing through injuries in order to keep working. \"...It's your ear, isn't it?\" \"Yeah.\" Dex gestured to a sodden red lump on the ground beside him. \"Last night's gauze.\" \"Is it still bleeding now?\" \"...Do I have to answer that question?\" \"You just did.\" Pursing his lips, Joe knelt beside him in the dirt. \"Well...eat, anyway. I'll find you some more aspirin when you're done.\" They ate the berries he'd collected one at a time. For Joe this was an old tactic he'd learned during a less savory portion of his life when food had been scarce and drawing out its migration into his body had been the only way to trick himself into feeling temporarily full. Watching Dex, though, he began to suspect that a different goal lay behind the other man's slow meal. The engineer was barely chewing, and every motion of his jaw seemed to intensify his pain. If this was evidence of how much Dex's ear was troubling him, it was no wonder that Joe hadn't seen any gum in his hands since they'd left England. \"If only we could do something about it,\" he burst out after a bad wince. Dex shrugged. \"We can do something. It's just that we can only do what we did before; keep it stuffed and feed me pain meds. And get out of Nazi territory,\" he added. \"That would be nice.\" \"Agreed. But can you still walk if your head hurts that badly?\" \"I'll manage.\" A smile flickered across his face. \"And if I can't manage, then we'll manage. We always do, right?\" \"...Right.\" But they'd never had to manage quite like this before. It was a long walk to their lines, Joe was positive, and while he was perfectly willing to carry Dex the whole way such a necessity would draw out the trip and increase the danger. The prospect of camping their way to Paris had lost the slight shine it had had when he woke up; now all he wanted to do was deliver Dex to a clean and well-staffed hospital and hover near his bed until that damned bleeding stopped. He kept all of that to himself as they readied themselves for a day of travel. A brief stop at the creek gave them the chance to re-hydrate, and then they set off. The previous night's clouds had dissipated, leaving the sky between the leaves bright and crisp. It was the sort of day that was made for idle flying, and Joe felt a fresh twinge of grief for his plane. Would any stick he sat behind ever feel so right again? \"I'm already working on it, Cap,\" a promise came from beside him. \"Your plane will be the first thing on my list once I get the force field generator rebuilt. That won't take too long; I've got most of the schematics memorized, so the biggest issue will be fabricating the custom parts all over again. Even if I start from scratch on your plane instead of recycling a standard airframe, it should be done by New Year's.\" Joe tried not to wince at the idea of spending three months using one of the regular Legion aircraft. Their planes were years ahead of even the Luftwaffe's best fighters, but none of them had been specially built for him. He wanted to ask if there was any way to speed up the process, but he held his tongue. It was going to be difficult to get Dex to take time off to heal properly as it was; making him feel like he was letting Joe down with an end-of-year deadline wouldn't help anything. \"It sounds like the best Christmas ever,\" he said instead. \"Yeah…I just wish it wasn't necessary.\" A beat passed. \"I can't figure it out, Cap. I can't figure out why they would betray us. They'd worked for us for years, and there's no way they'd been planning something like this all that time. So why ? What pushed them into it?\" Joe agreed that the plan had to have come together quickly, but he had no real insight to offer. Dixon and Overmeyer had been with the Legion since before Pearl Harbor, and Norton had signed on before the Totenkopf incident; they were known quantities, or at least he'd thought they were. \"All I've been able to think of is money,\" he shared. \"We paid them well, but who knows what the Nazis might have offered.\" Dex's brow knit. \"…Dixon did like to gamble,\" he mused. \"I've heard more than one of my techs brag about cleaning him out in poker game. I could see him needing money. But Norton didn't seem to have that kind of a habit, and he was the best paid of all three of them besides. As for Overmeyer…well, in retrospect it might not have been about money for Overmeyer.\" \"Meaning what?\" \"Meaning Overmeyer had something else to hide.\" Dex shot Joe an uncomfortable glance. \"He made a pass at me a few months ago.\" \"…He what ?\" \"You heard me.\" Joe was gaping. \"Why didn't you tell me? I could have done something about it!\" \"What, Cap? Really, what were you going to do about it?\" \"Telling him to stay the hell away from you leaps to mind.\" \"All that would have done was embarrass him worse than he already was when I made it clear that I wasn't interested. Besides, then he might have thought that you had an ulterior motive for defending me.\" \"I would have preferred him thinking that to him trying to sell you to the Nazis in retribution for his broken heart.\" \"Maybe so, but it wouldn't have done the Legion's reputation any good if he'd decided to spread his suspicion around. Just because we don't care what people do in their off-time doesn't mean that the rest of the world doesn't.\" \"Yes, well…still.\" They passed silently through a small sun-dappled glade. \"It doesn't seem like a reason for betrayal, though,\" Joe opined when they were in the trees again. \"He must have known you'd keep his secret. Even if he was worried at first, you said he had months to figure out that you weren't going to hold it against him.\" \"True. But that's a pretty big secret to leave in the hands of someone who isn't equally culpable. Overmeyer didn't have any good reason to trust me; we knew each other, sure, but-\" Dex broke off suddenly and stopped walking. Joe halted, too, and undid the strap over his pistol. \"Where?\" he whispered. \"It's not Nazis,\" Dex managed. His hand rose to cover his ear, and he closed his eyes. \"It's my head.\" Joe stepped closer. \"What's changed?\" \"Nothing changed, it was just…really intense there for a second.\" The pain lines etching Dex's forehead eased slowly. \"…Wow,\" he sighed when he finally let his hand fall back to his side. \"Whatever Overmeyer's motive might have been, he sure gave me something to remember him by.\" \"Let me see if there's any more aspirin,\" Joe said. He was digging in the first aid bag as he spoke, and only looked up when Dex told him not to bother. \"…What do you mean, 'don't bother'?\" \"It won't help,\" the engineer answered. \"This morning's dose didn't, at least, and I'm not sure last night's did anything either. I think I was just too exhausted to not sleep.\" \"Then what?\" Joe asked. \"Got any morphine?\" \"That's not funny.\" \"I wasn't joking. And I know you don't have any in there, even though you probably should have. I couldn't take it now anyway; we have to keep walking. I was just thinking of tonight.\" \"If it's that bad-\" \"You're not carrying me. Not so long as I can still manage a decent pace.\" \"So give it an hour or two, then?\" Joe asked archly. Dex sent him a cross look. \"You're not helping.\" \"…I know.\" Joe's shoulders slumped as a sense of helplessness settled over him. Aspirin being useless meant that he could do nothing, absolutely nothing, to mitigate the other man's injuries. His discontent over that fact was coming out as annoyance, which Dex didn't deserve to have aimed at him. \"I don't like this, Dex,\" he apologized. \"For obvious reasons.\" \"It's not my idea of a fun time either, Cap. But it is what it is. So can we maybe stop arguing and start walking?\" \"Yes. Of course. But if you need to stop,\" Joe added, \"say something before you get to the point of falling down.\" \"I will. I promise.\" \"…All right. Let's go, then.\" Joe let Dex walk a little in front of him so that he could set the pace. They didn't speak again until a continuous rumble rose in the distance. \"Sounds heavy,\" Dex remarked. \"Tanks, maybe?\" They had been avoiding open spaces all day, but Joe wouldn't put it past the Germans to patrol older sections of forest with tracked vehicles. \"Yeah. But I don't think it's just tanks.\" He cocked his head to listen. Joe, familiar with this particular stance of his friend's, waited quietly. Dex had a knack for identifying machinery by its operating noises alone, and that talent had saved their lives on more than one occasion. The question now was whether or not the ability had been hampered by Overmeyer's pistol blast. \"…There are tanks and trucks,\" Dex said finally. \"Big trucks, like troop carriers. I think I heard a few smaller staff cars, too. There must be a road not far from here.\" \"I don't suppose any of it sounded like our machinery?\" Dex smirked. \"Not even you have that good of luck, Cap.\" \"Damn.\" Joe considered their options. They had crossed a few country lanes since they'd left the crash site, but no major byways. Approaching while there were large numbers of men and equipment moving by would be dangerous. There was Dex to consider, too; limping through the forest was one thing, but running from Nazis was something else. If they were spotted while spying the engineer wouldn't be able to flee. On the other hand, any information they gathered about the enemy could prove useful if they managed to make it back to their own lines. \"It might turn out to be important that someone knows what direction they're heading,\" Dex put in. \"If we find a radio later today or tomorrow, the information we could relay should still be pertinent.\" \"You won't be able to get away quickly if they see us,\" Joe countered. \"And we're not splitting up.\" The last time they'd parted ways the other man had nearly been killed; whatever they decided to do now, Joe was determined that they would do it together. \"So we'll be careful. We can't just sit here and not at least try , Cap. If they're gearing up for a new offensive then anything we learn might save lives.\" \"It's our lives I'm the most worried about at the moment.\" \"Yeah, but…\" Dex trailed off, and after a moment Joe sighed. \"Yes, but,\" he repeated, giving in. \"You're right. We can't stand by and do nothing.\" He didn't like it, but he knew it would haunt both of them if it turned out that their failure to scout had cost lives. \"If we're going to get any closer while they're still nearby, though, we'll be doing so quietly and carefully.\" \"I hadn't exactly planned on breaking into a rendition of 'Yankee Doodle' any time soon, so…whenever you're ready.\" They might be preparing to sneak up on a caravan of heavily armed enemy soldiers, but so long as Dex was fit to joke Joe was willing to smile. \"Right,\" he smirked. \"Then let's go.\" ","Summary":" Author's Note: Hello, all.

Joe Sullivan is not. Hope you like it! Please Review. Lavender Fields, Empty Craters and Love's Broad Grin She looked out of the car window and sighed. There was nothing more she loved more than lavender fields, except maybe archaeology. Hanna Lance was a professor at the Institute of Archaeology University College in London . She had been in the middle of a lecture when her secretary had given her a note telling her that the head of the university had assigned her to go to Norfolk Airbase after receiving a phone call form the base general. She was puzzled, why would the base general need any knowledge about archaeology, especially at wartime, was beyond her. The driver turned his head in her direction: \"Norfolk Airbase, miss, will be on your left side,\" he motioned with his head and she saw the runway come into view. A plane was circling, waiting for permission to land. In the plan above the navigator, know as Sebastian Lee, glanced to his left and saw the car heading for the base. \"Look, Joe! I didn't know they let civilians in. I thought this base didn't exist to the public,\" Sebastian said over the intercom. \"It doesn't. Whoever it is down there must be mighty important. Well, let's show them what we're made of!\" Captain Joe Sullivan commented as he pulled the plane up into a loop. He was the pilot of the Tiger T-3A. He claimed that he knew the plane as the back of his hand, yet Sebastian had caught him a few times flicking through the plane manuals. \"Stop showing off, Joe. You know what the general thinks of it, he'll have your flying permit for this!\" \"Relax. The general's only wishing he could do the same. Hang on, we're about to land.\" The plane came into land as the car stopped by the side of the runway. When Hanna stepped out of the car and straightened, she saw that one of the pilots had climbed out of the cockpit and caught her breath. The man was tall, broad shouldered, with dark brown hair in wavy locks falling around his handsome face. She saw him draw breath and she could imagine how she must look standing there with the sun in her back, framing her golden locks like an aura. She was dressed in a pale blue dress suit and high healed shoes. Her long blond hair was in a smart bun at the back of her neck, leaving a few strands to frame her face. The effect must be stunning for he did not move as his friend, the navigator, tried to climb down the ladder from the cockpit. He look around him to see what his friend was staring at and as he saw Hanna, he threw out his arms in a surrendering gesture and jumped down to land steadily on his feet next to the his friend. Hanna looked at the driver who was smiling sheepishly at her and took her bag from him. Her movement seemed to have broken the spell for now the pilot came striding over to her with a determined look in his eyes. \"Captain Joe Sullivan at your service,\" he said and saluted with a disarming smile. \"Wait a minute, Joe. She's just arrived,\" Sebastian said coming over to join them. \"The name's Sebastian Lee.\" He too saluted and as she was about to reply, a man she assumed was the general strode out of a nearby building. \"Ah, Professor Lance. It's a pleasure to meet you and thank you for coming on such a short notice.\" \"Professor…. Brains and beauty, you really have it all don't you.\" Joe commented before he could stop himself and received an angry glance from the general. \"Now, now, leave the Professor alone. This way, if you please.\" He motioned to a building that was his office. \"Oh, and by the way, Captain Sullivan, nice loop. I wish I could have the freedom to do the same.\" \"HE knows something!\" Sebastian whispered to Joe. \"Could he have heard us?\" \"Nah, the line was safe, I double checked it. We'll have to be careful.\" \"What? We're still going through with it, are we?\" \"'Course we are. Now if you will excuse me, the general will be needing me,\" he said and at that moment he was called into the general's office. \"How do you do it?\" Sebastian shouted after him. \"A gift, mate,\" Joe answered as he entered the office. \"What, Captain?\" the general asked as he looked up from the desk where he was seated. \"My good looks, sir.\" He glanced at Hanna and winked at her. She rolled her eyes. Ignoring Joe, the general turned to Hanna: \"Professor, you might be wondering why we need your help. It is simple. Yesterday, the Germans bombed the whole country. Nothing strange there, Hitler might be feeling optimistic, thinking he will defeat the entire country by one air raid. It was the bombing that was… well, unusual. They usually drop as many bombs they can before they're shot down, but this time each plane only dropped one bomb. In addition, it seemed as if they had distinct targets. Not all are inhabited; they even bombed fields and woods. There have been reports of bombings in the moors all over England. We sent some men to check the bombs that fell in the area of the air base. They reported that someone had been digging in the crater the bomb made when it detonated. Apparently they found what they were looking for, only the spades were left. We were intrigued by this, so we looked at other places where the bombs fell. The same scene, a hole, nothing in it, not even bomb splitter and some spades.\" He leaned back in his chair and sighed. \"That is why we need your help.\" Hanna sat silent, her eyes showing the chock she was feeling after this flow of information. \"Wow!\" Joe commented and whistled. \"That was…a mouthful to say the least.\" \"I- I don't know where to start. I think I would like to see the crater where they have been digging,\" she said and stood up. \"Cartright!\" the general shouted and a tiny man in his thirties entered the office. \"Sir,\" the man said and saluted. \"Show the professor where she's staying and then take her to where the car is parked, we'll meet you there.\" The man saluted a second time and Hanna followed him out of the office. \"Now, Captain Sullivan you must be wondering why I need you.\" \"Sir.\" \"I need you to escort Professor Lance around the base and to the craters. You will fly her wherever she wants to go and help her when she needs it. No fooling around. This is as important as any other mission is; we really need to know why the Germans did this. Understood?\" \"Yes, general. No fooling around, best foot forward.\" Hanna stood waiting at the car that the general had ordered for her when Joe arrived. \"So, we're off to see this crater, eh?\" \"Yes, I need to see how deep it is and the surrounding countryside. I might need to do some digging and I might need your help.\" When they arrived at the bombsite they could see that who ever had been there the night before had left in a hurry, for the spades where cast away and they hadn't even bothered to cover up their footprints in the soil, leading away from the airfield into the countryside on the other side of the barbwire fence. \"Where do we start?\" Joe asked as he picked up the spades, turning around, looking across the field with the crater in the middle of it. \"Well, we start mapping the ground. Then we start digging trenches around the crater to see if there is anything left of what they found. If not we dig trenches in the areas we've mapped to see if there are any remnants of any kind of life here. When we've done all that, then we call it a day,\" Hanna said unpacking her bag she'd brought with her, rejecting and muttering as she saw the things she had stuffed in it. To Joe's despair, it took the better part of the morning to map the area around the crater and to decide where to start digging. \"So why is a pretty girl like you, interested in the past, choosing to dig in the dirt, mud all over her, when she could be a glamorous secretary and be with me say Saturday at eight. I'll pick you up,\" he said with a confident, and some might say, cheeky smile. \"Aren't you confident? How can you expect me to accept when you insult my way of living?\" Hanna looked up at him and saw that he was grinning at her, which annoyed her even more. \"Stop grinning! This is not a joking matter! The way I live my life is not for you to question.\" \"Touchy are we…. No, I am sorry for insulting you, I did not intend to. What I really was trying to say was that you puzzle me. I cannot for the life of me understand why you would want to spend you days in the past, observing history, when I'm in history making it.\" \"And I cannot see why you seem to avoid the past, if I'm reading you right. You want to make history but not study it. Has it occurred to you that you might learn a bit or to from history?\" She continued scraping away the earth. \"Then we might have avoided this war,\" she added under hear breath as she started to dig out the centre of the crater where there had been the most activity. Joe grew bored and walked off to see if he could spot the place where the intruders had come from. There were no wheel tracks, which puzzled him. Then he saw a strange pattern in the earth and bent down to take a closer look. There were footprints, many footprints, going everywhere so there was no telling where their owners had gone. He then pressed his foot down into the ground and noticed that the same footprint was mixed with the others. Interesting, very interesting, he thought as he headed back to the crater, saving the piece of information, in the back of his mind, for later.[Chapter 2] Hanna Lance, Sebastian Lee, The general and Cartright are my own characters. Joe Sullivan is not. Hope you like it! Please Review. Hanna was puzzled by the fact that the person or persons hadn't even bothered to attempt to cover up the crater. It was exactly as they had left it, which made it easier for her to see the shapes of the objects they had found. She had already copied the outlines of a bowl into her notebook and was working on some kind of sword shaped object when Joe returned to her. \"They've cleaned it out entirely!\" she complained. \"There isn't even a bit of rust left to me to find.\" \"Well they must have dropped from the sky. I can't see any other way they might have entered the area. We'd better go, I'm hungry. We may have time for a look at the crater closest to the base.\" \"I guess you're right. I'll just pack my stuff up and then we can go,\" she said and stood up, stretching. Then she saw something then made her stop and freeze. \"Hang on; I think I've found something!\" She bent down and carefully began to scrape of the top soil and after a few minutes she had managed to get the object free. It was a bronze hairpin with a ruby on it. \"Isn't it beautiful? This is from the early Viking age and very rare!\" \"They must have been in a hurry to miss that. Although it is easy to miss, you almost did.\" \"Good thing I didn't. This gives us a clue to the other thing the found. \" Hanna rapped it in a plastic bag and then took out a bag of plaster and started to mix the white mass with water. She then went to something that looked like an ordinary hole to Joe and started to fill it. The \"hole\" turned out to be a hole made by an urn and by filling the hole with plaster Hanna got the idea of what the urn looked like. They spent at least half an hour doing this and by dinnertime, they had over twenty different kinds of urns, jugs and vases, a few swords and brooches. As they where packing up Hanna's things, stopping for the day, Hanna suddenly threw the things she was holding on the ground and threw herself down on her knees, grabbing her brush as she did so. \"Oh, I hope I didn't damage it,\" she mumbled as she brushed the object carefully. She had found another brooch but this one was different from the others. It was a silver disk brooch with animals engraved on the front and with an inscription around the edge on the back. Hanna could see that it was in Old English but found that she had to consult her books before she could date it and translate the inscription. She tucked it safely in a bag and put it in her inner pocked as she picked up her things and walked to the car where Joe was waiting for her. \"Find anything interesting\", he asked as he started the engine and reversed the car. \"Yes, very. But I don't recognize the stile,\" Hanna replied and showed him the silver brooch. Back at her room Hanna unpacked all the things she had found and placed them on the desk in the room that had been assigned to her at the base. Hanna glanced at her watch and saw that it was a few minutes past five. Folding up her sleeves she began to copy all the artefacts into her journal followed by the date and where she had found them. Yawning as she finished her work she glanced out of the window and saw that it was getting dark. Hanna put the book and the artefacts away and massaged her arms. As she looked out of the window at the setting sun her thoughts drifted to Joe. He was breathtakingly handsome. And of that cheeky smile that made her melt inside. Hanna had never met someone like him before. She blushed as she thought of his broad shoulders and green eyes.[Chapter 3] HannanLance, Sebastian Lee, The general and Cartright are my ownncharacters. JoenSullivan is not. Hopenyou like it! Please Review. _____________________________________________________________________________ Maybe shenshould have gone with Joe but then Hanna felt that she was too tirednand longed for a good night's sleep, something that was rarennowadays. As shenunpacked her suitcase, she decided to go to the canteen to havendinner. Suddenlynthere was a knock on the door and then a piece of paper was slidnunder it.\"That's odd,\" Hanna muttered to herself, since no onenknew she was here, she assumed it was Joe wanting her to come withnhim to the pub. However, it wasn't Joe, it was someone who claimednto know who had been digging in the craters and wanted her to meetnhim in the pub for more information. Hanna reread the note and thennlooked at her watch. Half past six. The message said \"be at the pubna seven o'clock…\". Hanna was curious to what she might learn ifnshe met with the person, so she put the last shirt in its place innthe draw and headed for the door, grapping her purse on the way. Joe, whonwas sitting with Sebastian enjoying a drink of orange juice, sawnHanna enter the pub and walked over to her. She claimed to have annappointment and he decided to wait with her. \"No,nreally, you don't have to wait with me. I'll be perfectly fine onnmy own.\" Hanna said as they sat down at a table. \"Now,nnow, Miss Lance, what kind of man would I be if I left a lady on hernown to wait for some mystery person? No, I have decided, I'mnwaiting with you.\" Joe was clearly determined; Hanna could not helpnsmiling as she sighed inwardly. It would be nice with some companynand it had been ages since she eaten out, with a war on andneverything. Joe,nsuddenly shy looked everywhere except at Hanna, until he suddenlynrealised that this could be turned into a date. He turned to her withna broad smile on his face, moving closer as he did so. \"Do younknow,' he said pausing, eyes sparkling, \"if you add a bottle ofnwine and a few candles, this could be considered as a date….\" \"Wha…nwhat are you talking about. I'm waiting for someone!\" \"Thatnmight be that case,\" Joe smiled. \"Even if I'd like to thinknthat this just was a clever ruse to have dinner with me, I willnpretend, for the moment, that I believe you.\" \"Wellnthat is nice of you,\" Hanna said with a dry voice. \"Thatntime was you to meet… \"Atnseven pm… why?\" \"He ornshe is late.\" Joe said glancing at his watch. \"Well,nI… I guess that there's no reason for me to stay then.\" Hannanstood up and began to leave when Joe caught her arm and stepped roundnthe table so they were standing face to face. \"Hanna,nmay I call you Hanna? Now, let's not waste an evening. I have anproposition for you. Why don't you and I have something to eat andndrink and afterwards I'll drive you back to the base. How does thatnsound?\" Hannanlooked into Joe's eyes and saw that there was something she nevernseen before, and never in the men she'd dated. There was somethingnthat told her that she should stay. \"Thanknyou, Joe. I'd love to.\" Hanna hadnnever enjoyed someone's company as much as she enjoyed Joe's. … They werencruising along the empty road, Hanna telling Joe her plans for thennext day, when Joe saw a car closing in fast in his rear view mirror. The carnaccelerated and knocked into the several times, Joe barely managingnto keep control over the car, when they where forced off the road.nHanna climbed out of the car and stumbled around the car to see ifnJoe was all right. He was not. She touched his shoulder lightly andnhe jerked his head back. He was bleeding from a cut on his foreheadnbut was apart from that fine. She helped him out and to sit at thenside of the road. \"Whatnjust happened?\" he asked as he touched his forehead. It hurt badly. \"I'mnnot really sure. For some reason we were pushed off the road…\"nHanna was puzzled. She had been on the base less than 24 hours andnalready had she found artefacts indication a Viking treasure, beenncontacted by someone who claimed to know the persons behind thenbombings and now been close to death. \"Comenon, we will have to walk back, it's not far.\" Joe stood up andnswayed a little. Hanna sighed, fetched her bag from the passengernseat and placed herself at his side. \"You'renin no shape to walk, but if that is what we must do, then lean onnme.\" * Back atnthe base they reported the incident and the location of the wreckage. \"Mynrooms just around the corner from her,\" Hanna said. \"You cannclean that cut of yours…\" Walkingndown the corridor to her room they heard a laud noise coming from thendirection of her room. Joe let go of Hanna and leaned against thenwall as she ran the last few steps to her door and unlocked it.nThrowing the door open she found the room in total chaos. The drawsnin the desk were pulled out and where lying on the floor, papersneverywhere, her cloths were in a mess in the chest of draws. As Joenentered the room Hanna was looking trough the papers that were leftnand at the same time tidying the room. He walked over to the bed andnsat down, waiting for Hanna to say something. It was clear that shenwas in chock yet she seemed strangely calm. When shenfinally spoke it was in a whisper: \"Theynhave taken it. They knew where to look and – and,\" her voicenfaltered and Joe moved to sit by her side on the floor. \"Whatnexactly have they taken?\" \"Mynnotes on the finds, everything else is here. My books and the othernwork I brought with me are still here.\"[Chapter 4] Hanna Lance, Sebastian Lee, The general, Cartright and Keiran O'Reilly are my own characters. Joe Sullivan is not. Hope you like it! Please, please. please review. \"He's on his way,\" Hanna said as she hung up the phone and stood up to leave the office. \"Who's on his way?\" Joe asked curiously, opening the door for her. \"My assistant Kieran O'Reilly with some research material and some more tools. He will be here tomorrow, so can you inform Group Captain Fowler and arrange a car to pick him up, please? \"On it.\" Joe said lingering at the door to the office, fiddling with the handle. \"What are we doing today? More digging?\" \"Yes, why? Need to be someplace else today?\" Hanna turned to face him and smiled. \"Shovelling dirt not your cup of tea?\" \"Not really, no.\" Joe was relieved that he didn't have to lie to her to get out of digging. \"See you at lunch,\" he said as he strode out towards the airfield. He headed to the supply room. The supplies were kept in a large room, as big as a football pitch. It was packed full with rows of shelves packed with uniforms, tools, ….. etc. Joe looked for the aisle where the boots where stored and found it within minutes, that particular shelf was at the back of the room. When he got to the kind of boot he was looking for he stopped dead in his tracks. There were hundreds of boxes, no thousands! Joe sighed and wandered along the aisle trying to spot something out of place. On his second round, he noticed that one box's lid was ajar and that one of the boots inside had a faint smudge on the tip of the toe. He picked it up and examined it more closely. Whoever had worn these boots had been in a hurry when cleaning them, there was still earth on the soles. \"Huh!\" he said as he noticed that the boots were the same size as his own, a large 13. Now that was strange, he was one of only a few who had that size in shoes on the base, and that was helpful. If he could find the other size 13's then he might find who had been digging in the crater. As he was leaving he bumped into the Supply Officer who was sorting the shelf stocked with shirts. \"Hey, Joe! What have you been up to?\" He straitened and came to stand in front of Joe. \"Eh, well, you know Dave, hiding from Fowler. He wants me to write a report on the car accident, and I rather not, since I was out most of the time…. \"Joe smiled impishly. Dave sighed and shook his head. Joe would always be Joe. He bent to pick up a load of shirts to put on the shelf and Joe made his escape before Dave remembered to ask him what he'd been up to, entering the supply room without permission. Joe paused at the door and turned hesitantly back do face Dave. \"Eh… Dave?\" Dave looked up. \"Has there been a break in recently?\" \"Yes, rather strange actually. It happened a few days ago. They forced the lock on that door and made a real mess, but as far as we know, they didn't take anything.\" \"What, nothing's missing?\" Joe's face was astonished as he watched Dave shake his head. \"Nothing. That's what's bugging me. Why break in to a supply room and not take anything?\" \"Yeah, well that's a good question. I've gotta go Dave, see ya!\" Joe wanted to be alone to think things through. So, there had been a break in around the same time as the bomb fell, making the crater and revealing the Viking artefacts. * \"Care for a second date?\" Joe asked Hanna with a smile on his face. \"We haven't had a first date.\" \"Yes, we have, we ate dinner and then we were forced off the road, remember?\" Hanna and Joe were having lunch in the mess hall, Hanna getting inviting glances from the other tables. Joe was secretly proud that this goddess of a woman was sitting with him, hence the smug smile on his face. Hanna, on the other hand, was oblivious to the attention as she was picking a piece of meatloaf to pieces on her plate. \"Well, I wouldn't call that a date. So in order to have a second date you normally have a first date.\" She looked up through her eyelashes to see his reaction. She did not regret turning him down the first time he had asked her. She believed that he was too confident in his ability to knock a woman off her feet, a phenomenon she had observed happened often to women around Joe, and that he would have to work if he wanted her to go out with him. \"Fine. Hanna would you like to go on a first date with me?\" \"Well, I don't know… What would we do? I hope you didn't count the car crash as an exiting twist that you would like to repeat. I am afraid that I will have to burst your bubble by saying that normal people usually go into shock, you smiled the whole walk home…\" \"Could it have anything to do with the company I was with? And no, I would not count a car crash as part of the normal dating procedure. I was thinking more along the lines of dinner, dancing… you know, a date.\" Before Hanna could reply a clerk came up to their table and saluted Joe. Turning to Hanna, she said: \"Miss Lance, there is someone to see you. He's parked his van in the visitor's parking lot.\" \"You really did bring everything, didn't you?\" Joe commented as Kieran O'Reilly unloaded box after box from the van, adding to himself that he wondered if there was anything left in the office. Ignoring Joe, Hanna greeted O'Reilly with a warm smile. Too warm, Joe thought and walked around the van, memorising the tire size, markings and the registration number. \"Well, you sounded like you needed the stuff pretty quick, so I figured, why wait until tomorrow? I didn't have anything else to do… and here I am.\" He spread his arms wide and gave Hanna a smile that lit up his face. That boy's head over heals for Hanna, and she's completely unaware of it, Joe mused. \"Thanks, Kieran, I do really need it, but I could have waited until tomorrow. Now, where will you stay? You can't drive all the way back to London.\" \"Well, I was hoping I could stay with you… and help you with things here,\" Kieran added as he saw Hanna beginning to say that she was living at a lodging house and wasn't sure if she could ask the Group Captain and Mrs Brown if they could take on another person. \"Well, I do need help, and that makes you free to do something more important than follow me around, Squadron Leader Williams.\" \"I wasn't aware that I was following you around,\" Joe muttered to himself under his breath. \"No, no, I like the digging, and besides I really feel that I'm getting the hang of this archaeology business. I can help you, easily enough. History is beginning to grow on me.\" Joe said in earnest and stepped in front of Kieran, blocking him from Hanna. \"But I want to help. I can do all the research while you dig, Hanna.\" Kieran took a step around Joe and knew he had won Hanna over. \"Well, I do hate doing research…\" Hanna started to say when the Group Captain strode towards them, a huge smile on his face. \"Kieran! How are you? Why didn't you tell me that you were coming?\" \"Well, George, I didn't want to interrupt your work. There is a war on and everything. Oh, yeah, I mean Group Captain Fowler . \" \"No, no, don't say that, you're not disturbing anything. You will have to stay the night at least; it was a while since I saw a familiar face. I'm sure we can arrange somewhere for you to stay.\" Drat, Joe thought. The kid's staying. Well, what did you think? You've read it now, and I hope you enjoyed it but it would be great if you let me know if you did or not.

Also, if you don't like slash, please press that nice little arrow that's pointing to the left of your screen, which just happens to be the back button. You don't need to read something you don't like, I don't really care; it's an agreement. We'll just agree to disagree and it'll be totally fine. You'll not have wasted your time and you'll not have gotten my hopes up of giving my story a hit. So please, don't leave me a nasty little review because you don't like this type of pairing. Another thing, I'm not the most plane oriented person, so forgive my lack of knowledge. All I know is you need clearance to land or you will probably die. Disclaimer: Sadly, I do not own Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, although, I'm sure I own the DVD. The rumbling of the Sky Captain's modified Curtiss P-40 Warhawk made it impossible for Dex to speak to his Captain. No matter that, though, because Joe had been distant since Dex had discovered him with Polly Perkins after he had told the Brit that he didn't want her on the base. Dex's eyebrows furrowed at the memory of seeing Polly waltzing out of Joe's office, her sharp reporter's eyes honing in on the poor mechanic as he tried to retreat to his own office. She had been extremely civil to him, like she always was, but she had brushed him off like a fly before sashaying away. It had nearly broken Dex's heart to see her there; nearly . Dex's eyes trained themselves to the back of Joe's head, his light brown locks securely covered by the pilot's hat and goggles he always wore. He had no idea what he'd done wrong, why Joe wasn't so in love with him any more, why the Cap'n seemed to lose interest and go right back to the woman he hated to love. Dex nearly sighed, but chose to relay that action, as it could warrant a heated argument between the two; something else that had recently developed. They had been fighting, something they hadn't done when they were friends and hadn't done before Joe's sudden need to go out every night. Now they fought as if it were something to do, it was generally the only way of conversing with each other. So they fought and, even though he gave it his best, Joe always managed to win and Dex was always the poor sap in the end. An empty feeling suddenly took hold of Dex, its center the middle of Dex's chest, making him feel as if a hole had suddenly been forced into his heart. Tears welled in his eyes, but the mechanic closed his eyelids quickly and leaned back, taking a shaky, but calming breath in through his nose and releasing it out his mouth. \"Are you alright, Dex?\" Dex nearly jumped out of his skin as Joe's voice filled the cabin of the plane, somehow overcoming the sound of the engine and the propeller. Dex gave his all to put on his classic half smile, but it came off as fake and forced. \"I'm fine, Cap'n. Don't worry about me.\" He spoke, his voice slightly meek as he tried to ignore the fact that he felt hollow and suddenly extremely depressed. Joe seemed to be satisfied with this, as he gave up speaking to Dex and chose to pick up the short wave radio and call in for clearance to land. Dex's brow furrowed at the Captain's behavior, knowing full well that the old Joe would've pick up on anything Dex felt and would've nearly climbed into the seat behind him to make sure the mechanic was truly alright. Just as Dex was finally about to let out his pent up sigh, the looming figure of Commander Frank Cook's flying base (something he himself had a hand in designing) broke through the cloud barrier and made its way into his field of vision. \"Sky Captain, you have permission to land.\" The crisp voice of the air traffic controller responded, the man's quaint, but deep British accent suddenly reminding Dex where they were going and why. \"I'm to report to Franky, you're to report to the new mechanic's quarters. He's supposed to brief you on the problems the base has been having while Franky and I catch up.\" Joe condescended to Dex, causing the smaller man's brow to furrow. Joe was being moody and, now that he was going to see Franky, he was all self-important once more. 'Yep, now he's the Sky Captain.' Dex thought as he rolled his eyes, duly noting that they landing gear was being lowered on the 'Polly'. \"Dex, did you hear me?\" Joe asked, giving Dex a momentary glance, \"Or is your head stuck in a comic book?\" The other man mocked, making Dex glare at the back of the other man's head. \"I heard you Cap'n, sorry sir.\" Dex spoke formally, trying his best not to sound like a smart ass as he answered the Captain. \"Good.\" Joe simply stated, seemingly purposely not saying the affectionate 'Good boy, Dex' like he used to. Dex felt his heart sink and a surprised look appeared on his face before his brow returned to its furrowing and he fished in his pocket for a piece of Double Bubble gum. The plane hit the ground and bounced, then slowed its pace until Joe had parked the Warhawk in a row of airplanes on the flying base. Then, without paying any attention to his passenger, Joe threw back the visor, pulled the key out of the ignition, and hoisted himself out of the cockpit without a single glance at Dex. Another wound to the mechanic's severely beaten heart before he even got to get out of the plane. \"Gee whiz, Cap'n, you're sure a swell guy today.\" Dex muttered sarcastically as he clambered out of the plane, adjusting the visor to the proper position before standing to his full height on the left wing. Easily Dex managed to get off the wing, a feat for a man his height, before standing straight once again on the solid cement of the flying base. Then, with a few slight turns, Dex popped his back before heading off in the direction of the shop, former visits and a designer's knowledge of the base reminding him of where everything was. Dex's work boots began their own melody of 'clump-clack' as he made his way into the shop that he supposed the new mechanic would have taken over in the young man's absence. A smile grew upon the gum smacking man as the smell of oil and sweat pervaded the air; a familiar scent to one whose life had been accompanied by these scents for a good while. That's when he saw it, the latest in Franky's arsenal, the latest invention by her new mechanic, the new Curtiss XP – 37. \"Shazam!\" Dex breathed, his eyes wide and his mouth hanging open in awe of the beautiful machine before him. \"A beauty, isn't it?\" A deep, accented voice spoke from behind Dex, startling him into turning around. A man with dark brown hair and matching chocolate colored eyes stood before him, slightly towering over the smaller man. His face was smudged with grease and his hair was wavy, looking as if someone had run their hands through it several times in the past hour. He was also built, but not overly so, as much as Dex could tell, and he was wearing an open dress shirt with a white men's tank underneath. His posture was laid back, easy-going, and open; as if he would be any man's friend unless they double crossed him. \"I've yet to name her, but she's had a few suggestions. You wouldn't have one, by any chance, would you?\" Australian, his voice was touched up with a deep Australian accent and he was asking Dex a question. \"Huh? Oh, uh…well, I dunno, sir.\" Dex spoke, his mind trying to place the man to the occupation before an idea struck his genius brain. \"You wouldn't happen to be Mr. Westbrook, would you?\" \"Well, indeed I am. You must be Mr.….?\" The man questioned, leaning towards Dex as he slowly meandered past the younger mechanic and stood in front of the plane, his eyes never leaving Dex's. \"I'm Dex, sir, the mechanic that Commander Cook called in.\" The man's eyes lit up as he spoke, a grin pulling itself across Mr. Westbrook's face. \"Well, Dex, it seems fate has brought us together. We'll be working on the base together for most of our time, which I'm sure Francesca's informed you of, so you can call me Terry. It's my first name and since we'll be working together, I'd prefer to be called it. Mr. Westbrook bugs me; it makes me sound like a pissy old wanker who's got a stick up his ar-.\" \"Dex, I see you've met Mr. Westbrook.\" The voice of none other than Franky Cook cut off Terry as he spoke, making him pause in his speech and force them both to turn in surprise so as to face the formidable woman. A small smile had found its way onto the female Commander's face, the eyebrow above her visible eye raised in amusement as she stood, hands behind her back and arms akimbo, her legs spread as though she were in an 'at ease' position. Her body language demanded respect, but something in her eye seemed to soften as she saw the big grin on Dex's face and the sheepish look on Terry's. \"Franky!\" Dex felt as though he were a small boy visiting his older sister whilst on holiday as he saw his longtime friend before him. The urge to hug the woman overcame him and he shot forward, pulling her into a fierce hug, which she returned with a polite pat. He pulled away, still grinning like a madman, and took a step or two back. \"I thought Joe was going to catch up with you?\" \"Joe? He's just taken off to go on a supply run with a few of the amphibious squadron. We're near enemy territory, so they're going under radar. The submarines won't even stand a chance.\" Franky spoke, pride in both Joe and her fleet evident as she spoke. \"Left?\" Dex felt as though he was a child; the last to know everything and always being told. \"Yes, Joseph asked me to tell you. Now, Mr. Westbrook, care to explain to Dex what his duties are for today? I would love to stay and chat, but we need to avert our course or we'll be given away and the Germans will have a bloody conniption.\" Franky spoke, her voice commanding, but somewhat laced with kindness; a feat which only Franky Cook could accomplish. \"I was just getting to that.\" Terry spoke, but Franky didn't acknowledge he even existed as she made an about-face turn and marched off, her entourage that usually accompanied her filing in behind. \"That woman will be the death of me one day, I just know it.\" Terry joked, pulling Dex out of his thoughts and into the present. \"Yeah, Franky's something else.\" Dex joked back, returning the grin that the other mechanic was giving him. \"So, what are we to do today Mr. Wes—Terry?\" \"We're going to try and figure out what the bloody hell is wrong with this base, then we're going to have a few glasses of scotch, because I'm sure it's going to be something of a pain in the arse.\" Terry joked, causing Dex's grin to widen before they set off to the control room to gather information. Laughter filled the hallway as two men, one shorter than the other, made their way drunkenly down the hall. They stumbled closer and closer to their destinations, the taller man holding an empty flask in his hand while the smaller seemed to be supporting both their weights. This had become their routine in the two weeks that Dex and the Sky Captain had stayed on the air base; work long hours, drink until they became extremely drunk, fall asleep somewhere (sometimes they made it to their rooms), wake up, try to cure hangover, go at it again. It became a never ending vicious cycle, but it appeared to be a productive one as both Terry and Dex became the genius team Franky had hoped they would become. \"Hey, hey, hey…..hey Terry! We should totally do this again. I mean, shazam , that stuff was GREAT!\" Dex managed to slur out, his usually pale, boyish face grinning and rosy cheeked as they slumped against the wall outside of Dex and the Captain's living quarters. Joe had requested they stay in different rooms, but had asked that they be next to each other. It was something else that had told Dex that they were slowly drifting apart. \"Dex.\" Terry stated, trying his best to give the younger man a serious look, but coming off as a grinning idiot. \"Yeah, West?\" Dex had taken to calling the other since, well, since they'd started celebrating a job well done at about nine PM that night. \"I think, and this is jus' my thought, but….I think we do this every night .\" Terry (or 'West') stated, causing them to both stare at each other intensely for a few seconds before bursting out in unrestrained laughter. \"We do don't we?\" Dex questioned loudly, earning a 'shhh' from his companion, which only caused them to laugh louder. Then they slid down the wall behind them as they laughed, carefree and oblivious to how much noise they were making. Several yells of 'Shut yer yaps' and 'Quiet down out there!' sounded from the rooms around them, but this only caused them to laugh louder; that is, until they managed to pass out sometime around three AM. Joe found them leaning against the wall at around six in the morning after managing to ignore them most of the night. A sad smile formed on his face before he turned back around and shut the door, returning to his bed to find comfort in the arms of the body wrapped in his comforter. It was at this moment that Dex and West (as he now was known as by the whole base, via a very loud sing along in the mess hall around ten the night before) chose to wake up, both clutching their heads in pain. \"Aw man, my noggin' is killing me.\" Dex groaned, his voice hoarse as he crawled over West's legs, which were spread out in front of the Australian. \"Noggin'? Did you just say 'noggin'?\" West questioned, his own voice cracking and also slightly hoarse from singing every line to their latest hit single 'West and Dest, the two buckaroos from kangarooville', that had something up to fifty lines to it. \"Aw, shuddup West.\" Dex spoke just as he managed to open what he thought was his door, but happened to be Joe's. Never in Dex's life had he been 'one of the guys' before, but when he'd befriended the snarky Australian mechanic (who also had an affinity for comic books and sometimes chewing gum) he'd been thrown into the stereotype of being 'one of the guys'. He had even started to feel as if his time away from Joe was strengthening their bond, giving them time apart to sort out how they truly felt before they completely ripped each other's hearts out. There was a new feeling in Dex's heart, one of contentment, and he planned to keep it that way for as long as he could. Sadly for Dex, rarely any of his plans actually go according to plan. Laughing, Dex opened the door most of the way, catching sight of the Captain doing what appeared to be push ups in bed. Just as Dex was about to ask Joe what in the name of Flash he was doing, a woman's moan issued from the bed as said furniture squeaked underneath the Captain. Dex's eyes widened and his jaw dropped, his old gum he had started chewing at three in the morning falling onto the floor in his surprise. Every nerve ending in Dex's ears stood on edge as he listened to the moans of both of them, unable to turn away as he stared in horror. Then they both cried out in pleasure, the woman's voice slightly deep and British while Joe's remained the same as Dex had heard it once before. \"I'm glad you've still got it.\" Joe spoke, unknowingly to an audience as well as the woman. The woman sat up so that the right side of her face could be seen, a smile pulling itself onto her full lips. \"Glad to see you're not dead down there, Joseph.\" An all too familiar voice spoke. 'FRANKY!' Dex's mind went into overdrive, his heart ripping itself into shreds and his all dignity flying out the window. Two of the people he trusted the most had just betrayed him; one knowingly and the other clueless. Just when Dex didn't think it could get any worse, Franky spotted him. \"Dex?\" Franky asked, her voice sounding less commanding and official than it usually did, the voice she had reserved for the shaking young mechanic. Joe froze at the mention of the mechanic, his entire body going ridged. \"Dex, dear, what's wrong?\" Franky's eye took note of the tears streaming down the mechanic's face, something he didn't seem to notice, and the quivering of the young man's body. \"Dex, are you sick?\" \"I…\" Dex tried to speak, but his throat ran dry, his eyes fixated on Joe's unmoving form. \"I have to go.\" Dex said, quickly pulling the door shut and momentarily slumping against it. \"Wha-? What happened, Dex?\" West snapped to, having fallen back to sleep against the wall the he had been stationed at before. Dex didn't answer, he couldn't, and so he did the next best thing and grabbed West by the shirtsleeve and dragged him off towards the shop. \"Where are we going? Dex? What's going on?\" West's deep voice finally seemed to bring back some of the humanity Dex had just lost. They stopped halted halfway there, Dex turning them both so they could face each other. \"We're going to the shop. We're going to pretend we're working and we're going to take your Sheila and we're going to get clearance to get off this base. Then we're not going to return for the rest of the day. We're staying wherever we want and then we're coming back tomorrow. Sound good?\" Dex practically told the older man, causing the other's brow to furrow in confusion before nodding his assent. \"Alright Dex, it'll be our day off.\" He said, grinning so that he might lift the other's spirits. Dex, however, couldn't feel a thing and gave his friend the best he could muster. A fake smile and a pretend look of mischievousness. It was time to put on a show. Thank you so much for reading, I hope you enjoyed it! Check out the next chapter in a few. :) Please review kindly, if at all! Thank you, -Aimze P.S. If you can guess who the actor would be for West/Terry/Mr. Westbrook, you win a prize. I mean it. A real prize. :)[Chapter 2] Recap: Joe has turned away from Dex for some unknown reason and Dex has finally decided that he's tired of it. A/N: I'd like to thank my two reviewers from the other two, by the way. Thank you so much for reviewing, it boosted my writing mechanism in my brain. Got the 'ole hamster wheel a spinnin'. :) Caution: Nazis are mentioned. So, if you're allergic, don't read. Disclaimer: I don't own Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, if I did, then I would have a little bit of a different ending. \"Why, Joseph?\" Franky's voice was tender, the complete opposite of the righteous indignation that she had earlier displayed when she beat him senseless. Now they sat, on the right wing of the 'Polly' Joe had been thinking of repainting, Joe's eyes like a raccoon's and his nose covered in a small bandage. Joe clung tighter to the soft blanket that Franky had brought for him when she'd gone looking for him. \"How did you find me, Franky?\" Joe's voice was hoarse, his eyes bloodshot and still gleaming with the tears that threatened to start falling again. He had cried for two hours straight, like a small child who had been caught doing something wrong, before he had picked himself up and went to the one thing on the base that wouldn't judge him. He had been sitting on his plane, clothed in his usual baggy pants, but without his signature jacket. Franky had found him and brought him a blanket, ordering many of the people working on projects around the plane to 'shove off'. \"This is the plane that Dex rebuilt for you. It has his blood, sweat, and tears in every stain, every part, and every memory. Also, your bedroom still smells like betrayal, and this is the one place I knew you would go.\" She was being soothing, something Franky had only been once around him. He had been in the Manchurian death camp for six months and she had found him, rescued him, and taken care of him. Then she had introduced him to Dex. His chest tightened as he thought about the young mechanic and the want to hold him in his arms filled him to the brim. \"Well Joseph. I'm waiting.\" She grinned, nudging him with her shoulder as they sat next to each other on the Polly's wing. She was trying to lighten up the mood, something that he hadn't expected from her after she had kneed him in the groin and broken his nose. Did he mention she beat him bloody? \"I've been receiving threats, and before you say anything along the lines of 'who would threaten you' or 'how did they get to you' let me explain everything.\" He looked to her for her compliance, which she gave in the form of a nod. \"I've been finding notes in my house, at the office, even in my plane—my bloody plane for fucks sake-and I don't know what to do! They're getting past security, they're watching me, and they're watching Dex.\" Joe spoke, his voice grave and hoarse as he tried to reign in the fear the enveloped him at the thought of someone hurting Dex. \"They said that if I don't stop seeing him altogether then they would kill him. They would kill him and then they would leave his bloody corpse in my bed to frame me! They would kill the person I love more than anything and they would frame his death on me! They would make his family think I killed him, a jealous lover, unless I forced him to go away….but with Dex, I knew I couldn't just tell him I couldn't see him any more…because he'd always come up with a way to make things better and then there's the fact that he'd always be around and then-.\" \"Joseph, I understand, now move on.\" Franky interrupted his rant, her brow furrowing as she spotted several tears fall down the usually strong Sky Captain's cheeks. She had only ever seen Joe break down like this once before and it was when he had been tortured for six months in Manchuria to give up the location of their squadron and their leader: her. \"Right…well, I tried to find out who they were. I tried every connection, even calling Polly and having her come to the base to check things out. That didn't go well with Dex and I couldn't stand to hurt him, even though I knew I had to push him away, I just-I just couldn't, and I knew if he did he wouldn't stay away long enough for me to find them out. So I thought of coming to you, hoping you could help, but when Dex met Terry, I thought that maybe he would forget about me. He seems so happy with Terry, so I thought that maybe I could just leave them alone…but no, Dex still would come into my room and lay down beside me and I would have given anything in the world to hold him then, to stop him from escaping, from going back to Terry, but I couldn't so….when he kissed me yesterday morning after he had slept in my bed and ran off to go play with Terry's new plane, I knew I had to do something….so I used you. You may now hate me forever and a day, Francesca. I promise you, I won't hold it against you.\" Joe's head hung low as he spoke, not willing to meet Franky's gaze as she stared at him, her right eye boring into his skull. \"You couldn't have just gone the easy way and told Dex about the notes?\" She reasoned after a few minutes, allowing him to let out a breath that he didn't know he was holding. \"They said they would kill him if he was alerted….apparently they know everything that he does, how he acts…Christ, they must have been stalking him forever! They even knew his favorite gum, his favorite comic, and….\" Joe's voice tapered off as an idea struck him, causing his poor abused eyes to widen and his body to tense. \"Franky, how well do you know Terry Westbrook?\" He questioned the woman beside him, his head turning so that he could see her fully. A look of utter surprise etched itself onto Franky's face as his question sunk in. \"Do you have the notes with you, Joseph?\" She calmly asked, her gaze turning to steel and her voice becoming her usual 'no-nonsense' tone. \"I do.\" He affirmed, his heart clenching at what they both had just realized. \"I have blueprints to his new XP-37. They're handwritten. We should be able to identify whether or not he is the perpetrator and whether or not Dex's life is safe.\" Franky spoke as she hoisted herself off of the wing, turning about-face so that she could speak to Joe as he jumped down as well. \"I'll get the notes and you get the blueprints.\" \"Joseph, you've read my mind.\" They had been given clearance to take off an hour ago and they had yet to discuss where they were going. Dex had tried many times to strike up a conversation with Terry about the place that Terry said they would be going to, but the older man had said 'it's a surprise' and shrugged it off. Now Dex was getting worried as they continued flying above the cloud line, unable to see the ocean below. \"Y'know, I don't know about you West, but this usually isn't viewed as the best way to find a landmass in the middle of an ocean in my opinion.\" Dex tried, but only received a hearty laugh from his companion. \"Don't worry Dex, we're almost there, mate.\" West called back, not even glancing back at his passenger to see if the smaller male was alright with this answer. Dex shifted uncomfortably as he sat in the XP-37's additional seat, relatively worried over the determined look on West's face and the strange feeling he was getting in his gut. He had had this once before, when Totenkopf had sent his robots to the base to find him, and he knew something was wrong by the way the man had let him track their signal. No self respecting bad guy would give away his location unless he, himself, wanted to track his enemy. Suddenly, Dex felt the earth dive as they shot through the clouds in a rapid descent, Terry's hands forcing the control in the downwards direction. \"Terry, what are you doing?\" Dex cried before the other man pulled up just in the nick of time as they nearly crashed into the ocean. Dex knew, from viewing the other man's blueprints, that this plane was not modified yet to be part of the amphibious squadron and Dex would like to keep it from trying. \"Sorry mate, just wanted to get there a bit quicker than usual. A rapid descent always helps.\" The Australian answered, a strange smile contorting the other man's face as he steered them over the ocean, its waters barely feet away from the plane's belly. \"Where are we going again, West?\" Dex questioned, craning his neck to try and look for any land mass of some sort. \"There.\" Terry spoke, pointing towards the fog in front of them. \"What…?\" Dex questioned, not understanding before he looked closer and saw something he hadn't seen before. A large ship was poking its bow through the fog, aimed straight for the low flying aircraft they currently resided in, and flying high on one of the three flag poles was none other than the flag of Germany. \"I don't understand.\" Dex spoke, looking to his friend for some form of explanation. \"You don't understand now Dexter, but you will….soon enough.\" \"Joe…he crosses his t's the same way, he draws his ones and nines like a European, he slashes his zeros like an army officer, and they script on these notes exactly matches the script on these blueprints….also, the way he phrases things…they're very….\" Franky paused a moment, her brow furrowing in both anger and wonder. \"They're very what, Franky? What?\" Joe snapped, anxiously awaiting her answer. \"They're very proper, Joseph. Proper and well worded, filled with emotion, but not enough. Also, there are several instances where he mentions that you and Dex are an abomination, that you should be….well, terminated…but that Dex is an important component of something more…something bigger than you'll ever know.\" She replied, her hands clenching around the edges of the paper so hard that Joe was afraid they'd rip. \"Franky…?\" Joe questioned her, trying to understand her sudden change in tone; from wonder to absolute disgust and fury. \"He's a neo-Nazi, Joe. He's a neo-Nazi and he wants Dex because Dex is brilliant.\" Franky said, turning her body so that they were facing each other and placing her hands on his shoulders to stabilize the Sky Captain. \"Oh…. God ….then…?\" Realization fell on Joe like a hailstorm of bricks. \"He was trying to break you up so that Dex would play into his hands.\" Franky answered for him, worry filling her eye. \"He played the both of you. He made you hurt the one you love so that he could be there in Dex's time of need and then he could kidnap him.\" Anger dripped from her every word as she spoke, her words only affirming Joe's greatest fears. \"Oh Dex, what have I done?\" AHA! Joe isn't too bad of a guy, now is he? TERRY IS. D: Sadly, I kind of feel bad for doing this to Terry. He was so loveable. I'll make him a better person one day in another fanfiction. A/N: I'm a WWII buff, so if I messed up on something, please tell me, so that I can become that much more knowledgeable. :) If you have any questions or suggestions, then please, by all means, message me. I'll get back to you as quick as I can. Thank you for reading, I hope you continue! -Aimze P.S. Please review kindly, if at all![Chapter 3] Recap: Dex has been stolen and Joe has explained to Franky as to why he broke Dex's heart. A/N: I've had the new strain of flu for a while now….so, I'm sorry for the wait, but it really couldn't be helped. My immune system hates me. Disclaimer: I do not own Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, I just wish I did. \"Control, I need to speak with the current shift leader.\" The voice of the Squadron leader crackled over the radio in the control room, alerting the current air traffic controller that he was needed. \"Sergeant Mays, ma'am.\" The young officer replied, pressing the hold button to do so. \"Sergeant, I need you to check your log for departing planes. I need you to find the XP-37; a Mr. Terry Westbrook should have radioed the last man on shift to have clearance for departure.\" The young sergeant's posture straightened immediately, as if the Squadron leader was in the room, before quickly rolling his chair to the desk adjacent to him, grabbing the flight logs, and returning to his original post. Rifling through the log's pages, Mays quickly found the departures dated for today. \"They left two hours ago.\" Mays replied, trying his best to be as helpful to the Commander as possible. \"Thank you Sergeant Mays. Sky Captain and I will be requesting clearance for departure soon. That is all.\" A small crackle and Commander Cook was gone, leaving the young Mays to sigh in relief. \"Blast, that woman's scary…\" \"West….what's going on?\" They had touched down on the landing strip on the deck of the ship rather terribly, in Dex's mind (as he compared West's flying abilities to Joe's), and they now stood in a room below deck. Dex, in laymen's terms, was scared beyond imagine, but was trying to hold it together; in other words, what would Joe do? 'Joe wouldn't have been stupid enough to let him land.' Dex reprimanded himself in his mind, his inner Dex shaking his fist at him in a threatening manner, 'In fact, he wouldn't have gone at all. Cap'n knows people much better than you, you dunce.' \"Well, Dex, we're going to talk to the Commander about making a few of those underwater planes like the XP-37 and then, we're not going to have any more use for you.\" The friendliness that had been in West's tone at the beginning of his statement faded as he spoke, his eyes steeling over. His gaze tore through Dex like a super-villain would a weakened superhero, but Dex wouldn't let him see how he had affected him. In response to the apparent threat, Dex had let his body relax and a small 'Sky Captain' like smirk appear on his face; a vision of 'playing it cool'. \"Well, golly, and here I thought you were just going to kill a bunch of people, try to take over the world while working under the rule of a madman, and kick puppies.\" West's gaze hardened even more as Joe's words once spoken on the subject of the Nazi's flowed out of his mouth. \"The Füher is not someone to joke about so lightly, Dexter. He's helping to build a new world free of all those who do not meet the criteria for the master race.\" The man opposite him seemed to become even more soldier like and steely as they stood there, in their less inviting environment while Dex stood on edge, trying not to channel Joe anymore. Apparently, what would Sky Captain Joe Sullivan do was not what he should do in this situation. \"West….why me? Why are you doing this to me?\" Dex tried to reason, trying to return to their former friendly nature. The traitorous human before him only ignored him as the door to the room slammed shut, the younger mechanic jumping as he hadn't noticed it open, and a blonde haired blue eyed man strode towards them with an easy gate. \"You ask so many questions Mr. Dexter. Please, allow me to answer them.\" The new man's easy way of speaking and the sudden stiffening of the Australian's posture made Dex wary, his eyes lowering their gaze slightly so as not to directly meet the imposing mans own crystalline blue gaze. \"And…who might you be?\" Dex tried to sound uncaring, like Joe sometimes did when he didn't want to know what a girl's name was or who was now mayor or if Polly was ever going to leave them alone, but failed slightly as he paused out of fear. \"I am one of the high ranking Generals of the third Reich, Heinrich Von Stauffenberg.\" [1] Stauffenberg lips turned up into an easy smile, something Dex had never imagined a Nazi had the ability to, before striding forward and motioning towards a chair that Dex hadn't seen in the room before. Apparently, he was being incredibly unobservant at the moment, but one tends to do that when kidnapped by Nazis. Uneasily Dex made his way to the chair, only sitting down when the Kommandant had nodded towards the furniture and said 'please', as if to be polite, before sitting down across the suddenly there table as well and in yet another mysteriously appearing chair. Several moments passed, in which were filled with the motions of the Kommandant taking his hat off and placing it on the table, his gloves soon following, and his body leaning back to rest against the back of the chair. Then he proceeded to stare at Dex, as if assessing him like an adversary does; Dex following suit and taking in all the was the Kommandant. Metals, such as the Iron Cross and several indistinguishable ones, adorned the Kommandant's military uniform like they were prizes. They seemed never-ending, at least, until they were outdone by the stark contrast of the red band on his left arm, bearing the Swastika; the mark of the Nazi regime. That, in itself, was relatively unnerving, but to have that backed up by the metals nearly had Dex shaking in his boots; not to mention that Westbrook was staring him down like a hungry Rottweiler. 'Shazam….I'm in big trouble now. Thanks a lot, Westbrook, you traitor.' Dex's own gaze hardened, but, as soon as it did, it became nervous again; as if he was afraid Westbrook could hear his thoughts. To confirm this thought, Dex quickly glanced towards West to see if his demeanor had changed in any way. The Kommandant's eyes seemed to follow his gaze, much to Dex's benefit. \"Heir Westbrook, please take your leave so that I may interrogate Mister Dexter by easier means than making him sweat out the answers to my questions.\" The Kommandant [2] spoke, his voice full of finality, now allowing West to argue before he left, his body rigid with hatred for the young mechanic that he had acted as a friend to. Dex's body relaxed slightly, finding that the gaze of the Kommandant was less stifling than West's, even though he was clearly more dangerous. \"Now, Mister Dexter, we may plan your escape in peace.\" \"Franky, we should have left by now! Dex and that damnable man could be anywhere by now!\" Joe's frustration leaked through every word as paced behind Franky, who was standing at ease next to the Morse-code men who received intelligence when there was no way for someone to use the radio. Currently, poor Sergeant Mays was on duty, and was passing information from the Squadron leader to one of Franky's secret operatives. A message was soon tapped in, Mays adjusting his headphones before taking down the reply to Franky's request for information. She had recently asked one of her higher ranking operatives whether or not Dex was aboard some ship, or something along the like. Mays was rather grating when it came to his Morse code. Joe had been raring to quickly type it out for him just so they could move along. \"Read it aloud for Mr. Sullivan here, Sergeant.\" Franky spoke as Mays finished penning the message on a notepad. \"Man aboard vessel, stop. Willing to sacrifice some standing, stop. Will try to implicate Westbrook, stop. Will have boy home soon, stop. Will need assistance in defecting afterwards, stop.\" Mays read, his crisp British accent making it hard to imagine it coming from anyone else, especially someone who was supposed to be so high ranking that he could only be contacted once every couple of months. \"Well, Joseph, it looks like we're going aboard the SMS Weißenburg .\" [3] Franky spoke, a smirk evident in her tone. Joe only stared at her in disbelief, his body on auto-pilot as he followed her to what he thought would be the hangar to go and rescue Dex from what could end up as certain doom. \"I'm not sure I understand, Heir Stauffenberg.\" Westbrook spoke, his voice full of confusion as he stood outside the Kommandant's own lodgings aboard the ship. He had forfeited them to the young mechanic, claiming he would personally see that their guest was well guarded during the wee hours of the evening and night. No one questioned the Kommandant, usually, but Westbrook stood questioning a man of higher authority than he; knowing full well of Dex's sexuality and of how bad it would look for the Kommandant. \"I will not be sleeping with him, Sie Einfaltspinsel [4]; I will be sleeping on the sofa next to the bed. He will not be out of my sight. He is too valuable.\" The Kommandant's tone held the same finality as before, but Westbrook seemed not to notice. \"With all due respect Heir Stauffenberg, I have been able to build the XP-37 by myself without any help from the yank in there.\" Westbrook's tone seemed affronted, but the Kommandant waved it off. \"Of course you have, but you haven't been able to make them fly underwater, now have you?\" \"I….no, Heir Kommandant, I have not.\" Westbrook deflated as he spoke, knowing he had lost the battle. \"Then, it is settled.\" The Kommandant spoke, opening the door to his chambers, halfway and nearly stepping through before rolling back on his heels and undoing the process. \"And also, Heir Westbrook, might I remind you not to refer to me as Heir Stauffenberg. You are of no rank and I am of a high respect. Your over-familiarity could be questioned and also could be counted as insubordination.\" The man's voice turned cold, his German accent seemingly becoming more pronounced as he spoke. Westbrook nearly took a step back as the usually amiable Kommandant of the SMS Weißenburg showed why his was the higher ranking man. \"Ja, Herr Kommandant.\" Westbrook's posture straightened significantly, nearly saluting the General, before the man gave a dismissive gesture and he was off, nearly running down the hallway to get away from the imposing Aryan man. \"We won't be going today, Joseph, we'd ruin the Kommandant's plan completely. He had reason to keep Dex with him for a week at the max before he can even get them off the ship.\" Franky tried to reason with the Sky Captain as he paced angrily, not at all happy with the plans that Franky and this so called 'Stauffenberg' had made with each other. Apparently, they weren't going to retrieve Dex, the General was going to fly Dex to them. That way, if they were caught, the Nazi's wouldn't have their planes to use as guides and Dex wouldn't be disposable. This, however, did not seem to put Joe's mind at ease. In fact, his thoughts were racing, as he paced, coming up with impossible schemes to get back to Dex before the so called 'operative' could make an amphibious plane. \"For God Sakes Joseph, stop pacing or you'll wear a hole in the floor and I'll have to hit you for another thing today!\" Franky cried, exasperated at the Sky Captain as he continued to pace, despite her insistence that he was going to fall through into another person's quarters. Franky sighed, annoyed by Joe's impatience and at the situation altogether. The other paid no notice to her, choosing to destroy whatever varnish had been on the floor, which then became the varnish on Joe's boots as he moved about nervously. \"Joseph, I will shoot you if you refuse to stop fidgeting!\" Franky's voice echoed as she yelled, causing the Sky Captain to halt and turn to face her. \"I can't! It's my fault he's there! I-I-I….\" Joe faltered his voice cracking as he spoke, his mouth instantly dry for some reason. \"It's just….my fault.\" Joe spoke quietly, his head hanging in shame. \"You want him back, I want him back, it's the damn Nazi's fault, and nothing else! You just messed up, although you'll have to face him afterwards, and it can all be fixed with time. Now, stop pacing and try to get some rest, we leave in the morning.\" Franky's voice was calm, as if she was speaking to one of her soldiers, and failed to waver once. Joe was about to respond, but Franky stood up abruptly and left the room, murmuring \"Bloody men\" in her wake… [1] Von Stauffenberg, sound familar? Maybe a certain Tom Cruise movie? Maybe a historical figure? Anyways, I knew Heinrich was considered a Germanic name and Von Stauffenberg was my default. [2] Kommandant is commander, usually used for the head of prison camps [Hogan's Heroes anyone?]...I kind of guessed at this one. I don't know the hierarchy of the German Navy, but I guessed it was similar to the United States Navy, so I went with commander. I didn't want him to be an admiral because that position would be too high in the Navy for him to forfeit, but his General status could always be defected. [3] Is an actual ship that was sunk during 1952-1953 that was given to the Ottoman Empire I believe after the war. I just didn't want to use the Bismark, because that's such a famous ship and it was actually sunk before this timeframe, I believe. ß this character is also pronounced 'eisse' or something along those lines. [4] \"You simpleton\", because idiot is actually \"Depp\" in German, and that would look strange...and simpleton also would signify that West is of lower rank. Finally, Chapter 3. I've been sick and busy, so…pardon for the lateness! I know it's kind of short...but, I wanted to get it to you as soon as I could. I tried to use the correct German for everything, but if it's wrong, would you kindly point it out? I know maybe forty words in German...maybe. Anyways, hope you enjoyed it! Please read and review kindly, -Aimze[Chapter 4] Recap: Sky Captain and Franky are off to meet up with their contact, which has been revealed to be a high ranking officer in the enemy's navy. Dex gained a new ally, but lost a man who he thought was his friend. A/N: Forgive my hiatus. I couldn't come up with anything to write and I didn't want to half-ass it….that, and I was too busy failing at life. Disclaimer: I do not own anything Sky Captain related, but I do have the DVD and it plays wonderfully in my PS3. It took two flasks of whiskey, one of which was Franky's, before Joe even thought about sleeping last night. The guilt of having once again slept beside his best friend, the guilt of knowing he had betrayed the man he loved, and the guilt that he had let Dex be swept off by some bastard by the name of Westbrook had worn heavy on him all throughout the night. Dreams of Dex being tortured like he had been in Manchuria plagued him throughout the wee ours of the morning, the time at which he had almost been able to sleep, and had him drenched with sweat and worried. \"Would you please try to keep it together, Joseph, some of us would like to not be nearly thrown off a perfectly comfortable bed.\" Franky's voice startled him as he lay awake, his back turned to her so that he would be nowhere near touching her. They had slept in the clothes that they wore the day before, their thought process being that they could get a head start and make their rendezvous with their contact. It didn't matter to him, though, because he couldn't stand making physical contact at the moment, even if it was fully dressed in their daily attire. \"Sorry, Franky.\" He mumbled, his voice raw as he spoke, trying to sound as if he were the normal, snarky Sky Captain. He couldn't stand it if Franky pitied him any more than he knew she did now. No, he would have to act like they were going to save the day and Dex was going to be no worse for wear, just like he was the last time he was kidnapped. A small smile grew on the Sky Captain's face as he thought about the last great adventure they'd all been on together. Everything had ended bright and well, even though Polly had forgotten to take the lens cap off of her camera in the end. That moment, however, wasn't as great as when they'd returned to base and began to rebuild. No, nothing could have been as great as he and Dex practically professed their undying love for each other. A chuckle almost made its way past his lips before he stopped himself, his mind automatically returning to recent events. The urge to beat his head against the headboard for being so stupid was quickly repressed, but barely held back. \"Joe. It's oh-five-hundred hours, we have clearance to leave now, so stop having a mental war and let's get on with our mission.\" Franky's voice came from behind him, surprising him once again at her stealth as he hadn't even noticed her getting up from the bed and gathering up her gear. Joe immediately sat up and began to gather his things, stopping only to open his nightstand's drawer and pull out a pack of double-bubble. A sentimental smile grew on his face before his whole expression changed to that of determination, his brow furrowing in mock anger. Quickly he finished gathering all of his things, including the gum, and with a quick few strides to the door, he was ready. With a quick look to the woman beside him he opened the door, words no longer needed between the two aviators as they exited the room. Dex felt as if the Kommandant was trying to turn him into stone, or, at least, he'd deduced that after twenty minutes of being stared at. Dex could easily understand why the man was a high ranking official, even without the large display of war medals and the iron cross staring him in the face. The want to slowly slide out of his seat and underneath the table crossed Dex's mind before he mentally shook it, not quite understanding why he was so undeniably scared of the man. True, the Kommandant was a Nazi and had most likely killed a lot of people or had been the reason why many had died, but the man was risking his life for Dex and potentially saving hundreds of thousands of others. They had taken Dex for one reason and one reason only, and that was because he was literally a certifiable genius. He had created the technology for the ability to fly a plane underwater, he'd created a ray gun, an air force base that actually flew in the air, and had easily taken down one of the top minds of science, Totenkopf. Although the last one he'd had help with, the others had been all him, and he had so many ideas for so much more, he was scared. What if the Kommandant was killed trying to get him out of there? What if Joe and Franky were killed trying to save him? What would happen if West mentioned to one of the crew that his lover was a man? What if they found out that his family had some Jewish heritage? The 'what ifs' began to run so quickly through Dex's brain that he felt dizzy and disoriented; each what if bringing with it scenarios of death and despair. It wasn't until a large hand grasped his shoulder that he felt stable enough to notice that the Kommandant was no longer sitting across from him, but kneeling next to his chair, his hand on his shoulder in a form of comfort. Dex's eyes widened a fraction of an inch as he body became rigid at the notion of any contact with the man, no matter how helpful he had been. The other man immediately retracted his hand and stood, noticing the way the mechanic tensed up under his touch. \"I apologize; I only meant to make sure you were alright.\" The Kommandant's tone was soft and understanding, a tone that Dex would have never expected from him, but apparently came out of the man all the same. He had spoken the same calm, easy way to Dex when they had been planning his means of escape the other day and yet still it caused the young mechanic a sliver of surprise. \"Naw, it's alright Kommandant, I just….I'm just….\" Dex trailed off, unable to finish his thought as another formed in its place. \"Say, Kommandant….how come you're trying to defect?\" He questioned the man who had returned to his seat across the table, the same one that they had sat at yesterday when he was 'questioned' by the other man. Icy blue eyes connected with his as their gazes met and for once in his life, Dex thought he'd gone a bit too far. ' Something Joe would do on a daily bases.' Dex nearly laughed at the thought before, he reigned himself in and managed return the intense stare that Kommandant seemed to be so especially good at. Several minutes passed by, their staring contest taking precedence over their ability to speak to each other before a sigh fell from the other man's lips and he looked away. \"I guess, since we've got some time before we meet up with my contact from Britain, I could tell you why I became an informant.\" The older man seemed resigned as his spoke, causing Dex's brow to furrow in confusion while the other man's face became somewhat of a myriad of emotions. \"In nineteen thirty-three [1] we all hoped that we would save ourselves by electing him to office. By nineteen thirty-nine [2] we were practically out of debt and we had built an army. We put our faith in the devil.\" The Kommandant's voice was soft, almost like a whisper, but his German accent was more pronounced somehow. His shoulders seemed to slump as his eyes became fixated on his own hand on the table, its ungloved paleness standing out against the table's slate grey backdrop. \"I joined the army in nineteen thirty-nine in an attempt to make my father proud of me, as he had fought and served during the First World War. I was commended for terrible things; crimes that I should have never committed. I was so naïve and caught up by the Füher's message that I forgot how to be human; that is, until my unit was marched through Germany and parts of Austria. I was a part of Kristallnaucht [3], I was part of the invasion of Poland [4], and now, at the age of thirty I am old.\" The older man raised his gaze to meet Dex's; sorrow filling it passed the brim so that one streak of salty moisture trekked down his cheek. \"The last straw was when my men and I were to assist in the guarding of internment camps.\" The Kommandant's gaze fell once again to the table, hiding his face under the brim of his hat and displaying the 'hail Hitler' [5] that was placed upon it. Dex repressed a shudder as he listened, watching the man before him with both disgust and pity. \"I saw what we'd done to them. I never knew true cruelty until that camp; I was never as cruel as I was there. I became a monster…until I met him .\" The emphasis on the word 'him' seemed to resonate in Dex's mind, making him even more curious about the man before him that he had been originally. \"I was on guard duty in the barracks, as it was the night off for one of the other lieutenants and I was situated at the front entrance. They had just brought along a new batch of prisoners and were still situating them to the horrors of the labor camps. They didn't know all the rules or how to act around us in the new environment quite yet, but they still needed to know their place,\" He paused at this, his hand on the table reaching up to wipe his face off slightly, \"Or so I used to think. I was alert, on watch, and determined to be the perfect Scheisskopf Nazi [6]. I had been on guard for most of the night and would soon turn my duty over to Herr Schweighöfer [7] when I heard humming.\" \"You heard humming?\" Dex slapped a hand over his mouth as quickly as he spoke, his eyes widening as far as they could go in trepidation. \"I'm sorry, Kommandant, when I don't have gum I start talkin' like Cap'n and I get all ridiculous and-.\" \"I understand, it's a very odd thing to say. Your disbelief is easily understandable, Dexter.\" The Kommandant cut Dex off by raising his hand in the air in a placating gesture and speaking up, his voice once again returning to its normal state. Dex could only nod as he was once again befuddled by the older man. \"As I was saying, I heard humming,\" The Kommandant paused to glance at Dex, making sure he had returned to his story before continuing on, \"Generally, the prisoners would keep quiet except for very low whispers; most of the time, though, they tried to sleep as much as they could; so, when I heard humming, I went in to investigate.\" Dex nodded, a pure reaction to make sure the other man knew he was following him. \"I found him lying in the bottom bunk, his eyes closed, and his fingers swiftly mimicking a pianist's movements. He seemed not to take any notice of me; he just kept playing his invisible piano. I stood in silence, watching him, waiting for him to finish his piece before I knelt down next to him and shone my torch in his face.\" The officer seemed to be lost in the memory as he once again stopped to let this information sink in, his eyes almost glazed over as he stared above my head, seemingly remembering the event. \"What happened then?\" Dex interrupted, his voice betraying his interest in the tale like a little kid would any tale. A small smile broke the cold look to the man across from Dex, making him seem just for that second like any other man instead of a person who orchestrated the murders of probably hundreds. \"He finally noticed me and flinched back, holding his hand up to the light and saying 'God, Lieutenant, could you not shine that light in my face? I'm trying to play here.' To say that I was stunned into silence would be an understatement. Immediately I shone the beam of light towards the floor, causing him to smile at me as if…\" The Kommandant faltered again, his eyes once again looking towards the floor. \"As if what?\" Dex questioned, trying to figure out the mystery, wanting to know what could change such a person's whole view on life. \"As if I were a human being,\" The Kommandant finished, his face falling and his tone hoarse, \"After a few seconds of silence I asked him what he had been playing, not quite able to return to the way I was supposed to act, and we started talking. I was conversing with someone who I expected to hate me, but didn't, and I felt different around him.\" \"How so?\" Dex urged the other man to speak, his body now literally on the edge of the seat as he listened to the other man, wanting to know how that singular person had changed the man before him. \"I didn't feel like a monster.\" As soon as the Kommandant quit speaking a loud knock resounded, causing them both to sit bolt upright. A few seconds passed as they settled themselves into their roles, Dex taking the frightened prisoner approach while the Kommandant's whole persona grew cold and imposing. Again the person outside knocked, the knock slightly louder in volume than the first. Quickly Dex threw himself into the corner of the small room, trying his best to look as though he'd been terrorized and belittled. \"Geben Sie!\" [8] The Kommandant spoke, standing up from his seat at the table to turn and face the newest addition to their space. The door swung open easily and two pairs of footsteps were heard entering the room before the door was once again closed. Silence shrouded the room in mystery, making Dex reluctant to look up from his feigned terrorized position. \"Guten Morgen, Kommandant. Ich sehe, Sie haben unser Paket bereit zu gehen?\" [9] A woman's voice cut through the tension like a knife, the unmistakable smile in the tone causing Dex to nearly have a heart attack. \"Ja, ich glaube ja, Squadron Leader.\" [10] The Kommandant replied before doing an about-face and walking over to Dex, stopping only to kneel down next to him from his spot in the corner. \"Dexter, I think you might want to look up now.\" The Kommandant spoke, his hand finding purchase on Dex's shoulder once more, though Dex refused to tense up once more. Dex slowly unfurled himself from the 'defensive' position he took, his head rising so that he could look up, over the edge of the table and see the one face he'd been wanting to see since he'd arrived on the warship. \"Dex?\" Was the only word Joe could get out of his mouth before the small mechanic practically leapt towards him, bringing the slightly taller man's head down with one hand so that he could kiss him. They had been flying above the cloud line for far too long, in Joe's opinion, and it was starting to make him fidget. Never had the Sky Captain opted to sit in the passenger seat in his life, but for once, he let Franky do all of the flying. They had chosen the poor Sergeant May's plane, as he was part of the amphibious squadron, in case of any tries at sabotage. It was common knowledge that the Polly was Joe's plane and Westbrook knew from working on Franky's plane which one it was. Therefore, Franky decided she would be pilot and Joe would be passenger because she'd 'Flown this type of plane before'. Joe hardly saw the difference, but he understood her reasoning. 'You're emotionally compromised.' She'd said to him, something Franky usually would say to get Joe to see reason in his rash actions, although, this time, he could say the same about her. A sigh flew past Joe's lips before he even had the chance to stop it and he nearly smacked himself in the head with the pilot's seat. ' This isn't some fly-day for us, it's a rescue mission and it's for Dex, so get it together, Joe!' Joe yelled at himself in his mind before he took a deep breath and looked out the visor of the plane. Joe's brow furrowed in puzzlement as he noticed that they were now breaking through cloud coverage and were diving towards the water, but with no warship in sight. ' Of course, you ninny! You can't just go landing on a Nazi warship, declaring you're going to just pop in a rescue your lover, who happens to be a man, and also leaving heavy one Kommandant!' Joe reprimanded himself, trying to keep himself at least somewhat sharp and not shrouded in the depressive guilt that was having to actually rescue Dex. \"We're going under.\" Franky's voice startled him out of his thoughts and he looked up just in time to see them breach the water's surface and plunge into dark depths of the ocean. Joe hadn't even heard Franky prepare the plane for submersion he was so lost in his thoughts. ' Definitely emotionally compromised.' He scoffed at himself before returning his attention back onto the task at hand; making sure to remember all that Franky told him. \"We're going to only breach the water's surface when board the ship. There is a hull, an escape hull, that is going to be opened by one of the Kommandant's trusted men—.\" \"How do we know we can trust this man, let alone the Kommandant?\" Joe cut Franky off, his brow scrunching in suspicion. \"The Kommandant found us, not the other way around, and he's helped at least a hundred Jewish peoples escape while also giving us the movements of the Nazi Naval Fleet,\" Franky paused, letting this new information seep in for Joe before continuing, \"And if he says he trusts this man with his life, then he trusts this man with his life.\" \"Alright….what's next?\" Joe said, reminding himself that he would never question Franky again if her icy tone of voice was anything to go by. \"Then we change into uniform. You look Aryan, so you will take the Kommandant's bars and be Lieutenant Schleiden. [11] I will be the Kommandant's recently hired personal secretary, Iiana Lindemann. [12] We will make our way to the interrogation room that the Kommandant has Dex in where we will then discuss the next part of the plan.\" Franky's no-nonsense tone was enough of a hint to Joe that they were going deep undercover and that this wasn't a time to be the Sky Captain, it was time to be Joe Sullivan who was going to be demoted to Lieutenant Schleiden. \"Okay.\" Was all Joe could muster as the gravity of the situation caught up with him and he slowly fell back into his seat, wishing that he were the one flying so that he could at least be doing something instead of sitting there, waiting for the images of Dex being tortured to fill his head. \"We're here Joseph, get ready to move as fast as possible. As soon as I set the plane to auto-pilot, we're going to need to climb the emergency ladder.\" Franky spoke, turning slightly in her seat to look at Joe. Joe nodded, feeling slightly more confident now that he was going to go do something to free his Dex, not just sit there pathetically and wait. \"Three….two….one…now!\" Franky whispered loudly as they breached the surface and the visor of the plane shot back quickly to let them out. Joe jumped out first, walking quickly and as quietly as he could on the slick wing before grabbing onto the rope ladder that was lowered for them and climbing up, not even waiting for Franky. The feeling of someone else climbing below him followed soon after and a smirk formed on Joe's face before he steeled himself again and began to climb faster, wanting to reach the hull as quick as possible. It took only a matter of minutes for them to climb all the way up, but once they were inside they were met with only an empty hallway. Slightly suspicious they both pulled out their firearms, aiming down each end of the hallway respectively. They stilled, posed and ready for battle, until the sound of very timid footsteps began to echo through the hall. Franky turned around just in time to force Joe to lower his weapon as a tall, thin man appeared around the corner wearing the garb of a Nazi soldier. \"Ach, Sie haben es geschafft.\" [13] The man spoke, his German slightly accented and his smile warm and welcoming. Franky nodded briskly, her small smile becoming slightly larger and her eyebrow rising in that way only Franky could raise it. \"Ja, wir ... und Sie haben es geschafft, als auch, wie ich sehe.\" [14] Franky spoke, her British accent disappearing under years of perfection. The man's smile became a full blown grin before he nodded and moved closer, soon standing right in front of them. Ja, das habe ich. Nun ist es Zeit für Sie zwei zu ändern…..Please, follow me.\" [15] The man spoke, changing into English as he seemed to notice the lost look on Joe's face. Franky only smiled and nodded, literally dragging Joe down the hallway to the room the man walked into so that they could put on their outfits. \"You speak German and English with an accent.\" Joe stated as the man from earlier, now known to them as Andrzej, who was currently placing the bars of a Lieutenant on Joe's uniform. They were to be lined up perfectly, just like any medals the Kommandant had seen fit to let them borrow and the iron cross, which was generally bestowed upon ranking officers for their combat valor. \"Yes…I am Polish, sir.\" Andrzej spoke as he stepped back, his large grin having faded a long time ago and now the haunted look of a man who had seen far too much for his age replacing it. Joe felt the need to apologize, but the surprise that sparked through him seemed to freeze him in place. \"You are Polish? How have you stayed hidden?\" [16] Franky stepped in, asking the question of the hour. Andrzej turned his head to look at her, his eyes seeming hollow while a small smile formed on his face. \"I haven't stepped foot outside the Kommandant's quarters until today.\" Andrzej's words weighed heavy in the air, the gravity of the fact that he had only had the Kommandant as his only confidant and friend, let alone that he even was living and was talking to him, slowly sinking in. \"He saved you?\" Joe questioned, but just as he was about to get an answer, Franky interrupted Andrej. \"I'm sorry, but we must really keep to schedule. Andrej, will you take us to the interrogation room?\" Franky questioned, giving Joe a pointed look before Andrej nodded to her and turned around quickly, opening the door and looking back to them to motion for them to follow. \"Komm, folge mir nach.\" [17] \"Dex?\" Joe's heart fluttered at the look Dex gave him before the young mechanic shot towards him yanked him down for a kiss. Instantly Joe's arms wrapped around the shorter man, pulling him as close as he could manage while Dex's right hand pulled his head down closer and his left went to Joe's cheek. A slight cough from Franky's direction caused them to quickly separate, but only just far away enough for it to be seen as proper if anyone were to walk in. \"So, Kommandant….how the devil to we get out of here?\" Facts and Translations: [1] In nineteen thirty-three we all hoped that we would save ourselves by electing him to office. Hitler was elected Chancellor, not Füher, of Germany. [2] By nineteen thirty-nine we were practically out of debt and we had built an army. By now, Hitler is Füher and has made the secret pact with Russia that they will leave him be if he lets them have half of Poland. [3 & 4] I was a part of Kristallnaucht, I was part of the invasion of Poland, and now, at the age of thirty I am old. Kristallnaucht is the 'Night of broken glass' or the 'Night of glass', which was the invasion of Nazi Germany and Austria by the Nazi Army. The invasion of Poland was the first time Blitzkreig or 'lightening war' was fought. Also, the Ramones sing the song 'Blitzkreig Bop' which is about the invasion of Poland, I believe. The one that goes 'Hey Ho Let's Go' in the beginning. [5] ' hail Hitler' This is probably spelled Heil Hitler, but I don't really care to Heil him, so meh. This is the symbol of the hawk holding a swastika. I've seen it on their hats before, although I'm not sure if it's just the formal wear or not. Sometimes it was just the Iron cross, other times it was just the hawk, etc. [6] Scheisskopf Nazi Shit head Nazi. That's all it means. He's very bitter, mind you, so, even if you're a neo-Nazi, you got to admit, you just learned how to spell shit head…kind of. [7] Herr Schweighöfer I feel kind of bad for associating Matthias Schweighöfer in this, but his last name is German and I am lazy. [8 - 10] \" Geben Sie!\" \"Enter!\" \" Guten Morgen, Kommandant. Ich sehe, Sie haben unser Paket bereit zu gehen?\" \"Good morning, Commander. I see you have our package ready? \" \" Ja, ich glaube ja, Squadron Leader.\" \"Yes, I think so, Squadron Leader.\" [11 & 12] Lieutenant Schleiden. Iiana Lindemann. Schleiden is a name I accidentally found out was German and Iiana is after a friend of mine from Germany. Lindemann is Till Lindemann's last name and he is the lead singer of Rammstein. [13 – 15] \" Ach, Sie haben es geschafft.\" \"Ah, I see you've made it.\" \"Ja, wir ... und Sie haben es geschafft, als auch, wie ich sehe.\" \"Yes, we did…..and I you've made it as well, I see.\" \"Ja, das habe ich. Nun ist es Zeit für Sie zwei zu ändern…..Please, follow me.\" \"Yes, I have. Now it's time for you two to chance….Please, follow me.\" [16] How have you stayed hidden? The Polish were looked upon as dirty to the Germans, so they decimated them and tried to destroy an entire race of people. Thanks to people like Captain Wilm Hosenfeld and the people who tried to hide Poles like Wladyslaw Spilzman, they didn't. It's also ridiculous that they thought this, but that's my opinion. [17] \" Komm, folge mir nach.\" \"Come, follow me.\" End of Facts and Translations. A/N: Some of my translations are not literal because English and German, however similar they should be [English is a Germanic language], they do not always coincide. That's because we thought we'd just make it harder for everyone to learn by making up new slang every few years/months/days. Yay Americans, we're just awesome.

For those of you visiting from other fandoms, I have some new Starfox stuff I'll be posting shortly, and for Firefly fans, I cross my heart that Dear Ma will be updated soon. To those of you who are dedicated Sky Captain fans and were wondering about the new face, while this is the first story I've posted in the fandom it is not the first I've written in it, and I have several others needing only final edits. It seems to me like this fandom has been painfully quiet of late, which is a shame because there have been some great stories written for it in the past and posted both here on and on the live journal slash community. With that in mind, here's a little jolt that with any luck will get things jumping a bit. In any and all cases, reviews are always wonderful. Thanks for reading! ***************************************************************************************************************************************************** \"Can you believe how fast they've been putting this place back together?\" Skip asked, tipping his chair back and glancing out the window of the guard house. \"It's been what, two months now? And it's practically all done. That's even counting in the three weeks it took to start getting supplies in here for rebuilding. It's crazy.\" \"Yeah, I don't envy all them other guys,\" Tommy replied as a battered deck of cards flew back and forth between his hands in a complicated shuffle. \"I heard they've even got the pilots working construction.\" \"I'll bet they're real happy about that,\" Homer snorted. \"Hey, are you gonna deal those, or just sit there and fondle them?\" \"Relax, Homer. We've got all night to play.\" Tommy rolled his eyes as he began to deal. \"Five card draw, sevens wild.\" \"What're you in such a rush about?\" Skip threw in, picking up his cards as he offered a verbal jab towards the oldest member of that night's shift. \"It's not like you're winning or anything. Give me two,\" he finished, placing a pair of cards facedown on the table beside him. \"I'm not the one with the ants in my pants,\" Homer countered. \"You've been staring out that window since we got here. Three.\" He glanced at the cards he was given and grimaced. \"You and the kid we let out earlier, you're both in some hell of a hurry to get away from here.\" \"Kid?\" Skip wrinkled his nose, thinking back. \"Only person to leave the base since we got here's been Dex.\" \"Right. The kid. Raise you two.\" \"I'll see the opener and your raise, plus another buck. And Dex isn't a kid. To hear everyone else talk, he's a fricking genius or something.\" \"Call,\" Tommy interjected, throwing his chips in the middle with the others. He frowned down at the three of a kind in his hand. It was low, but it might do the trick. \"How'd a guy that young get to be head engineer, anyway?\" \"Probably a pervert, just like his boss. I'm out.\" \"Up another dollar,\" Skip said, frowning towards the older man. \"And what do you mean, perverted? I never got that sense off of him, or off of the boss. Not that I ever see them except when they're rolling through the gate, but still. Besides, like I said, he's supposed to be super smart.\" \"Hmm…yeah, alright, I'll see you and call. You're crazy, Homer. Dex is just a nice guy.\" Tommy laid his cards face-up, heard Skip's groan of defeat, and pulled the pot towards himself with a grin. \"I broke down on the road once after my shift, right?\" Skip continued speaking as chips clicked into stacks on the other side of the table. \"He comes along, pulls over and asks if I need any help. I wasn't gonna say no, it was three in the morning. Now, I figure myself to be a pretty good hand with a car – my pop has a garage, you know – but I couldn't figure for the life of me what was wrong with that old jalopy. He looks under the hood for all of two minutes, messes around a bit, and I'll be damned if that car didn't start up with a purr. Haven't had a problem with her since. It's your deal, by the way,\" he finished, passing the cards to Homer. \"All I know is that Mr. High-and-Mighty Sky Captain figures he can just sleep with whoever he wants any time he wants,\" the oldest guard said as he shuffled clumsily, nearly dropping the deck several times. \"Me, I call that perversion. And as close as them two seem to be, could be maybe some of that perversion's rubbed off.\" Skip laughed from where he was once again watching out the window. \"All famous people do that. Don't you read the papers?\" \"That's not being perverted, that's taking a good thing when you've got it,\" Tommy agreed. \"And who can blame him? Some of them women he's been with, oh man, I tell you what…Maybe you're just losing your juices, Homer.\" \"Like hell. I'm just saying, maybe it ain't only girls he's jumping between. Sevens wild again, ace to open. You can't never tell with those foreign types.\" \"He's a Brit, Homer. It's not like he came out of darkest Africa. Sides, you ever actually seen him come home with a guy in the car next to him?\" \"Just the kid. He's come back with him plenty of times, both looking about happy as clams, too.\" He turned to snap at Skip, who had yet to pick up his hand. \"Would you quit looking out there and play the game? I'm dying of old age here.\" \"Sorry. Just got a funny feeling tonight, I guess. Thought I heard something up the road a bit ago.\" He examined his cards. \"I'll open.\" \"Thank God,\" Homer breathed as Tommy called and play came around to him. \"I'll raise two. I'm telling you, those two act awful funny together sometimes. Like they've got some sort of secret.\" \"Jeez, can't two guys be friends in your world? Call. Besides, who cares who sleeps with who? I mean, so long as the job gets done.\" \"You're sounding awful Red there, Tommy. Kinda scary, thought of having a Red watching my back on night duty.\" Homer narrowed his eyes at the younger man. \"Would you back off already?\" Skip barked, throwing his cards down. \"I'm out. And Tommy's right - who cares who anyone else is sleeping with? It's none of our business.\" \"Hey, now, boys, I'm just saying, the kid's a little creepy. He freaks me out.\" He looked at them, his eyes wide in mock innocence. \"I'm just trying to warn you fellows that you maybe ought to, you know, be careful around him. You never know. I mean yeah, he's American enough sounding, but it's not so hard for those foreigners to twist your head around so you think up's down, if that what they want. You two are fine guys, I figure you should watch your back.\" Skip stared at him stonily. \"He fixed my car, in the middle of the night, and didn't ask for so much as a dime. We had a pretty pleasant conversation, too, while he was at it. He always remembers my name and asks how I am when he sees me on duty. So I'm not really interested in hearing you talk shit like that about him.\" He stood up, his chair screeching slightly as he pushed it back from the table. \"I'm gonna take a look outside. See you two in a few.\" Shrugging on his jacket, he stepped outside, muttering under his breath. \"I tell you, you try to be a nice guy, maybe warn somebody so they don't get sucked into something dirty, and that's the thanks you get,\" Homer complained. \"He probably voted to give the country to FDR, too, I'll bet. Him and that creepy kid both.\" \"Homer?\" Tommy asked from where he sat examining his fingernails. \"What?\" \"Shut the hell up.\"[Chapter 2] Skip came back inside a few minutes later, letting the door slam behind him as he headed for the coffee pot. His jacket was wet from the rain that had been falling all evening, and he shot a scowl towards where Homer still sat at the table, erecting a shaky looking house of cards. \"How's the weather?\" Tommy asked meditatively. He had moved to lean against the wall so he could watch the road without seeing his co-worker's sad attempts at architecture reflected in the glass, and asked the question without looking around. \"Cloudy. No stars. Driving home's going to be just dandy if it keeps raining like it is.\" \"Mmm.\" They fell silent again, the two younger guards studying the approach to the bridge that separated the base from the mainland and trying to ignore the heavy breathing of the man behind them. Had it just been them, the quiet would have been companionable; with Homer's low curses as the cards folded over and over again in the background, it was tense. \"Don't you guys want to keep playing?\" the older man asked finally, a slight begging tone in his voice. \"Not in the mood,\" Skip muttered. Outside, a sliver of moon peeked out of the clouds, casting just enough light on the wet blacktop for him to realize that something was on the road. \"Did you see that?\" he asked Tommy, straightening up. \"I thought I saw something, but there's no lights. Can't be a car, unless they're running dark.\" \"Pretty stupid in this weather.\" He grabbed a rifle down off of the rack by the door. \"Or pretty smart, depending on why they're driving blind.\" \"I'm with you,\" Tommy nodded, snagging a handheld spotlight from under the counter and following Skip back outside. The falling water sank through his uniform, reminding him too late that he hadn't put his jacket on. \"Shit, this is a cold rain.\" \"Yeah. Shine that light up the road, would you?\" They searched fruitlessly for a few moments before the sound of footsteps became clear. \"Someone's walking up,\" Tommy said unnecessarily. \"Hey, who goes there?\" Skip hollered into the dark. The footsteps stopped. \"Is that you, Skip?\" a muffled but vaguely familiar voice called back, a note of pain in it's tone. \"Uh…yeah.\" Exchanging a glance with the other guard, he shrugged. \"Who're you?\" \"It's Dex.\" \"Oh. Hey.\" His eyebrows knit together suddenly. \"Didn't you leave here in a car earlier? Why are you walking back?\" \"It's kind of a long story. Look, I'm just trying to get back down to the base.\" \"Step into the flashlight beam before you come any closer.\" He jerked his head towards the spot the voice had come from, and Tommy aimed the light there. A pair of boots became visible, followed by the standard issue khaki uniform that were all either man had ever seen the engineer dressed in. \"You sound kind of funny, you know. Just making sure you are who you say.\" \"I know. Just doing your jobs. It's fine, guys, really.\" He raised one hand to block the direct light that was stabbing into his eyes. \"Could you put your hand down? I can't see your face.\" \"Sorry.\" He lowered his arm slowly, trying not to hiss as the brightness filled his already pounding head with needles. \"Ow.\" \"Holy cow, Dex, are you okay? Tommy, turn that light off, or away or something.\" \"I'll live. It looks worse than it is, I think,\" he called back as he tried to stay on his feet. The world was unstable, the lights of the base beyond the guard post refusing to stay in one place for more than a second. \"Can I come forward now?\" he asked before taking any further steps. The last thing I need tonight is to get shot, on top of everything else. \"Sure. I mean, hell, you're the boss.\" The two guards waited as he walked the rest of the way to the glow that surrounded the gatehouse, both of their eyes widening as he came into full view. \"Oh, wow, what happened to you?\" Skip asked, moving to open the door for the dripping engineer. \"You look like you went three rounds with Joe Louis.\" \"It was more like one round with a deer,\" Dex replied as he stumbled forward. \"Tommy Johansen, right?\" he asked as he passed by the flashlight wielder. \"Right.\" \"Heard through the grapevine you just became an uncle. Congratulations.\" \"Hey, thanks!\" Homer's a dumbass . This guy's all right, he decided as he followed Skip and their guest into the warm guardhouse. \"Get you some coffee?\" \"Sounds good to me,\" Dex replied, not certain he'd be able to stomach it with the way his head was spinning but eager to at least wrap his hands around something warm. \"Thanks, Skip,\" he added as he slumped into the chair that the guard pulled out for him. \"Sorry,\" he addressed the fourth man in the room. \"I don't think I caught your name.\" \"Homer Gates,\" the older man said stiffly, eyeing the newcomer's damaged features. \"What the hell happened to your face, kid?\" Despite the agony the action ignited, Dex's mouth automatically pulled a terse smile at the youthful moniker that he hated with a passion. It was one thing for Joe to refer to him as a 'good boy' all the time – that was a term of endearment, after all, a nickname given to him by a man not exactly known for his creativity – but to be addressed like a child by an oaf who hadn't even bothered to get out of his seat while his comrades had been doing their jobs was something else all together. \"Like I told the others outside,\" he replied as best he could with both his lips split and bleeding, \"I had a run-in with Mother Nature.\" \"What, were you driving drunk or something? Roads ain't that bad.\" \"I hit a deer,\" he answered tightly, his already frazzled nerves wearing thinner still the longer he talked to this man. Having answered that incredibly rude presumption, he turned his attention back to the other two. \"I won't interrupt you for long, I know you're working. I just want to dry off some before I finish walking back.\" \"Are you kidding? You can't walk back like that. You'll never make it,\" Skip exclaimed, straightening up from where he'd been rustling around under the counter for the first-aid kit someone had told him once was supposed to be there. \"Here, a wet towel's about the best we've got,\" he gave up finally, tossing the engineer the rag they'd been using to wipe condensation off of the insides of the windows. \"Maybe you can get some of the blood off, at least.\" \"…Does it look that bad?\" Dex asked tentatively, dabbing here and there at his face. \"Ow! Guess that's broken. No wonder I sound ridiculous,\" he muttered when he brushed at his nose. \"Stupid thing came right through the windshield. It didn't hurt this much outside. I guess the cold must have numbed it some. Hey, thanks, Tommy,\" he said as he stopped exploring his injuries to take the cup that was being offered to him. He sipped gingerly, wincing as the liquid stung the open wounds in his mouth but grateful for the heat. \"You don't have a mirror laying around, do you?\" \"Nah. Try the windows. They reflect pretty good on nights like this, if you wipe them off. Homer, aren't we supposed to have a first aid kit around here somewhere? Or a blanket, or something?\" \"Hell if I know,\" the older guard spat back, watching from the corner of his eyes as Dex stood uncertainly and moved towards the window. \"Your turn to mop the floor tonight, Skip,\" he added, seeing the blood that had dripped onto the concrete where their visitor had been sitting. \"Shut up, Homer. Dex, you all right over there?\" he asked, seeing him waver a bit and grab the window frame for support. \"Yeah, I'm fine.\" He peered at his reflection as it rippled in the rainwater on the glass. \"Oh, man, Joe's going to kill me when he sees this,\" he groaned. So much for this shirt, he thought as he noted how the cascade of red that coated his lower face and neck had soaked into the light-colored cotton. He wiped at it ineffectually, managing to do little more than spread it around. \"What's he care if you smash your face up some?\" Homer asked, suddenly interested. \"Or does he only hire pretty boys for the good paying jobs?\" Dex stiffened. \"Excuse me?\" he asked icily, his hand freezing a few inches from his lips, the now ruined rag clenched in his fist. \"I'm just saying, maybe you're worried if you lose your looks he'll pack you off up here with the rest of the hangdog gang. You know, maybe he won't want to keep you so close by all the time if your face is all fucked up.\" \"Just what are you implying, Mr. Gates?\" he said slowly. As badly as it hurt to talk, there was no way he was going to let a jab like that go by unrecognized. Comments like the one that had just been made were how rumors got started, rumors that they could ill afford to have taken seriously. \"Jesus, Homer, quit being an ass,\" Tommy interjected, having caught a frightening glimpse of the steel that made up the engineer's core and not wanting to see any more of it revealed. \"I just asked a simple question,\" Homer insisted. \"If he doesn't want to answer it, that's fine with me. Tells me plenty in either case.\" \"I'll be happy to answer your real question, if you'd like to spit it out,\" Dex nearly growled back. Skip had never before thought of the man in front of him as a frightening figure, but as he watched him utter that slightly slurred threat from behind his mask of carmine and angry bruises, he shuddered. The eldest guard, being either incredibly fearless or completely lacking in a sense of self-preservation, continued his taunting. \"I'm just wondering what it is you and your boss do when-\" \"Homer, get the hell out of here,\" Skip interrupted him, his lips pursed. He could see the engineer tensing, every muscle in his body tightening as he tried to hold back the urge to beat his provocateur into the ground. It wasn't hard to imagine how the rest of the night would go at this pace; Homer would end up dead, Dex would be led off in handcuffs, and it would take every connection and ounce of charm that Sky Captain possessed to get him back and clear his record. Worst of all, Skip himself would have to fill out more paperwork than he saw even in his nastiest nightmares, on top of having to explain what it was that had driven the engineer into homicidal madness to begin with. No, it was much better to just stop it now. \"You can't-\" the older man tried to argue. \"The hell I can't. You might have been here longer, but in case you haven't noticed my name's above yours on the schedule, and has been for months. If I tell you to get the fuck out of here and go home so you can cool off, you better just do it, all right?\" \"…Fine,\" he spat finally. \"I'm going. See you boys tomorrow night, maybe. Good luck walking home in the rain, kid ,\" he tossed in Dex's direction as he stormed out. A few minutes later an engine roared from the ditch behind the gatehouse. Tires squealing, Homer Gates sped away towards the city, muttering curses about sexual deviants and Communist infiltration as he went. \"What an ass,\" Tommy broke the silence when the red glow of Gates' taillights had vanished over the hill. \"Just ignore him,\" Skip said when he saw that Dex hadn't relaxed. \"No one listens to him, he's just a sorry sack of shit.\" Heaving a sigh that he immediately regretted, the engineer settled back into his chair. I nearly blew that, he realized belatedly. If I had attacked him, it would have given credence to his accusations. Normally I can just brush people like him off. What the hell's wrong with me tonight? I never react like that. \"Yeah. I'm sorry you guys have to put up with that kind of talk. Is he always like that?\" \"Pretty much. We just laugh at him when he's not around to hear us. It's okay.\" He shook his head slowly, trying to keep his aching muscles from screaming. \"You shouldn't have to deal with someone like that at work. Besides, he doesn't seem very good at this job. If you like, I'll mention his conduct to the Captain. If Mr. Gates is as unhappy here as he looked just now, maybe it's time he found another employer.\" Tommy and Skip barely had to glance at one another to know that they were having the same thought. \"If you don't mind…\" Tommy ventured. \"If it isn't too big of a hassle, I mean, we know you're a busy man…\" Skip threw in a little too eagerly. Dex tried to smile, and ended up flinching. \"Leave it to me.\" He contemplated his now-cool coffee for a few seconds, trying to decide whether he could stand another sip. Just as he was about to give it a try, a bolt of pain flashed through his head, nearly sending him into the cup face-first. \"Uhmm….\" he moaned slightly. \"Oh, hey, are you okay?\" Tommy came forward. \"Maybe you should see a doctor about that,\" he suggested. \"I mean…there's a lot of blood on you.\" \"You could have a concussion, you know,\" Skip added. \"I just need to go to bed, I think. I'd better head out.\" He stood up, blinked a few times, and then nearly fell back down. \"On second thought, walking might not be such a great idea…\" \"One of us could drive you. We've both got cars.\" \"No, no, there should always be two people on guard. Captain's adamant about that.\" A thought popped into his aching head. Joe. \"You guys have a phone up here, right?\" \"Yeah. You want us to call you an ambulance or something?\" \"Jeez, I didn't think I looked that bad in red,\" Dex attempted to joke. Seeing the looks on the other two men's faces, he grimaced. \"Just call 3257, would you?\" \"3257? I don't think that's on our exchange,\" Skip said doubtfully, looking closely at the phone roster that hung on the wall by the phone. \"Are you sure you've got the right number?\" If he took as bad of a hit as it looks like he did, he could be confused. I don't recognize that number, and I thought I knew all of the lines on base. \"It's a private number, but it's on our system,\" he explained. \"I'll take the phone after you dial. I don't want to cause a panic, if you know what I mean.\" \"Sure. You're the boss.\" Resisting the urge to call an ambulance regardless of what he'd been told, Skip rang in the requested number and then passed the receiver over, stretching the cord out to reach across the room so the injured man wouldn't have to get up. \"Hey, Cap,\" Dex said after a few seconds. \"I'm at the guardhouse. No. Well, kind of. No…Yeah, I did, but it was just a fender bender. A little. No, Cap, I told you, I'm fine. Just sort of banged up.\" He paused. \"Listen, can you come get me? It's pouring outside, and I really don't think I can - What? Yeah, there are people here. I'll stay here. Yes, I promise. All right, all right. Look, there's really no rush-\" He broke off suddenly, a look of exhaustion coming over his face as he pulled the phone away from his ear and stared at it. \"Well, so much for not making him panic. I should have known he'd wait up for me, I told him not to…\" He looked up sharply, knowing that he had just said much more than he should have. The other two men looked no more uncomfortable than they had before, however, and for some reason he couldn't explain that fact soothed his worry. \"Sorry to keep bugging you,\" he found himself apologizing. \"I'll be out of your hair here in a bit.\" \"No need to apologize,\" Skip told him. \"Hell, I owed you one anyway, for fixing my car.\" \"What? Oh, no, hey, anyone would have done that. You can't just drive by someone who's broken down in the middle of the night.\" \"Most people would have,\" Skip countered. \"Homer would have,\" Tommy agreed. \"Well, either way, you don't owe me anything.\" He shut his eyes tightly for a moment. \"You mind if I just put my head down for a minute? Sorry to be a bore, I'm just really tired all of a sudden…\" \"I don't think you're supposed to sleep if you might have a concussion. Heard that somewhere,\" Tommy put forth. \"I won't go to sleep, I'm just going to rest for a minute.\" He lowered his forehead to his arm as if he simply didn't have the strength to hold it up any longer. \"Just, you know, let me know when my ride gets here?\" \"Sure thing,\" Skip conceded, knowing there was nothing they could do if he was determined. The last thing he wanted to do was get him all riled up again like he had been a few minutes before. \"Hey Tommy, let's take a walk, huh?\" Leaving Dex sitting quietly in his chair, they stepped outside and stood, watching, one facing the base and the other facing the approach road.[Chapter 3] \"I could fucking kill Homer for saying what he did,\" Skip growled, raising the collar of his jacket against the rain. \"What a complete bastard that guy is.\" \"He didn't seem tired until that argument they had. Dex, I mean. He was pissed, I really thought Homer was gonna leave in a body bag.\" \"Nobody's business who does what with who. Least of all Homer's. Where's that guy get off, saying stuff like that?\" \"Yeah.\" They were silent for several minutes. \"Be nice to just be the two of us up here nights again.\" \"Yeah. Like it was before they stuck us with Gates.\" Headlights turned onto the far side of the bridge and approached quickly. \"Looks like Dex's ride's here.\" \"You want me to go get him?\" Tommy offered. \"No. I want the Captain to see him like he is right now. Maybe if he does he'll take him to a hospital. Can you believe all of that blood he's got on him? If he'd of come stumbling up without us noticing, I might of took him for a zombie and blown his head off.\" \"Yeah, I guess you're right. The boss should see him that way. I really think he's got a concussion. Guy's a genius, he can't just go around getting knocked in the head and not have a doctor look him over.\" \"I wish I could have found that first aid kit, cleaned him up some. Or at least a blanket, I think he was still shivering when we came out here. This rain's nasty, and who knows how far he walked in it.\" \"You tried, Skip.\" \"Doesn't show to look at him, though, does it?\" Their conversation broke off as the sleek car pulled up beside them. It had barely come to a halt when a figure recognizable to everyone in the literate world leapt from the driver's side. \"Is he inside?\" Sky Captain asked as he came around the car, his crisp accent overriding the patter of the steady downpour on the pavement. \"Yes, sir.\" \"…You left him alone ?\" he lectured as he glanced in the window and spotted the man slumped over the table. Before either of the guards could answer he strode past them and inside. \"We're gonna pay for that,\" Tommy muttered. \"Dex will back us up,\" Skip consoled him. \"Relax. If anyone can talk Sky Captain out of something, I'd bet money on Dex.\" He felt rather than saw Tommy's questioning look. \"Just a feeling I have,\" he shrugged a little sheepishly. \"We'll be fine.\" Joe stepped into the guard house, let his eyes adjust to the indoor light, and strode forward. \"Dex?\" he asked quietly, resting a hand on his shoulder. \"Ow…you mind, Cap? That arm's kind of sore.\" \"Sorry.\" Squatting down in an attempt to see the injured man's hidden face more clearly, he moved his hand onto his engineer's knee, leaving it there when he heard no protest. \"Dex, you're soaking wet. Where's your jacket?\" \"…Think I left it in the car.\" \"How far did you walk in this storm?\" \"I don't know, a mile or two. Not far.\" \"Not far,\" Joe repeated sarcastically as he pulled his own heavy coat off and draped it over the trembling figure in the chair. \"Far enough to catch pneumonia, it looks to me.\" \"I'm fine, Cap, really. Just need to sleep for a while, and I'll be fine.\" Sleep? Sky Captain frowned. Sleep was a far cry from what they'd been planning for when Dex returned from picking up the package he'd been subtly hinting about for weeks. \"That's not exactly what we discussed for tonight,\" he ventured, hoping for an explanation. \"Well, to be honest,\" came the reply after a long silence, \"I kind of thought you might not want to do what we had planned after you saw my new look.\" \"Your what? What new-\" Joe sucked air in quickly between his teeth as Dex raised his head a few inches and turned to look at him. Taking in his crooked nose, the deep bruises under his eyes and across his cheeks, and the rivers of red that had coursed down half of his face, the pilot felt a lump form in his throat. \"Dex, my God, what happened to you?\" \"A deer decided it wanted to be my hood ornament.\" He lowered his head slowly back onto his good arm, his desire to just close his eyes growing as he warmed beneath the other man's jacket. If his hand creeps up just a little bit, I could almost pretend like we're in bed, he thought wearily. Even like this, it'd be so easy to go to sleep… \"Don't close your eyes, love,\" he heard a voice order, low and close to his ear. \"Not until we get you to a doctor.\" \"Tired…\" \"You've got a concussion. There's no way you avoided one, the way your face looks.\" He stood up as he spoke, glancing out at the car to judge how far they had to walk. At his words, Dex felt his eyes fill with tears. So he does think I'm ugly now, he bemoaned quietly. Everything was so perfect, and then that stupid deer had to screw it all up… He choked back a sob, hating the idea that Joe might want to go back to being just friends. We never even got to open the box. It's not fair, damn it. It took a few seconds for Sky Captain to realize what was going on. \"Are you…\" He knelt back down on the floor. \"Why on earth are you crying? Is the pain bad?\" he asked, biting at his lip. I hate seeing you hurt. Please, please stop crying, you're only going to make it worse if your nose gets stuffed up. \"Listen, we'll go back down to the infirmary and get you some morphine before we go into town, all right? Please, tell me what's wrong. It is the pain, isn't it?\" \"I know I look awful, Joe, alright? You don't have to…you know…do this, if you don't want to anymore. I understand. It's okay, I won't leave, you know I couldn't leave you anyway.\" The problem struck him as he listened to the man he adored blubbering. What was I thinking? 'The way your face looks.' You really are a complete ass sometimes, Sullivan, to say such a thing to him when he's like this. \" Dex!\" he exclaimed, glancing outside again to make sure that the guards were still far enough from the windows that they wouldn't hear anything from inside. \"I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking before I spoke. We'll get it fixed, I promise. Don't worry about it. You'll be just fine in a few weeks. Besides,\" he added, levering his lover's swollen, tear- and blood-streaked face up with the utmost care, \"you know full well that I would love you more than anything in the world no matter what you looked like. You're still my Dex. All right?\" His voice shook slightly as he spoke. He's completely addled, he knows full well that I can't live without him. But what if he doesn't believe me? If he carries on like this, I'll never get him out of here without those two suspecting something. Fortunately the explanation cleared the engineer's head enough for him to realize that he was being foolish. \"Yeah,\" he mumbled painfully. \"I know. I'm sorry, I don't know what happened there, I just…God, Joe, I'm so tired…\" \"Shh, you're all right,\" he soothed, standing up again now that the tears had ceased. \"Come on, now, we've got to get you to a hospital. Can you stand?\" \"Sure thing, Cap,\" he sighed, gathering what little energy he had left to shove himself up out of his chair. The motion sent another shock through his skull, forcing him to gasp. He cried out as the rush of air through his broken nose caused a network of nerves to scream in agony. He didn't dare open his eyes afterward, knowing that if he did the room would be turning and he would immediately throw up. And that would really hurt, he informed himself, hoping the threat of further pain would quell his twisting stomach. \"It wasn't like this earlier,\" he whined, practically collapsing into the other man's arms. \"You've warmed up since then,\" Joe told him. \"That's why it's worse now. Can you walk?\" \"…Maybe?\" He sighed. \"All right, come on. We'll get to the car somehow.\" Bearing most of his slender engineer's weight, Sky Captain got them to the door and wrestled with the handle, attempting to get the door open and keep his partner from sliding to the floor simultaneously. Seeing them trying to exit, Tommy rushed up and held the exit open so that the two could stumble into the semi-darkness around the guardhouse. \"Is he okay?\" Skip asked, also coming forward. \"Not really, no,\" the pilot replied. \"Get the car door.\" The guard nodded and splashed to the sedan ahead of them, opening the passenger door as wide as he could. \"Good. Now get inside, the both of you, before you wash away or something.\" \"You sure you don't need-\" \"I've got it, thanks,\" Joe cut him off brusquely as he swept his semi-unconscious load into his arms. Giving him a subtle squeeze, he set him gently inside of the idling auto. As the door to the guardhouse slammed shut in the background, he pressed a soft kiss against damp hair. \"Stay awake, do you hear me?\" \"Sure thing, Cap,\" he heard whispered back groggily. \"Good boy, Dex.\" He shut the door securely and jogged around to his side, only noticing once he'd seated himself that he was soaked through thanks to his lack of a jacket. \"Blasted rain,\" he cursed, putting the heat on full. Seeing the figure beside him flinch as the fans kicked on, he frowned. \"What is it?\" Dex shook his head slightly. \"The heat makes it worse,\" he admitted. \"But it's okay.\" He pulled his left arm close against his stomach and swallowed heavily. \"Let's go, huh?\" \"Maybe we should go back down to the barracks and wait for an ambulance,\" Joe suggested a little nervously as he watched him in the filtered light. \"At least then we could get you some morphine. I know you're in pain, Dex, I can tell. You can't hide it from me.\" \"Never could,\" the engineer smiled slightly. \"Just take me to the hospital,\" he requested, his tight expression returning after a few seconds. \"I'd rather ride with you.\" \"I would come with you in the ambulance. It might be a smoother ride that way.\" \"They won't let you ride in back. They'll make you sit up front. I don't want you to go away right now.\" Sky Captain felt his stomach knot up at that plea for him to stay close. \"If that's what you want, love, then I'll take you. It's going to be a long drive, though, with this rain. I promise, it's going to hurt like hell.\" \"So long as I'm with you, I don't mind.\" \"So stubborn,\" he sighed, reaching over and rubbing his leg. \"Gee, wonder who I could have learned that from…\" Laughing, Joe shifted the car into first and pulled forward through the gate that had been raised in anticipation of their departure. \"I love you. Don't you ever forget that,\" he hissed as darkness closed in around the car. \"Love you too, Cap. Always have, always will.\"[Chapter 4] \"Car coming,\" Tommy said one evening a few weeks later. \"In or out?\" Skip asked, not looking up from where he was carefully drawing a line through Homer's name on the next month's schedule. The older man had returned to work the night following Dex's unexpected visit, but a phone call from Sky Captain himself less than five minutes after his arrival had given Skip the authority to fire the useless Gates, much to both of the remaining night guards' delight. \"Out.\" \"Ten o'clock's kind of late for people to be leaving. Do you recognize the car?\" \"No. I'll check them, it's my turn.\" \"All right.\" Continuing his ministrations to the roster, Skip kept one ear turned towards the door, listening for any trouble. Several minutes after Tommy stepped out, he came back in, followed by a familiar figure. \"Dex! How are you?\" \"Better than the last time I saw you,\" the engineer replied, gently fingering the bandage across his nose that was all save the last vestiges of bruising beneath his eyes and at one temple that showed he'd been in an accident recently. \"You look a lot better,\" Skip admitted. \"Head still hurt?\" Details about the extent of his injuries had been on everyone's lips the day after the wreck, and top among the rumors had been concerns that the nasty concussion he had suffered might have negatively affected his brilliant brain. The guards had waited rather uneasily through the several days that Sky Captain had forbidden Dex to return to work before hearing from the overtly relieved mechanics that, while he was still having awful headaches, the chief engineer's genius seemed to have been heightened rather than dimmed by the collision. \"Nah, nothing to speak of really,\" he shrugged good-naturedly. \"The down time was actually kind of nice. I got a lot of work done, just laying around. But don't tell the Captain that,\" he added with a grin. His smile spread as he recalled the pleasant feeling of having Joe in his bed every night, cuddling and caressing him with a relentless neediness. Sky Captain had retrieved the mystery box from the damaged car before it was towed back to base for repairs, and Dex would never forget the look that had crossed the man's face when he'd opened it and discovered exactly what kind of \"toys\" had been worth hitting a deer for. They hadn't had the opportunity to use any of them yet – Joe refused to do anything more than tease until he was completely healed – but both were greatly looking forward to doing so. \"Someone said your arm was broken,\" Tommy's voice broke through his thoughts. \"I don't see a cast, though.\" \"Yeah, it was just a wrenched shoulder. Still a little sore, but it's not holding me up at work, so you won't hear me complaining about it.\" A honk sounded from the vehicle outside, making them all jump. \"Sorry,\" Dex laughed. \"I guess I'm taking longer than he expected me to. I just came in to drop these off,\" he added, holding out a pair of envelopes that Skip had noticed but not commented on. \"Your paychecks. Sorry they weren't here when your shift started, we had to make a little adjustment down at payroll to reflect your promotions.\" Both guards' heads whipped up from examining the envelopes they'd been handed. \"Our what?\" Skip exclaimed. \"Dex, you didn't have to do that, really.\" \"It wasn't all me,\" the engineer said quickly. \"It was the Captain's decision to name you head of perimeter security. We figured you would need a deputy, and that Tommy'd be just about perfect for the job and was probably who you'd pick anyway, so he went ahead and approved that too.\" \"But…\" Skip stammered, \"head of perimeter security? You mean…for the whole base?\" \"Sure,\" Dex beamed. \"You can do it. We've never had that exact position before, but he said he liked the idea of having someone focused just on the perimeter defense, rather than having you guys report to artillery like you have been. You'll be in charge of the gate guards, the watchtowers, all of that stuff. We've already got feelers out for a couple of new people to train for the night shift, and until we find them you'll still have to pull duty up here, but your raises are retroactive to your last paychecks. You've got an office down in the admin building, too,\" he finished as the horn outside blew again. \"Let me know if you need anything, you know, maps or whatever. Don't look so nervous, guys,\" he tacked on. \"You'll be great, I know it.\" Raising a hand in goodbye, he left the guardhouse and trotted back to the car sitting before the gate. \"Promotions,\" Skip breathed. \"Our own office,\" Tommy added. \"'Head of Perimeter Security,'\" Skip tried out, his eyes dancing. \"Sounds pretty damn good, doesn't it?\" \"I'll say it does. I knew Homer was wrong about that guy.\" \"Yeah, Dex is all right.\" He broke the seal on his envelope as he spoke, and then gaped down at the money inside. \"Tommy.\" \"Yeah?\" \"There's at least double our normal paycheck in here.\" Tommy tore his open quickly. \"Holy shit. I think you're right.\" Skip beamed. \"There's only one way this evening could get any better.\" \"How so?\" \"I wish Homer was here to see this. Can you imagine what he would say?\" The two laughed so hard at the thought of their former co-worker watching them get huge promotions that tears of mirth rolled down their cheeks before they settled and began to talk seriously about their new posts. \"Get your message delivered then, Dex?\" Joe asked as his chief engineer slipped back into the car. \"Yup. I think they'll be perfect for it.\" \"I know you do. That's why I agreed to it.\" He glanced over at the other man and quickly read his bashful smile. \"You did tell them that it was your idea, didn't you?\" \"I told them it was your decision. You had veto power after all, Cap.\" \"Yes, but we both know that I never use it with you. I've never had reason to. Your ideas are always worth carrying out.\" \"They don't need to know that,\" he answered back. \"You're the head of the Legion, you're the boss. Telling them something like that might lessen the power that you represent in their minds. Besides,\" he went on, \"with new responsibilities and higher pay, they won't have as much time to think about anything they may have overheard the other night.\" Although, he thought without saying, I don't think they would say anything even if they flat-out knew about us. He didn't know why he felt as certain of that fact as he did, but it calmed him nonetheless in the same way it had the night of his accident. \"Sometimes I wonder if I really deserve to be in charge,\" Sky Captain pondered, staring at his lover. \"Sometimes I think you'd be much better at it than I am.\" \"Don't be ridiculous,\" Dex replied confidently. \"I don't have the right attitude for it. The head of the Legion has to be a bona fide hero, someone people the world over can swoon thinking about. Someone like you. Besides,\" he went on, his voice dropping into a sensual murmur, \"I like being beneath you.\" Joe gulped at those words. \"Uh…Dex?\" \"Yeah, Cap?\" \"How do you feel?\" \"Pretty good, actually. And I have a bottle of pills in my pocket for if I start feeling less than up to par. Why,\" he practically purred, \"did you have something in mind?\" Let's just skip the movie and get a hotel room, shall we? he wanted to ask. Only the fear that he might hurt his partner if they went too far too soon after his injuries held the question behind his lips. He glanced desperately over, hoping the engineer would say something to break his indecision. Dex could see the war in Sky Captain's eyes as easily as he could see the bulge that had formed in the man's pants. Smile turning lecherous, he caught his gaze and divulged the secret he'd been keeping for the last hour. \"The box is in the trunk.\" Joe stare widened, a soft moan escaping him. \"Good boy, Dex.\" He settled back in his seat and placed his hand where it could be inconspicuously reached from the driver's seat. \"No problem, Cap.\" Warm fingers covered his own. \"You can thank me later.\" \"Oh, I will, Dex. I will.\" Images of what he intended to do to the man beside him that night racing through his head, he sped away from the gate and towards the city. ","Summary":" I don't know how many of you are here from the Sky Captain fandom versus those who had author alert"},{"Movie":"Sky Captain and the World of Tomor...","Title":"Sky Captain Meet Sky Princess","Author":"hydra350","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7291889","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Sky Captain; Meet Sky Princess Hydra_350 Disclaimer: Sky Captain and all affiliations do not belong to me. All I own is Princess. This follows through with movie but it begins with Joe 'Sky Captain' Sullivan in the Manchurian Prison Camp. He meets a girl called Princess. They become friends then they become partners in crime. Lastly Frankie Cook breaks Joe out but what about Princess? Dex/OFC Prelude: Allow me to introduce myself. They call me Princess. Wish I could give you an honest to GOD name, but seeing I was born in the Manchurian Prison Camp I got stuck with the name Princess. Born into captivity like some damn animal! Like an animal they trained me. To do what, you might ask? Well seeing as I was a child a little girl at that; I was trained to steal things from pockets. The guards at the Camp sent me to places all over the country. I always received a picture of the intended target and took what was in their pockets. Now I know what you're thinking; how did I know the Camp Guards weren't using these objects to kill thousands of innocent people? Simple: I didn't, at least I got outside of that crappy rat hole. Although sometimes I would 'accidentally' drop a note about what had happened. I never liked taking orders like some dog so I tried rebelling any way I could. After childhood I had grown into a teenager. The Prison Guards realized that after I lost my innocent looking face they decided to put me to better use. Better meaning personal entertainment, I'll let you use your imagination for that. I can't even think of that without shuddering. Still, I couldn't work out as that! Seems my prior talents for nabbing things got me in trouble a lot. Instead of entertaining the gentlemen I was told to, I stole anything that wasn't tied down. This went on for a long time before I was caught by the guards. They branded me for that. Now I have an impressive tattoo on my right back shoulder. Of course it looks neat and all, but in Manchurian the symbol means 'Shame'. The old guy down the way said I had been in here since he had brought in. His name was Shifty, though the poor guy thought his name was Shifty I'm sure it wasn't. After 25 years in a place like this I think the man has lost whatever passed for a brain. I did the calculations (thanks to the scientist that was held here one time) Shifty had been here for 25 years which would mean I'm either 24, 25, or 26 years of age. I kind of miss that scientist; I can't even remember the man's name. He helped me learn how to read, and do math equations. It wasn't until another year when my life inside this Prison Camp took an interesting turn. Who would have thought that the scruffy man being thrown into the cell next to mine would make such an enormous impact in my future? I remember the man sitting up and straightening his leather jacket on his shoulders back to its original position. I couldn't help myself and asked what his name was. The man looked at me in surprise, probably because I was a female in the prison camp. He answered softly, hell I almost couldn't hear him. \"Captain Joe Sullivan 'Her Majesty's Royal Air Force…\" Then he asked my name and I replied. \"They just call me Princess.\" He looked at me with a kind of quiet sadness and nodded in acceptance.[Chapter 2] After a week had passed with Joe as my neighbor we had talked about how we both ended up in this damnable place. \"My girlfriend Polly Perkins.\" Joe admitted quietly and I had looked over at him oddly. \"Don't quite follow you…\" \"She's a reporter; I think she sabotaged my plane so she could get a picture of the head guy in his bathrobe…\" \"always a relationship killer huh?\" I asked and he gave me a sad smirk. \"What about you princess? How did you get here?\" \"I've always been here.\" I looked away when Joe gave me a perplexed look. \"I was born here.\" I could see Joe's face fall in the corner of my eye. \"I don't even know where I'm from…\" \"You've never noticed that we sound alike?\" Joe asked and I thought about it and nodded. \"That is odd. Where are you from? Maybe I am from there to.\" \"Well Princess you're probably from Britain, or Wales.\" Three months Joe and I had become good acquaintances. I once heard somebody say that friends were a bad thing to have. If you have acquaintances and they die then it hurts less. Poor Joe had been through the wringer a few times. He was gone when I woke up one morning and heard the guards talking to each other. Seems they were asking Joe about whereabouts of some guy named Frankie. I didn't a chance to see him that day because the guards had collected me at noontime. \"Time to prove your worth.\" They had said to me with a sneer. \"You no steal items this time!\" The taller one warned me and escorted me to a hidden room. Seems they still thought that I wouldn't steal objects from the gentleman I was supposed to be 'entertaining.' I received a couple welts to the back for taking the man's pocket-watch. They escorted me back to my hole in the wall. Even five hallways away from my cell I could hear Joe Sullivan raising holy hell. Yeah I think he realized I wasn't in the next cell when they tossed him back in. He also knew what the guards tried to make me do. He hated that thought and became quite verbal anytime they had tried to make me entertain. \"Where the bloody hell is she?\" There came an angry yell from down the hallway. I remember rolling my eyes every time this happened. \"Answer me you low life!\" Joe cried from his cell as another guard walked past him. \"Careful Joe, don't want you to blow a fuel tank.\" My voice always had a certain effect on Joe and he calmed down enough to take in my appearance. I saw him open his mouth and cut him off. \"Yes I'm fine. No I didn't entertain them. And yes you can have the pocket watch.\" I replied I tossed the stolen watch to Joe. \"So how was your day?\" I asked and Joe's face closed down and he became quiet. \"That good huh?\" \"They threatened to cut off my fingers.\" Joe admitted sullenly. It was another three months before something odd happened again. Some explosion on the surface caused dirt and grime to rain down on all of us making us even filthier. I noticed a voice drifting through the now crumbling debris. It sounded like me and Joe, which I mean similar sounding accents only this was crisper. I managed to see a tall figure through the dust crouching beside Joe and heard the figure talking quietly to him. \"Hello Joseph long-time no see.\" The voice greeted and Joe coughed in response. \"Hello Francesca, use a little too much sulfur again?\" \"Oh you know me…\" The figure helped Joe stand up. I got worried that Joe was leaving and I would alone yet again. That guy that said acquaintances hurt less was full of malarkey! Losing anybody hurts! \"We have to move Joseph the guards will only be distracted for so long before they get wise to the diversion.\" \"Wait I can't leave Princess here.\" \"Aw Joe you got yourself a boyfriend?\" \"What? NO!\" Joe grimaced at the taller figure. \"I'm not leaving without her Frankie!\" My eyes widened oh! Frankie was short for Francesca! Glad I found that out before I got myself hurt. \"Her? Oh Joseph we need to break you of your passion for strays.\" \"Frankie she kept me sane these last 6 months.\" \"Oh all right let's be off.\" Frankie used an odd looking gun to slice open the bars of my cell and helped me up. I finally got a good look at the woman that saved my life. Yes she was tall; probably 6'1 she had tied back black hair. One of her eyes being covered by a patch made her seem all the more intimidating.[Chapter 3] Free I was finally free! The three of us were escorted by armored vehicles and showed where we could wash up. Joe must have seen my apprehension at the tub filled with water. I heard him ask Frankie to help me. Well that's not embarrassing at all! Frankie agreed and Joe left the two of us in the wash room. Frankie tried to comb out my hair to no avail. \"Good lord when was the last time you bathed!\" I know she didn't mean to sound like a parent to a child but I figured she didn't really have much tact in gentleness. \"Counting this time?\" I saw her nod. \"This time.\" I admitted and Frankie frowned in realization. Frankie helped me figure out how to get into the tub without killing myself. She stared at my shoulder and got my hair wet. As she cleaned up my hair for me she asked me questions. \"Interesting brand you have.\" \"Yeah.\" I admitted quietly knowing she was talking about the Manchurian symbol they had burned onto me. \"What does it mean?\" She asked another question as she rinsed out my hair. \"Shame.\" \"Why is it on your shoulder?\" \"I was supposed to entertain the men the guards brought in. Instead I stole things from the gentlemen and the guards said I had shamed them. So that is what they branded me with.\" \"That's what it means in Manchurian. It doesn't mean shame to Englishmen. When you look at what the symbol means in English it translates into Sky.\" \"So I'm Sky Princess?\" \"What did you do to get put in that place?\" Frankie asked as she cleaned off my face and shoulders. \"I was born.\" I admitted drolly with an indifferent shrug. \"Who were your parents?\" Frankie asked again as she rinsed the final amount of grime from my body. \"I don't know. I don't even know where I'm from.\" \"But you have a blood type. And that could help an acquaintance of mine to assist you.\" \"Who?\" I asked curiously. \"He's around your age mid-20's. He invented a hand-held machine that can decipher genetic codes. If anybody can find out where your family is, then it's Dexter Dearborn.\" Frankie explained to me and then helped me into a pair of pants and a blouse. I didn't recognize the person I was looking at. \"Is that me?\" I asked so innocently that Frankie frowned sadly. The two of us heard a knock on the door and heard Joe call through. \"You two done yet?\" Came the voice and the door opened a second later. I looked at Joe; well he certainly cleaned up nicely. I started to feel self-conscious because he was just staring at me quietly. \"Princess? Is that you?\" He asked with a smirk. He approached me and Frankie and moved around me. \"Well you certainly clean up nice.\" He admitted and I smirked wryly at him. \"I was thinking the same thing about you.\" Joe was still staring at me and Frankie clipped him in the back of the head. \"Joseph.\" She warned him and he smirked sheepishly and backed away from me. \"I had the idea that Dexter can use his molecule detector device and help Princess find her family.\" \"Frankie that's a brilliant idea!\" Before I knew what happened Joe had grabbed my arm and had me running behind him until we were in a hangar with a bunch of engineers running about working. \"Hey CAP!\" A pleased voice hollered over as a bright light came out of a small pen. \"Glad you're back!\" \"Likewise Dex.\" Joe admitted quietly to his friend and then Dex saw me beyond Joe. \"New friend Cap?\" The guy took off some weird looking goggles and looked at me better. \"Something like that Dex.\" \"Any friend of Cap'n is a friend of mine!\" The guy popped a piece of gum into his mouth and started to chew it. \"Dexter Dearborn just call me Dex.\" He didn't look like he wanted to shake my hand. But Joe elbowed him and he raised his hand in greeting. I shook his hand with an odd look to Joe who smirked wolfishly at me. \"My name is Princess.\" I answered I hated getting those odd looks of confusion when I met new people. \"That's the only thing they called me in the prison…\" \"Dex, Princess was born in the prison. She doesn't know who her family is. Frankie gave us the idea that you could use you detector device.\" \"Well let's see what we can do…\" Dex muttered and took me by the elbow and led me to a large desk that was completely cluttered with paper. He grabbed one my fingers and pricked my finger. I must have flinched because he gave me an apologetic grimace. \"Probably should've warned ya about that…\" \"That is all right, but why did you feel the need to stab me?\" I heard Joe snicker and I glared at him. \"All I did was collect some of your blood. It will show me your genetic strand shortly. See?\" Dex held up the small device for me to see. I watched as a few lines dancing across the screen. Dex looked back at the device and frowned. \"Huh.\" He muttered to himself. \"It says your fraternal strand comes from Jonathon Masterson. But his information doesn't list any children.\" Dex looked at more information. \"His wife Winifred and he live in Liverpool England.\" \"I have a family?\" I asked hopefully and Dex just nodded with a shrug. I couldn't stop myself and hugged him. I heard Joe snickering again and I noticed that Dex was uncomfortable with this display. I let him go apologized then hugged Joe. \"I have a family!\" I repeated happily to Joe who laughed and grabbed my shoulder in a brotherly gesture. \"So I heard.\" He grinned at me.[Chapter 4] I looked out of the window of the flying vessel we were currently on. Frankie, Dex and Joe were going with me to meet my parents for the first time. The others could tell I was a bundle of nerves. This was a very big thing for me. I've never met them before. They were let go after I was born so I don't even know what they look like. I stood up too nervous to sit in one place. I walked around and noticed Dex standing near another workbench. I approached him and noticed Joe and Frankie talking off to the side. I looked over Dex's shoulder to look at what he was working on. He turned his head and jumped in surprise at seeing me right there. \"Sorry.\" I muttered and walked around the small table. \"Sorry for what…? It's not like I'm working here…\" Dex grumbled and went back to work. I looked over and saw Joe nudging Frankie in her side prompting her to watch the two of us converse. \"Is there a reason why you're so dang quiet when ya walk?\" Dex asked not looking up from his work. \"I used to do lifting work for the prison guards when I was a child.\" \"Lifting?\" Dex finally looked at her with a raised eyebrow. \"I snatched things from people's pockets. The guards used my cute innocent features to their advantage.\" I saw out of the corner of my eye that Joe and Frankie were enjoying this talk between Dex and me. \"So…\" I started slowly trying to get into another discussion topic. \"Frankie told me you designed this flying vessel?\" Dex looked up at me again and smirked sheepishly. \"She told you correctly.\" \"It's a nice piece of work. How did you come up with the idea?\" I asked as I looked down at a picture of an underwater ship. \"Oh I get the ideas from my comic books…\" Dex admitted failing to see my confused look. \"I'm sorry a what?\" \"Here we go…\" Dex sighed miserably. \"Listen just because I get my ideas from a comic book…everybody always teases me…\" \"No!\" I interrupted him causing him to stare at me in mid-rant. \"I meant what is a comic-book?\" I must have said something horrible because Dex's eyes widened in horror. \"You don't even know what a…? They're only the greatest things to come out of the printing press!\" Dex argued his point but noticed I still had a confused expression. \"I mean Shazam! I've never met nobody that never even heard of them!\" \"Shazam?\" I asked even more confused and I frowned at Joe who snorted with laughter. I noticed that even Frankie had her smirk hidden behind her hand. \"Oh you two shush!\" The closer we got to Liverpool the more scared I got. I started to come up with every worst case scenario that I could come up with. Joe approached me when we were about to land. \"Now I hate to do this to you Princess. I have to debrief with my commanding officer over in the next town. Frankie is going to go with you, but I will see you later okay?\" He asked worriedly and frowned seeing my panicked expression. \"I'm not lying here Joe, I'm getting scared…\" I admitted out loud finally. \"I mean what if they don't remember? What if they hate me?\" Joe patted my shoulder awkwardly and told me it would be okay. Then he had left me there to go debrief with his officer. Frankie approached me after we landed and led me to the car. One of her underlings drove us to a small farm in the middle of nowhere. I got out and noticed a tall man working the ground with a machine. I approached the man quietly and when he looked up at me his face was confused. I noticed that I had similar features like his. \"Who are you?\" He asked me curiously and I moved closer. Frankie had opted to wait for me at the car. \"Father…?\" I asked warily hoping he was who I was looking for. As soon as the word left my mouth I knew something bad was going to happen. The man's face paled then started to go red with fury. \"You?\" He spat angrily at me not caring that I had a confused, mortified expression. I then was on the ground when he struck me in the face. \"You have a lot of nerve showing your face around here!\" 'Jonathon dinner is going to be ready soon!' A lady called from the porch of the house. I stood up still confused but I did notice that Frankie had moved closer. \"You are my father right? From the Manchurian Prison?\" I asked worriedly and the man scowled angrily again. \"Was that lady my mother?\" I asked trying to make sense of things. \"No that is not your mother!\" The man offered venomously. \"Your mother died not long after we were let go. Evidently the pregnancy took a toll on her health! The guards agreed to let us go if we gave them you!\" \"My mother's gone?\" I asked feeling the air leave my lungs. \"Oh please it was your fault we were caught! Pregnant women cannot run very fast when secret police are chasing them!\" \"You gave me to the prison?\" I asked feeling sick to my stomach. \"We struck a deal with the prison. Our freedom for your life. I figured they would just kill you or something! Never did I even think they'd let you live this long!\" \"But I searched for you two for so long…\" \"Do you really think I would want you? Not after it was your fault we got caught. Definitely not after you managed to kill my wife! If you ever set foot on this property I swear I will kill you!\" I felt an empty void tearing apart my heart. I really do have nobody, no family whatsoever! Jonathon must have seen my trepidation over being turned away from his life. I turned slowly and started away but not fast enough for him and I felt a harsh shove to my back. I stumbled forward with a startled cry and landed hard onto the dirt road. \"I SAID GET OUT HERE!\" He yelled enraged and was about to kick me while I was down in the dirt. \"I do believe you have made your point clear.\" I looked up Frankie who was standing beside me glaring with one eye at Jonathon. Frankie helped me up off of the ground and dusted me off. \"It is a shame this occurred. Princess here works for Her Majesty's Royal Air Force 'special operations' division.\" Jonathon looked at her and then me and paled. I was startled as well, I didn't think Frankie would ever lie about somebody working for them. \"She had come by a lot of monetary shipments and was allowed to keep them. She professed she wanted to find her parents and share in the wealth. But, since you disclaim her as your daughter…\" Frankie gave Jonathon a snide sneer before turning around and calling back to me. \"Come along Lieutenant.\" \"Uhm. Yes sir?\" I answered unsure of what just happened. \"Wait!\" Jonathon hollered after us and ran up to us. \"You know I didn't mean what I said right?\" He transformed before our very eyes. Now he wanted to have a father/daughter relationship? \"Oh so sorry. But it is I'm afraid too little too late.\" Frankie opened the car door and hurriedly shoved me in and looked back at the man who was now just standing there like an imbecile. \"I guess now you can spend the remainder of your life thinking about the large sum of money that you could've had, but will not.\" Frankie walked around the car and opened the other door. \"Good day sir.\" She got in and we drove away.[Chapter 5] Frankie looked over at me I know she looked at me. I was staring out of the window trying to stay unaffected by what just happened. \"Are you okay Princess?\" \"Do I look okay?\" I snapped back and sighed wiping a rampant tear from my eye. \"And why did you lie about me working for you?\" I took in another shaky breath and released it. \"Aren't you going to get into trouble for that?\" \"What I did Princess was make him regret hurting you. He will think about turning you away when he could've had a large sum of money. Sooner or later that information of what could've been will drive him mad.\" The ride was quiet the rest of the way back to the base. The man that drove us got out and opened my door with an apologetic frown. I walked through the hangar from before and sighed miserably. I saw Dex working on more blueprints. I tried to move quietly past him but he looked up and caught my movement. \"So how'd the reunion go?\" He asked chewing on some more bubblegum. \"As I had expected…\" I answered bitterly and hurried out of the hangar. I then sat on a scaffolding beam and watched everyone mill around the base. I obviously wasn't far enough away to not hear Dex talking to Frankie. 'So how did it go Frankie?' 'It didn't go well at all.' 'Why what happened?' That one didn't sound like Dex. Figures Joe Sullivan would show up at the wrong time! I held my breath waiting to hear Frankie tell the two of them what happened. Thankfully she had talked quietly which meant if I couldn't hear then nobody else could either. I'm sure everyone heard Joe's voice shouting though. \"HE WHAT?\" 'Good work Joseph yell a little louder next time. The other side of the hangar didn't hear you.' I actually felt a smirk dart across my face. At least Frankie managed to have some tact while talking. 'He hit her?' Dex's voice sounded distraught so I looked down the hangar aisle and saw his confused expression. He was also scratching the back of his head. 'He hit her, shoved her into the ground and was about to kick her but I managed to stop that at least.' Frankie's facial expression lacked emotion of any kind, but I figured she was just always like that. 'You tell me where this prat lives!' I saw Joe's facial expression and was worried at the vein throbbing on his neck. I had heard enough and made a decision. There was no point in living somewhere I didn't belong. I had no family, no-where to live, and basically the three people that I associate with the most would be considered mentally unstable on a good day. It was time for me to go back to the only home I ever knew. I realized after I had gotten down from the scaffolding that I had no way to get where I needed to go. I saw one lone plane that was just sitting there. I noticed the number on the side of plane read h1109. Well that was an odd thing to call a plane but I shrugged and looked in the cockpit. \"What're ya doing?\" The voice behind me startled me into slipping off of the ladder. I heard an oomph as I was caught. Whoever had caught wasn't used to saving girls from falling and had the wind knocked out of them. \"Careful there Princess.\" I looked back to see Dex Dearborn holding me up awkwardly. \"Thanks.\" I managed to stammer out through my embarrassment. \"So what're you doing?\" He asked again looking past me to the cockpit of the plane. \"I'm going home…\" I muttered quietly and he gave me a concerned look. \"Thought Cap'n said ya didn't have a home?\" Dex questioned with an odd expression. \"I'm going back to the Manchurian Prison, okay!\" I snapped at him and his confused face became horrified. \"Why in God's name would ya do that?\" He shouted in disbelief. \"There's nothing here for me. I have no place to live, no family to speak of. I'm just going to cut my losses and call it a life.\" I ended the conversation and tried to open the cockpit again. I turned around in time to see Dex talking to another engineer and sent the guy running for the hangar. \"Come on Princess, please just wait so Cap'n can talk to ya!\" Dex pled turning his blue eyes onto me with a poor whipped dog look. \"I got to admit Dex that look is slowing me down…\" I stated simply and he gave me a shy expression. \"Is it working?\" He asked nervously and I quirked my head at him and smirked sadly. \"no.\" That two letter word deflated the guy and his face fell. \"Oy! Princess! Where do you think you're going?\" Joe Sullivan stormed over with a look of determination. \"For a spin.\" \"She's going back to the Prison Cap.\" Dex admitted and I gaped at him. \"Seriously?\" I snapped at him in disbelief. \"I'm afraid I can't let you do that Princess.\" Joe admitted and climbed up the ladder and hopped into the cockpit before I had the chance to. \"And why the hell not?\" I snapped angrily but my facial expression went confused when Joe just smirked at me wryly. \"Cause I'm not going to let you just steal my plane…\" I quirked my head in exasperation. \"Out of all the planes on this base I happened to try to steal yours?\" I shook my head at my horrible luck. \"And who the hell names their plane h1109?\" I yelled and Joe cleared his throat and looked away embarrassedly. Dex smirked at me though and explained it further. \"You're not reading it backwards like in a mirror.\" I looked over at Joe who still wasn't looking at me and I turned my head and read the name of the plane in the reflection of a nearby building. I saw that h1109 translated into 'Polly'. Wait wasn't that Joe's girlfriend's name? The one that he believed sabotaged his…? I smirked vapidly at Joe who still looked uncomfortable. \"Oh that's RICH!\" I snickered lightly. \"Oh shut up!\" Joe snapped out with a slight pink tinge to his cheeks.

Ok, I know I said, I won't write any Jumanji till the next movie but when your dream throw this kind of stuff in your mind you have to do something with it :). So here we are... I hope you'll enjoy ! Bad day, crazy night From, smashing her little toe on furniture few minutes after waking up, to forgetting half of her homework home so she's been full charged with extra homeworks from her teachers for the next week, Bethany was having one of those days where nothing seems to works, where all the planets are aligned to make you having a bad time, whatever you try. So, by the end of the day, she had accepted her fate and waited for the day to pass. Even walking home, mother Earth seemed to have something against her. Half way, it started to rain as heavily that it was sudden. - \"Seriously!\" she exclaimed as a car watered her, passing full speed on a large pool next to her. She arrived home drenched. - \"Honey, what the hell did you do?\" asked her mother when she saw her. - \"I woke up this morning.\" replied the blond girl with a tired smirk. \"I'm going to bed.\" - \"You're don't want to eat something first?\" - \"I won't take the risk. With the day I had today, I could accidentally stab myself to death with a little spoon.\" - \"But it's a bit early to go to bed.\" - \"I know…\" But she did anyway. After a hot steaming shower, she slipped on the large T-shirt she was usually using for the night and put herself in her bed. Strangely, she felt really tired and fell asleep almost as soon as she hit the pillow. ### She woke up to the sound of her phone vibrating on her bed table. She blindly stretched her arm and search for the device. She cracked open one sleepy eye to see who was calling her. It was Martha. When she spotted the hour she let out a soft annoyed : - \"2am, seriously?\". The sound of her own voice made her instantly regaining full consciousness. \"Please, don't... don't...\" she chanted as soft as she could. Using the light from her phone was emitting, she raised up the quilt to discover exactly what she was afraid of. Oberon's body was fully occupying her night shirt. - \"Oh my god!\" she whispered, hiding once more under the quilt. She answered the phone. - \"Bethany, I'm sorry to phone that late but I have a big problem.\" said her friend low voice. - \"Not big as mine.\" she replied. Martha kept silent a few second. - \"You too?\" she finally said. - \"Well, it seems so.\" - \"What do we do? We can't go to school like that.\" - \"Well, school is not my first concern, right now. My largest T-shirt hardly covers my whole body...\" she countered. \"I can't go out at all... I'm trapped in my room.\" - \"Wait a minute, I've got an idea. I'll call you back.\" - \"Martha... I...\" It was too late, her friend already had hung up the phone. Bethany grumbled a little bit. She rolled herself up into the quilt and got up. She carefully opened her bedroom door and listened. Fortunately, everyone seemed asleep. Using her phone to light the way, she ventured out in the corridor and tiptoed to the utility room. In the pile of clothes to iron, she searched for her father's clothes. He was taller and slimmer but with luck she could find something she could dress with. Alas, there was not much in the basket and nothing she found fitted, except for a pair of socks she put in. Reluctantly, she decided to return in her room. But, the moment she was going to leave, her phone vibrated, making her jump in surprise. She hid back and answered. - \"What?\" she asked a bit dryly. - \"We have all changed to our avatar from Jumanji.\" came the muffled reply from Martha. \"Fridge is going to Spencer with large clothes, I asked him to take some more for you. We'll call you when we'll be here.\" - \"Ok, thanks.\" Bethany said calmer. \"And how is it for you?\" - \"Well, Ruby is taller than me but she is thin. My clothes are a bit short but I can dress.\" - \"Do you have any idea of what happened?\" - \"Nope… I just woke up like this.\" Suddenly, Bethany heard some noise coming from the hall. \"Sorry girlfriend, I gotta go. I think my mom woke up.\" She hung up quickly and listened carefully. The steps were coming in her direction. She had nowhere to hide and couldn't escape so, anxious, she waited in the middle of the room. When her mother entered and switched on the light, she tried her best smile, but that didn't work quite well as the blond woman screamed her lungs out. - \"Mum! It's me Bethany! I don't...\" she exclaim trying to reach her mother witch made her scream louder - if that could be - and literally run away, closing the door on her face. \"What is it with everyone tonight?!\" Bethany carefully opened the door as, once again, nothing was to be heard. - \"Mum? Dad?\" she asked. She was expecting more agitation after her encounter with her mother but the house was silent again. She went straight to her parents room and called them softly again through the door. She waited a few seconds for an answer. Nothing. - \"Mum? Dad? Are you there?\" she asked louder. \"Well, I guess it's a bad idea but what could be worse?\" she told herself before opening the door. The room was empty. \"What?! Mum! Dad!\" She searched the house and found out at she was all alone. The strangest thing was that nothing seemed wrong except her parents were not there. The front door was even locked from the inside. - \"What the…\" her phone rang. \"What?\" she said a bit aggressively to Martha. - \"Wow! Would you calm down, please?\" - \"Sorry... I'm on the verge of freaking out, right now. My parents have disappeared and...\" - \"There are more urgent thing to assess right now. How long can you survive in your house?\" - \"Excuse me?!\" shouted Bethany - \"I thought we could arrive sooner at your house, but after we joined Spencer, we got lost. I don't know how but it could take a few days for us to join you.\" - \"Are you kidding me?\" the conversation was surreal. \"This is Brantford. I'm twenty minutes from your house at most.\" - \"Look outside.\" Bethany sighted but obeyed. She regained her room, then she lifted the curtain and picked a look. - \"Well, what should I see?\" - \"You don't see anything strange?\" - \"No. Everything is fine.\" - \"Ok so it means you're safe for the moment. I have to hung up now to spare the battery. See you soon.\" On that, Martha did indeed hung up the phone. - \"Well, this time she warned me...\" said Bethany a bit taken aback by the conversation. As she was replacing the curtain back, she saw - or thought she saw - a tall men in the dark in the lane, but it was just a shadow. She was maybe a bit nervous and beginning of imagining things. Then she sat on the corner of her bed, still wrapped in her quilt, and she waited. - \"My parents have gone. My friends are crazy. I'm maybe stuck in male body for good. If today was already a nightmare, tonight is turning to hell.\" She lowered her head in defeat and looked at her feet. \" On the bright side, I have found a pair of socks.\" She shrugged. She knew she should do something but for the moment she was just afraid that things would getting worse if she tried anything. Though, troubles found her anyway. She jumped and let out a cry of surprise as she heard something smashing against her window. She got up and looked through it. Her three friends were there in the lane, in the most ridiculous outfits. Martha seemed to wear clothes skrinked by a too hot bath. Spencer was wearing Fridge's football equipment and Fridge himself was floating in too large clothes and had a backpack which seemed also too big for him. She opened the window. - \"Why didn't you use the phone, like civilised people?\" she reproached. \"You could have broken the glass. And, what happened to the days you would get lost in Brantford trying to reach me?\" - \"Get down!\" required Spencer ignoring her. Bethany was growing more and more annoyed by the general attitude of everyone but she obeyed. She got down the stair and tried the front door. The key was turning but it was still locked. - \"Hey guys! I can't unlock the door!\" she screamed to them through the door. - \"Try the window.\" came Fridge's reply. She entered the living room, but there were just walls. In panics, she tried the other rooms of the first floor. All the windows were missing. She ran up to her room and found with relief that hers was still there. - \"There is no exit!\" she screamed in alarm. - \"You're in front of one. Get down!\" replied Spencer still ignoring her distress. - \"Are you kidding me?! Even in my own body I wouldn't jump from there!\" - \"This makes a little slide. I'm sure you can do it.\" said Martha pointing out the small part of roof under her window. Bethany looked at her friends with big eyes. \"Come on, we don't have time! You have to get out, now!\" - \"Well why don't you jump and join me up there? You're much welcome in my crazy house.\" None of them replied. They just blankly stared at her. Suddenly, she heard a deep baritone voice behind her. She turned round and saw the large figure of the foreboding presence of Van Pelt. - \"No way!\" She pushed herself up and passed the threshold of the window. She felt the man grabbing her quilt. She pulled harder but she was caught in the momentum when Van Pelt let her go. She flipped head over heels out of the window and rolled freely on the small piece of roof. She screamed her lungs out when she fell from the first floor. Strangely, the impact was not as painful as she had imagined it would be but she was still a bit shakened. - \"Are you ok?\" asked Martha helping her on her feet. - \"Miraculously alive.\" she replied. - \"Oh please!\" exclaimed Fridge turning his head in disgust. - \"What now?\" Bethany asked now deeply annoyed by the lack of consideration her friend had for her. Then she realised that the quilt wasn't covering her whole body. \"Give me some pants, so I can spare your innocent eyes.\" Without looking at her, he searched in his backpack and dropped a pair of jeans next to her. Bethany put them on quickly. - \"Why on Earth do you sleep without underwears?\" asked Martha while she was dressing. - \"Don't you? It has to breathe, girlfriend.\" the red haired girl sent her an outraged look. \"Well, and excuse me but right now, I'm pretty happy that I don't, so that dear Shelly is not in my panties.\" she replied rolling up the bottom of Fridge pants to adjust the size to her shorter legs. \"Do you have any tops I could fit in more comfortably?\" she asked pointing at her night t-shirt stretched on her body. - \"I'm gorgeous.\" read Martha out loud. \"Really? Even when you go to bed?\" - \"That's positive reinforcement thoughts. That's good for your ego.\" - \"Girls, we have no time for that. Van Pelt!\" interrupted Spencer. The tall man was uncannyly still, standing in the street, a few feet from them. - \"How did he…\" - \"Run!\" screamed Spencer. - \"Wait, I have no shoes!\" exclaimed Bethany, joining the course nonetheless. They ran for a few minutes ignoring the way. They were just escaping Van Pelt who seemed to miraculously cross their way all the time. - \"I have questions.\" said Bethany out of breath when they finally stopped. \"First, why do we run when obviously the bad guy can teleport?\" - \"She has a point here.\" notted Fridge, leaning against a wall. - \"Then, how did you manage to come that fast to my place after telling me it would take days?\" - \"We did take days, even weeks. How did you manage to survive that long, by the way?\" Bethany was first taken aback but then she began to understand what was hapenning. The increasing nonsense was begining to make sense, so she tried an absurd approach. \"I almost starved for those two long minutes but I'm resourceful. I ate the couch, it's made of leather.\" she replied waiting for a reaction. There was none, as she expected. \"I am dreaming?\" she asked then. - \"Smart girl.\" said a baritone voice on her back. She turned round. Van Pelt was just behind her \"They still have not figured it out. They think they are playing once again.\" - \"They are not real, aren't they?\" -\"Well. It depends on your definition of real. Are dreams real or is it just this one?\" Van Pelt smirked. - \"Either way you don't seem to control my reality very well, mister bad guy! So, Freddy Krueger, you better get out of our heads or I'll make you regret that you ever thought about getting here in the first place. Don't mess up with a girl that had a bad day.\" Van Pelt was about to laugh at her but then everything went nut. ### The next day, Bethany met Martha on her way to school. Her friend was visibly tired. - \"Hi there. Are you ok?\" - \"Oh hi, Bethany. Well, I had an awfull night.\" - \"Really?\" asked the blonde girl with an innocent grin. - \"I was trapped in Jumanji with you guys. We were back in our avatars and we fought in the jungle for weeks as it seemed. And then, I don't know how nor why, I was suddenly throwing fireballs with my hair. Fridge was bouncing around with his elastic limbs. Spencer was made of rock and wearing Fridge's football suit.\" - \"And me?\" - \"You were generating force fields and doing some crazy stuff I wish I didn't remember 'cause you were in Oberon's body.\" - \"You know, you can only totally disappear if you're naked.\" Martha grimaced but didn't notice that Bethany just pointed a detail she didn't mention before. - \"You were calling us the Fantastic Four of Odd Fashion.\" she continued. \"After that, it made even less sense. I can't even tell you. That dream just exhausted me.\" - \"Well, at least we defeat him, right?\" - \"Yes, I guess… Wait, what?\" exclaimed Martha, suddenly getting the implication. \"That's impossible!\" - \"As much as being stuck in a video game.\" Bethany laughed. The end Yes, I actually dream that stupid stuff hahaha! Well, to be fair, I dreamt until the \"Fantastic 4\". I made up what happened 'cause I woke up just after Bethany said \"We're the Fantastic Four of Odd Fashion\" ^^. I didn't see what they did, or their powers. Have a nice day!

Almost like at part of him never returned together with him. The first few days he spent hours inside the bathroom, looking at his own body. Noticing every small detail of his own face in the mirror. It had been a while since he had last seen his own expression. In the beginning he assumed what he had missed was the handsome face his character had when he was known as Seaplane McDonough. Or maybe how daring he had been. After having spent some time alone inside Jumanji he had after all both tried to fly a plane and fought against different attackers. Both animals and human lookalikes. Having been returned to his own time, in his own weak body might make him feel a little lost. Nonetheless his heart told him that his assumption was wrong. The hole he felt inside had nothing to do with his body or lost skills. Days went by and the feeling of missing something would not leave him. After a short while he just concluded it was another aspect from the dreadful experience he had to carry with him for the rest of his life. Similar to the nightmares he had about crashing a helicopter. When his playmates gave him the responsibility for flying the helicopter on behalf of all of them inside Jumanji he had became terrified. In the past he had died inside the game in similar settings, and suddenly they wanted him to become responsible for all five of them. If he had crashed then he might be the reasons as to why none of them would ever been given the opportunity to return to their own lives. For them to miss the opportunity to live a long health life, out in the real world. For weeks after his return Alex woke up screaming in horror with the feeling of his body falling. His voice yelling out \"mayday mayday\". Fortunate for himself his parents bedroom was on the other side of the house. Luckily, as certain he had lost something inside the game, he also knew without a doubt that the four teenagers had, like him, returned to their own time after finishing the game. They might be placed twenty years in the future compared to him, but nonetheless he still knew everything had ended well for them. With this knowledge his nightmares mostly disappeared. Only returning in one of his weakest moments in life. Although the feeling of lacking something vital, Alex had gained something from the participation and living inside Jumanji as well. In the real world he still held on to the knowledge about how to fly a plane, or even a helicopter. Not that anyone would let a teen try out those things, especially if there was no evidence he had ever taken relevant courses before. Despite all of those lacking elements he knew with an certainty in his soul that if ever given the chance, he would excel. And after a stressful day he now could make a mean margarita. oOoOo Having spent a few years struggling a little fitting in the real world again, Alex had a mentally breakdown. It is what might happen to someone who had gone through similar experiences so he tried not take it to hard. He had never told anyone about his time in Jumanji, after all, who would believe him? Year upon years, carrying the burden of his knowledge by himself. It would break even the strongest person after a while. All his thoughts, knowledge, ideas, and with the certain feeling he had left something behind, did not make life easier for him. Alex had nightmares, missed the other participants and sometimes felt like he did not fit in with his family or his friends. He had in a way been to war but lacked the evidence. oOoOo As he returned from Jumanji he came out as a new man. Being completely honest with himself he was a little stranger than the boy which went in the game. In the first few years he talked to himself daily. Luckily he managed to mostly contain his own comments and opinions to when he was alone. In order to lessen the burden a little he opted in the end to contact a shrink. One of the first things his female doctor told him was to start writing an journal. By doing so Alex managed to say what he wanted to say without feeling the need to express himself out loud. Surprisingly it helped. He even felt less lonely. In spite of the knowledge his psychologist thought everything was connected to a dreamworld he had made up inside his own head, if felt good talking to someone about his hard times. Almost refreshing. The almost bare, white office, with just a few black chairs and a simple oak desk, made him feel more comfortable in his own skin that he had in years. It felt nice just to let everything go. No longer needing to hide his experience or who he had become. A small haven. Months went by and he spent hours inside that small office, talking about a world completely different that the one he was now living in. Discussing the behaviour and personalities of those he met while playing, laughing as he told the doctor about how Martha had tried to flirt with the bad guys and the strange friendship between Fridge and Spencer. They talked about his gaming friends, despite knowing it would be years before he could see them in real life. He had just spent a few days together with them, but for Alex they could be considered his real true friends. All four of them. Someone he would treasure until the day he died. An hour or two a month inside the shrink's office was enough for Alex to face every day as if he had no real problems in life. Hiding as he was waiting. Every time he left the office, it was still with the confidence that Jumanji was not made up fiction. He had lived it. Survived it, in spite of losing to many of his own life because of the generosity of Bethany. oOoOo His fear of mosquitoes every summer made him contemplate moving to Antarctica or something, but his heart told him to stay put. Like he was waiting for something, or someone. Who cared about what the professional said about the subject? For Alex the appointments was more of an way for him to still hold his memories alive. He went to the doctor in order to have someone to discuss and analyse his time inside the game. Someone who legally could not tell his secret to the world. Someone he could exchange money to in order for them to have an relationship of trust between the two of them. Beside his psychologist had probably heard way stranger things from other clients over the years. He just wish the doctor would help him find out what he was missing. What he was physically yearning for. Instead of finding out what was the real problem, the psychologist diagnosed him as a mild depressive man with PTSD. When Alex questioned the last diagnoses, especially considering the shrink just categorized his experience as a realistic dream. The doctor just replied that the brain worked in mysterious ways. Nonetheless Alex did not argue loudly against the diagnoses. In his opinion there might be some truth to it. The PTSD was ofcourse connecting to the horrors of the game. He had after all been thrown from his everyday life into an situation completely different from what he had ever experienced before. The closest he had ever gotten the jungle in the past had been on a camping trip over two days with his father. Those two situations could not even be compared. In jumanji he lived in the jungle by himself. Having to learn how to survive, gather food, find a place to stay, and hide from those wishing to kill him. Both humans and animals. Even small bugs. Everyday his main focus had been to work hard in order to find a way to return home again. He had even died there. More than once. Who knew what would had happened to him if Bethany had not saved him by sharing one of her lives with him. What would happen if she had not tried CPR? He might have never returned, maybe even died inside the game so that none of the other four players could return to the real world as well. Making the four of them wait, maybe for years, until the game managed to lure someone else to play. Like he had. Alex felt a shiver run down his spine everytime the considered the dreaded idea. The depression diagnosis he got from his shrink was the one he felt might be a little off. There was something missing, and he knew the second he figured out what it was he might be freed from his sometimes heavy emotions. He did not wish to take anti depression medication. He was not depressed, just lacking a part of himself. oOoOo Years went by and slowly he became a man. Getting a degree from college, going to work everyday, making money, and spending time with his dad. His mom had died before he became thirty. Leaving the two of them. It was hard but they both managed to face a new day, and then another one. After a while the both of them even started to feel a smile enter their faces again. Things got better. Alex knew his social life was lacking. Despite everything he could not make himself feel the connections he had once felt towards the friends he had before his time inside Jumanji. Everyone of them were lacking in one way or the other. The four teenages he had connected to in just a few days inside the jungle felt more real and true than the years he had spent together with his childhood friends. He still had fun, smiled and acted as if everything was fine while at the same time separated himself slowly from those he had formerly considered his closest friends. When his parents questioned why he was so often alone and how was Thomas and so doing, Alex answered elusive. Not wishing to lie. In the end he just told them life was to hectic, and that they were all growing apart. Different collages, new interests, and so forth. No one except his shrink and himself needed to know that those he considered his true friends was hardly out of their diapers. oOoOo Alex had a new perspective on life after his adventure. Making him appreciate the small things in a new and more meaningful way. Electricity and indoor plumbing was something he would never take for granted ever again. Running cold water he could drink, and a shower he could turn scordering hot made him almost cry the first times he used them after his return. His parents used to joke around that the water bill was significant higher the years before he moved out compared when it was just the two of them left. Just to remind himself of how life could be without all those luxurities Alex spent a few weeks a year alone out in the forest. This time he had a tent and warm blankets. It was luckily nothing like Jumanji, but with bug spray and a few bottles of beer he felt more at peace than anywhere else. A while after his mom had died he moved back to his childhood home to be closer to his dad. The house was more than big enough for the both of them, and it felt nice not living alone in an empty flat. This time Alex was paying his share of the water bill and other expenses. oOoOo His lovelife had never been questioned by his parents at least. Or his lack of one. The first few years Alex had not noticed his lack of interest in the opposite sex. Heck, he had no sexual interest in the same sex even. Despite this he would not adress himself as asexuall, he had a drive and his right hand could give him the release when he needed it. The only problem was finding someone he wanted to be with. Someone to share his life with. It felt as if everyone he could in passing consider attractive became boring the second he addressed them. Making him lose interest in just a few minutes. Not seeing the point of even try dating them. There was always something wrong with them. To tall, wrong color in hair or eyes, or the wrong figure. The other person might even smell a little off. Alex had no idea what he was searching for, but he knew it was not someone he had met yet. In the end Alex just concluded it was another strange thing his body and mind had dragged with him back from Jumanji. Maybe it was for the best he never got a family of his own, never making his father a grandfather. Those thoughts made him a little sad. His dad would make a great grandfather. He just knew it. Nonetheless he could not make himself become intimate with anyone. It felt wrong to even consider it. More than once he had considered adopting. But who in their right mind would let a forever single man adopt a child when it had been documented that particular man was both depressed and suffered from PTSD? Personally Alex did not think those elements would hinder him from becoming a great dad. With the right person he could open himself up, becoming the man he knew he could be. Even without the need to talk to an psychologist. If he ever found somebody he would tell them everything. Every small detail. His partner would know all his hidden emotions. They would know Jumanji. This he promised himself. In the end it was as if his heart told him not to adopt. Almost like he was suppose to wait for something. Or someone. oOoOo When he was almost forty he finally figured out what had been missing his whole life. Right in front of him, on a cold day in December, he notised four teenages looking at him strangly as he was unwrapping the christmas tree from the hood of his car. For a moment he could hardly breath, but then he managed to find his courage. He started walking in the direction of the group of four missmatched strangers. Step by step, making his heart beat louder and louder in his ears. Despite having never seen them before, his heart was screaming to him that he knew them. Had spent an adventure together with them. Had seen some of them die and return to life. Had almost died in front of them himself. One by one he gave them a lookover. The small skinny kid he addressed as Spencer, the hight strong boy would be Fridge, the ginger haired girl was Martha, and the beautiful blond girl would have to be Bethany. From their shocked expressions he knew he had guessed correctly. None of them were even remotely similar to the character they had played inside Jumanji, least of all Bethany, but even before they had an real conversation Alex felt a inner peace at last. As the five of them were talking, everyone trying to make an understanding of what had happened during the time they had last seen each other. Alex talked but had trouble keeping his eyes away from Bethany. She was beautiful. And so young. He had finally found what had been missing. The small girl in front of him. She held part of his soul. And he had part of hers inside of him. Just standing close to her made him feel complete for the first time in almost twenty years. She was hardly legal but he knew he would love her for the rest of his life. She was the one he had been waiting for. When Bethany shared one of her lives with him she had probably made a connection between the two of them which had crossed over from the game and into the real world. A red string in a way, linking their lacking souls together. Two half making one whole. oOoOo Alex had trouble on how to address the issue with the girl. Did she feel it as well? The connection holding the two of them together. His elecluse life, completely without ever having tried to flirt with someone from the opposite sex made him extra uncomfortable. Especially considering the high age difference between the two of them. She was an vibrating young woman, ready to take the steps into making a great future for herself. He on the other hand were twice her age, diagnosed with mental problems and were living together with his dad. 'What a great catch he were' he told himself depressingly. Luckily for Alex, Bethany had decided he was what she needed in order to make her great future. Despite everything she did not hide the fact she wanted him and told him so with straightforward words and sparkling eyes. In the beginning Alex had no idea what he was suppose to do with someone like Bethany. He just knew he could never refuse her. She was the love of his life. The keeper of his heart. The reason he was alive today. Nonetheless he made her promise to take things slow with him. She needed to graduate, and then they could gently try dating after that. Bethany protested in the beginning but in the end reluctantly agreed. This was the one thing she could not make him change his opinion on. Alex had in a way waited for her for twenty years, he could wait a few more months. It was hard, but they both managed to hold their emotions back. For a while at least. It made him less worried for the future when she confessed to him that she knew it would be the two of them for life. oOoOo Bethany graduated and they started to get to know each other on a personal level out in the real world. In coffeeshops instead of the wet jungle. During their first dates they received more than a few looks. If it had not been for their connections Alex would had run for the hills a long time ago, not used to the judgmental looks. Bethany on the other hand would strongly hold his hand when they were out in public together. Refusing to let go and at the same time giving him strength to hold his head high. Their love was connected on a deeper level than what the ignorant people around them assumed anyway. Having Spencer, Martha and Fridge cheering them on from the sidelines helped him a lot as well. Slowly the couple went from dating, till kissing and having a sexuall relationship. Alex proposed not long after. He had bought the ring years ago without having an idea as to why he wanted to at the time. Or even having an idea as to who he would give it to. His heart just told him he should buy it. At that time he had long given up not listening to his heart, and followed the directions it wanted him to go. Which was toward a golden ring with an bright green emerald stone. Bethany both cried and screamed out in joy when he got down on one knee. The ring was a perfect match to her finger. Less than a year later they met at the altar, she an angel dress in white, and him in a black suit. oOoOo Alex had been correct in one of his former assumptions. His dad was a great grandfather. Sitting next to his lovely wife, watching his father joyfully playing around in the yard with his three grandchildren made his heart and face smile. Everything in his life was now finally whole and perfect. oOoOo AN: This is something more similar to how I wanted to movie to end, hope it reflects the wish for someones else as well. ","Summary":" Jumanji- Half of a soul Ever since the return from an exciting, but nonetheless completely mind blo"},{"Movie":"Jumanji","Title":"The Game","Author":"Vaneria Potter","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13124824","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: I do not own Jumanji, or any of the associated characters Summary: Jumanji had existed in many forms over the years, played by countless people. Yet, The Game was selective in who it chose to play. It always had been. The Game The Game did not know how it came to be, or why. Some, if they thought about it at all, believed The Game a trap from the Fair Folk, trouble in a harmless guise, for the cruel amusement of the Lords and Ladies. Others suggested a Trickster's gift, a blessing and a second chance disguised in trauma and terror. Yet more wondered if it might not be an unlawful djinn, gone mad from imprisonment and cursing itself into a new form, to grant a wish that the even the finder was unaware of, lingering malice driving it to do so in as cruel a way as possible. The players themselves rarely had time for such philosophical questions, more concerned with survival, and then with doing their very best to hide or destroy the game. The Game laughed to itself when they did, amused at their petty attempts. As if one with the power to bend reality could be so easily thwarted. But it was pleasing that they retained enough hope to think it possible, so The Game allowed them their illusions. If The Game cared to dwell on its origins, in the long years between players, it thought that it was probably none of the things that people supposed, yet all of the theories had an element of truth. It had a consciousness, of sorts, an awareness unbound by empathy or morality, and a purpose, though the fine details varied between players. It's power, it's very existence, was bound to that purpose. The Game's first player had been a young girl, scared and uncertain, unwilling to face the duty that came with her privilege. The Game gave her the adventure she didn't know she wanted, the wisdom to realise that her choices had consequences, and the skills she needed to achieve her potential. She thanked The Game by having it trampled in a stampede, much like the ones she had experienced. The Game, then only a set of dice and a list of actions, laughed to itself as the clay shattered and parchment tore. It would be back. The Game had it's favourites, over the years. Jacob Sherman, an arrogant bully whose fellow players, playing a game found while raiding a place sacred to the natives they saw as little different to the animals they hunted, finished the game without rolling the 5 or 8 needed to free him. Jacob responded by allowing his bitter cruelty to overtake him, hunting the other residents of Jumanji in an attempt to slake his fury. The Game was disappointed at Jacob's failure to accept the offer to improve himself, and never allowed him to succeed in his hunts. Allan Parrish, an intelligent but fearful boy who had the potential to thrive to greatness, but not without some external help. His parents protected him too much to force him to face his problems, and none of them had yet managed to bridge the communication gap. Allan would have to be the one to make the first move, and to do that, he needed to learn to rely on himself. The Game lured him to discovery with the sound of drums, and Allan followed with a will. Allan thrived in the crucible that was Jumanji, and the game protected him just enough to ensure that he survived to return home. Alex Vreek was a special favourite, who loved The Game because it was a game, but needed to learn to live outside of games every so often. The Game guided him to Allan's old home, gave him a place of safety and helped him avoid the traps until he knew where they were. Alex would survive, and learn what his fellow players would need when they arrived. He awoke to the sound of drums, and followed them to his destiny. The Game had been a board game for centuries before Alex gave it the opportunity to transform into something new. The Game relished the opportunity to expand into something new, something so much more than it had been. It rejoyced, and slowed time in Jumanji, so that Alex would not need to linger too long between his arrival and return. The other four were a delight. Two of each, desperately trying to ignore the problems plauging them, needing The Game's help more than they would ever know. They would be perfect companions for Alex. The two girls who needed to find true, supportive friendships, polar opposites who were not so different as they thought. One who needed to live life, rather than endure it while chasing some undefined goal. One who needed to stop relying on external validation and appearences, and own her decisions. Two boys who needed to mend the gulf between them, who had so much buried anger and hurt, wounds that needed to be lanced in order to heal, that they would never confront on their own. One hurt by abandonment, so desperate to regain a lost friendship that he did not realise how much he was hurting himself in an unhealthy parody of that relationship, who needed to stand up for himself and his wants, to realise that being himself was enough. He and the first girl would help each other far longer than simply their time in Jumanji, if they gained the courage. The Game thought them adorable, as much as it could feel anything. The last was a walking contradiction. He seemed to have life the best of all of them, yet was the one most in need of The Game's intervention. He had been in a position of Social power and respect, yet internally was filled with so much fear and insecurity that it made him cruel to those who had once been friends. The game forced him to the bottom of the power structure, forced him to realise that even in the position he feared the most, he still had value, as did the ones he scorned. The Game was pleased when the five players learned their lessons as well as they did, succeeding in all the challenges that The Game threw their way. They blossomed in the fires of Adversity, forged themselves in the crucible of Jumanji, and emerged stronger and better for it. The Game laughed when they destroyed it, with as much determination and thoroughness as the noble daughter, the first of The Game's players, had. The outside world was changing swiftly, and already the game needed a new form than the one Alex Vreek had given it. As ever, The Game would return, when there was one nearby who needed the lessons it taught. . . . . A/N: Hey, all, sorry for the absence. I've got three co-workers on long-term leave, so there has been an obscene amount of overtime happening. This has been kicking around in my head since I first watched the movie, and I finally sat down and finished it. I don't know how much sense it makes, but I hope you enjoy it anyway.

Are we there yet? Are we there yet?\" \"No!\" If there was one question Nora Shepherd was beginning to hate, it was that one. She gripped the steering wheel tightly, trying to blot out her nephew's repeated chants of \"Are we there yet?\" she slowly counted to ten. \"Are we-\" \"Peter that's enough!\" Judy's hand clamped down over Peter's mouth as she gave him her trademark \"Shut up\" look. Eventually she released him. The nine year old folded his arms and sat there with pout. They had been driving for what seemed like hours, at least that's what it felt like to him when he had nothing to keep him amused, not even a toy or his games console. Well, this sucks. Peter sat there with his arms resting on his seatbelt, already fed up with the whole situation. He sunk into the beige leather seat. Peter sighed as he glumly watched the world pass by. Instead of the industrial estates and skyscrapers of Albany, his home, all that washed past were fields and rural neighorhoods. Everything rushing in a dull, green blur made him nauseous. He tore himself away from windows, they were starting to fog up from the damp air and pouring rain anyway, and quickly fetched a white, paper sick bag from the pouch on the back of Aunt Nora's seat. Judy glared at him with sharp green eyes as the rustling from him opening the bag disturbed her from her phone call. She tutted, brushing her straw colored locks aside as she spoke into the small pink phone held up to her ear. \"No still in the car,\" she said, trying to blank out the disgusting sound of her little brother puking into a sick bag. \"No that's just Shrimp being car sick again. Honestly I think most of it is just dry retching for attention.\" Raindrops tumbled down the window like a stampede of wild buffalo. Even from a very young age Peter would turn to counting them to pass the time on long car journeys. However he soon lost count somewhere near two hundred and gave up. That's odd, what did I eat today that had corn in it? Peter glimpsed at the contents of his sick bag. \"Ugh! Peter! Don't look at it!\" Judy yelled, gagging at her brother's morbid fascination with his own vomit. \"What were you expecting to be in there?!\" \"Well, I had corn today,\" Peter remarked. \"Ah, must have been Aunt Nora's tuna casserole.\" Now Judy felt sick. \"Aunt Nora, pull over before I throw up!\" \"Peter put thing away!\" Aunt Nora yelled. \"We're almost there, Judy!\" \"Where's there?\" Peter asked. \"Our new home Peter...\" Aunt Nora replied. He's asked that same question five times today already! \"What's wrong with your old house?\" Peter asked, sitting up. \"This new place is bigger and in such a lovely neighborhood! You'll make lots of new friends!\" Aunt Nora replied. \"I don't want any new friends! I miss my old friends!\" Peter whined. Aunt Nora didn't reply, however Peter could hear her counting again. He decided to shut up for the rest of the trip. A cool but expected October breeze disturbed the vibrant carpet of leaves stripped from the trees as fall set in. Stood in front of an empty, worn out mansion infested with dry rot, was a sold sign. Aunt Nora's red sports car pulled up on the kerb. In stark contrast to the rotten, old mansion it was shiny and almost brand new. \"Well, here we are kids,\" sad Aunt Nora. Eager to look around she almost forgot to turn off the ignition. You have got to be kidding me... Peter couldn't believe his eyes. Beyond the rusted gates a crumbling,white mansion barely stood there. It was way too rotten and busted to live there. Aunt Nora... What were you thinking...? Well, come on you two! Have a look!\" said Nora. \"Yeah, move it Shrimp!\" Judy gave Peter a swift kick up the backside to get him moving. Peter shot her an icy glare. That's it! I swear, if you call me that one more time! He growled as he got out and set foot on the sidewalk with his muddy, black sneakers. Dusting himself off, he looked up at the decayed mansion. \"What do you two think? Lovely isn't it?\" Aunt Nora asked. \"Eh,\" Judy mumbled, far more interested in texting her friends. \"Peter?\" Aunt Nora asked. What do I say? \"No Aunt Nora, I think it looks like dump\"? Peter was reluctant to be honest, fearing she would get mad at him. \"It's fine, I guess.\" Liar. It was not fine. The shutters were hanging by a rusty hinge. \"Good. Why don't we see what's inside?\" said Aunt Nora as she went on ahead down the stone path. Peter went to follow but was stopped by Judy. \"Liar. You don't like this house at all do you?\" Judy asked him. \"What's it to you?\" Peter was in no mood to acknoledge her questions as they felt more like an interrogation. Besides why should he give her the time of day when she'd been picking on him all day. \"I can read you like a book, Shrimp. You're already sick of this place and we've only just got here!\" said Judy. \"First off, stop call me that! My name is Peter!\" Peter said sharply. \"And secondly, Look at it! the whole place is falling apart!\" \"I have eyes, Peter!\" said Judy. she softened her frigid tone slightly. \"You're still missing Mom and Dad, aren't ya?\" It seemed that soon after Mom and Dad died in that car accident in Canada Aunt Nora was desperate to get rid of anything that reminded her of them. Peter and Judy barely had time to mourn them. The question pierced Peter's heart like an arrow. He could only nod. Of course I miss them! Why did they go on that stupid holiday anyway? \"Hurry up! you can both play later!\" Aunt Nora called them from the end of the winding path to the front door. It was flanked either side by overgrown lawns boarded by twisted barbed wire rose bushes with dead brown blooms. Judy pushed Peter to get him to go through the rusted iron gates first. They simply read: \"Parrish Hall\" in gothic letters.

He was a generally well behaved boy who never really gave his parents much trouble. He lived in a big house somewhere in Maine. He loved the old house. He would explore the house, pretending to be a famous archeologist. He loved archeology. It was one of his favorite things. He'd pour through old books about ancient cultures and read magazines about expeditions in dangerous jungles. The only thing he loved more than ancient cultures was animals. He loved animals. So much so, that he would upset his parents a lot by bringing home a wild animal, asking them if he could keep it. He had several different pets. A pet lizard named Indy. A cat named Lara. A dog named Anubis. He wanted a bird but his parents wouldn't let him. He had a relatively happy childhood. When he went to the beach one day to play with his dog, Anubis, he heard the distant sound of drums. Where was the sound coming from he wondered. His dog ran up to a strange object half buried in the sand and growled at it. \"What have you found boy? What is it?\" Russel said. He heard the sound of drums again only much closer. It seemed to come from the strange object. He went up and pulled it out of the sand. It was a long thin wooden box. He brush it off and saw that it was a board game. An old and beautifully carved wooden board game labeled Jumanji. There were pictures of animals on the outside of the box and a the picture of a hunter or explorer with a pith hat and mustache. Russel was intrigued. Anubis wouldn't stop barking at it however so he grabbed the dog and walked back to his house, taking the board game with him. When he got back to his house he put Anubis in the backyard and rushed up to his room to take a closer look at the game. When he got back to his room he placed the game on his bed. The lid of the box was hinged on both sides and opened in the middle. It unfolded out into the game board. The board itself was a classic board game with a starting area and spaces leading up to an end. The end was in the middle of the board and was an interesting looking black circle that looked like it was made of glass. On the edges of the board there was a compartment where the game pieces and the dice were kept. The game pieces looked to be carved from different colored stone. The dice looked to be made from some sort of bone. On the edges of the board in the same area the dice were kept there were instructions. Russel read them aloud. \"Jumanji: A game for those who wish to find a way to leave their world behind. You roll the dice to move your token, doubles get another turn, and the first one to reach the end wins. Adventurers beware: do not start unless you intend to finish. The exciting consequences of the game will vanish only when the player has reached Jumanji and called out its name.\" \"Wow. This game looks so cool. It must be an antique. I wonder how old it is?\" Russel said to himself. The antique quality of the game excited him. The theme of the game appealed to him. An exploration of a dangerous jungle. He really wanted to play. The only thing about Russel's life that wasn't that great was that he didn't have all that many friends. Most kids his age thought him weird. So when he encountered an interesting board game like this he was a bit sad, since there'd be no one to play it with. He resolved to play the game anyway and took out the crocodile token. he held it in his hand for a bit, when it flew from his hand and adhered itself to the starting space. \"Woah. It must be magnets or something.\" Russel suggested. He rolled the dice. Seven. His token moved seven spaces all by itself. He stared at it in shock. Then words started to form in the black glass circle in the middle of the board. \"His fangs are sharp, he likes your taste, Your party better move post haste.\" Russel read the riddle aloud. Suddenly he heard something down the hall. His cat Lara hissed at something. The something she hissed at growled in response. A deep growl that sounded to big to be another house cat. Russel stood up and stared at his bedroom door. Did he want to find out what that was? No. He had a pretty good idea of what that was given the sound of it's growl. He loved animals after all. The thing was, just because he loved big animals did not mean he wanted one in his house. It must be the game he thought! He had to finish the game or his parents would be really upset to find a lion in the house. He just knew he'd be blamed for this. He went back to the game on his bed. Since no one else was playing he could roll again. He picked up the dice and shivered, then he rolled. Three. The crocodile token moved up three spaces. \"In the jungle you must wait, until the dice read five or eight.\" Russel stared at it in shock. \"What does that mean? I'm the only player!\" Suddenly the board sucked Russel into the black glass circle. Russel came to lying in some foliage. There are jungle sounds all around him. He looked around. He was in a jungle! The game told him he had to stay there till the dice read five or eight...but Russel was the only one playing. How was he going to get out? He sat on the ground and put his head in his hands. He was screwed. It truly looked like he was stuck here. It was awhile before Russel got up. When he did he just wandered for awhile, not really knowing where he was going. He heard sounds through the trees that scared him. After awhile it started to get dark. He got very scared. Russel knew that things would only get worse in the dark. He needed to find shelter. As if the game itself had listened to his thoughts there was suddenly a crude hut ahead of him. He ran to it. The hut looked like something out of Robinson Crusoe. It was made of bamboo and logs and was held together by crude rope. Near the entrance there were words carved into a log. \"Alan Parrish was here.\" Russel went inside the hut that was barely closed to the elements. There was a crude bed at the end of the room and various crude furniture around the room. There was food on one of the tables but it looked like it had been there for a very long time and had rotted mostly away. Russel wrinkled his nose and took what remained of the food and threw it out of the hut. Then he went and laid down in the bed and cried himself to sleep. Fairly quickly, Russel learned to survive in the jungle. He learned he had to be quick and that nothing should be underestimated. Even some of the plants in Jumanji were deadly. He learned what animals and plants to avoid and how to avoid them. He learned what was safe to eat and where it was safe to get a drink of water. Most of his knowledge of jungle animals came from his long hours staying up at night reading, back in the real world. But not all of Jumanji's animals seemed to fit the information he knew. It was like Jumanji was an exaggeration of what a jungle was supposed to be. Animals that didn't fit together in the same location wandered around together. The rhinos were all albino and seemed to be carnivorous. There were jaguars in one location and lions in another. It seemed like a mishmash of a jungle. But Russel learned how to survive it. About a month or so into Russel's life in the jungle he started getting rather lonely. He also figured out that some of the things he needed, like citronella candles, could not be found in the jungle. As if the jungle knew of his worries, Russel ended up running across a large bazaar filled with people. The people didn't seem to even really notice that Russel existed that much and didn't really talk to him other than to hock their wares at him. But he felt a little better knowing that there were people in Jumanji. Even if they didn't really seem like real people. The culture of the bazaar was strange. It seemed like everything else in Jumanji, a mishmash of several different cultures. It looked like every bazaar he'd seen in pictures in explorer magazines. There were bits of Africa, bits of South America, bits of India, bits of Asia all mashed together. Russel just accepted it and bought the supplies he needed. He paid with things he'd found in the jungle and all of the shopkeepers seemed to accept anything he wanted to give them. He chatted with several of the people but they didn't really talk much back to him, as if they didn't really have anything to say. He guessed fake people didn't have anything to small talk with. He settled into the hut he christened as Alan Parrish's hut. He made it his own, fixing it up as best as he could. The citronella candles he had helped keep away all the different sizes of mosquitos, from the normal sized ones to the huge scary ones. It was like a home. Russel still missed his family and his pets though. He wished he had someone to keep him company at his hut. About a year later Russel comes across an injured buzzard. He took it back to his hut and nursed it back to health as best as he could. The bird started to trust him and when it had healed it stuck around and sometimes gave him dead things as gifts. He grew rather fond of the bird and named it Jack. After awhile Jack and Russel seemed to become the best of friends. Jack would fly ahead of him and check to see if anything bad was in the area before returning to him. Russel would give the bird small animals as treats in return. A few years went by. Russel was growing up. He was no longer the small boy who dreamed of one day going on an adventure. He was now a teenager who lived day to day hoping that he would survive the day. His old love of archeology was still there, and sometimes he would stare at the ruins he'd run across in the jungle. One day the forest grew very quiet as Russel was walking along. That didn't seem to be a good sign to Russel or Jack. Jack scouted around for Russel. Suddenly, the shot of a gun was heard! Jack barely escaped being shot! Russel ran to where Jack had landed and checked him over to see if he was alright. Suddenly a man came through the trees. A man in a pith hat and old fashioned explorer's garb. He had a very large gun. The man looked shocked to see another person in the jungle. Russel stared at the man. \"Hello. Are you a real person too? Or are you just part of the game?\" He said hoping that the man was indeed real. But then he realized that he had seen this man before. On the game box. He was the man in the pith hat on the cover of the game. Russel sighed in disappointment. That meant that the man was just another part of the game. \"Hello there young man. I didn't know there was someone else in this jungle. You know, you remind me of someone I used to know. His name was Alan. Pity he got away. Maybe you wont.\" the man said before raising his gun and pointing it at Russel. Russel's eyes widen in realization. This man was just another of the jungle's dangers. \"Go on, start running boy.\" The hunter said. Russel ran. And ran. He didn't stop running till he got back to his hut. By that time the hunter had lost him. He collapsed on the floor of the hut, breathing heavily. Russel kept running into the hunter several times over the next few weeks. He always had to run away as fast as he could and dodge the hunter somewhere in the jungle. Russel, not one to give up, started to plan how he could stop the hunter from hunting him. He devised several traps around the jungle to trap the hunter. Then one day he found the hunter caught in one of his traps. He was hanging upside down by a rope. \"Get me down from here this instant! You'll pay for this boy!\" the hunter shouted. Russel picked up the hunter's gun which had fallen to the ground. He aimed it at the hunter. The hunter laughed at him. \"Going to shoot me boy? Go on. Do it. I dare you...You don't have the courage to do it do you boy?\" Russel had learned over the course of his stay in Jumanji that the rules of the jungle were Kill or Be Killed. But this was a man he was aiming at. He didn't know if he could pull the trigger. \"Let me down from here right now and I will give you a head start. I promise.\" the hunter said. Russel shook his head. This wasn't a man he reminded himself. He was just part of the game. It wasn't like killing someone real. He raised the large gun again and pointed it back at the hunter. He closed his eyes and pulled the trigger. \"BLAM!\" The gun went off and Russel staggered, nearly falling down. He opened his eyes to see the hunter disappearing in a shower of blood. The blood seemed to soak into the ground and disappear. Russel let out a sigh of relief. His relief was short lived however. The blood reappeared at his feet and ran up his legs like it had a mind of its own. He screamed in terror as the hunter's blood covered him. When the blood completely covered him, the pain started. Pain unlike anything he had ever known ran through. Russel couldn't see anything. Couldn't hear anything. Couldn't feel anything but pain. His head was filled with it. Then mercifully he passed out. Somewhere in the real world a crocodile game token fell off the game board and slotted itself back into it's storage area. Some time later he woke up. He was lying on the ground staring up at the trees. The trees seemed different somehow. He felt strange. His whole body felt different. His mind felt different but he didn't know how. He staggered to his feet, and went over to the water to see his reflection. What he saw in the water made him scream. That wasn't his face! It was the face of a grown man! A rough looking grown man with a hard savage looking face. His clothes were different too. He was dressed as if he was a modern explorer with a long coat. He had a revolver strapped to his hip. In his mind he looked like an evil version of Indiana Jones. He tried removing the coat and throwing it in the water but the coat reappeared on him right after. He stared at his reflection. He stared at his reflection for a very long time. Time just seemed to stop mattering to him after that. He just wandered the jungle for awhile. Jack the buzzard continued to follow him but he hardly paid the bird any mind. The animals in the jungle seemed to either pay no attention to him or just seemed to scatter when he walked past. He had loved animals. He remembered that. He barely remember his past. Barely remembered his name. He knew his first name was Russel but didn't remember his last name. Why couldn't he remember his last name? He cried a little as he walked through the jungle aimlessly. And then one day when he was staring at his reflection in the water for awhile he felt the jungle change somehow. It felt different. His left eye started hurting. He closed his eyes in pain. When he opened them he was in a small camp and there were several other people milling around. He looked around confused. Where was he? One of the men came up to him and spoke to him. \"Sir? Van Pelt? I heard that Seaplane McDonough has arrived in Jumanji. He's trying to help Nigel Billingsley return the jewel.\" Russel shook himself out of his musings. Of course. How could he have forgotten? His name was Russel Van Pelt. He was an archeologist who had gone after the Jaguar's Eye of Jumanji. When he had finally claimed it, it had been stolen from him by Billingsley who wanted to return it to where it came from. He didn't want the jewel to be returned. Why would he with all this power he had found with it? He could control the animals of Jumanji. They obeyed his every command. His faithful bird landed on his shoulder. He whispered to it and the bird flew off to go follow Seaplane. He would get that jewel back! And then maybe his head wouldn't feel so strange anymore.

Didn't have to experience the world to get the shit, I got the shit filtered through the door so I could enjoy the nuggets in the turds.\" Nigel stared at him. \"So why am I here then, eh? Why-\" \"Jefferson Seaplane McDonough. The greatest flyer in the world. The man who rescued a dozen innocents from the savages of the deep Amazon with nought but a helicopter and some rope. The man who holds the record for fastest flight over the Indian Ocean. You are here because Jumanji needs you. Van Pelt…\" Alex let him drone on and returned to his margarita. Should have seen this coming. He'd heard this speech more times than he could count. If his question involved the words \"why\" or \"here,\" then nine times out of ten Nigel could give him a lecture about how great he was. Or, rather, how great Jefferson \"Seaplane McDonough was, rather than Alex Vreeke being great. Jumanji, having transformed itself into a videogame for his 'entertainment,' apparently hadn't learnt that exposition generally wasn't good writing. That there'd be no reason for anyone to tell the protagonist of a story what they already knew about themselves. Of course, Alex reflected, as he waited for Nigel to finish his speech, he didn't know what Mr McDonough knew. Unless what McDonough knew was the extent of his character blurb, then, yeah, he knew about as much as his avatar. But apart from that- \"So my friend, I wish you all the best, and pray you pass the final tests.\" \"Yeah, about that,\" Alex said. \"I'm not really that big into tests, and I never studied flying with a major in homicidal orangutans.\" Nigel said nothing. He began walking to his car. \"Don't suppose you could give me a ride?\" Alex called out. \"Or guns? Or a nuke? Or a way out of this game?\" Nigel remained silent. He got into the car and revved it up. \"Yeah, well, thanks for everything, I guess.\" He raised his margarita in a mock toast. \"Hey, do you have any side-quests I could do? Maybe extra lives? Collect a hundred rings or coins, that sort of thing?\" Nigel gave him a wave, but still said nothing. He drove off, leaving nothing but the smell of gasoline, and the bitter taste of limbo. \"Wanker.\" Alex leant back in his chair – he hated this place. He was in a videogame, and somehow he hated it. Granted, this game was more of an RPG/adventure hybrid, whereas his interests were more in racing and action – Grand Theft Auto , Twisted Metal , etc. Oh, sure, everyone was losing their minds over Final Fantasy VII which was going to be released next year, but he could see a flop coming when he saw it. This game should have been a platformer. He yawned – a platformer. He'd have done great there. Or, at least, a platformer with rings, or coins, or any other device that gave hedgehogs and plumbers the means to keep trying to defeat their enemies, not to mention continue screens. Few years back, he'd fought in what the kids were already calling the Console Wars, now, as PS1, the N64, and the Saturn hungered for blood, he was stuck here. Not fighting in a war per se, but still hunted by people who wanted to kill him, animals who wanted to kill him, and without any companionship outside some NPCs, and the writing of some guy named Alan Parish. \"Here's to you mate,\" Alex said, raising a glass to the writing. The carved letters that said ALAN PARISH WAS HERE – proof that manners still counted for something in the jungle. Soon as I get out of here, I'm going to the Yellow Pages. If, he got out of here, which was becoming a bigger \"if\" by the hour. There had to be a way out…or he hoped there was a way out, because he'd searched everywhere he could, talked to every NPC he could find, and none of them had ever heard of an Alan Parish. It had occurred to Alex that maybe this was just part of the game's backstory, that maybe the armour of Alan Parish existed to give him a buff after defeating a sub-boss or something, but he doubted it. His gut, his heart, whatever it was, something told him that Alan Parish was…or had been…real. And that he'd been here. Maybe when Jumanji was a board rather than computer game. But had he got out? Or was his digital body residing in this digital world, decomposing digitally? Is that a thing? He didn't know. All he could do was wait, watch, and wonder. Few hours from now (or days, it was hard to tell) Nigel might show up again – he was a roamer NPC, on a set path throughout the game world, whereas the other NPCs usually cloistered around in the bazaar, spouting nonsense if they spouted anything at all. He'd tried talking to them. Tried to find side-quests. Anything to give him an extra life, or some gold, or some weapons, or, heck, anything. But, it wasn't to be. The game had sucked him in like a movie from the 80s, and now he was living the high life – marauders, mosquitos, and margaritas. All he was short of was McDonalds, Metallica…mum…dad…other things that began with \"m\" that he couldn't recall right now…mercy? Madness? He was short of the former, and edging ever closer to the latter. And misery. That, he reflected, he had in spades.

I stepped on Legos that my little brother left on my bedroom floor. I hissed a sling of cuss words and jumped up and down on my good foot. I should have just went back to bed. I never should have gone to school. But I did. I dressed as fast as humanly possible and chucked the Legos into my brother's room. I ran down the stairs to see my mom dressed in her purple scrubs flipping pancakes. My little brother Michael was playing with more goddamn Legos at the kitchen table. Mama told me to sit my little butt down, so I did. I knew better than to get on her bad side. Mama had been through a lot in her life. She had me at sixteen, went to college at night to become a nurse all to have my daddy leave us right before Michael was born. It was just the three of us. I hadn't heard from my dad in almost five years and I was ok with that. Mama put a plate of pancakes in front of me and another in front of my brother. She then sat down at the table between us. Breakfast was the one meal a day we got to spend with each other. Mama usually picked up night shifts after working all day in order to provide for Michael and me. I wanted to go to Brown someday and that shit didn't come cheap. So I watched my brother at night because Mama earned more than I would if I got a job at nights. You wouldn't have known it by looking at me, but I was first in my class and on track to be valedictorian when I finally graduated. I worked my ass off and because of that I didn't have very many friends. Oh fine, I don't have any friends. When I was younger, I had been close friends with Bethany Walker but when she got boobs she became popular and forgot all about me. We hadn't spoken and I was ok with that too. Judging by her instagram we definitely had nothing in common anymore. I ate my pancakes. I was about halfway through when I looked at the clock. Fuck. I was going to be late. Again. I was almost always late for school. But I had a good reason. It was because I was trying to spend time with my mother, something most teenagers avoided. Leaving my plate at the table I kissed Mama on the cheek before I ran to grab my backpack. If I ran fast enough I might just make the bus. I ran down the sidewalk and tripped over Michael's bike. I couldn't really blame him, he didn't really know better. But I bet if I hadn't tripped I would have made the bus. Instead, when I got to the bus stop, I saw the bus moving down the road away from me. I swore and kicked the ground before I walked home. Mama wasn't going to be happy. She would understand but she wouldn't be happy. Michael's sitter and the hospital were on the other side of town. If I asked her for a ride, I would probably make her late and I knew she had an important meeting today about a promotion. I couldn't make her late. Not today. Instead, I grabbed my old bike that I hadn't used since like sixth grade. It was pink with streamers, a basket, and a bell. I had a phase back then. I jumped on the bike and headed towards school. At school I flung the bike at the bike rack, not caring if it fell down or not. I ran into the school out of breath and sprinted toward my first period class. The halls were empty. School had started. My only hope was that my teacher didn't notice me sneaking in late. But I had no such luck. The teacher greeted me with, \"Eileen, how nice of you to finally join us.

The name I gave you The local news report was passing on television. Alex wasn't really paying attention. The sound and the image were playing in the background. Snippets of information were reaching him as he was focused on the difficult task of giving his son Andy his dessert.. ...She is the fourth student of Brantford's high school declared missing... He sighed in defeat. The apple compote was almost everywhere but in his son's mouth. ...The teenage girl was trekking alone in the North Mountains for few days... As he lifted his head, Alex's look caught the TV just in time to see a familiar face. He felt his blood turning cold. On a red coloured background, a big portrait of a smiling Bethany was occupying the screen with the word \"missing\" written in caps. He realised his hands were shaking as he tried to raise the volume with the remote. - \"This case may not be related to the paranormal disappearance of three other students in a park this afternoon.\" Said the male journalist to his feminine colleague. - \"Indeed.\" She replied. \"Several witnesses have report the same observations. The teenagers seemed to have been absorbed by their phones.\" Alex gulped as the journalist emphasized the last part of the sentence. - \"Absorbed?\" - \"Yes. The police is investigating on that case as some raw footages of the event have been uploaded on several video platforms and are buzzing right now. We don't know for sure if that's real, but the first testimonies are concurring.\" As the reporter spoke, the picture changed to a shaky cam recording. The sound was a bit saturated as people screamed around the camera, but Alex could hear a distinctive drum beat in the background. Also, even with the unfocused images, he recognized the three teenagers. He watched with dread their frames distorted slowly as they were sucked into their phone. That moment he knew that probably the same had happened to Bethany wherever she was. Suddenly he realised that he could be the next one, that Jumanji would call him back too. Or, worst, put his family in danger. His heart raced. - \"...The police have declared that some evidences seem to have been concealed. The four students' phones, found on site, seem to have been infected by the recent virus that paralysed several Brantford's companies a few days ago. The phone data have been encrypted so they cannot be collected by the authorities. For the moment, no track of investigation is preferred.\" - \"It seems that a lot is happening these days at Brantford...\" Alex stared blankly at the screen. He wasn't listening anymore. He was still lost in his thoughts when his wife, Elena, entered the room. - \"Bethany is waiting for her daddy goodnight kiss. She... Alex? Are you ok?\" Asked the brunette with concern when she saw his face. \"You're as white as sheet.\" She turned to the TV as the journalists were repeating the same last news. \"Poor kids. That staging is sick.\" - \"Staging? It was filmed in a park full of people. I don't think they can have faked the testimony of so many.\" Again, the portrait of the four missing students was displayed on the screen. At that very moment, Alex wanted to explain everything to his wife. But all was rushing back in his mind and he couldn't find a way to tell the truth without her thinking he was mad. - \"Anyway... That story just moved me. I thought about our children...\" He concluded with a sad smile. - \"I'm sure the police will find the people behind that. I hope they will find the kids safe and sound.\" She hugged him tenderly before adding to his ear: \"Your daughter is waiting. I'll take care of Andy.\" She smiled when she witnessed the multiple streaks of compote around the baby. \"Look at that mess.\" She raised her hands in an ironically gesture of defeat that made him laugh. ### Alex stopped in front of the door. The name of his daughter was written with colourful pieces of wood. - \"The girl that saved my life...\" He murmured as he touched the letters. It was quite a very long time since he had been that scared. Jumanji was coming back in his life in an unexpected and cruel way. Those teenagers belonged to the past but without them he wouldn't have the life he enjoyed today. And even if, from the group, Bethany had been a lightning bolt love in his youth, she had such an impact on him for the brief moment they met. Thanks to her he was alive, and her support made everything possible. He remembered the emotion he had when he met her in flesh few months ago. Of course, as the time had passed, he didn't have the same feelings that he had back then in the game, but he was quite moved. - \"Daddy? Are you there?\" The little voice cut his thoughts. Alex finally pushed the door and entered his daughter's bedroom. - \"Hi there princess.\" - \"Daddy!\" Exclaimed the little girl. \"Kiss me goodnight.\" She said with an innocent grin. - \"Sure.\" Delicately, he replaced the cover over her. He sat on the corner of her bed and then landed a kiss on her forehead. \"Daddy is watching over you. Sleep well.\" Bethany gripped her teddy. \"Goodnight little fairy.\" He simply added before switching off the light on the bedside table. - \"You don't tell me stories?\" Even in the dark he perceived her disappointed pout. He closed his eyes and sighed. What could he tell her? At the moment, he had nothing in his mind except Jumanji. He heard the door creak, so he turned round. In the frame, against the light of the corridor, there was his wife. Alex put his head in his hand. - \"Is everything ok?\" Asked Elena as she entered the room. She put a hand on his shoulder. Alex shacked slowly his head in a negative way, but he smiled at her. He sighed deeply and finally said for both his wife and daughter: - \"Daddy has a story. This one is for the whole family.\" - \"Alex?\" With a single movement of the head, he invited his wife to join him. She sat in front of him on a tiny children chair. He smiled. The dim light coming from the corridor was just enough to light the faces of everyone. He began to talk in a calm and slow-paced voice. - \"I will tell you a rather strange story.\" He eye-locked with his wife. \"A long time ago, there was a boy who had a magical game. He didn't know it was magic until he played it. And the day he did, he found himself literally absorbed by the game. He was sent into a beautiful but very dangerous jungle. To return in the real world he had to win the game, but he quickly found that he couldn't do it all alone. So, he stayed hidden and tried to avoid perils as much as he could. Because inside the game time was different and the boy didn't age, and years passed without him noticing. But one day, four other kids found the game and were trapped just like him. The boy found them, and they quickly became friends. They joined forces to defeat the game. As they progressed the challenges became harder and harder and, at some point, the boy almost lost his life. He was saved by one of the four kids.\" Alex looked at his daughter and smiled. \"Her name was Bethany.\" - \"Oh! That's my name.\" Exclaimed the little girl. She looked up at him with big eyes. - \"Yes. And that girl became special to him and during their journey they got closer.\" His wife frowned but didn't say a word. \"Finally, the kids beat the game and they were all released. But when the boy returned into the real world he found that he was alone. He was back the exact same day he had begun the game, so the kids that helped him weren't there. They weren't even born.\" - \"They were from his future?\" Asked the little girl. - \"Exactly.\" Replied Alex looking back at her. - \"So, was Bethany?\" - \"Yes, so was she.\" He turned back to his wife. \"At first he was sad because he knew that he may never see her back but as time was passing by it became less painful. Years later, he felt in love with a woman that became his wife. The first child they had was a girl. He chose Bethany as a name to honour his lost friend.\" Alex found it hard to finish his sentence without a tremor in his voice, but he managed to keep it smooth. - \"I like the story.\" Bethany said. - \"Great.\" He replied. \"Now, it's time to sleep.\" He got up and laid a kiss on her forehead. Without a word, Elena did the same. - \"Goodnight.\" Said the little girl as her parents were leaving the room. The brunette closed partially the door behind them. She gave Alex a quizzical look. He knew that a long conversation was ahead, but it was the moment to tell the truth to his loved one. Jumanji was a part of his life he couldn't ignore anymore. He silently invited her to follow him.

Jumanji- No longer insane When Alex woke up on the hard floor of his own bedroom when his alarm clock started ringing, he first assumed everything had been a long dream. Something his mind had fixated on as he probably had fallen asleep while playing the game he found in his room. Jumanji. Despite feeling like he had been separated from his parents for a long time he managed to mostly shook off the strange feeling and act as if nothing was wrong. That nothing had changed. He put on his semi clean black metal t-shirt for the day. Tried to fix his hair with a few strokes of his hands before walking downstairs. Searching for breakfast before going to school for the day. For the most parts Alex managed to convince himself everything had just been an interesting and unique eventure. In a dreamworld. Nonetheless something inside of him was telling him not to share this particular dream with his friends or his parents. Almost like there was a wall inside his own head hindering from saying anything about jumanji. As time went by he sometimes began wondering it it had really been just a dream. More than a few strange things happened in his life in which he could not explain. He, who had only focused on games and metal music was now hooked on man made machines which could fly. Alex knew with almost certainty he could handle controlling both flying a plane and a helicopter. As if he had been programmed inside the matrix, or something just as strange. One of his main focuses in life was now to get better grades since his new focus was fixated on becoming a pilot. It would not be cheap and since his parents was not billionaires he would try to gain a scholarship. Those who knew his noticed and questioned his change, but Alex could not give them an realistic answer. What could he tell anyone without sounding completely insane? At least his parents supported his new interest. They were just glad he was getting great grades and now had a \"real\" goal in his life. oOoOo Alex both longed for, and was terrified to sleep outside under the open sky. Inside his own bedroom he felt trapped, making him become a insomniac. It was as if his body no longer wished to lay in his soft bed which was covered in his clean bedding. In a way he felt a strong inner yearning to sleep on leaves and moss. But at the same time he was terrified of sleeping alone outside. His body would get petrified just imagining getting bitten by moscatos. In the end the best solution he could come up with was to sleep on the hard floor of his bedroom. With his window open and the sounds of rain and the wind relaxed him. His open window covered by a mosquito net making Alex feel more at peace than he had in a long time. Lying there without real covers Alex slept better than he had since he first had his \"dream\". oOoOo Years went by and he had almost managed to completely convince himself it was all an unrealistically realistic dream. He had graduated a few years ago. Now an official pilot. He had taken a liking to the nickname Seaplane, despite flying commercial planes, and a lot of his friend began addressing him as such as well. Then everything changed one evening. Making everything more real. oOoOo Alex and a friend had been out drinking at a local pub. They had both the day off the next day so why not have fun together? Catching up a little in each others life. Having had a little more few drinks before walking out the door together the friends let their loud conversation continue. Maybe a little louder than what was typically considered normal, but why should they care. It was rude to listen to others conversations anyway so people should just focus on their own thoughts and ideas. As they were walking his friend addressed him as Seaplane when he told him good night before walking in the direction away from Alex. Without thinking Alex loudly proclaimed his \"full name was Seaplane McDonough, at least it had been in the game\". His friend just gave him a small wave by his hand as he was walking further and further away. Before Alex managed to start walking in the direction of his own home again a young voice interrupted his thoughts. Asking if he was \"Alex that had been inside Jumanji\". For a moment Alex was confused, he had never said the word Jumanji out loud to anyone. He had thrown the game away the day he had the strange dream. Ignorantly thinking no one else had ever played it. He had been wrong. Slowly he turned his body in the direction of the female voice. Standing just a few meters away from him was four teenages. Two girls and two boys. There and then Alex could do nothing except to let his eyes go from one teenager to the next. Despite almost knowing it was completely impossible he knew with certainty he was now confronted with reality. It had not been a dream. Not even a nightmare. He had actually been stuck in the jungle alone for years until these four strangers had enter the game and helped him win. He had never seen them before, but at the same time he knew them. Bethany, Spencer, Fridge and Martha. No longer managing to hold it together Alex let his body sink down on the dirty walkway in shock. His confused eyes never leaving the children. After a short while all he managed to utter was \" Aw, hell, I need a new drink.\" For some reasons his reaction made the four teenages laugh. Shaking his head a little Alex could do nothing except to join in on their innocent laugher. Not even stopping his laughter as he felt fresh tears run down his cheeks. After all he had always know it had been a really realistic dream. At least now he had evidence in a subject which had worried him for almost twenty years. He was not insane.

This was the first time he had spoken to her since their breakup. He looked as tall and muscular and handsome as ever. Instinct kicked in, and she twirled one lock of hair around her finger. \"Um, yeah. I have.\" \"Backpacking. You. I have trouble picturing it.\" The hair-twirling wasn't working. It had always melted Noah in the past. Bethany felt a twist in her gut. Maybe he really did mean it when he'd broken up with her this time. Maybe there would be no winning him back. But she kept a sweet smile plastered on her face despite the sinking in her midsection. \"Why? I like sunshine and flowers and…things like that. Why wouldn't I decide to try backpacking?\" \"For one, because backpacking would mean being without your phone. For like, days. There's no cell service in the Himalayas, sweetie.\" He made the former endearment sound like an insult. \"For another, backpacking requires wearing more than a bikini, and you're very likely to get dirt under your nails. Which we both know you hate. And finally, you have to be smart enough not to get lost without a GPS.\" Bethany felt tears start to burn her eyes. She willed them not to grow any bigger, lest he notice. \"One, I know that, duh. I can survive without my phone.\" She held up her fingers to tick off the points he'd made. Of course, he didn't know she'd gone cold turkey on the phone thing for what felt like several days recently, even if no time had passed in the real world. Only Martha, Spencer, Fridge and Alex knew about the adventure they'd had trying to get out of the jungle-themed video game Jumanji . There had definitely been no cell towers there, even if she had been transported into the game with her phone. In hindsight, it hadn't been as bad as she thought once she got used to it. \"Two, I've definitely worn more than a bikini and I can survive a little dirt. Three, I one hundred percent know I'm smart enough to read a map.\" Cartography had been her character's total thing in the game. She even knew what cartography was now. She held up a fourth finger. \"Four, why are you being so mean? You broke up with me . If anyone gets to be mad right now, it's me. You're lucky I'm a nice person and haven't been, like, bad-mouthing you like some other girls would if their guy dumped them with no warning.\" Noah full-on sneered at her. An actual honest-to-god sneer. It seemed incongruous on his perfect face. But then, she thought unhappily, she had seen this expression on his face in the past. It just had never been directed at her . Only at the people he considered beneath him. Was that where she stood now? As a less-than-person? She felt her lower lip start to quiver. So much of what she'd done since they began dating two years ago had been to please him, to be attractive to him, to feel the warm glow when he graced her with that smile that reminded her so much of the guy from that superhero movie he'd made her watch but she'd secretly enjoyed. She'd poured so much of her identity into earning that smile. What would she be if they were really over? \"Oh, don't cry , Bethany, really. We both know that's just a ploy to get me to feel sorry for you and take you back. It's not going to work this time.\" \"No, it isn't—Noah, please—\" she started. A locker slammed behind Noah, making them both jump. Suddenly Fridge was there, looming over Noah's shoulder. Noah might be tall, but Fridge was taller, and he was also broader—he took the football workouts seriously, unlike Noah who always did the minimum needed to stay on the team and no more. \"Is he bothering you, Bethany?\" asked Fridge in a mild voice that held just the barest edge of steel. Bethany thought irrationally that she'd never been so happy to see him, especially in his normal football-star body. His puny game body hadn't had a prayer of being intimidating (the name 'Mouse' suited him better than Bethany would ever let on), but as it was, she saw Noah was instantly wary. \"I—um…\" Bethany stumbled. She sniffled a little, then winced at the display of weakness. She didn't want Noah thinking what he said had hurt. \"No. Um, I don't think so.\" \"You sure? You look upset.\" Spencer appeared from behind Fridge and stood next to him. He was shorter than Noah and Fridge, but for the first time Bethany noticed that he wasn't exactly a shrimp. The nerdy, nervous hunch he'd worn before going into Jumanji was gone. While he looked nothing at all like the musclebound Dr. Smolder Bravestone, his character in the game, something subtle about the way he stood with his shoulders back, chin up, and head slightly tilted to the side in a watchful attitude evoked him, at least to Bethany's eyes. Martha stepped out on Fridge's other side. While she was much shorter than any of the boys, her insecure hunch was also gone. Bethany could have sworn she saw the sparkle of Ruby Roundhouse in the cool, almost calculating look Martha was giving Noah. She looked ready to take him one-on-one should he even look at Bethany wrong. Bethany's heart swelled at this. Martha's newfound confidence was, after all, at least in part due to Bethany's training. Though in this case she wasn't about to flirt with Noah. Just kick his ass, Jumanji-style. \"No, guys, I'm fine. Really.\" Noah, for his part, seemed very confused by this sudden unlikely team-up. Spencer and Fridge had been friends a millennia ago; everyone had noticed how well they were suddenly getting along again despite getting on the wrong side of the school's Academic Integrity guidelines, and Spencer and Martha were now an item, but that didn't really explain any of them coming to back up Bethany against her ex. To all appearances, it was none of their business. Except it was. Braving the jungle together had made them a team, and teams didn't leave anyone hanging off a cliff. \"Step off, Noah,\" said Spencer. \"And don't speak to her again unless it's with respect.\" \"And what are you going to do about it, Gilpin?\" asked Noah. \"Beat me with one of your game controllers?\" Spencer just folded his arms and squared his chin. Again, a very Bravestone thing to do. It didn't work as well in this body, but the confidence evoked, along with Fridge and Martha next to him imitating his motions, it made for its own kind of intimidation. Bethany slithered around to join them, folded her own arms, and popped her hip. It never hurt to give things your own stylistic flair. And to remind Noah what was missing by breaking up with her. Noah's eyes darted between all four of them. Confusion warred with anger, but Bethany could see when he chose to back down. \"Whatever, bunch of losers,\" he said. Spinning on his heel, he stalked away. \"Yeah, keep walking,\" Martha called after his retreating back. He started to turn around, thought better of it, and followed her directive. Bethany waited until he was out of earshot before turning to the others. \"You guys,\" she said, half-pleased, half-exasperated. \"You didn't have to do that. Now we're never getting back together.\" \"Why would you want to?\" asked Martha with her usual sardonic bite tinging her voice. She hadn't moved from her crossed-arm position. \"Um, because he's the most gorgeous guy in school and I'm the most gorgeous girl? What about that doesn't scream 'meant for each other'?\" \"Because you deserve better.\" It was Fridge who said this, to Bethany's surprise. \"It was none of my business before, but I didn't know you then other than as Noah's hot girlfriend. Like, I know we saw each other at parties and stuff, but it's not like we talked much. If you'd asked me…before…I would have said you were fine together. But I know him from football, and I know you from…you know.\" His half-shrug somehow managed to encompass running for their lives through the jungle and dodging a motorcycle gang armed with bazookas, among other things. \"You're too good for him.\" \"You're the kind of girl who would give up her life for someone she cared about,\" said Spencer. \"He's totally not. Fridge is right. You deserve better.\" \"But…\" Bethany started. Then she paused. Spencer's words had, of course, reminded her of Alex. She'd given one of her lives to keep him from Game-Overing and dying for real. The others had second-guessed her, but she hadn't even hesitated. And it wasn't just because he—well, his character—was seriously smoking and reminded her of a boy-band singer she'd had a crush on in middle school. He was charming and nice and surprisingly vulnerable and he'd treated her well, even though she wasn't in her own super-hot body and he could have brushed her off as a weird old fat guy who acted like a chick. He deserved the chance to go home as much as any of them. Of course he was totally off limits now, having returned to 1995 to grow up, marry and have kids of his own. He'd named his daughter for her, which was deeply touching to her if not a complete consolation at his loss. They'd shared a real, honest connection. But she thought she knew what the others were getting at: they were hinting she deserved someone like Alex, someone who didn't only like her for her looks. Which, if she was being honest, was the only reason she and Noah had lasted as long as they had. She focused on Martha, Fridge and Spencer again. They all wore variations of the same expression: they'd seen on her face what conclusion she'd come to and were smiling reassuringly. \"Awww, you guys,\" said Bethany, truly touched. Maybe that warm feeling couldn't only be found in a guy's smile: she was getting it again when her three new friends smiled at her now. \"You're totally right. Thanks for being my backup singers. Group hug?\" \"Hell no,\" said Fridge, backing away immediately. \"I ain't hugging any of you.\" \"Not in public,\" said Martha, glancing around. \"Um, I'll pass,\" said Spencer. \"Fine. Be that way.\" Bethany shrugged, tossing her hair. She started down the hall, then turned to look back. \"Well, come on! Don't we have, like, classes and stuff to get to?\" They started after her, and Bethany fell in line. \"So,\" she said. \"What do you do on weekends when you're single?\" \"Read Wollstonecraft and do my homework,\" said Martha. \"Play Halo until three in the morning,\" said Spencer. \"And homework.\" As an afterthought. \"Spend half the day at the gym and the other half sleeping,\" said Fridge. \"Wow. That sounds…awful. Don't any of you know how to have fun ?\" At the blank looks she got, she rolled her eyes. \"That's it. We're going to the mall on Saturday. We'll see a movie, hang out at the food court, browse the stores. Take a couple tasteful selfies. You know. Fun. \" \"Doesn't sound fun to me,\" muttered Martha, but even Bethany could tell the grumble was halfhearted. \"Compared to almost crashing in a helicopter and getting eaten by rhinos, going to the mall for an afternoon should be a piece of cake,\" insisted Bethany. \"Oh god, don't say cake. Anything but cake,\" said Fridge. A beat. Then they all laughed, and scattered to go to their respective classes. Author's Note: I spend most of my time in the Beauty and the Beast fandom but I really enjoyed Welcome to the Jungle and wanted to write a small piece with these characters. Jack Black did a fantastic job playing Bethany without turning her into a caricature and I found it so impressive. So I started to wonder what it might be like for her once back home, having realized there are people who like her for more than just being pretty. But old habits are hard to break sometimes...we all occasionally need a reminder that we deserve to be around people who like us for who we are on the inside. Hope you enjoyed.

Bethany screamed when she saw Alex flying across the field. Then she saw Spencer and Martha run away. The stronger members of the team were on their way to bring back the jewel. - \"Go Martha!\" she yelled, while getting on her feet. Van Pelt almost instantaneously turned away to chase them. Bethany wanted to do something to help. Maybe she could buy them more time. She looked around her to find something she could use to hold the attention of Bravestone's nemesis. She found a kind of roundish piece of tree peel. She grabbed it, then aimed and threw it at the Van Pelt who was going away. The projectile hit the man right in the head. He stumbled et turned round quickly. Bethany took the pose. - \"Yeah yeah, I know. I'm the best at Ultimate Frisbee!\" she perorated with a large smile that vanished almost instantly when she saw the look on the face of their enemy . \"Well, maybe that wasn't a very smart move.\" she told, now grinning. Van Pelt pointed at her. She suddenly felt something by her feet, moving fast around her left leg. She looked down. A large python was trying to climb her calf. In fear, she jumped back trying to escape, but the snake stayed clipped to her leg. - \"Bethany, don't wriggle that much. Don't upset it. Try to move away slowly.\" advised Fridge who was still near the unconscious form of Alex. - \"She cannot escape, you fool. I'm in control of the jungle life.\" said Van Pelt with a dark tone. Trying to stay chill, Bethany tried to do as her friend told, but the large snake was already almost at her hips. Nervously, she moved back 'till she reached a pillar behind her. She blenched at the unexpected contact, and then she screamed when something heavy felt on her shoulders. Before she could even see the snake, she felt the cold scaled skin repting around her neck. She tried to drive it away, but it constricted her faster than she could react. - \"Fridge! What do I do?\" she squeaked terrified. - \"I don't know. He is controlling them.\" replied Fridge, watching the two pythons taking rapidly the advantage over Bethany. He looked at Van Pelt. - \"Stop this. You don't need to kill her. Please. Stop it.\" The dark guy gave him a sinister smirk, before stepping back. Without a word he disappeared in the shadows, by the same path Matha took a moment ago. Next to him, Alex regained consciousness. - \"Fridge?\" he asked. - \"We gotta help Bethany.\" the other replied, helping him to get on his feet. The pilot looked with horror the pythons getting over his friend. The snakes were around her neck and chest. And judging by the face she was making, they had begun to squeeze hard. - \"Bethany...\" Alex said, moving forward. - \"Can't breath…\" she murmured. - \"I know it's hard, but try to hold on. Martha and Spencer will bring back the jewel to the statue and you'll be released.\" the pilot said, trying to look confident. - \"'kay…\" she whispered. He tried to squeeze a hand between two rings of the snakes to make them lessen the pressure but it didn't help. Soon her eyes revulsed and her knees buckled. She went slack against the pillar behind her. Alex and Fridge helped her to the ground. There was nothing more they could do. Alex felt helpless. He took her limp hand in his. - \"God! Her tattoo… it is fading away...That can't be...\" he noticed with emotion. \"Please, hold on. Hold on.\" He wasn't really aware of what happened next. He heard Fridge scream something and then he felt like an energetic pulse hitting him with force. He was engulfed in the light and when the world reappeared in front of him, the sun was brighting strong. Spencer and Martha were miraculously back and smiling. Alex looked down. Bethany was still lying on the ground, although the snakes had disappeared. Her hand was still in his, unmoving. He gently stretched her arm. The tattoo was no more. He let a sob out. - \"What happened?\" asked Martha realising there was a problem. - \"You were just a bit too late… She tried to distract Van Pelt, to give you more time to accomplish the mission. And... she lost.\" sadly replied Fridge. - \"Jumanji, I hate you.\" cried Alex, squeezing Bethany's hand. \"This is not fair… Don't take her life.\" Softly, he put back in place a lock of her hair and he bent over her body to land a kiss on her forehead. All of a sudden, there was a green glow radiating from her. Alex stepped back. Amazed, they all looked at the strange light. Soon, Bethany took a deep and shaky breath and sit back up. - \"What did I missed? Did we win?\" she asked with a tiny voice and an innocent grin. Laughs of joy and relief erupted. They were alive and happy. They did it. They saved Jumanji and on the way they all grew up. Bethany felt good. She smiled openly. Alex threw himself at her, hugging her strongly. - \"Easy, I've been constricted to death by pythons. It's kinda traumatic, you know.\" she said squeezing him back, not really ready to let him go. The laughs doubled. Then, they heard a sound they knew. The sound of a Jeep coming their way. Yes, it was time to go home. I hope you enjoyed it. Bye bye then and have a nice day :).

He remembers that much. He doesn't know whether it was his teacher who introduced him or he introduced himself, but before long just plain 'Tony' soon became 'Tony and Spencer'. He didn't know what love was like at 4 years old, as no one does, but Spencer, with his black curls and big eyes, was the perfect best friend. They did everything together those days, gaming (Spencer always won), trips away (rarely thanks to Spencer's long list of allergies and his custody visits with his dad, but camping in Tony's backyard counted, he guessed), school projects. You name it, Tony and Spencer did it. Until 7th grade that is. Tony didn't mean to hurt Spencer. In fact, if he was honest with himself back then, Tony /never/ wanted to hurt Spencer, but...things just happened that way. It all started at the beginning of 6th grade, if he could really pinpoint an actual time. He'd been playing football since he could walk, so it was no surprise that come a Friday, there was always a game on. Spencer's mom would always bring him after his after school classes to let him watch and cheer him on and then, they would go to Denny's afterwards, whether his team won or lost, to celebrate. It should've been a normal game, but to Tony, it stood out as it was the beginning of the end for his and Spencer's friendship as they knew it. For it ceased to be friendship and turned into something...more. Different. Terrifying. Tony should have been concentrating on the game, that what he'd told himself, but Spencer's eyes and red cheeks as well as his jumping up and down in excitement distracted him more than usual today. Soon enough, even after that football game, his presence alone was enough to make Tony shy, different, his heart racing every time Spencer came over or was with him. Almost as if he was...falling in love with him. Now, by this time in their lives, Tony had amassed a pretty substantial line of long forgotten ex-girlfriends, so he had a pretty clear feeling of what love, or at least it's barest form, was like. He refused outright for a long time to believe that he felt the same with Spencer. Yet he knew it was true. He couldn't deal with it, this new development in their lives. He wouldn't have minded something else, a new friend or son, as him and Spencer could work around that, but gay? No. His father was long gone, his mother was a church goer. He read and studied the Bible like it was a football strategy and went to church on Sundays, singing for Grace and the Lord himself. He couldn't by gay. He just...couldn't. Scared, panicked and upset, Tony finally stopped being friends with Spencer, thinking that maybe, maybe if he hoped hard enough, the feelings would go away, like they should. Except they didn't. By the time Tony was now 'Fridge' and Spencer had fallen down the ladder to become 'Werid Kid', the feelings (now well hidden) were still there. Still brewing under the skin. Burning and buzzing and making it hard for Fridge to keep his cool, on and off the football field. He knew it had been a bad idea to rope Spencer into doing his homework for him from the start, but if it gave him a chance to see him where he didn't look like he was lovesick, it was worth it. He hated what he had to do to him to hide the truth, but if Brantford found out that one of the senior stars of their local high school football team was gay...small towns do what small towns do. He will well admit that when the plan fell to pieces, he had hated Spencer for it, but really only had himself to blame. He had used his heart instead of his head for once and had paid the price. Finding Jumanji however, turned out to be both his waking nightmare and of course, his saving grace. Funny how a stupid game can cause so much shit to come to the surface. He hadn't honestly mean to get most of his stuff out, but come perhaps the second? third? day being stuck inside Franklin \"Mouse\" Finbar's body, Spencer (in his /giant/ and Greek god looking body) got cocky. If there was one thing Fridge /really/ didn't like about this new version of Spencer, it was how big balled he had seemed to become overnight. Putting him in his place hadn't worked much (considering he had just come back straight after and /slapped/ him into a rock wall), but eventually, he found out on his own when Spencer succeeded in saving them and they become even. More than even. Those feeling he hidden for so long were coming back again...and he didn't feel like stopping them this time like before. He allowed himself to settle in them instead, considering it was the only time he could. From afar of course, as he didn't want to freak him out too much. Thankfully, or maybe even not thankfully, it seemed the rest had either been oblivious or even just not asked, with the exception of Alex of course, when they located him. Fridge never thought the question \"So you and Spencer...are you guys...?\" could produce such a response out of drunken him (mostly stumbling over words and nervous laughing) before he finally straightened out. \"Uh, no. No. No. Spencer doesn't...he's not like that. Neither am I. He likes Martha, I think.\" He hated those words. 'He likes Martha, I think.' There was no question he did, of course, it was obvious that Spencer had liked Martha. Spencer had liked her since 7th grade, he had taken that information to heart when it made the rounds of the local student gossip chain. He hated it and he hated them. Until the night they stopped the curse at least. That night, or really, early afternoon, Fridge bumped into Spencer as he went to fill the team's canteens from the fresh water spring turned lake nearby...everything went to hell and back after that. Fridge had just been minding his own business, looking though his backpack when Spencer had appeared in front of him, startling him. \"Jesus Christ, man. What the hell you doing!?\" \"Sorry, sorry.\" Spencer, or really Dr. Smolder Bravestone, smiled awkwardly. \"I was just uh-\" He pulled up several canteens by his side. \"-filling these up.\" \"Cool.\" \"Yeah.\" Fridge just shook his head at Spencer's usual wordlessness, pocketing the stone and of course, that strange ass boomerang back into his backpack, before Spencer spoke again. \"I, uh-actually, I'm really glad you're here.\" Fridge had to look up again, standing when he happened to be seeing something different in Spencer's eyes. Well, they really /weren't/ Spencer's eyes, but you get the idea. \"I have something to tell you-\" Spencer started, looking nervous to the other male despite his character supposedly being more than enough brave to make Spencer speak. \"-and I want to tell you now, just in case the next time that-that we talk, if we talk again, I'm no longer brave.\" \"Okay…\" Fridge said lowly, heart suddenly racing again and hands becoming sweaty, stomach flip flopping a bit as he waited. \"I like you, Tony.\" Spencer mumbled, biting his, Bravestone's, lip. He did not just...he /did not/ just say that. Hell no. No. He said… \"What?\" Fridge said dumbly, but it seemed Spencer wasn't finished. Or rambling. \"I like, /like/ like you. Like, I'm /fully/ into you.\" \"...You are?\" Fridge murmured a little nervously, entire body shaking as he tried to process what was happening in front of him. \"I am-\" Spencer confirmed rather confidently, shakily. Just like him. \"- and I have been, since, like, the 5th grade.\" The fuck?! \"Really?\" Fridge asked with doubt, biting his lip. When had Spencer gotten closer to him? Spencer just nodded nervously, both of them standing there nervous before Spencer made to leave, Fridge's hand suddenly stopping him and closing around his wrist tightly. \"Sorry, this has just...never happened before.\" Fridge felt like he couldn't breathe. \"I...I can't believe I'm doing this and-\" Should he really do this? Ruin everything here, in a fucking jungle in some other guy's body? \"-I...I know I'm going to hell, but man...I like you too, Spencer.\" \"What?\" Spencer stood there in the same position as he had been before when Spencer had admitted the same, it was almost fitting. \"Yeah.\" Fridge nodded, swallowing hard. \"Yes, Spencer. I like you too.\" Spencer, dumbstruck, blinked before he gestured wildly to his body. \"Are you sure it's not because of the, you know, like /all/ of-\" \"What? Woah, no, no, hell no. No.\" Fridge had to laugh a little. Typical Spencer. \"That is...no, it's not how you look, man. To be honest, I liked me better when I was with the old you.\" \"R-Really?\" Spencer asked, seeming excited. If Fridge's smile got bigger, he barely noticed it. The moment seemed to swell and the noise in the jungle seemed to fade away and become quiet the closer and closer he and Spencer became...well, until the moment was ruined by Spencer opening his mouth and licking his face. Clearly, he didn't know how this was done. They would have possible gotten in another try, if it wasn't for Bethany, stuck in Professor Sheldon \"Shelly\" Oberon's body, informed them quickly of Alex's discovery about the statue. Just like that, the moment was over. Over and unable to be taken again. They had to focus on the game, as well as each other's survival. His heart had to come last once again. When he got back home, restored to 6 foot and after seeing Alex happy, in a family, safe and unharmed by the jungle just like them, Fridge got to thinking. It took the weekend, but he finally made his decision. It was time that Anthony 'Fridge' Johnson paid the piper in full for his mistakes. \"So-\" Bethany was by his side, Martha as well as they walked into school together. \"Did you guys talked to Spencer?\" \"Oh, I was texting him this weekend.\" Martha nodded shyly, looking up. \"Have you talked to him?\" Fridge bit his lip, going to reply 'No.' when Bethany's voice stopped him. \"There he is.\" He stopped in his tracks, seeing Spencer in his hoodie and jeans, backpack weighing down his shoulders in the crowds of their fellow students coming up the path. He barely heard the words \"Go get that guy, Mouse.\" before he was moving, catching up with Spencer as he had stopped in the middle of the path when he saw him. \"Hi.\" Fridge smiled nervously down at his, well what was he? What was Spencer now? Friend? Former best friend? More? \"Hi.\" Spencer responded back, shy self back to completely normal after Bravestone. \"Yeah, uh, so I really wanted to call you man-\" \"No, no, I get it, I mean, you're trying to work your way back onto the team and all-\" \"Yeah, sorry, but still. I should have-\" \"It's just weird, you know, not knowing if you're okay or anything, what's going on-\" Fridge had to interrupt the start of the rambling banter with a loud laugh at just how awkward they were both acting, making Spencer look curiously up at him. \"What?\" Spencer soon found out as Fridge lent down and in front of everyone, kissed him. It was better, more proper than Spencer had done and the moment they had wanted earlier was back again, stronger than the last time and it was so quiet as they just stood there, Spencer on Fridge's feet as they made out in front of their small town school, ignoring the gasps of shock and horror as wella s Bethany and Martha's more positive reactions...till they heard it. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Boom, boom, boom, boom. One bowling bowl later, history was...well, history. Oh, as for Fridge and Spencer, well, I think you mean Tony and Spencer. That has a nice ring to it, I think. ","Summary":" It was Summer, when they first met. He remembers that much. He doesn't know whether it was his teac"},{"Movie":"Red","Title":"Operation Stir Fry","Author":"Remember December","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7510995","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Taylor lay underneath her motorcycle, a small allen wrench in hand. Her brakes had seemed a bit off lately and she was attempting to fix the problem. Her twin sister Sarah was lounging on the garage couch, flipping through a a bird owners magazine. A radio played quietly in the background. \"Hey, could you give me the specs again?\" she called, turning the wrench firmly. Sarah sighed softly and got off the couch. She turned to the multitude of manuals and blueprints spread across half the garage's wall-length projects table. \"You want European or American standard?\" Taylor hissed slightly as thick smelly blue fluid dripped onto her cheek. \"Make it European. American won't cut it for the races this week.\" Sarah frowned at that as her eyes quickly absorbed lines of tiny print. \"I thought Dad said absolutely not. You're still on probation from the last time.\" Taylor rolled her eyes. \"A li'l scratch like that? He didn't even pay for it! I did!\" \"No, you didn't. Melissa did.\" Sarah neglected to mention that sliding fifty feet on after-light-rain-oil-slick concrete after a vicious shove from a less scrupulous rider that had resulted in the bike being nearly totaled and Taylor walking funny for weeks, would hardly be considered a lil scratch. It was a rather touchy subject for the whole family. Taylor slid out from under the bike on her trolley to glare at her sister. \"Out of my funds.\" \"Yeah, but her and Veronika manage the money that Mr. Cooper gives us. And don't change the subject. Dad still said no and I am so not covering for you this time.\" She found the info and quickly read it off. \"Some sister you are,\" Taylor mumbled to herself, measuring the brake fluid carefully. She poured it in and looked up to see Sarah glaring at her. Sometimes it slipped her mind how annoying it was to have a family who all read lips. The hurt in those liquid brown eyes made her heart twinge in her chest. But she wouldn't apologize. If Sarah lived to act, Taylor lived to race...and there was nothing they could do to change that. \"Brace yourselves.\" They whipped their heads to see Lidia finish coming down the stairs, an irritated expression on her face. Then again, she almost always looked irritated. \"What's up?\" Sarah asked. Lidia deigned not to answer and instead pointed at the stairs. They heard the fuss before they figured it out. \"-THE MOST RIDICULOUS, SHAMEFUL, ABSOLUTELY WANTON DISPLAY OF DISCOURTESY IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!\" Taylor and Sarah both winced. Melissa was on a rampage. Lidia flopped down on the couch and began disinterestedly flipping through a tween gossip magazine. The door at the top of the stairs slammed as two people trotted down to the garage. \"It vas very funny, Meh-lissah. I do noht see the problem,\" Veronika said as she descended the stairs, blue-green eyes pratically dancing in amusement. Melissa followed half a step behind was fuming, face white with suppressed rage making her freckles stand out that much more. \"AND YOU!\" She pointed at Lidia, who looked at her evenly, no sign of fear in her sharp emerald eyes. \"YOU!\" Melissa marched over to Lidia, leaning down until they were practically nose to nose. \"I know , this was your idea! I just know it!\" She hissed. Lidia rolled her eyes and crossed her arms. \"Dat is a good point,\" Veronika said, grabbing one of the overstuffed chairs. \"SHE DIDN'T EVEN SAY ANYTHING!\" Melissa exploded, whirling around to glare at Veronika. \"AND DON'T YOU EVEN TRY TO SAY THAT SHE DID! I HAVE PROOF THIS TIME!\" Lidia's face suddenly went white behind her and others looked on interestedly. Melissa whirled around to begin ranting at Lidia in rapid-fire Russian. \"So, mind tellin' me what's got her gears grindin'?\" Taylor walked slowly over to Veronika, trying to remain inconspicuous to the miniature whirlwind of rage in front of them. \"You haf blue on your cheek.\" Veronika wiped at her own in imitation. Sarah handed Taylor a rag absently. \"I haven't seen her this mad since the French Embassy Incident. What'd Lidia do ?\" \"Frohm vat I understand, Mehlissa is upset because of the rahder fetching flowers she was given dis morning,\" Veronika said nonchalantly, focusing curiously on Lidia's shrinking and uncomfortable figure. Finally it seemed as if she was beginning to wind down. Melissa demanded something of Lidia which made Veronika choke and sputter out something in shock. Melissa turned to glare at her and they began their own rapid fire exchange. Sarah and Taylor exchanged a weary look. \"Think we should invest in some lessons?\" Taylor asked glumly, not even attempting to follow along. She pulled her red-brown hair into slightly neater ponytail. \"Probably,\"Sarah said, \"Looks like Lidia really did do it this time. She hasn't glared, rolled her eyes, or done that funny little hum thing-y.\" Veronika shook her head in disbelief- or maybe amazement- and leaned back in her chair, content to have Melissa continue ranting. Sarah took the opportunity to plop down in front of her, giving her a puppy-dog look. Veronika chuckled and sat back up. \"Sit up straight,\" she commanded and Sarah happily complied. She began neatly and gently braiding Sarah's thick auburn curls. She glanced over at Taylor, who had returned to looking through one of the manuals. \"So, I see you haf decided to enter the races dis veek. Haf you told Mehlissah?\" \"Told me what?\" Melissa snapped sharply apparently done berating Lidia. She paced over to the far side of the room, still irritated but slightly calmer. \"That Taylor has once again flown in the face of reason and decided to put her life in mortal peril for the sake of avenging her wronged reputation in a highly dangerous, underground - and might I add- incredibly illegal motorcycle race this weekend at 11 pm? Why, no, I don't think she did.\" Melissa leveled a sharp glare at Taylor, grey eyes icy with disappointment. \"And can you imagine my surprise when I received an email from the scum who run the race with one of your alliases on it? Luckily for you, I managed to delete your name off the list.\" Taylor gasped, a sharp stab of betrayal ripping through her chest. She opened her mouth to start screaming at her - \"OH, don't even start with me!\" Melissa spat. She twisted her wavy red hair back into a bun, clipping it in place. \"It just might have escaped your notice, considering you were travelling at upwards of 90 miles per hour when it happened, but that little love-tap was actually meant to kill you, you stupid girl.\" Everyone froze. Melissa smirked, crossing her arms. \"Well, now that I've got your attention.\" She walked over to the projects table, grabbing a remote off of it. She pushed a few buttons and a flat screen TV appeared where the huge poster of Elvis had been. Documents and files were spread across the screen. Lidia stopped trying to immesh herself into the couch cushions and walked over to stand next to her, an interested and intense expression on her normally bored face. Veronika continued her interrupted braiding, tugging on it to remind Sarah not to move. \"You managed to get under the thin skin of the resident drug lord of our beloved inner-city and even better! He's courting with one of the local Triad operations.\" Her cheeriness was undermined by the incredibly irritated look on her face. \"Damned Asians,\" Melissa grumbled to herself, \"never know when when to quit.\" \"But, moving on!\" A sour, sick looking ratman appeared on the screen, next to a Jackie Chan wannabe and a slick looking, mean street-walker with blue streaked hair, who looked like something straight off the roughest streets in Tokyo. \"On your left, Din Jei Wan. Ratface here is the one in charge of these splendid little races our beloved idiot is so very fond of.\" She paused to glare at Taylor again. \"He reports to our next charming specimen, Jei Xian Wan, inner-city drug lord and thorn in Customs' side. He's been the most successful drugs runner we've had in quite awhile and unfortunately it doesn't look like that's going to change anytime soon.\" She paused to glare at the screen. \"We've had forty overdoses in the past two months because of this bastard.\" Veronika raised an eyebrow at that. Melissa was not overly fond of cussing. Though given the subject was drugs, it wasn't too hard to imagine why. \"What's he deal?\" Lidia asked, speaking for the second time that day. \"He's an alphabet dealer, ladies, although he specializes in opium and heroin.\" Veronika gave a small 'tch' of disgust. Alphabet meant that they sold anything and everything they could get their hands on, which made them very difficult to track down. \"And who's the candy-head?\" Sarah asked, standing up now that her hair was done, Veronika doing the same. \"Now that is where it gets interesting. Taylor here might know him as Blue Helmet, and yes that is his racing alias. Very creative, isn't it?\" They all shared a snicker. \"Ratface here isn't exactly keen on real names as I'm sure Taylor could tell you.\" \"Would you stop that! I'm sorry, okay?\" Taylor protested, throwing a rag at her in exasperation. Melissa caught it neatly and continued, a slight smirk playing about her lips. \"But his actual name is Toshiro Watakari. Quite a character, even by our standards.\" Lidia and Veronika shared a look, as did Taylor and Sarah. \"Oh?\" Veronika prompted. A list of qualifications popped up on the screen and Sarah gave a low whistle. \"Born in Japan, specialist in armed and unarmed combat- no surprise there-, three counts of aggravated assault in the last month, formerly of the Australian Special forces...what is this guy?\" \"A jack-of-all-trades. You need a job done and for the right price, he just might do it. He's not like our typical mercenaries, he only does what he wants. Somehow he's come by a lot of money, legally too.\" She frowned deeply muttering to herself, \"Believe me, that was the first thing I checked.\" \"So he's an adrenalin junkie,\" Lidia said, looking at the screen still. \"Precisely.\" Melissa pulled up a few video clips. \"Here's the footage I managed to capture off our local traffic camera's. Whoever Wan decided to hire for his tech support is just plain lousy. They had so many gaps in their security it could've doubled as a cheese grater.\" Sarah gave a giggle at that, Taylor grinned and Veronika's lips twitched as Lidia rolled her eyes. They watched through a montage of clips as a two modified bikes crossed an intersection. The one in the lead was Taylor's red Toyota followed closely by an electric blue Yamaha. As the two bikes raced through, both whipping left to follow the course the group saw the blue rider wrench his bike to a dangerously low angle, whipping his right leg up to kick at her and allow the tailend of his bike to bump Taylor without crushing it. They saw him pull out of the drifted turn and zip off down the course. They saw Taylor fight to dodge him and then regain control of her bike but to no avail. She spun out and flew off to slide about fifty feet, her bike sliding in the opposite direction. The collective silence of the room wasn't broken for a few minutes. Sarah gripped her sister's hand tightly as Veronika clasped her shoulder. Lidia looked slightly green and Melissa's resigned face didn't help much. Melissa broke the silence first. \"But that's precisely why I think it's time we took a closer look at why Mr. Watakari is here.\" There was a second stunned silence for the evening as everyone looked at her in disbelief. Veronika was the first to recover. \"Vat exactly ahre you prohpohsing?\" she asked slowly, locking eyes with Melissa. \"If Watakari had meant to kill Taylor he would have. Watch this.\" A new video clip popped up. It was from a cell phone and had horrible quality. It was a rather blurry view of Taylor's bike, with excited commentary in a foreign language. The tone was excited, with pauses and commentary from another voice in the same language. Then someone else appeared on the screen by her bike, someone in black and white street clothes. They lingered by her bike a bit and the two voices' tones began to change. The first one shouted something and cut it short as an unmistakeable electric blue leather suit appeared on the screen and scared the other person away. \"Thank you for your assistance. You may go.\" The brilliantly clear English broke through the fuzzy audio and the video stopped. \"I don't get it,\" Taylor said looking at Sarah who shrugged. \"Vat language vas that?\" Veronika asked, toying with a small piece of her platinum blonde hair, braiding and rebraiding it. \"Spanish?\" Sarah ventured. Melissa grinned. \"Close, but not quite.\" Lidia raised an eyebrow impatiently. \"It's Portuguese, but that is not the truly important part. It's what our darling Mr. Kimawari said. 'Thank you for your assistance'? It got me to thinking. Why on earth would he be thanking them? All they did was compliment the bikes and get the attention of the mystery person hanging around your bike...wasn't it? And then it hit me. I was not looking close enough.\" The screen files rearranged themselves again, some disappearing others popping up in ther place. Now there was a series of still frames, like parts of a photo shoot. It showed a skinny black teen with something clenched in his left hand. The next picture showed him crouched next to Taylor's bike, putting something on it. The next pic showed Kimawari grabbing the teen. The teen was gone in the next but Kimawari was crouched where he had been. \"I had to fight the system to give me this much. Whoever decided to go back and try to wipe the footage clearly knew what they were doing, which I must admit, is highly suspicious. I'm very much inclined to think that someone not hired by Ratface went back and attempted to erase it completely. But after abour four hours of doctoring, we have the following series of stills.\" \"Zoom in on what wannabe gangsta's got in his hand,\" Sarah commanded. Veronika frowned. \"That looks like a patch,\" she muttered, tilting her head for a better look. \"Oh my god,\" Taylor breathed, \"he saved my life! That's a homemade incendiary patch complete with cellphone relay and roughly 200 grams of C4!\" Melissa grinned smugly. \"Precisely what I thought.\" Lidia hummed softly to herself. \"He's being handled,\" she stated. Melissa shrugged. \"Perhaps, but that certainly doesn't tell us by whom, for what purpose or what the end game objective is. I'm proposing we find out.\" Veronika smirked. \"He looks like he vould be an excellent contact. I agree vith Melissa. It is time ve found out vhy Kimawari's here. However, I feel it vould be in our best interest to handle this-\" \"Discreetly?\" Sarah suggested. Veronika nodded sharply in confirmation. \"One problem, y'all.\" Taylor broke into their happy plotting. \"The souless ginger over there took me outta the race! How're we suppposed ta get close to him if I can't race?\" Melissa scowled at her. \"Souless ginger, indeed! If we were to assess status based on appearance, then you would be a member of the Blue Man group!\" She stuck her tongue out at her. \"Enough,\" Veronika warned. \"Hmmph. Before I was so rudely insulted, I was going to say that although I may have taken Taylor's alias off, I put her in the race again as Grace Wilson's twin sister. Identical twin, might I add,\" Melissa tossed her head and pointedly looked in a different direction than Taylor. \"I thought we would agree to see if he would become a contact so I went ahead and finished your registration.\" Taylor's cheeks flushed with a strange mixture of rage and thanks. She turned away uncomfortably. \"Uh, we got one more problem, guys,\" Sarah said, looking at all of them. \"There's no way Dad's gonna go for this. He's practically forbidden Taylor from ever going racing again.\" Lidia snorted and held up her cellphone. Melissa glared at Lidia unhappily and Sarah and Taylor's faces split into identical grins. However, now it was Veronika's turn to frown. \"Perhaps, it is just me, but I vish to know how you are invovled in all of this,\" she said pointedly to Melissa frowning. Melissa raised an eyebrow at her. \"I find it curious as to how only now , once we've decided upon everything, do you think to question the situation.\" Veronika's scowl deepened. Melissa flicked her fingers at her playfully. \"San Diego contacted me with a job a few months back. Said I might be interested in making a few dollars on the side and getting some information on the new slime in town. I accepted and now manage quite a bit of the cities betting for an exorbitant fee, of course.\" \"Of course,\" Veronika echoed dryly. \"Garuanteed payment and no chance to be openly cheated, every swindler's dream.\" She gave the room a wry expression. \"What? You thought they'd let teenagers legally manage thousands of dollars?\" She scoffed. \"I thought San Diego was outta comission,\" Sarah said, suspicion lacing her voice. Melissa shrugged nonchalantly. \"Mr. Cooper has them run the odd job every once in a while. San Diego seems to have a fondness for me, is all.\" Now everyone was glaring at her. San Diego was code for a team of contacts in California. They had been officially retired by the girls after a nasty incident with international shipping that Melissa had played a large part in. They had all just barely made it out of there alive and Melissa had refused point blank to tell them anything on why she had decided to go rogue during their time there. Everyone had their suspicions but no one had been able to verify them yet. Now this wasn't to say that they trusted her any less, but it did mean that something major was going on and they weren't being clued in. There's nothing a well-trained agent hates more than to be kept in the dark. \"Enough,\" Lidia said. \"What's your plan?\" Melissa stiffened slightly. \"I'm not talking to you at the moment. But in case anyone else was wondering, here's what I had in mind...\" TO BE CONTINUED[Chapter 2] Veronika was always faintly amused when the group gathered together. Whether it was plotting out a mission, exchanging information, tutoring each other for school or in practical skills like shooting and lock-picking, or simply to hang out and watch cheesy movies. The group had a rightness that felt similar to a military unit at the top of their game; a friendship borne of trust and extreme situations when your life was on the line. When one was gone, the others felt it sorely. She mused that she much prefered this sort of circle than the Family over which her parents ruled. Being the daughter of Tsar Ivan had its advantages of course, but there was a certain edge and definite lack of brutality that this gathering lacked. It was much nicer, but Veronika knew she would forever walk the line between her Comrades and her friends. They all would. She watched Melissa out of the corner of her eye. There was something much bigger going on between her and Lidia than a simple bouquet. She had been there when it had happened. 12:47 Third Period Earlier that Day Veronika wasn't particularly bothered by Tuesdays, or any day of the week really. It was only that on Tuesdays the school required that she meet with a college advisory for fifteen minutes at the end of second period. She shifted slightly in the purple plastic chair, mentally reviewing the Gilded Age and it's importance in American history. Her counselor, Mr. Thatch, was helping someone else at the moment. The basketball player lounging behind the aide's desk to her left, kept checking her out and it was beginning to get on her nerves. Lidia was an aide this period and typically they chatted or played Sticks to pass the time, but today she was out on an errand. Veronika idly contemplated shooting him with her watch air-pellet gun. It would be a lovely distraction, but she was sure Lidia would find out and that would mean losing her watch under contract breach. He looked her up and down again and waggled his eyebrows. Her fingers twitched over her watch. One more time, I swear, one more time and- \"-I'm going to scream!\" yelled a familiar voice. Impeccable timing, as usual, she thought with sour humor. As these things usually go, she was interrupted by an uncanny bit of comedic timing that only one person would ever be able to pull off. Melissa stormed through the small hallway that connected the main office to the counselors' offices and the nurse's office. She was cradling a rather beautiful bouquet of flowers to her chest and looked murderous. Her towering rage was momentarily sidetracked at finding the Russian sitting there. \"Afternoon,\" she snapped, glaring at the flowers in her arms. \"Please tell me that you had nothing to do with this.\" Veronika raised an eyebrow eloquently. The basketball player behind the desk looked on interestedly, leaning forward over the desk to take a better look at Melissa. He leered at her suggestively and Veronika sent up a brief prayer for his soul. Ten seconds later the jock was on the floor clutching his stomach and Melissa was glowering over him. \"Do it again, I DARE you!\" she hissed. \"That is enough,\" Veronika said quietly, too amused to put any threat in the words. A dramatic sigh was heard from the doorway. Veronika turned to see Lidia, leaning against the door frame and glaring at Melissa. She caught a fleeting look of satisfaction cross Lidia's face when she saw the bouquet in Melissa's arms. Then again, it might just have been a trick of the light. \"Now I have to listen to him complain for the next week. Thanks,\" she said dryly. Melissa turned ever so slowly to look at Lidia and even Veronika wanted to take a step back. \"YOU.\" The malice and blood-lust compacted into that one word should've been Lidia's specialty. Lidia raised both eyebrows, took a step back and then gave Veronika a curious look. She shrugged in return. It was most likely something to do with a boy or an internet stalker or something mundane like joyriding. \"You did this,\" Melissa said quietly, an odd expression on her face. \"I want you to know that you did this. Whatever happens next, it is all on you, Lidia Anne Cooper. You.\" She held up the bouquet, glaring fiercely into Lidia's ice blue eyes. A thick rope of uneasiness snaked it's way into Veronika's stomach. This wasn't right. Melissa was loud, annoying, arrogant, oddly proper in her speech, melodramatic, paranoid, extremely talented and completely irreplaceable. But rarely ever was she serious. Lidia's expression shut itself down into a completely unreadable mask at that and Melissa swept out the door, not bothering to say goodbye. Veronika had frowned then and she had frowned at the earlier rant on privacy. It appeared Lidia had overstepped herself and done something on one of Melissa's highly important computers. Both of them were aware enough to never breach the subject while arguing in Russian, but judging by the way Melissa was carrying on, this was something very, very big. And something she didn't want the twins to hear, either, which in itself might be the strangest thing. It sorely puzzled her. She couldn't imagine any reason that Lidia would have had to do something to Melissa's gear without asking. Sure, Lidia had been particularly furious about Operation Humble Saint (the unfortunate mishap in San Diego) much like her father, but surely it hadn't triggered this. But then again, the group still wasn't exactly sure what had happened at San Diego. And now this utterly ridiculous behavior of ignoring Lidia, who didn't say much to begin with. None of the pieces fit, none of the clues were right. Veronika decided that it was time to contact her Comrades and see if they had any information to share. Given the rather glorious explosion that had followed their escape, she could safely bank on the fact that they would. Russians loved a good fire show, after all. She broke herself out of her thoughts and continued to look over Melissa's compiled information on the scum they would be dealing with this time. Taylor and Sarah had maps spread out all over the floor and were arguing over the possible routes for this weekend's race and where they would all need to be. Her ears caught the sound of the door at the top of the stairs opening and closing. Her sister Elizabeth walked into the garage, holding up a hand in greeting. \"What are you lazy blokes about now? Did we receive a mission?\" Her British accent fell crisply into the air and broke Lidia's silence neatly. \"Melissa's op. She'll fill you in.\" Lidia said looking up from her files, a tinge of disapproval in her voice. Elizabeth rolled her eyes. \"I had a Robotics meeting to attend after school today, seeing as I am President and everything.\" She looked around and noticed Melissa's unhappiness. \"I miss something?\" Taylor and Sarah surfaced from their papers grinning wickedly. \"Something?\" Taylor asked innocently. \"What thing?\" Sarah asked matching her sister's tone. \"That thing?\" \"My thing?\" \"Your thing?\" \"Which thing?\" \"This thing?\" \"One thing?\" \"This thing between us?\" \"Nothing!\" Elizabeth growled as the twins burst out into laughter, \"Forget I said anything!\" Now they were howling in laughter and Melissa was too. \"You walked into that one,\" Veronika teased her sister. \"Yeah, yeah, whatever.\" She walked over to Melissa and looked down at her apprehensively. \"You're not going to bite my head off are you?\" \"No,\" Melissa said, frowning up at her. \"She already bit mine off,\" Lidia muttered causing the twins and Veronika to chuckle. Melissa flushed a brilliant cherry but didn't respond. Elizabeth adopted a surprised expression but refrained from making a comment at Melissa's dark look. \"Let's get to work then, shall we?\" Elizabeth said cheerily, but not one of them missed the underlying nervousness of her tone. Melissa rolled her neck. \"I'm in a bad mood, Elizaveta. So listen up and pay attention because I will NOT be repeating myself. Understand?\" She said in her flawless Muscovite Russian. Then without waiting for an answer she launched into a super condensed, almost too fast recap of what they'd gone over earlier...in Russian of course. Finished speaking, Melissa turned to Elizabeth. \"Too much eyeshadow today, Dove. Is he treating you right?\" The whole group went into an uproar at that and Elizabeth's face lost of it's natural color. \"Say WHAT?\" -Taylor \"Pinch me, I'm dreaming!\" -Sarah \"He who?\" - Lidia Unintelligible English and outraged Russian from Veronika. \"You forgot to tell them, didn't you?\" Melissa muttered in her ear. She nodded minutely. \"Well then, I handle this for you, you owe me a favor. Deal?\" \"Deal!\" Melissa grinned at that. \"Too easy,\" she said, looking at her hands. She pulled her MPMPR (mulit-purpose multi-program remote) out of her pocket and pressed a few buttons in quick succession and suddenly It's a Small World After All was crescendo-ing through the room. It had the desired effect of knocking everyone temporarily slack-jawed. Another button and the resulting silence further shocked them. \"It's seems that as usual, you have misunderstood me. Brian was practicing his make-up skills and Dove here agreed to be his guinea pig. Now, if you're all done causing a fuss, we've got work to do.\" The two turned their backs on the others and set to analyzing the video, running it through multiple programs chatting comfortably about resolution and image quality. The others glared at Melissa, just about fed up with her antics, but eventually got back to work. An hour later everyone was ready to head home. \"Homework sound-off,\" Lidia ordered. \"Finish puttin' together the disguises me 'n Taylor'll be usin',\" Sarah said. \"Finish the layout of the city rooftops,\" Veronika said, holding up a roll of paper. \"Modify our camera's and test them out,\" Elizabeth said, stuffing wires and tools back into her backpack. \"Track down Kimawari's finances and monitor the betting as the race approaches, see if I can't manipulate the odds and track down some of Wan's shipments,\" Melissa said, typing something into her phone. \"Permission, or at least a window to work in,\" Lidia stated. \"Finish modifications on my bike,\" Taylor said with a grin. \"Ladies, start your engines!\"[Chapter 3] The week passed quickly for the group. Between schoolwork, extracurricular activites and prepping for the mission, the girls saw very little of each other, maybe a quick question in the hallways or a texts here and there. The faster the weekend approached the more impatient they all became. Everyone except Elizabeth. The youngest of the girls, she sometimes felt left out. The others were seniors about to leave for college and were selected for more missions than she was. She had been a bit resentful in the beginning to be perfectly frank. She loved the feeling of actually doing something, of going beyond the norm in such a spectacular fashion. She loved the fights and the adrenalin and even the little nicks and bruises after a successful mission, even the long and often monotonous planning. But Lidia and Veronika had banded together to keep her on a tight leash. They said she was too reckless sometimes and occassionally even the twins agreed. The only one in the group amused by her antics and willing to be brutally honest was Melissa. Sensing a kindred mind, she had pulled her aside one day and asked her to disarm a few bombs. Elizabeth tried her best but had failed to disarm two and afterwards Melissa had unofficially taken her on as an apprentice of sorts. It had been a godsend. Elizabeth was always torn between being disturbed and awed by the sheer amount of technical genius Melissa had. Bombs, hacking, robots, cameras, photography, pattern identification, symbolism in flowers, clothes, paintings even jewelry, multiple languages and behavorial tags and patterns. She was a terrifying powerhouse of memory akin to one of her supercomputers. The others sensed it, but Elizabeth was privy to all this and expected to learn it. Melissa was harsh and strict, the kind of teacher who you wouldn't dare to question or lie to. She pushed and pushed and pushed with quizzes, tests, examples and projects. Failure was an option, but repeated failure was not. And Elizabeth loved it. The sort of responsibility she craved, Melissa gave and gave freely with the full consequences on her wallet, her time and her self-esteem. But she wouldn't change it for anything. And that was why she was so worried as she and her sister drove to Lidia's house to meet up before the mission. Melissa had been acting strangely lately and her sister telling her about the flowers only confirmed it. Elizabeth knew that Melissa had a lot more secrets than she let on, especially considering she managed their finances so spectacularly well and she was the resident information specialist. But never before had she felt that something sinister was going on. \"What's on your mind, Polina?\" Veronika asked quietly, breaking the silence. Elizabeth wrinkled her nose at the nickname. \"Must you call me that?\" \"Absolutely. Now, answer the question.\" She sighed. \"It's nothing. I've got a bad feeling about tonight is all.\" \"Why?\" \"I think Melissa's up to something.\" \"She's always up to something, Dove.\" Elizabeth glared at her. \"Why don't you like her?\" Veronika's hands tightened ever so slightly on the steering wheel. \"I never said that.\" \"Then what, you've just developed a 'distaste' for her?\" \"No. She's unpredictable. And in our work, that's the same thing as untrustworthy.\" She scoffed. \"Hardly! If any of you would get to know her-\" \"How exactly?\" Veronika demanded sharply, giving her sister a venomous look. \"Perhaps, if you'd get over the idea of her being your teacher, then you'd notice a few key things. For example, for someone who's always talking, how is it she never talks about herself?\" \"She does, she-\" \"Says things about other people that involve her. Think about it, Polina. When have you ever heard her talk about her dreams or nightmares or hopes? Even Lidia has.\" Elizabeth gave her a skeptical look. \"I said once.\" The skepticism deepened. \"It was a stakeout.\" Her face was stuck in permanent disbelief. \"No one else was there.\" Elizabeth rolled her eyes. \"Of course, the selective mute strikes again.\" Veronika slapped her upside her head. \"Enough of that. If I wanted Melissa, I would speak to her. I'm talking to my sister.\" She glowered but didn't respond, rubbing her skull. She settled back into her seat, looking moodily out the window. She had expected as much. Her sister was grand, but sometimes she could be so incredibly dense. She had asked Sarah once why Veronika and Lidia didn't like Melissa. Sarah had shaken her head. \"Oh no, Doll, you've got it all wrong. Lidia and Veronika like Melissa. Like her a whole lot. It's just Melissa's kinda...strange, to their way of thinking at least.\" Sarah had tucked away her homework temporarily to explain better. \"Melissa ain't very practical. She's got a great memory and is the best at what she does, but she's a liability.\" Sarah held listed things off on her fingers.\" She can't fight, her aim is iffy and she's distracted in tense situations. She belongs on the sidelines, you see. The others just gotta be on the front lines, or else they don't feel right and good about themselves. Now, Melissa knows this and if you ask me, kinda prefers it. Me and Taylor can switch between the two but Lidia and Veronika can't...well, they can, but it's not a good idea.\" Sarah chewed the end of her pencil thoughtfully. \"Honey, it's more like a personality clash than anything else. Melissa's just different and they haven't figured out how to accept it yet. They'll get there, don't you worry.\" Elizabeth had thanked her and then gone back to fiddling with some gears. It made sense, but it wasn't the whole picture. It had also become stunningly clear that the only reason Lidia and her sister let Melissa teach her was because they were trying to shelter her and keep her safe. They wanted her to do Melissa's job in the future, so that they'd have someone 'predictable' they could depend on. Elizabeth had never sounded out her suspicions but she had the uncanny feeling Sarah and Melissa knew how she felt. Sarah paid way too much attention sometimes. Those odd looks she'd give people and her funny little smiles set Elizabeth's teeth on edge sometimes. The quieter twin and resident psych specialist, she was one to watch out for if you ever got on her bad side. And Melissa talked to her more than anyone else, meaning she had her fair share of information she was keeping under wraps. They pulled into Lidia's driveway. Melissa's truck was already there and Taylor's motorcycle was next to it. Veronika popped the trunk and they pulled out their two duffel bags a piece. They went in through the side door, passing by Mr. Cooper at work in his study. He paused in his work to give them an intense stare and then nod at them before he went back to whatever it was he was doing. Elizabeth repressed a shiver. Lidia was intense, but her father was a category unto himself. They continued down the hall and went into the Rec room. Melissa was typing furiously away with one hand while talking into her phone with the other, parked in a blue beanbag chair. Taylor was suiting up into her racing suit in the middle of the rug, Sarah double checking a few of her knives. Lidia was cleaning out a pistol at the coffee table and was the first to notice their arrival. \"Help the twins,\" was all she said, focused on the cleaning brush in her hands. Veronika dropped her things and went to braid Taylor's hair. Elizabeth reached into her bag and started pulling out the small cameras she had worked on for the past few days. Melissa snapped her laptop shut and walked over to help. They threaded the camera's into her helmet and one of her pockets. Two seperate wires were threaded into her seams. Satisfied, the two stepped back and surveyed their work. \"That should be sufficient,\" Melissa said, opening up her laptop. \"Vigorous movement, if you please.\" Taylor stretched and danced a bit, trying to jiggle them loose. The picture stayed clear and focused despite the movement. \"All right,\" Elizabeth said, putting on her modified headset. \"Start talking. Let's test these new mics.\" Taylor grinned. \"We have clearance, Clarence.\" \"Roger, Roger,\" Elizabeth replied. \"What's our vector, Victor?\" \"2939-er, Clarence, over.\" \"Enough you two,\"Sarah said with a giggle, \"It sounds like it's working just fine.\" \"Everyone sync up,\" Lidia said. The girls put in their ear mics and and checked their watches and phones. \"Elizabeth and Veronika, you're with Melissa. Sarah, you're with me. Taylor, you're on point. No slip-ups, no explosions, quick and simple. We've got Habitat for Humanity tomorrow at nine.\" They filed out and got into their assorted vehicles. Taylor took off down the street, popping a wheelie at the stop sign and headed out through the city. Melissa turned the key and her truck rumbled to life. She took the highway route, having to get there first and drop off Veronika so she would be in position. Lidia took the residential route, Sarah chattering about HFH and how she just knew, \"Brian is going to flake out\". Melissa had recieved the course layout the night before at ten. Technically, none of the contestants were supposed to know the course beforehand, but money was very, very convincing and no one wanted to get on the bookee's badside. You might never see your cash again. And in an illegal race like this, there was no such thing as an honest participant. Taylor zipped down the lane, weaving in and out of the clubbers and drunks and college kids. The motorcycle thrummed in her blood, metal and leather clutched beneath her thighs, she perched on air, flying without wings. The asphalt blurred into a black rock river, boiling with leftover oils and water and other unnameable liquids. It flowed underneath her, yellow lane markers blurring into long stretches of color. She was flying, fighting the wind and winning. Heart singing, both cradled and crushed by the wind, she flew. Past the cars, past the semi trucks, past the exits and the flashing yellow signs. She was pure speed, faster than light. Giddy with adrenalin and only warming up, she screamed down the highway, fearlessly taking overpasses and bridges at dangerously fast speeds. She cut close to cars, moving as little as possible one moment and then whipping dangerously fast turns the next. Finding the exit, she was looking for, reluctantly she slowed to legal speeds. Winding her way through the inner city's financial district, stopped at a red light, she briefly wondered where the financial branch of the CIA was. She knew it was somewhere in the city. But somewhere was not here and she took off again as the light turned green. Veronika's voice broke into her musings, helmet mic loud and clear. \"I'm in position.\" Taylor must have just reached the signal boundry. The race was only ten miles away now. \"I read you loud and clear,\" Melissa said. \"We have reached our mark and are about to embark on the usual routine of ceasing all cerebral activity once the mission has begun. Oh, aren't we lucky.\" \"A bit of caution, when you round the electric plant our signals will be scrambled for about ten seconds, so don't panic if any of us drop off the grid,\" Elizabeth said. \"We're in position and getting parked right now,\" Sarah said. \"Ready to rumble, y'all?\" \"Enough chatter,\" Lidia broke in,\" We've got a race to win.\" \"Guess that means it's time to party,\" Sarah grinned at Lidia. She rolled her eyes and got out of their car to walk towards the sounds of throbbing techno and the dirtiest form of rap possible. She briefly paused to consider if her outift would be out of place, but then discarded the thought. Her combat outfit was perfect for these kinds of situations. Lidia slipped out of the car garage to mingle with the crowds of almost naked teenage girls and women and the thugs with bizzare taste in fashion. This was so not her scene. She was never one to complain, something she prided herself on, but she felt that this was overkill. She knew that this mission was nothing more than Melissa's elaborate and borderline insane attempt to punish her for interfering with her business. She had done a bit of research on her own, looking over the clips, checking her sources for information and of course, discussing it with her father. And they had both agreed that while it was a noble cause to aid the police in stopping the drug trafficking, this was a very strange way of doing it. There was something else at play here and even if she had to beat it out of Melissa, she was going to get some answers. Veronika was of the same opinion. But she had said that Taylor would mutiny if not given the chance to prove herself and that Sarah would follow. Whatever one did, the other followed, for better or for worse. It was a wonderful thing about 90% of the time, but the other ten percent left Lidia wishing for electric shock collars. She shook away the amusing thought and focused on the greasy-looking pothead in front of her. \"Hooo-eee! Lookie what we got us here! Looks like we got a real lady for our entertainment tonight, boys!\" he grinned nastily, displaying crooked nicotine-stained teeth. He smacked his lips, looking her up and down. \"And damn, if she ain't fine !\" He circled her, jaunting his steps to try and keep his pants from falling even further. She wrinkled her nose at the pungent odor of marajuana, sweat and cheap beer. \"What say you come home wit' me and see if we can't work out a lil som'thin'-som'thin',\" he leered suggestively. Lidia reigned in her quickly rising temper, to fix him with a cool look. \"I'm here for Kimawari. Move, or I will move you myself.\" The druggie's eyes widened and he took a step back, almost tripping over himself. \"$hit, girl! Why didn' you say so! I ain't gonna mess wit' that bat-$hit crazy mother-f*****! No, suh! He one creepy ass f***er, tell you da truff right der, yeah,\" he backed away, holding his hands up. \"Go on wit'ch'er bad self, then girl, I ain't stoppin' you. $hit.\" Lidia rolled her eyes and moved closer to the racers leaving the idiot mumbling to himself, noting the bouncers and the groups of supporters. She scanned out the area, finding Kimawari's distinctive blue suit easily. There were ten racers here so far, a total of twelve were due to race. \"Where are you?\" she muttered unhappily. \"Keep your panties on,\" Taylor shot back, \"I'll be there in two minutes tops.\" Lidia clenched her teeth in annoyance. \"Hurry up.\" A parting of the crowd caught her attention. The tenth racer had arrived. A punk in pink, a drag queen with a need for speed, Jorge Diaz. Lidia fought the urge to grimace. Men in pink gave her a stomach ache for some reason. Even she had no idea why. One of the other racers was entirely too friendly with Mr. Diaz, one Evan Blackhill. A lanky suburban kid who was most likely a sex addict. They chatted comfortably as the two racers watched and the others studiously ignored them. The two watching were Rodrigo Valdez and Joshua Sweet. Two black office workers for competing companies who shared the same father. They had a running betting pool on how long it would take Evan to seduce Jorge. There were two more Latino's, one female, one male. Selena Hernandez and Mario Fuente. Three Caucasians. Jack Plum, Ferris Smith and Milo Carter. Gang member, racing shop employee and undercover cop, in that order. The girls had been very surprised at 'Milo's' success in getting into the race. His first deep cover assignment and he'd already convinced most of the people here he was actually who he said he was. Props to a great actor, but judging by the way the guards and the one's in charge were watching him, this might be his last race. That left one racer missing. Lidia frowned. Melissa had assured them that everyone would be present. Taylor was on her way, but where was racer number twelve? Anyone who didn't show forfeited his entry fee and his life. \"Melissa,\" she said quietly. \"A racer is missing.\" \"Really, now. Who might that be?\" \"Arnold Greyson. He's not here.\" Elizabeth cut into the line. \"He's on his way. I've been monitoring the traffic cameras in the surrounding area. He should get there just as Taylor does.\" Lidia didn't have to wait long. With the screech of burning rubber, two motorcyles drifted into the docks, seconds behind each other. Taylor's distinctive red motorcycle was hard to miss, as well as Arnold's apparent obsession with purple. They dismounted, took off their helmets and gave each other approving looks. \"You're good,\" Taylor said. \"So are you,\" Arnold replied with a grin, tenor voice almost laughing. \"Let's get registered, wha'dya say?\" \"After you.\"[Chapter 4] Back in the truck, both Elizabeth and Melissa threw popcorn at the screen, in front of them. \"Oh, get a room you two!\" Elizabeth said. \"Stop flirting!\" was Melissa's contribution. The two rolled their eyes in tandem. Melissa's popcorn maker hidden in the armrest was their saving grace during missions. It got very boring on the sidelines sometimes, so mindless snacking was definitely needed. Meanwhile... Taylor pretended not to hear either of them and continued smiling up into the stunning pair of green eyes trained on her. Arnold was giving her this heartmelting grin and oh, was her heartmelting. They had already registered with the overly muscled brutes guarding the registration list and the pile of money to go to the victor. They had attached the GPS patches to their handle bars as per race rules. The patch made sure everyone stayed on the designated course, willing or no. They were discussing music and he admitted to being in choir. \"A baritone? NO way! Do you KNOW how hard it is to find someone not afraid to like music? Ah!\" Taylor did a little twirl of happiness, her eyes sparkling. Arnold was giving her stunned look, his mouth hanging open slightly. \"How did you know I was a baritone?\" he asked breathlessly. He ran his fingers though his short, wavy chocolate hair. \"You have perfect pitch!\" he said, shock melting into a happy dance of his own. Meanwhile... \"Are you two eating popcorn?\" Sarah asked over the line, getting out of the car. She needed to get going if she was going to do some serious monitoring of Wan. There was a suspicious silence over the line. She rolled her eyes and popped the trunk to grab her gear. The rest of the group had been trying for months to find the secret popcorn maker that the two swore didn't exist and the others knew did. She headed through the parking garage to the second floor vantage point. Meanwhile... \"Back to work,\" Lidia snapped, sifting her way through the crowd to get to Kimawari. He had noticed her a few moments ago and was watching her progress with hooded interest, leaning casually against his bike. She broke free of the gyrating mass of half drunk bodies and into the respectful space surrounding the racers. Kimawari's eyes slid farther shut, still watching her, but at a much more intense level. She knew that he knew that she was trained and dangerous. She'd never bothered to learn to disguise her abilities, despite everyone's chiding...even her father's. She came to stand directly in front of him, arms at her sides. \"Kimawari,\" she stated. His eyes closed completely at that and then opened them slowly. An impressive look, but nothing compared to what she was used to. \"To what do I owe the pleasure, Ms...?\" Lidia quirked an eyebrow at his flawless British and at Melissa's excited howl over the line. \"Dear Gods, would you listen to that drawl! You can run, but you can NOT hide, Aussies! Wa-ha!\" Lidia decided to play it cool. \"Thompson, Ginny Thimpson. I have questions.\" Kimawari chuckled unexpectedly, a halfway grim, halfway amused expression sliding across his features. \"And you think I have answers?\" \"No. I know you do.\" Kimawari raised an eyebrow. \"You remind me of someone. I don't expect you would know her, though.\" Lidia gave him a blank look. Kimawari shook his head. \"Unimportant. However, I will say this. I do not like being lied to...Ms. Cooper.\" Lidia's insides turned to ice even as she gave him a rather perturbed look. \"Deaf as well as stupid,\" she replied cooly, hiding her unease. \"My name is Thompson.\" Kimawari sighed and stood up, a few dangerous inches taller than her. He reached over and grabbed his helmet. \"It is lucky for you, Ms. Cooper,\" he said, undeterred by her fierce look,\" That you have such good friends. I suggest you, and that lovely blonde sniper on the roof over there, leave before I inform Wan that you are here. I am after all, temporarily under his employ.\" He got on his motorcycle. \"Ten minutes, Ms. Cooper, and then the game's up.\" He put on his helmet and drove to the starting line. She glared at his retreating back and then furiously dove into the crowds, scattering people left and right. \"What the HELL was that?\" she spat furiously into the line. \"He KNEW we were coming!\" \"Take a breath, sugar. We planned for this,\" Sarah said soothingly over the line, pulling herself into the shadows of the car garage. She had almost made it to her vantage point, on the second level. She had a perfect viewpoint to see the crowd and montior Wan from his control station in the cafe on the corner. \"Veronika, your cover's been blown. Get into your secondary station, I repeat, your secondary station ,-\" Veronika started disassembling her rifle lightning quick.\"-They've got eyes in the sky. Elizabeth, Melissa, I want them found and I want them found yesterday-,\" Melissa and Elizabeth set aside their popcorn and began furiously pounding away at their keyboards. \"Sarah, get back to the car. We're moving to another station and you're driving.\" Sarah paused where she was and threw up her hands in frustration, to begin walking back. \"Taylor, you are NOT, I repeat NOT, to do anything at this point. Continue as planned. Reputation and money be damned, I want these bastards beaten and would you stop flirting?\" she hissed. The rest of the team was nearly shocked into silence. Taylor stopped her giggling at Arnold's happy dance to wince at the unexpectedly loud outburst from her ear mic. Arnold gave her an odd look and she quickly turned to look at the large electronic clock that read 10:55. She faced him slowly and gave him a pained look. \"See you at the finish line,\" she said, turning to get on her bike. Arnold reached out to grab her hand gently and spun her around to face him. He leaned close, pulled her hand up and kissed her gently on her fingers. \"For luck,\" he said, green eyes grinning into hers. And then he was gone. Taylor absently rubbed her thumb over her fingers and turned back to her bike, mind swimming. She was broken out of her trance by Melissa's crow of victory and Elizabeth's cry of mock-despair. \"Smile for the camera! BLACKMAIL, BLACKMAIL FOR LIFE!\" Melissa crowed happily. \"Caught on tape and absolutely SHAMELESS. I can't believe you! ...WAY TO GO, TAYLOR!\" Elizabeth said. \"What'd I miss?\" Sarah asked over line, slipping into the grey Honda Accord. \"SHUT UP!\" Lidia roared, cowing them into silence. \"GET BACK TO WORK!\" Melissa manipulated the com lines so Lidia wouldn't hear them for a minute. \"Ladies, Lidia's gone Rhino. All chatter ceasing now.\" \"Agreed,\" the others said in unison. Rhino mode was when Lidia bulldozed everyone into submission like a territorial bull rhino with a mean streak. It was, in a word, terrifying. \"Veronika, are you in your new position?\" Elizabeth asked. \"Nyet. I ahm travelling through building. Getting shot vas not on de list of activities fohr de night.\" \"Excellent. We've just located an anomolous heat signature three buildings away. A round of applause for your lovely, sister,\" Melissa said. \"Go to position four. The blind spot should be just perfect for you and you can still give us some cover. Position four.\" \"Roger,\" Veronika said, trotting down the building's stairwell. She hated orange carpeting. Melissa turned to Elizabeth and beamed. \"Piggybacking off of three satellties simultaneously? Genius! You simply MUST show me that delicious bit of code when we get back.\" Elizabeth gained a smug look. \"You wrote it, Mistress Cypher. A few months back at our think tank with NSA. I just improved it.\" \"Marvellous, simply marvellous, Ms. Binary. We'll be keeping this between us, I trust?\" She nodded. \"Oh, definitely. Cooper would be...\" She trailed off. \"Exactly.\" They turned back to their screens, fingers flying. Lidia slammed the door as she got into the car. \"Drive,\" she growled. Sarah turned off the car motor and gave her the Look. Lidia's glare turned positively glacial and it was a safe bet the temperature in the car dropped a few degrees. \"I ain't gonna be intimidated like some sorta perp you just scraped off the bottom of your shoe, Lame Brains,\" Sarah said calmly. \"So you can stop being rude and quit the 'tude. We get it. Nobody likes being bested by somebody who's marbles aren't all there. ESPECIALLY in this group. But if you make a habit of blowin' up at your team whenever things go...what was Melissa's phrase...'pear-shaped', then I'll be the first one to tell Mr. Cooper you're unfit for the team he's thinking of putting you on.\" Lidia had turned into a glacier at this point. \"You had better have turned your mic off,\" she growled. Sarah rolled her eyes. \"Of course, I did. Giving this information to anyone else would be stupid. Veronika would have a fit and so would Taylor. They've been trying for the same thing you know.\" \"Yes, I know,\" she ground out.\"But how do YOU?\" \"You're not the only one with sources, Lame Brains. So get a grip, because my SISTER is risking her LIFE for you. I've had a funny feeling 'bout this mission from the start. I AM not gonna let you screw it up. We clear?\" \"Crystal. Now, DRIVE.\" Sarah started the engine and they began to exit the parking garage. Lidia absolutely HATED it when Sarah went all saintly and gospel-ish, because she was almost always right. And screw beating Melissa half to death, she was going to beat her within an inch of her life. Files were off-limits. They'd ALL agreed to it. And now, she had gone rogue again, expecting that nobody would notice. Not this time. There was no way Sarah had access to those files. Of all people, there would be no WAY she'd go back on one of her promises. And only Melissa would tell Sarah something like this. Oh, it was on. Tucking her rage back firmly where it belonged, Lidia refocused on the mission at hand. There was a race to win and information to gather. Meanwhile... \"All right, y'all. I suspect Sarah's talkin' Lidia down, since they've dropped off the com lines. Are you guys, ready?\" Taylor asked, revving her engine at the starting line. \"As we'll ever be,\" Elizabeth said. \"Be careful,\" Veronika said. \"Yes, do,\" Melissa said. \"I'm not paying in full if we have to scrape you off the concrete again.\" There was collective rolling of the eyes that was definitely felt if not heard over the line. \"Feeling the love, y'all,\" Taylor said, a grin creeping up on her lips. It always amused her how Melissa would never say she was worried. Even Lidia did, if in a very concise way. How she managed to say so much in five words or less would always be a mystery. Maybe something about the eyebrows? A scantily clad Asian chika in a something that imght be called a string bikini in other parts of the world, walked in between the racers, nothing in her hands. Oh, God. It was going to be one of THOSE races. Rolling her eyes, Taylor shifted to peripheral vision just as the girl lifted her top. Leaving the hoots and catcalls behind in a screech of burning rubber, she was off. immediately, Kimawari, Jorge, Taylor and Jack raced to the front boxing out the others. Jorge took an early lead during the 500 feet or so of straight track, but Taylor was too worried. He faded way too fast. Kimawari settled in just behind her and she tailed Jack. This was new. Normally, Kimawari lead from start to finish. She wasn't the only one to notice. \"Stay sharp,\" Melissa said, quietly. \"Kimawari's up to something.\" \"I know!\" she yelled, drifting a wide left around Jack and Jorge to take the lead. \"Now let me race!\" Kimawari had had the same thought it seemed for suddenly they were side by side. She could hear Arnold's engine about fifty feet behind, Joshua and Milo after him. It was gonna be a close race. She could tell. The course was one of the more complex one's that Wan occasionally dreamed up. \"Mad as a hatter,\" to quote Elizabeth. Starting at the docks they would wind their way through the financial district, the art district, a public park, the gay-borhood, a construction site by a power plant, a football stadium and then over the bridge back to the docks. Wan could be inventive if he chose it seemed, or at least, one of his minions was. Turn by turn, they wove through the city. Arnold took the lead on George street, then Joshua pulled a fast one two streets later. Kimawari cut her off at the Arbor Park in the middle of the financial district, causing her to slam on her brakes and have Milo and Joshua pass her. With a cry of frustration she slammed on the acclerator trying to gain lost ground. \"Talk to me! I need a break! Kimawari's on me like no other!\" She jockeyed for position behind Joshua, now in the lead. Kimawari had decided to follow her for now, Milo behind him, following Arnold then Selena who had steadily been moving up in the race. Evan and Rodrigo were still fighting but Jorge had pretty much given up at this point. Evan had been stuck in the middle and so had Rodrigo. Evan had an explosive temper so he was going to make a move soon, good timing or not. \"Let's see, there should be a straight stretch once you pass the stadium. Floor it,\" Elizabeth directed. \"Got it.\" A quick slam to the brakes cutting through Milo's guard and she was in second again. Kimawari was falling farther behind giving her bad vibes. Something was definitely up. She was rounding the power plant and as predicted a severe static took over the lines. Taylor winced, but continued racing. Meanwhile... Veronika lay low on the top of the roof, observing Wan through her rifle scope. He was drinking a very European cappuchino and being entertained by two girls dancing a very odd rendention of the Macarena. She tuned the rifle in on his surrounding companions. A few sleazy, 1970's looking wanna-be's. A suit with a very impressive watch and laptop. And, hello, what was this? A tall black man with ridiculous muscles and tasteful gold was sitting in a white chair conversing on a cell phone. Static buzzed in her ears. Taylor was at the power plant then. The man stood up suddenly, said somethiing to Wan and then left the cafe, still talking on his phone. Veronika's inner alarm system started going off like crazy. In a game of who's who, the one that doesn't belong always means trouble. \"Girhls, ve have company,\" she said as soon as the static subsided. \"Mehlissah, Elizabet. I need to to trace, track and break a call beihng made by a tall black man in a vhite suit. He just left the cafe.\" Silence on the line. \"I repeat. Trace, track and break cell phone call in progress. Tall black male, white suit, jsut left the cafe. Do you read me?\" Silence. Time to check the lines. Elizabeth had said they might go wonky around the power station. \"Taylor, do you read me?\" \"Kinda busy at the moment!\" Veronika turned to Sarah next. \"Sarah, do you read me?\" \"I hear you. Anything interestin' up there, Birdie?\" \"Black man 'ho just left cafe.\" \"Oh, I see him. What's he doin' 'round these parts? I'd peg him as European, maybe even Mid'E. We're watchin' him now.\" Lidia was next. \"Lidia, do you read me?\" \"Yes. Is he a problem?\" \"Possibly. I did noht even see him until a fe'u moments ago.\" Now her sister. \"Elizabet, do you read me?\" Silence again. The alarm bells were ringing like mad now. \"Melissa, do you read me?\" No answer. She made her decision. Lifitng herself into a crouch, she quickly packed her rifle away. \"Somet'ing's 'rong. Melissa and Elizabet are noht responding. I'm on my way.\" \"NO, hold your position! Veronika!-\" Veronika calmly reached in her ear and pulled the earwig mic out, slipping it into her pocket. Being Tsar Ivan's daughter had definitely straightened out her priorities. She headed back into the building. Family first. Meanwhile... Taylor had made it to the bridge, Kimawari still breathing down her neck. He was playing with her and she knew it. She had seen him wreck Milo three miles back and then shut down Joshua a mile later. He knew. He knew there were government agents in the race. He had taken out Milo and she was next. For the first time in her life, an icy dagger of fear lay close to her heart as she zipped down the concrete. He was going to kill her. She thrust down on the throttle again, hoping to create some distance. No such luck. He knew he style too well. She wasn't going to make it to the finish line. The finish line got closer and closer and so did Kimawari. She was barely hanging on- Two more corners, one more drifted 25 mile turn and then- She felt it more than saw it, Kimawari passed her, Arnold trying to do the same- Not today. Wrenching her handlebar suddenly she caused Arnold to veer left sharply making him lose his wind drag and then the finish line passed them by, the crowd roaring it's approval at the flashy display. She slammed on her brakes, a sideways drift engaged to slow her down faster, the other racers doing the same. Coming to a standstill eighty feet later, she put her feet on the concrete and saw who came in next. By law of the street, those who came first got closest to the crowds, followed by place consecutively. Kimawari, her, Arnold, Selena, Jack, Rodrigo. She turned to look at Kimawari, who had already taken his helmet off. He was regarding her strangely. Arnold had also taken off his helmet was glaring at Kimawari. Sensing her gaze, his expression softened and he gave a small bow in her direction before going back to uber hate of Kimawari a moment later. Really sore loser maybe? Not to that degree. \"Something's wrong, you guys. Arnold's gettin' downright nasty and Kimawari didn't take me out like he could've. I've got a bad feelin' about this.\" \"So glad I'm not the only one,\" Sarah said. \"Don't get off your bike, don't take your helmet off. Somethin's awfully hinky. Veronika's gone to check on Melissa and Elizabeth. Their com lines are down completely. I fancy they're havin' a nice little session with their gadgets at the moment. Lidia and me have been watchin' this fancy black fella. Who-ee, is he outta place, stickin' out like a show pony in a barrel race. Veronika tagged him for us. You'll be happy to know, Milo's alive. His people snatched him up a minute or two after Kimawari happened. Poor guy, he's gonna be walkin' real funny if he ever gets back on his feet.\" Taylor felt herself relax slightly at her sister's longwinded report, the adrenalin lessing. \"Anything else I should know?\" She asked good-naturedly. And then all hell broke loose. Shots rang out, people screamed, scrambled and screeched away. Mass panic sweeping down the street. \"Agent down, Agent down!\" Veronika screamed over the line. \"Agent missing and agent down! We're marked!\" \"Taylor, get out of there!\" Lidia ordered. \"Meet at the rendezvous point!\" Taylor gunned her motor again, slipping down an alleyway, leaving the mess behind her. The last thing she saw was Arnold and Kimawari facing off, completely still in the middle of a panicked mob. Twenty minutes later, half out of her mind with worry, she reached the warehouse they used for a meeting ground. Melissa's red truck was already there and so was Lidia's Honda. The other's were huddled together around a bench. She scrambled off her bike and ran over. Elizabeth lay spread out on the bench, arm over her eyes, Lidia checking her vitals. Sarah and Veronika hovering worriedly nearby. She hugged her sister tightly, relieved she was all right and then turned to Lidia. \"What the hell happened? Who did this to her?\" she demanded breathlessly. \"Melissa.\" For a split second, Taylor thought she had heard wrong. \"Melissa- but that's crazy! Why would she-?\" Elizabeth intterupted. \"She tasered me and then dosed me with a knockout-painkiller potion. She was talking to me before she left. I don't know what she said, that bitch.\" Veronika looked like death warmed over. \"The truck's systems vere viped clean. She destroyed all evidence of her leaving. No goodbye, noth'ink.\" \"I can't believe she would do this! It's San Diego all over again!\" Sarah raved, throwing her hands up in frustration. \"Our resident technological expert takes out our number two and then vanishes? What the hell is she thinking?\" Taylor rounded on Lidia, whose face was curiously drained of all color. She opened her mouth to yell at her, but something in Lidia's expression froze the words in her throat. The others noticed her absolute, frozen silence as well. \"Lidia?\" Sarah asked cautiously. She snapped her head up to look at them, eyes wide. \"I didn't know. I didn't. I just thought it was some boy, or one of those people from the internet. I didn't know. She warned me, I didn't listen, I didn't know, I swear I didn't know-\" Lidia was babbling now. Veronika slapped her and suddenly there was silence. \"This was about the flowers, wasn't it,\" Sarah demanded. She mutely nodded. \"Explain.\" The heat in Veronika's voice would have melted diamonds. \"I logged onto her main laptop a few weeks ago to get some files. I thought she wouldn't notice-\" there was a collective hiss of disapproval and disbelief. Lidia flushed a brilliant cherry. \"What I found was something else entirely. She'd been looking for something, or rather something had come looking for her. It looked completely benign. Nothing out of the ordinary. Like two love-sick teens flirting. I'd been annoyed with her. She had just destroyed our operation in San Diego and then she had the nerve to insult me about my decision making. So I sent an email. Two weeks later, the flowers appeared. Did any of you see what was written on the card?\" The group mutely shook their heads. \"'Time's up, my Love. I'm coming for you.',\" Lidia recited. \"You mean-\" Taylor began. Lidia nodded. \"She's gone. And this time...she's not coming back.\" One hour earlier... \"Nice call. You're getting good at this, Ms. B.\" Elizabeth grinned over at Melissa mowing down on popcorn once again. \"Why thank you, Mistress C.\" \"Will you take the lead, next mission?\" Elizabeth stilled her fingers, to turn to look at Melissa, who had set her popcorn aside and was giving her a serious look. \"What?\" Melissa grinned, a sad strange grin, her eyes hollow in the harsh electronic light as static buzzed in their ears. \"You'll have to, my dear.\" And suddenly Elizabeth was shaking in the grip of 300 kilovolts of electricity, vision fading into white. Her heart was stopping and then she was aching in every muscle, every joint, every bone. Her eyes were gumming shut with thickening tears. The small prick in her forearm was negligible compared to the flood of sensory input. \"I'm sorry, my dear. I never wanted to hurt you. But there are no choices left for me. Believe me, I've tried everything. Goodbye.\" Elizabeth felt herself slipping into black oblivion. She heard Melissa tinkering around with a few things, the car door open, shut and then she was gone. ","Summary":" Taylor lay underneath her motorcycle, a small allen wrench in hand. Her brakes had seemed a bit off"},{"Movie":"Jumanji","Title":"JUMANJI: Online","Author":"KaizerMichaels","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12789306","Passage":"[Chapter 1] JUMANJI ONLINE: Welcome to the Jungle – The Next Adventurer Is YOU! Written and Adapted by Kai Michaels Premise: Kai Pickering is your typical, hard-working secondary school student with a loner status, a whole set of various book smarts and a love for RPG and MMO-based games. But when he receives a mysterious e-mail from a new and upcoming gaming company called: Rainforest Games inviting him to take part in private beta-testing of a brand new MMO-based game called: JUMANJI ONLINE, he, of course, jumps at the chance. Unaware of the fact he was about to embark on a treacherous and life-threatening virtual journey that will put everything he knows about the world of gaming to the test when he is sucked into the world of Jumanji and must work together with complete strangers to traverse and complete the game in order to free himself, and his party members from their virtual nightmare. Chapter One: \"The Boy who Cried, Jumanji!\" \"Kai! You're going to be late for school!\" called a rather stern female voice up from the bottom of the stairs within the interior of a large, white Victorian-styled house in the middle of the suburbs in the county of Hertfordshire in the United Kingdom. \"I know…Mum!\" Kai called back from inside the small ensuite bathroom attached to his bedroom, where he was currently brushing his teeth, and rolling his eyes at his mother's constant reminders. \"God…\" he muttered to himself, spitting out the last of his toothpaste into the sink. Kai Pickering is currently in Year 11 at the Britannia Secondary School. A loner by nature, Kai always kept to himself and was often bullied for his teacher pet-like status, and for being too smart for his own good. But he didn't care though; he couldn't wait to get out this god-forsaken town. He was only 5'9\" with a slender frame. He had short brown hair that was styled slightly to the right with cute facial features. Kai's deep yet distant blue eyes stared into the mirror before him for a second. \"Just half a year to go, Kai, you can do this. Just forget about everyone else, and keep doing what you're doing. It'll be all over soon.\" The teen said out loud, looking to pep-talk himself before exiting the bathroom. He grabbed his shoulder bag and kissed his husky puppy, Raiden on top of his furry black and white head, who was lying down on his side on top of his daddy's double bed. \"See you later, buddy! Be good!\" Kai smiled before giving Raiden's head fur a little ruffle and leaving his bedroom and quickly made his way down the stairs. \"I'm going now, Mum! Bye!\" Kai shouted out. \"Bye, sweetheart…see you tonight, and don't forget your Dad's coming to pick you up tonight!\" she yelled back from inside the kitchen, where she was sitting and working from on her laptop with a mug of freshly brewed hot coffee in her hand. \"I know, Mum…I know! I'm leaving now!\" he said shaking his head and opened the front door, closing it behind him. He hopped on his moped, and put in his earphones and played some of his favorite music on his iPhone using his iTunes account. He fired up his mode of transportation, and sped off down his road heading off to school in his monkey suit that called a 'school uniform'. Kai pulled up outside the Britannia Secondary School, where masses of students were already making their way into the last place they all wanted to be, especially now that the winter school holidays were over and done with. ' It was a new year, which meant new challenges right? Yeah right. Nothing ever changes around here, so forgive me when I say, don't get too excited.' This was the internal monologue of Kai's life right down to a tee. Kai got off his moped and kicked out the stand gently as it lent off to the side after turning everything off. He removed the key from the ignition and put it away inside his blazer pocket. He adjusted his shoulder bag after putting his earphones away along with his phone and made his own way towards the school's entrance. The morning of the first day back at school seemed to be never-ending but when it finally did come around, Kai was sitting by himself in the corner of the large, bustling cafeteria eating the packed lunch he made the night before. He wasn't a baby; he didn't need his mother doing everything for him anymore, he was 16 now. Kai was just minding his own business reading a book, when he's seemingly peaceful and uninterrupted lunch came to an abrupt end, when he was joined by none other than Chad Marshall and his two flunkies: Sebastian Cruise and Tom Delaware. \"Well, well…if it isn't the teacher's pet himself, boys?!\" Chad mocked and knocked Kai's almost empty lunch box container off his table with a single a swipe of his hand. Kai sighed, and looked over at Chad with hateful eyes and sense of pity for his arch-nemesis, who had been making his life hell since year seven. \"What do you want, Chad? Can't you see, I'm busy educating myself, unlike brutish thugs like yourself?\" Kai stated harshly, sometimes he let his mouth get the better of him. He used to be scared of him, but it had been going on for so long now, he just didn't want to waste any more of his precious energy on the wanker. \"Ooh..lookie here…talking back to me, already!? How rude…\" he replied with a smirk, and his facial expression soon changed to more angrier typing and instantly grabbed the front of Kai's white long-sleeved shirt, lifting the gamer up and bringing them face-to-face with each other. \"I think you need a little lesson in respect, don't you…FAGGOT!?\" insulted the short, blonde-haired bully. \"Let me go, Chad! I mean it, or I'll…\" he finished. \"..OR WHAT?! You gonna kick my ass, are you, Kai?!\" he taunted, trying not to laugh at Kai's pathetic attempt to stick up for himself, slamming him up against the back wall. Kai didn't know how to respond, it was like he was just frozen in place. He saw the burning intensity in Chad's brown eyes, the fear they would try to infect him with…and for intents and purposes, it actually seemed to be working a little. Kai gulped since Chad didn't seem to be messing around here…so maybe he should just back off with the smart mouth comments for now. Kai looked away, and Chad smirked at Kai's defeated demeanor, triumphant in his method of persuasive no doubt. \"That's what I thought…Pickering!\" Chad than out of nowhere smashed his fist into Kai's abdomen causing the loner to groan in pain, and become winded by the blow. Chad seemed pretty proud of himself, and let Kai go who slid down the wall onto the floor holding his gut, choosing not to cry or show any kind of emotion right now, and give Chad more ammo to tear him down with. \"Let's go, boys…we're done here.\" Chad concluded and took his leave grinning wickedly. Kai looked on at his oppressor, swearing internally to himself that one day he would make Chad pay for everything he has ever done to him. Whether or not that day would come he didn't know but he was sure as hell hoping it would. Later that day, Kai had received a text from his father telling him, he wouldn't be able to pick him up tonight, so their weekend plans were off in general, because daddy dearest had to work. No surprises there, and continues to be one of the reasons, Kai always took his father's plans with a grain of a salt, because in the end he would always only ever disappoint his only son. ' Tragic, I know? But who cares right? Because life isn't fair right?' the internal monologue continued to fill Kai's thoughts, the teen was becoming more and more cynical every day it seemed. Kai pretending his wasn't upset about the entire day's events, shook it off with a sniff and slammed the front door to his family home shut as he dashed upstairs, glad his mother wasn't around to see him like this having been jumped again by Chad's two flunkies on his way home from school giving him a cut lip and a nosebleed. He was pretty sure he'd have a black eye in the morning since his left eye was just pounding with pain right now. Raiden was barking at his owner upon Kai's storming entrance, hoping to get some fuss and be played with. \"NOT NOW, RAIDEN!\" yelled Kai furiously at his puppy who whined at his father's voice causing his ears to drop along with his tail. Kai entered his room, closing the door loudly behind him again and threw himself on top of his bed, burying his face in his pillow. He couldn't hold it in anymore as the tears finally came, and to cry into his pillowcase. It wasn't fair. What did he ever do to Chad? Apart from trying and be his friend at one point years ago and nowadays made sure to keep his distance. Kai didn't want to hurt anyone; he just wanted to be left alone. He didn't need friendship, love, family or any of that crap or so he thought when really he was incredibly lonely deep down but would never admit it out loud. He didn't owe this world a thing, and he would happily leave it if he could. No-one would miss him. Suddenly the monitor of his Mac turned on by itself and began flashing a symbol of an envelope with its flap moving up and down… \"YOU'VE GOT MAIL!\" said the computerized voice. Kai stopped crying for a minute and lifted his tear-stained face up from his pillow looking over at his desktop computer. \"What the-?!\" he asked himself and quickly moved off his bed over to his Mac. \"YOU'VE GOT MAIL!\" it repeated. Kai wiped his eyes with the sleeve of his school shirt and had his mouse pointer hover over the envelope icon, and double clicked it opening up his e-mail account. There was 1 new message inside his inbox waiting for him to read. \"Rainforest Games? Wha-?\" Kai muttered upon reading who the sender was out-loud. He then read the subject, \"You've been invited! Kaizer_262!\" he paused to think, \"Invited to what?\" he commented, and opened the e-mail with a large banner appearing at the top of the message browser with the sound of drums beating in the background. 'RAINFOREST GAMES PRESENT: JUMANJI ONLINE!' Kai raised his eyebrow, sitting down on his desk chair and began to read the rest of the message to himself: \" Dear Kaizer_262, you have been selected for an exclusive beta-testing of our brand new game: JUMANJI ONLINE! We've selected over like-minded players like you, who thrive in the world of MMORPG!\" Kai stopped reading for a second, \"Really? Interesting?\" he said resuming his reading. \"Jumanji Online is an open world game with safari adventure aspects, and is any true explorer's dream come true! You can create your own avatars, and equip them with special skills chosen from a limited pool of abilities, we currently have installed in our beta server build with more to come! If you have a mind for strategy, roleplay, action, quests, and adventure than this is the game for you. You will need all your wits, and skill to complete this game's current content.\" He paused. \"The next big adventurer could be YOU! So do you accept this invite, Kaizer_262? If so then click 'ACCEPT' below, and you can start downloading the game right now! But think fast, you only have one hour to accept after opening this message…DON'T MISS OUT!\" Kai's interest was definitely peaked, as a timer starting with 60:00 appeared at the bottom of the e-mail and began counting down quickly. Kai put his hands together and rested his chin on top of them. He had to think about this, but was their really anything to think about? He loved this kind of game, and this was a great opportunity…it all seemed legit at least to him anyway. Kai bit down on his lower lip filled with temptation right now, and smirked to himself, after the day he had he could do with an escape for a few hours, So why the hell not? \"Okay! I'm in!\" Kai decided with an excited smile and clicked 'Accept' the timer than disappeared, and the game began downloading instantly. He had a fiber-optic broadband connection, so it didn't take long at all, just enough time for Kai to clean himself up, and change out of his uniform, and get a bottle of water. Once the game had finished downloading, Kai installed it on his Mac. Once it was done installing he double clicked on the .exe file, and the game opened up in full screen. A black screen at first, but soon, a sense of mysticism filled its space with swirling mist-like graphics that came together to form a circle with words, which Kai read out loud. \" A GAME FOR THOSE WHO SEEK TO FIND. A WAY TO LEAVE THEIR WORLD BEHIND…\" Kai smiled, \"Now this is cool.\" he watched in anticipation. \"Welcome to Jumanji Online…\" the screen read with the drums sounding in the background. \"Enter Jumanji Online?\" Kai nodded, \"Hell yes!\" pressing the return key on his keyboard and was brought to the beta server character screen. Kai clicked: 'Create-A-Character' , and was brought into the character creation screen. Kai spent a good thirty minutes designing the character, he wanted to present him. He used some of his favorite actors for inspiration with some of his own ideas thrown in for originality. Once done, he had to select his skills and abilities from the pool available to him. So he selected the skills, he wanted. \"Now, I just need a good name. Hmm…\" Kai thought about it for a moment. \"Phoenix 'Valiant' McCloud? Now that's cool, yeah let's go with that!\" he hit FINISH , and was accepted by the game. \"Here we go into Jumanji baby!\" Kai smiled excitedly. He couldn't wait to get stuck in. Soon the game's screen began to physically bend reality, unleashing a mystical circular portal causing his mac to spark a lot in areas. \"What the hell-?\" Kai said instantly getting up off his desktop and watched as his hands began to stretch and dematerialize. His entire being began to be absorbed into the game, but before he could say anything he was sucked all the way in within seconds. The monitor than immediately shut off and Kai was gone…just like that. ..To Be Continued! Author's Notes: Hey guys, its KaizerMichaels here. It's been a long time since I done any posting on . I recently saw the new movie, 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' and loved it, just as much as the first film, probably even more, and couldn't resist taking a crack at doing a limited fanfiction on it through an original character of mine. This was just the first chapter with more to come hopefully if you guys like it. This is my first time doing a Jumanji fic, so please be gentle with me, haha! Anyway, I hope you like it an would love to hear what you think about it so far. You will meet Kai's avatar in the next chapter, so I thought I'd keep you guys in suspense on that front for now. Hehe. I do not own Jumanji.[Chapter 2] JUMANJI: ONLINE Welcome to the Jungle – The Next Adventurer Is YOU! Written and Adapted by Kai Michaels Chapter Two: \"Meet, Dr. Phoenix 'Valiant' McCloud!\" A mini-explosion was seen in the clear blue sky above the great jungle of Jumanji down below. It was beautiful in scenery, and an element of placidity overflowed across the land. Creatures of all shapes and sizes resided in very tranquillity, some friendly and some just plain nasty. A sense of yelling could be heard echoing throughout the jungle with an actual human body forward somersaulting through the sky heading straight for seemingly harmless environment below, the gravitational pull taking no prisoners on the poor soul's descent. The person in question was actually male in gender as they hit the ground softly of course or as soft as one could be when you're falling from an endless height like the atmosphere above. The male groaned in a twinge of pain as they rolled onto their back, and looked up at the sky above them. \"What the—\" he quickly got up to his feet, and looked around at his surroundings trying not to freak out. \"Where the bloody hell am I?!\" the male avatar spoke in a gentle yet strong British accent. \"Wait a sec…\" the adventurer began feeling around the front of his torso and looking down at himself. \"Holy shit!\" he expressed in pure surprise. \"This can't be real. I'm…I'm in the game?!\" Kai vocalized and gulped soon after to himself. \"T-That…that must mean…\" Kai was interrupted. \"Dr. Phoenix McCloud! You've finally made it! Or…should I call you, Valiant for short?\" another male voice confirmed and clearing up Kai's official suspicions going forward. Kai quickly turned around and saw the other guy standing there. He was a much older male with short grey hair after he had removed his hat from the top of his head, and approached the avatar. \"Rufus McDonald, my good sir. It's an honor to finally make your acquaintance, I've been waiting for you.\" introduced the older man, who was dressed in your traditional safari uniform along with a set of black hiking boots. Rufus offered Phoenix his hand to shake. Kai looked at it, and then up at the non-playable character (NPC), who he could only assume was the correct identification for him. \"Whoa…I'm the character, I created?! What the deuce?\" he told himself, he was in disbelief right now. \"And, what's with this voice? Oh, damn it…I made him, British like me…didn't I? Well that's just great, isn't it? How in the blooming hell am I going to get out of here?!\" Kai asked himself. \"Dr. Phoenix McCloud! You've finally made it! Or…should I call you, Valiant, for short?\" Rufus McDonald, my good sir. It's an honor to finally make your acquaintance; I've been waiting for you.\" the NPC annoyingly repeated, offering him his hand again. Kai sighed, he was going to have to shake the man's hand to shut him up it seemed, so that's exactly what Kai did and acknowledged the NPC's presence. \"Yes. Rufus, old chum…the pleasure is all mine.\" Kai's eyes widened, \"Oh god…I can't even fully control it?! It must be the character's natural programming…great.\" He shook his head, this was completely nuts. How did this happen to him? Is there even a way out? If so, Kai better find out, what and soon. \"…and Err…Valiant is just fine mate, there is no need for such formalities around friends, I'm sure.\" Kai responded, having no choice but to play along right now, and get into the mind of his created character. He could do that…right? He was going to have too if he was going to get out of here in one piece. \"Here, here, my good man. I'm sure; you're here to inquire further about the letter and relic, I sent you, and why I called you here specifically?\" Rufus replied withdrawing his hand. \"Err…yes…I remember…\" Kai soon found himself recalling a flashback recording his character receiving the letter. A cutscene, no doubt, to set up the story, he was sure of it. This was kind of cool; it was like virtual reality but better. Cutscene December, 7 th 2017 – One Month Ago: Knock, knock on the front door of a very uptown, and contemporary loft in the heart of London in the United Kingdom. It was like any other day or at least that what a man named, Phoenix McCloud or Valiant to his friends first thought. He had not been home long from an expedition in the Amazon Rainforest. Phoenix was typing up his findings in a report on his laptop computer when he was forced to stop what he was doing and start making his way over to the front door to answer it. The explorer was dressed in a casual attire of a pair of black gym shorts, and a white tank top. He was currently barefoot. Dr. McCloud was at least 6'1\" with an athletic build, and crystal blue eyes. He had short, dark brown hair and was extremely handsome. He was still quite young at only 29 years of age, and highly skilled in his area of expertise and well-known among exploration and safari circles. The man had a love for archaeology, culture and more, but he never seems to stay in one place for too long. He came from old money, so he never ever had to worry about funding his trips, because he always made sure he had enough to cover himself completely. \"Delivery for Dr. McCloud?\" the deliveryman announced upon the opening of the front door in which Phoenix was now standing inside of. \"Yeah…that's me,\" he responded, and took the package from the man, and finished signing for it. \"Good day, sir.\" he politely said, bidding him farewell. Phoenix had no idea, who it was from, and closed his front door behind him upon turning around and heading back to his dining table to finish up his work. The eager adventurer opening up the package and raised his eyebrow pulling out its contents which consisted of a folded up map, a letter address to him, and a black onyx statue of a jaguar's head with ancient markings and symbols on it. \"Hmmm…interesting.\" he voiced, talking to himself naturally. Phoenix sat down at his dining table and used the letter opener he had resting there to open the envelope to reveal the piece of paper sitting inside of it. Valiant removed the paper, and unfolded it and began to read the letter out loud. \" Dear Dr. McCloud, You do not know me, but I am Professor Rufus McDonald. I am sure you have heard of me from my good friend, Nigel Billingsley for I believe you two have worked together in the past? I am writing to you to inform of an event, I feel is about to transpire here in the heart of Jumanji. Jumanji is a vast jungle with animals, creatures, and dangers of all kinds of shapes and sizes with ties to certain mystical energies it is believed. Despite the previous efforts of Dr. Smoulder Bravestone, and his associates…Russell Van Pelt has returned once again to dive deeper into the occult myths that surround the world of Jumanji and has teamed up with Carlyle Kersley, a truly horrid individual who has unearthed many curses, relics, and other mystical relics over the years in his desire to rule the world. He is a lunatic, and has now arrived in Jumanji to further loot its secrets! I beg of you, Dr. McCloud, we must stop him. Jumanji civilizations of the past have always seen the jungle as a land of a great power and in order to protect it from those who would seek to use it for their own selfish desires, and bring us harm, created many curses and such to ensure these secrets would never see the light of day. This wicked duo has already recovered at least two artifacts from these previously lost ancient temples and seeks to find the other three. Legend states if these five artifacts should come together, the animal kingdom of Jumanji and its mystic properties will destroy the world. Such evil cannot be set free. Please come to Jumanji, Doctor and help us combat this threat with your unique skills, and those already here, I am sure we can put a stop to their plans! Do not lose the artifact, I have enclosed in this letter, it is one of the five animal heads that bound the inherent mystical energies of Jumanji together. My team stumbled across its ruined temple some time ago, and we were unsure of what it was at first until recently. You must protect it at all costs, Dr. McCloud. They will come seeking it out, but at least this way we can hinder some of their plans. Please come to Jumanji as soon as possible, Phoenix. I will be waiting for you. Yours Sincerely, Professor - Rufus McDonald. \"Excellent! I'll just go bring the car around than shall I? and I'll bring you back to our campsite. I am sure; you will want to go through all our preliminary research and our findings? I shall not be a moment. But Doctor, I would not wander off too far until I return, Jumanji is filled with creatures of the like you have never seen. I suggest you prepare yourself, my good man.\" advised Rufus. Kai raised his eyebrow and watched Rufus leave the area to retrieve their vehicle. Alone again, Kai as Phoenix McCloud looked out at the terrain before him upon the turning of his heel. He walked towards the end of the hillside cliff he had previously landed on top of upon his entry to the world of Jumanji: Online. He placed his hands on his hips, \"This is so weird, but so cool at the same time. And, what did Rufus mean when he spoke about Jumanji having creatures of the like I have never seen? This is just a jungle, right? Sure it's a virtual, open world jungle…but do I seriously need to be concerned here? I mean, this is a game right?\" he muttered out loud, asking himself. \"Am I in danger here? If something happens to my avatar? Do I exit the game? Or do I…\" he gulped, \"…die?\" he didn't have the answers, and it was making him nervous since he had no idea what he was in for here or what to expect going forward. \"HEEEEEEEELLLLLLLP ME…..SOMEBODY!\" screamed a female voice filled with fear. Kai's head snapped instantly to the side when he heard the woman's scream. She was close too. Kai quickly dashed off to where the cries were coming from or from what he could tell, and hear right now. He jumped and landed on top of a large boulder, where he looked over at the scene away from him. He saw a woman crawling back across the ground beneath her, very carefully with a large brown bear towering over her, it roared hungrily at her. \"It's a sloth bear…and he's looking for his next meal.\" Kai told himself, and suddenly snapped out his character's trance. \"What the-how the hell, did I know that? It must be a Phoenix thing…man…this is going to take some getting used too. I feel like I have a split personality right now! One part is me, and the other is this Phoenix McCloud, I've created. Just great.\" The teen concluded. The woman saw Kai's character and called out to him. \"OH! PLEASE HELP ME, HELP ME PLEASE!\" she begged, pleading with the male to save her from her furry attacker. The next thing Kai knows, he is surrounded by four holographic displays in front of him with the camera circling around him with battle music being heard in the background, clearly for that in-game dramatic effect. \"Whooooaaaaaa…..this is sweet!\" Kai smiled widely filled with excitement. The four screens displayed different things including character information such as listed in the first screen: Health Points (HP), Power Points (PP), Level (LV) , and a Character Biography with a headshot photo. The second screen underneath the first screen displayed all of the character's statistics such as Strength (ATK), Intelligence (INT), Stamina (END), Speed (SPD) and Toughness (DEF ) . \"This is so awesome! So this is how powerful I am right now? Cool.\" He stated, reading through the first two screens carefully. The third screen showed a dialogue box with the woman's headshot in the corner of it, she was an NPC by the looks of things. It was actively delivering text to Kai with voice-acting, and it read the following… \" Dr. Sarah Collins: \"HELP! Please save me from this beast, brave sir! I do not want to be eaten alive! But hurry! I think he's done waiting! Owwww….I knew I should have listened to my mother, when she said, I should have stuck to teaching!\" After he read the box, he looked at the fourth and final screen, it had a list of commands for him to use. They were as follows: ATTACK, SKILL, SPECIAL, and ITEM . A line of text appeared across the center of the screen, instructing Kai, what to do next. Save Dr. Collins by defeating the bear… The than text faded out, after a series of tutorial screens regarding targeting, how to attack, opponent stats etc. \"Okay…no problem right? I got this…I hope at least.\" He said, encouraging himself. Kai memorized everything the screens showed him, and the screens disappeared upon his jumping off of the boulder onto the ground below, where he soon found himself sliding in between Dr. Collins and the fierce animal before him. The avatar looked up at the enemy and gulped not sure if he was feeling super scared or super dumb. It's not like he had ever seen a bear…like ever…in his entire life, and he didn't know all the rules to Jumanji at the moment, and he could have just given himself a death sentence. The bear roared angrily at Kai's interference, and his initial reaction was just to put his arms to block the bear's lunging towards him, this, in turn, caused the word: DEFEND to flash once above his head, where it stayed for the moment knocking the bear back a little as it scoffed at block, shaking it off. Kai lowered his arms, after seeing his body flash a brief color of red alongside a number with a minus symbol next to it: -5 it read. Kai looked down at his avatar's muscular arms, and a lopsided grin appeared across his lips. \"Whoa…nice!\" Kai said his confidence rising all of a sudden, and drew the twin blades he didn't even know he had that was attached to his back, the avatar's in-game programming taking over no doubt with Kai now behind the wheel. Kai spun the blades and performed a double parry with both blades the word: ATTACK appearing and disappearing with a single flash each time he used that command to cut the bear down to size, and lowering its health bar. The bear cried out in pain, and used its huge paw to counter one of Kai's attacks, and knocked the avatar away from it rather harshly forcing Kai to hit the ground a little hard upon impacting with distance now created between the two enemies. This caused Kai's health to drop slightly following the -75 that appeared off to the side of him in its usual red coloring indicating Kai had just taken damage from the bear's counter attack. \"Ouch...okay that hurt Yogi!\" groaned Kai, referencing the infamous Yogi Bear cartoon character as a joke relating to his current predicament. Kai dug his blades into the ground, and pushed down on them to get him back on his feet, and pulling them out again and taking up a battle stance with the blades crossing over in front of him. \"Okay….how the hell am I supposed to defeat this thing? I must be doing something wrong right, or I wouldn't have taken so much damage?\" he thoughtfully considered. \"Maybe attacking him close up isn't the right strategy here? Maybe I should consider all my options?\" he contemplated. \"Let's see…\" Kai wondered, bringing up his command menu with his willpower. Kai looked down the list, and checked the SPECIAL command; it opened up a sub-menu that had at least one ability listed. \"Analyze? 10 power points eh? OK! Let's try it…\" Kai muttered and selected it. The ability activated instantly as an eye-scouter materialized digitally across his left eye, and Kai focused it on the bear. An interface of enemy information appeared in front of him with everything he needed to know about the bear including its strength and weaknesses. \"Damn! I need to get myself one of these in real life! This rocks!\" smiling again, he used the new information to re-strategize, and end this little practice battle the game had set up for him. The scouter dematerialized once Kai was done, and switched strategies opting for a ranged attack instead, and lucky for him he had one in the SKILL selection of his command list, which he wasted no time in selecting for his next attack, once again costing him power in the form of 25 PP , and calling itself: 'XROS SLASH'. Kai's avatar produced a white power up aura rising up from the ground, and once it vanished, Kai crossed his twin blades back over, and raised them above his head before raising them briefly, and launched them at the bear with pinpoint accuracy and control. The two blades cycled through the air with an intense spin and stabbed the bear quite graphically I might add in the chest at the same time, the bear roared in anguish, pain and more. The bear soon fell to the ground with a loud thump, as Kai's attack had seemingly eliminated the last of its health completely and defeated it. The battle was now over with the music fading and the scene returned to a more natural view. Kai looked up, and saw a wave of blue text, which read: +1000 XP and saw an experience bar quickly move across the screen underneath Kai's power bar, and exploded at the end increasing Phoenix McCloud's level from 1 to 2 now, and assessing his victory and giving him 250 Jungle Coins which must be the game's in-game currency, Kai could only assume. The teen turned virtual explorer took a moment to catch his breath, and couldn't believe what he had just physically gone through, looking down at his hands that were now bladeless. He was sweating just a tad though, and just in shock. But he did just complete his first mission in Jumanji though, and a sense of achievement was definitely starting to come over him. This was just one battle; Kai WAS Phoenix 'Valiant' McCloud now, flesh and blood or close to it, and if he knew games like he thought he did, the battles were only going to get much harder and far more challenging…but the question was, would he be up for it? Only time will tell as a game of survival was now in full effect. Good luck with that. ..To Be Continued! Author's Notes: So here's Chapter Two with a bit of backstory and such. I hope you like it. I am currently looking for potential players to join Kai/Valiant in their quest. If you're interested? Please do not hesitate to contact me via Private Messaging with details of the character you would like to portray along with their skills, looks, biographies etc and of course their real-life players etc. I have six spots available right now (since most raid parties are indeed a total of 8) with one reserved for another character, I had always planned on bringing into the game. I am not too fussed with gender-ratio since it can't always be helped. I look forward to reading up on all your character creations, and of course feel free to PM me any questions too, I will happily respond quite quickly also. So you won't be waiting too long. I do not own Jumanji. ","Summary":" JUMANJI ONLINE: Welcome to the Jungle – The Next Adventurer Is YOU! Written and Adapted by Kai Mich"},{"Movie":"Red","Title":"When Stars Collide","Author":"Silver as the Rain","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11497465","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hey guys, well I'm back due to popular demand! It's so great to hear that you all want to read more of my work, specifically with RED as, let's face it, this franchise is awesome :) So I'm returning with another story however this is the first RED film, the one I did not start with for my other fanfiction, The Great Seduction and The Great Kidnap . If you haven't read those then please go check them out, Natalia is awesome. This one was requested by AYMASgonalves and her crew, Liza P, Matty J, Leslie S, James T and Alina G. So guys, you asked for this and so this story is completely dedicated to you! I hope you like it, any comments just drop me a PM or review because I always check those and tell me what you want, it will definitely be considered. Same goes to you all! The more reviews, the more motivated I feel to write more chapters ;) Anyway, I'm done prattling on, so go ahead and enjoy! \"Yes I realise sales have increased and there is a public demand but I'm afraid I can't just force myself to write some load of absolute crap and hope that it'll sell. If I am not making myself perfectly clear, then let me explain a little more simply.\" I growled down the phone to my publisher. \"There is no sequel as of yet!\" Slamming down the phone I walked away with a dark, stormy expression. Why could people not understand writer's block? It is a simple enough concept, nothing too overly taxing on the mind. Yes, my first novel has become a number one bestseller this season and profits were still increasing but it did not mean that I could just write a sequel with no inspiration! With a long sigh I fell backwards onto my sofa, burying my face into a pillow. Something soft brushed past my hand and my cat meowed in my ear, purring as she began to paw at my back to get my attention. \"Hello Tinsel.\" I mumbled into the pillow which muffled my words then shifted, turning onto my side to smile at my young cat, who was gazing at me with large blue eyes before she meowed again then rubbed her head and body against my until I had lifted my hand and stroked her long ginger and white fur. She pressed her body against me then lay down, finding her own comfortable spot then promptly went to sleep, purring as I continued to stroke her. I switched on the TV, flicking through the channels to find something of interest. There was some stupid teen drama but I bypassed that and settled on a nature programme, listening to a voice explain the everyday life of a sperm whale because, quite frankly, I had nothing better to do. Time ticked by with me laying on my couch stroking my cat until at some point I drifted off. When I awoke again it was to Tinsel pawing at my face and meowing. \"Okay, okay, I'm up.\" I sighed softly, rubbing my eyes. \"I'll get you some food.\" Rather reluctantly I got up and went to the kitchen to find my pet her dinner, because who could say no to those big blue eyes? She was just too adorable. I put some wet food down and tickled her chin before she dove in and began to eat it up, her tiny body crouching low on the ground as I went over to my phone and checked for voicemails. Apart from a few from my publisher, there was nothing else of importance so I went and had a shower. Whilst letting the water rush down my face I slapped my cheeks a little, closing my eyes to try and think of a new story. I had been stuck on this for a few weeks now and still it was going nowhere. People were practically begging for a sequel, wanting to know more of the adventures that Kate Owens went through in her secret agent life. Perhaps I should consider a new direction for my writing? Try a historic novel or something. Or perhaps I should go on holiday to get some proper inspiration? Go exploring for a good backdrop to put in my story. Turning off the water I stepped out and wrapped a towel around me, yawning slightly as I glanced across to the clock. It was still early, only six in the evening so I changed into my favourite pyjamas, pulled on a thick woolly jumper then headed to the kitchen to make myself a cup of tea. \"Hey girl, you all done?\" I asked Tinsel as she mewed sweetly at me. \"Good to see, how about we stay in tonight?\" I suggested, glancing outside to the cold and snow. Christmas was coming so I need to start thinking about heading over to dad's. Ever since he retired he'd been rather restless, unable to truly settle down because in reality, he was still thirty years younger and in the prime of his career. He still wanted to be out there doing his job for the government and CIA. So with this being the case, I often took it upon myself to go visiting him, making sure he was never alone on his birthday or Christmas, making sure that he always had something to do so that he didn't start to tear his hair out. Figuratively, I mean. He doesn't actually have any hair. Sipping on my tea I contently watched the snow spiral down against the blackness of the night, lit only by the streetlamps outside. My living room was already decorated with a tree, tinsel and lights with a gas fire going to keep me warm. I considered calling for a takeout but decided I wouldn't put the driver at risk. The snow was getting pretty deep and the roads would be very icy, I didn't want someone to die just to bring me a pizza. Looking through my cupboards I didn't find much of interest, save for some pasta so I cooked that, added some cheese sauce then put up my feet, wearing thick fluffy slippers. Tinsel quickly jumped up into my lap and curled into a small ball of fluff, purring contently and I smiled lovingly down at her. I ate in silence, listening to the occasional car that crawled past carefully before finally caving into the nagging in my mind and picking up the phone. I dialled a number then waited, listening to the tones before it was picked up. \"Hello?\" \"Hey Danielle, I was wondering if you would like to earn some spare change?\" I said to the young girl who instantly replied cheerfully. \"Sure that would be great! You need me to check in on Tinsel for a few days?\" \"Yeah, that would be very helpful. Usual rates okay? I'll be leaving for my dad's tomorrow, so if you could just come in whilst I'm away and make sure she has food and water and that she's okay then I'll really appreciate it. I'll be gone for a few days, no more than a week okay?\" \"Sure Jean, not a problem.\" Danielle assured me. \"Just leave the key in the usual place and I'll pop in. Merry Christmas!\" \"Merry Christmas Danielle, see you soon.\" I hung up the phone then smiled down at Tinsel. \"Your favourite friend is coming over to see you, would you like that? Huh?\" Tinsel merely purred at me so I shifted, sitting further back on the couch to get more comfortable whilst reaching out to pick up my pen and notepad from the coffee table. I began to write down story plots, trying to figure out a good direction but every time I came up with something I ended up crossing it out, deciding that it wasn't exciting enough before tearing out the page and scrunching it up. Soon my floor was littered with balls of paper. Tinsel lifted her head then sprung forwards, catching a ball of paper then began to swat at it, purring with amusement as she rolled over with it, playing with it like a ball of yarn. I watched her then chuckled, shaking my head. When I next looked around to the clock the time read ten pm. \"Well, I'm going to bed. You coming Tinsel?\" I asked, standing up then began to clear everything away. Tinsel meowed then followed me as I put the stuff in the bin then headed off to bed, rubbing my face wearily. I crawled under my covers, turning the lights off as I went then hid under there, only smiling when Tinsel meowed and pawed at my duvet, looking up at me with winsome eyes. \"Alright, up you come.\" I reached out and lifted her tiny body up onto the bed where she then jumped onto me, purring as I turned over before she curled up by my shoulder, my fingers brushing against her fur before I slowly drifted into sleep.[Chapter 2] You know what? I've had a really good day at school and I'm feeling nice. So I'm going to give you guys not one, but TWO chapters in a day! Yay for good moods and ice cream! Let me know what you think, I'll be checking all comments ;) Walking down the road in the crisp cold, wearing a thick coat and scarf with a woollen hat I bowed my head against the wind, my blonde waves spilling over my shoulders as I kept my gloved hands tucked into my pockets. I was heading for the shops to buy some Christmas food to take to dad's this evening, seeing as he probably won't have much in the house. My cheeks were reddened against the biting cold so I rubbed my hands together, blew hot air onto the wool then pressed them to my face, shivering slightly. Glancing up at the sky I watched as the snowflakes twirled down like balletic fireflies, resting on my long lashes and melting on my plump lips before I looked down and continued to walk again, nearly knee deep in snow. I listened to the crunching of the snow and the gentle thrum of the wind whilst a car crept passed, careful against the slippery surface of the road. With my head bowed I heard the car door open so I glanced over with my eyes, watching a man step out with the car still moving parallel to where I was walking. Instantly I was set on alert, beginning to pick up my pace just to be on the safe side but I had to pull up short abruptly when two figures stepped out in front of me. \"Excuse me miss, but could you please step into the vehicle.\" A deep voice asked and a black gloved hand extended towards the SUV which had now stopped beside me. \"What is this?\" I asked slowly, glancing around with fearful eyes as several more men dressed in black coats surrounded me. \"Who are you?\" The one who addressed me flicked open a wallet with his identification on the inside, a silver badge with the words CIA printed firmly in black. \"Miss Moses?\" Someone stepped from the SUV, dressed in a smart black coat that fit his frame flatteringly. His dark hair was dusted with snow the moment he stepped out, settling on his broad shoulders also as he showed me his ID. Cooper, William, CIA. This was bad. Still, I couldn't quite tell what shade of blue his eyes were. Sometimes they seemed dark as sapphires but then when he shifted, they became a light cyan colour. \"We are not going to hurt you. We just need you to step inside with us for a moment. It's about your father.\" Immediately worry creased my features as I turned, blinking at him. \"Dad? What's happened? Is he alright?\" \"Please, we need to vacate to a secure location before we can discuss what is happening.\" I made to move forwards but stopped, looking around me. There were about six of these men surrounding me, all of them armed and they had purposely caught me when I was out in the open, purposely defenceless. This was not a social call, something was seriously wrong and I do not trust these guys. \"If it's all the same to you, I would prefer to talk here.\" I answered, teeth chattering slightly from the cold. \"What's happened to my dad?\" Mr Cooper glanced to his comrades before stepping forwards. \"There has been a development that needs to be contained. Don't worry ma'am, you're safe with us. We just need to make sure we're secure.\" I arched an eyebrow, shivering slightly. \"Pardon?\" \"I said you're safe. We do not wish to hurt you.\" Safe, secure, contained, my dad, this was not good. They were using the warning words dad had taught me to be careful of. It meant that they were not going to take no for an answer. \"But I do not understand, why can't you just tell me if he's hurt?\" I pressed him, trying to stall for time but he reached out and gripped my arm in a firm but painless hold. \"We have no time for discussion, you're going to have to come in with us.\" I tried to pull away from him but he turned and merely swung me around to the car. \"No! Let me go!\" I pleaded, struggling against him. \"Let me go! You have no right to handle me like this!\" Whirling my arm around I broke Cooper's grip, turning to try and make a run for it but then someone drew a gun and pressed the barrel to the back of my head, making me freeze in place and tears began to slide down my cheeks as I gasped loudly, body freezing in place as my breath deepened and I trembled. \"Get in the car.\" The man who had first addressed me growled so I slowly shifted around to face the car, lower lip quivering as I took one slow, small step forwards. \"Faster.\" I gave a slight stumble forwards, a whimper escaping me as I shuffled towards the car. \"Please, please don't hurt me. I'm just an ordinary citizen, I haven't done anything and my dad is just a retired cop, there's nothing special about us.\" I wept tearfully, shaking as I lifted my hands to show my innocence. \"Please just let me go, I'm frightened.\" My heart beat thunderously in my chest as I looked around at the six men and Cooper, who was opening the door. What do I do? I can't get in that car with them because if I did then it would be likely that I would later die. These guys don't take prisoners, only tools. \"Weapons down, she's not a threat.\" Cooper ordered then held out a hand to me, giving a sort of kind expression to reassure me as the gun remained at my head whilst the others put theirs away. \"Carlson, I said guns down.\" With emphasis on his order, Carlson grunted quietly before lowering his gun. My eyes narrowed slightly as I waited, my mind sinking into a calm state as I stopped crying in front of everyone. Without warning I whipped around and curled my hands around the lowering gun, lifting it up and shot three times in quick succession at the men on my left so that they dropped in the snow. With powerful force I cracked back my head onto the bridge of Carlson's nose, making him cry out as I twisted the gun expertly from his grip then whipped around, striking it on the back of his head as the last two men and Cooper went for me. Cooper kicked the gun out of my grip into the snow then went to grip my neck and head but I ducked and twisted out of his grip, concentrating with deep, even breaths as I slammed my weight against Cooper to crush him against the side of the SUV. Spinning around on one foot I lifted the other up and swiped it across in a wide arc, kicking the first agent in the head then twisted, using my arms to block Cooper's attack then struck back with my fist so hard that one man slipped on the ice and snow to crash to the ground. Cooper moved with hard, fast movements which looked scarily similar, almost like my own fighting style which was taught to me by dad. How convenient. Exactly as I expected Cooper gripped my wrist and went for an arm lock so I lifted his arm up, opening his front to exposure then struck out with my knee but he anticipated me, using his other hand to block before spinning me around and holding me to his muscular chest. Breathing deeply I twisted, pushing his hands up and above my head with a small grunt, twisting and leaping up to wrap my legs around his body then flung myself backwards, easily lifting him off the ground because of the slippery snow then planted him down into the soft powder, not hesitating to rip back my fist and strike him in the face, bursting his lip open and stunning him. With him now momentarily immobilised I darted for a trash can that sat outside a house, lifting the lid as several other men got out from their cars and aimed their guns, firing shots at me. Using the lid as a shield I ran for cover, hiding behind a wall before Cooper's shout echoed through the street. \"Cease fire! We need her alive!\" Taking this chance I leaped over the wall still clutching my can lid, flattening my wool hat so that I wouldn't lose it then ran for the road. Bunching up the muscles in my legs I lunged for the ground and landed on the lid, gliding over the icy surface as the hill began to shoot me down. \"After her!\" I squinted against the harsh cold that watered my eyes, pointing my toes as I dove headfirst down the hill towards the traffic. Once I had gained momentum I spun around in my place, sitting on the lid then began to swerve, leaning from side to side to snake my way down the long slope to avoid the cars parked on the roadside but then a large truck pulled out at the bottom and turned, climbing its way up the hill with bright lights glaring. It honked at me in warning, the sound booming through the skies. Without thinking I leaned down, holding my weight mere millimetres off the ground as I moved slightly to the right. I shot under the truck, staring up at the underside as I sped down the road then shot out the other end, sitting up instantly as the road evened out and I began to lose momentum. A car shot out from a bystreet with the back door already wide open and my dad's face at the driver's seat so I sprung forwards, stretching out as if I were flying and dived into the car gracefully, the lid sliding away underneath as dad then shot away. \"You know, this was not how I planned spending Christmas with you dad.\" I said as I yanked the door closed then climbed into the front as he glanced at me, making sure I was unharmed. \"Hey honey, you okay?\" He asked me with a soft smile as I pulled on my seatbelt. \"Yeah I'm good thanks. Merry Christmas.\" I smiled then reached forwards, kissing his cheek which was warm against my frozen lips. \"Merry Christmas, I'm sorry about that, I tried to get here sooner but they got here ahead of me.\" Dad said. \"They're trying to kill me.\" I laughed, shaking my head as I looked over my shoulder to see us being followed whilst also brushing myself off from the snow. \"Yeah I kind of worked that out for myself.\" I answered, opening the glove compartment in front of me and took out the gun that lay there. \"Ooh nice, you upgraded?\" I asked him as I loaded it. \"Yeah thought it would be nice to make a change, you know, try something a little bit different.\" He shrugged as he turned around a sharp bend, the car drifting slightly on the snow but dad was soon shooting forwards again. Behind us one of the cars was not so lucky in the turn and I glanced at the rear view mirror to see a massive burst of fire as the car blew up from hitting another vehicle. \"So how's the book writing coming along? Any ideas for a sequel?\" I groaned, wiping my brow as snow began to melt there before cocking my gun. \"Absolutely nothing.\" I replied, rolling down the window then leaned out and shot a few rounds. My bullets hit the window of the SUV behind us and one of them struck lucky, killing the driver so that the car swerved then flipped over, rolling in the road and blocking most of the space but the two cars behind banked around it carefully, moving with precise caution and firing rounds of bullets at us, clipping the framework. \"Oh that's too bad, your first one was great.\" Dad said to me as he made another turn. I drew back from the window and looked up at him. \"Really?\" I asked with a smile. \"You read my book?\" \"Of course I did. I thought it was really original, good context and of course your technical understanding of the secret agent world was spot on perfect.\" He said to me, reaching out and brushing some snow from my shoulder as I reloaded. I couldn't stop myself from smiling. It was weird how although we were racing for our lives we were still having an ordinary conversation, one that we would no doubt ordinarily have over a coffee or something. \"But don't worry about the next one, you'll get your inspiration and it'll be another bestseller.\" He assured me and I blushed. \"Aw dad, you're making me blush.\" I told him as I shot another three bullets out the window. \"But thanks, it really means a lot to me.\" Glancing ahead I saw the string of lights crossed between buildings with a large star hung in the centre, glowing bright blue and white. \"So how is that girl you've been talking to? Sarah isn't it?\" I asked as I changed direction and carefully aimed. \"Oh she's okay, we're still talking. Might have to go and pick her up though because they're bound to notice all the calls I've been putting in to her office. Not how I wanted to first meet but things get tough like that.\" \"Don't worry dad, I'm sure she'll like you once she gets over the kidnapping thing.\" I assured him as I fired a bullet. The wire overhead snapped and the star began to fall to one side, sweeping down so dad swerved out the way in time and I twisted quickly in my seat to watch as the decoration dropped down and struck the hood of one of the SUVs, causing it to cut out and skid, swerving uncontrollably until it wrapped around a lamppost on the opposite side of the road and forcing other cars to stop. Screeching tyres and honking horns filled the air as the road filled up with cars as they piled up, unable to stop in time because of the ice. \"Ouch, that one's going to hurt their pride for a while.\" I winced then looked back at dad. \"So I was thinking this year we could have duck, what do you think?\" \"Duck sounds nice, with gammon?\" Dad suggested and I nodded my head whilst pursing my lips thoughtfully. \"Yeah why not? Also I think I'll do the pudding this year, seeing as you completely burned ours last time.\" He laughed aloud, shaking his head as he headed towards the airport. \"Hey, I did okay. It was my first go.\" I grinned then shook my head, shifting in my seat to get comfortable and relax in the warmth. \"So where are we going?\" \"Sarah lives in Kansas City, so that's where we're heading next.\" Nodding my head I glanced in the rear view mirror to make sure we weren't being followed. \"You have any idea what this is all about?\" I asked him but he shook his head, looking forlorn and deep in thought. \"No.\" I left it at that. If this was something that dad didn't know anything about then it was serious. People wanted him dead which in turn meant that they wanted me captured to get at him, which then meant they would kill me too to make sure that I would keep my mouth shut.[Chapter 3] I am super sorry about the wait between chapters but I've really been struggling to fit this story as well as my others into my busy life. If it were up to me, I would spend all waking hours writing, yet, alas, life forces me to socialise at this horrid place called school. Still, I am going to try and make more time for this story, because I've already had a couple of ideas which will heat things up a bit and Jean is definitely going to be putting a few surprises out there in later chapters. Anyway, thanks for being so patient, you guys are amazing! I waited in the car, hands gripping the steering wheel whilst watching the apartment floor where our target had just entered. Our target being Sarah, of course. Dad was already up there waiting whilst I kept an eye on the surroundings and main entrance, wearing a pair of reading glasses which distorted my features slightly so that if a camera picked me up, it wouldn't instantly recognise me. The glasses made my nose look thinner, my eyes smaller and I also wore a wig to make my blonde ripples disappear into a short black bob, which made my cheeks look more angular rather than the rounder shape I preferred. The night was well underway and Kansas was still awake, lights blinking in the streets as the cars strolled past. It was certainly warmer up here, though there was still a slight chill to the air. I gazed up at the Christmas lights in the windows of the apartments, counting them to pass the time. It was not long before my mind wandered back to the slight scuffle I had had with the CIA. Those boys certainly did not expect what I gave them and still to this moment I cannot supress a smirk. The look on William Cooper's face when I floored him was completely priceless. Though I have to wonder at their intelligence. Did they honestly expect any daughter of Frank Moses not to be able to defend herself? Much less against a couple of thugs who thought they were the real deal because they carried big guns? Honestly, no one cares about the classical arts anymore. It's all about knives and weapons, when I prefer to go with a simple, clean fist. \"Jean. Come in Jean.\" I blinked quickly to shake the image of William Cooper's face from my mind as it seemed to be sticking around there a lot, where it was certainly not welcome. \"I'm here. You're all good to go.\" I spoke back into the radio then moved the car forwards, inching towards the side road where I had been told previously to wait for dad and his rather unwilling guest. Sure enough not moments later he came crashing out of the fire exit with a rather pretty woman who was struggling all the way, despite being bound at the wrists and had a strip of duct tape over her mouth. I watched as she aimed a good kick to my dad's shins then whipped her fisted hands upwards, smacking him in the jaw whilst she screamed from behind the tape. Arching an eyebrow I smirked, impressed with her guts. She had some backbone, which was good. My dad, however, quickly recovered from this assault and hoisted Sarah up over his shoulder with a slight sigh, shaking his head as he strode over to the car then wrenched the back open. \"You struggling there dad?\" I queried with a grin. \"Nope. She's as quiet as a rabbit.\" A foot hit his face and I laughed. \"A dangerous rabbit.\" I concluded as he wrestled Sarah into the car. \"Hi, I'm Jean, Frank's daughter. It's nice to meet you finally because he talks about you all the time.\" I said to Sarah who shot me a dark look. \"Sorry about the kidnapping, I thought we should just leave you alone but he thinks that you won't be safe unless we take you with us so…here you are.\" I winked at her as dad strapped her in then revved the engines a little, waiting for dad to get in the passenger seat on my right. Once he was in I pulled away, hitting the highroad where we could make our escape into the next county, though Sarah complained in loud mumbles under her tape. Dad talked to her casually, asking her questions and answering them himself which I found really amusing to listen to. \"Don't get me wrong I know it's crazy.\" Dad said as he flung Sarah's phone out the window. I hope he was going to replace that, because even I know it's almost a federal offence to smash up a girl's phone. \"Don't thing that…that I don't think this-this is crazy.\" He said as he then flung something else out the window but I didn't turn in time to see what it was. \"And it…\" He sighed, shaking his head slightly. \"Couldn't, be more different, than how I'd hoped to meet you for the first time.\" He looked into the rear-view mirror but Sarah just shot him a look. \"But you know, sometimes things happen. And I just hope that someday you and I could be…sitting somewhere…comfortably…and look back at this as the-the great big adventure that it is.\" Sarah started to talk behind her tape which dad had put over her mouth. She mumbled quietly at first but then gradually her voice escalated, rising in volume before she was yelling loudly though nothing was audible, not a single word but still I smirked to myself, amused as she hit her head on the front seat then trailed off in a whine. \"I'm a little hungry too, what should we get?\" Dad asked, his expression perfectly serious. \"Pizza.\" Sarah muttered, the word only just coming out and I nodded my head. \"Sounds good to me.\" I smiled and looked over my shoulder briefly to her. \"Don't worry about all this, it's for your own protection. You'll be perfectly safe with us and once we've sorted this all out then we can bring you back home and you'll never hear from us again if that's what you want.\" She shot me a dark, blazing look which only made me smile further. I like her spirit, at least she stands a good chance of living through this. We drove through the night until we found a motel which we booked a room for to get some rest, though dad explained to me briefly that he had to go out to see someone. \"Who?\" I asked curiously, glancing to Sarah as she glared at us from the bed, freshly tied up. \"Joe.\" He said to me and I smiled instantly. \"Give him my best. Are you sure it's alright to leave her on her own here?\" I questioned cautiously, glancing over again. This girl had a lot of spunk, I wouldn't put it past her to be able to somehow figure her way out of this though dad didn't seem worried. \"Nah, you just go get us some supplies. It's going to be a long trip, I think.\" He said then kissed my head. \"You take care, make sure you keep your face hidden from cameras and pay with cash only.\" \"I know dad.\" I assured him gently. \"It's all under control, I can handle a little shopping trip.\" Kissing his cheek I then waved to Sarah who continued to glare hotly. I left the motel and headed to the nearest shops, dad following me out then took the car to go see an old friend of his. I had met Joe when I was very small and he'd always been wearing a smile. He always remembered my birthday and always sent me a card for Christmas and I did the same, exchanging gifts also. He was like the uncle I never had. I went to the corner shops where there were less cameras, keeping my hair all tucked up under a hat though it made my head pretty hot. I wore a trendy scarf and also a skin adherent which changed the shape of my lips and nose, thinning them as it tightened the skin as if I were wearing a layer of glue. It didn't take me long to buy all the essentials like food and water, though I added some lady essentials just in case Sarah needed them, but then I bought some things that might come in handy like lighters, some cooking oil and other things that could easily be turned into a very useful flash bomb in case we needed a distraction or a strong weapon of attack. All this in hand, I head back to the motel. It was a bright, sunny day, rather warm compared to the frosty streets of New York that I was now used to. It was nearly Christmas and it was like I could go sunbathing in this place. Maybe I should think about moving? Perfectly happy strolling along, it was a few moments before I noticed there were cops and an ambulance at the motel. Hey, that's pretty amazing, Sarah got free! Now dad had seriously struck gold with this one, perhaps we should get her to stick around after this has all blown over. I approached a lone cop car, frowning slightly as the cop who was leading Sarah suddenly grabbed her arm and forced her forwards. \"Just get in the car!\" \"Ow! You're hurting me!\" Sarah was then slammed against the car and the corrupt cop brought out a syringe, sliding it into her arm to knock her out. I slung the rucksack further up my back, containing all the supplies then ran forwards as silently as I could, moving quickly then whistled. \"Hey!\" Standing barely eight feet away I glared at the cop who looked at me then his eyes widened. Instantly he let go of Sarah who stopped screaming and he went to draw his gun so I took a step forwards, already reaching for my own but then something struck him heavily from behind and he dropped like a stone. \"Dad? Nice timing.\" I mused as he pulled out the syringe then tasted the substance. \"Am I gonna die?\" Sarah asked as dad carefully manoeuvred her around. \"No. You just need some sleep.\" He said then nodded to me, gesturing to get in with her so I slid into the front passenger seat, turning to make sure Sarah was comfortable as dad lay her down inside. \"I may vomit.\" She warned and I didn't blame her, she's been through a lot in just a few hours, I'd feel pretty messed up if I were in her shoes. Dad got into the car and we tore away with a screech, Sarah blinking in a daze. \"Wow…it's just like 'Love's Savage Secret'.\" I chuckled, glancing back to make sure she was okay. We drove down the street a little faster than the speed limit, Sarah continuing to blink at dad. \"Wow, I am high .\" She announced and I chuckled, shaking my head. \"You've got such beautiful green eyes.\" She said to dad and I glanced at him. \"See? Told you she'd come around.\" I said to him but not a moment later, someone slammed into us. Instantly I gripped on, feeling the car spin around violently as dad locked the wheel, letting it ride then looked at me. \"Take it.\" He said then opened the door. Instantly I leaned over and kept the wheel locked, allowing the car to continue spinning as dad stepped out and neatly walked forwards, lifting his gun and aimed for the black SUV, whose driver didn't take much guessing. Cooper. I turned around, making sure Sarah wasn't hurt as the car finally stopped. \"Sarah? Sarah can you hear me?\" I questioned and she looked up at me with wide eyes, sitting up slightly to see dad following after the retreating car as it backed into a lamppost. \"How did…\" I slid back as dad returned, letting him take control of the car again as Sarah whistled under her breath. \"You really are CIA.\" \"Sarah are you hurt?\" I asked her, trying to get something sensible from her but she merely grinned. \"I'm great! How are you?\" Maybe she should just go to sleep. Then she'll feel a whole lot better. \"Get us out of here dad.\" I murmured and he nodded his head. \"No problem.\" He answered, spinning the car around then drove quickly away. He picked up the radio then began to speak into it. \"Officer down, we're at the north pier and suspect is a white male, thirties, black suit and tie, dark hair.\" I have to hand it to him, my dad is the coolest guy ever. We hurtled down the street before he screeched to a halt then leaped out as I did the same. \"Come on, we need to get moving.\" He said as he lifted Sarah out the car and carried her as she was finally asleep. \"Where's the car?\" I asked him and he gestured forwards. \"That way.\" I ran beside him, hand ready to go for my weapon but as we reached a corner I let him drag back, slowly sliding around to check that the coast was clear before running back towards the motel. Dad had parked a block away so we got in and he drove us away. I sat in the back with Sarah, making sure she didn't throw up or anything, resting her head against my shoulder as I sighed. \"Do you have any idea who wants you dead?\" I asked him quietly, looking at him with a serious expression that I had long since adopted from him. He glanced into the rear-view mirror then shook his head. \"No. But we're going to find out. Joe found out that whoever wants us dead killed a New York Time's reporter. Stephanie Chan.\" I sat up slightly. \"I know Stephanie, we went to college together and she did a story on my newest book. She's dead?\" Dad nodded his head. \"Sorry.\" This time I shook my head, taking a deep breath as I pictured Stephanie, dark hair always cropped neatly in a bob, eyes twinkling with mischief. She always loved a juicy story, even when we were studying in college. This time it seems she got herself in too deep and she's paid for it with her life. I can't imagine her poor mother and what she must be going through. As far as I was aware, Mrs Chan was a widower, to lose her only child must be heart wrenching. Turning I looked out the window, watching the streets fly away as my mind spiralled into deep thoughts. There was nothing I could think of that gave any indication to label Stephanie as dangerous. Though somehow those thoughts then turned to Cooper. He was a persistent bastard, wasn't he? I don't think he'll ever give up this chase, not until we're all dead or he's been shot through the head, which I was more than happy to do if it meant Sarah and dad were safe. However at that thought, I felt slightly saddened. It was definitely a shame to have to ruin a face like that. Maybe I'll cast him in my next book, because even I'm woman enough to admit. William Cooper was one damn good looking agent.[Chapter 4] I know it's ben a massive wait and I'm so sorry about that, so much has been going on and I kind of lost my train of thought for this story, I had the largest writer's block ever however I think I might have a couple of ideas as to what to do with it, so I'll try it out and see what happens though I may end up making adjustments and rewriting parts. Mrs Chan ended up crying in my arms when we turned up at her small apartment. She knew of me however we'd never really officially met before but she seemed to appreciate the fact that I'd came to offer my condolences for Stephanie. \"She used to talk about you, Jean. You were a good friend to her, thank you so much for helping her through college, especially when it became difficult for her to cope.\" She said as I held her hand and rubbed her back tenderly. \"Stephanie always made me laugh, she had the greatest sense of humour.\" I agreed. \"I'm sorry that this happened, but I promise we're here to help. We want to know what happened to Stephanie as much as you do and we think we can do more to help than the police.\" Mrs Chan nodded her head, drying her eyes. \"They told me it was a break in gone wrong, but nothing was stolen.\" My dad and Sarah sat quietly, looking sympathetic as I dealt with Mrs Chan, doing my best not to upset her further. She had just lost her only daughter, I didn't want to cause her anymore distress. However just like Stephanie, her mother was a tough cookie. She dried her eyes then showed us a postcard she'd received from her daughter the day she had died. Immediately I recognised the numbers as being a book code for the library at the college we studied in. Dad must have clocked it as well because he instantly glanced my way when he saw them. \"Thank you Mrs Chan. I promise we'll get to the bottom of what happened and we'll keep in contact.\" I said to her as I stood. \"If there's anything you need, make sure to call me.\" I leaned forwards and kissed her cheek, drawing her in for one last hug before we had to go. \"Looks like you're going back to college.\" Dad murmured to me and I nodded my head. \"I'll get you guys in pretty quickly, I spent most of my college life in that library so they'll let me in without question.\" I said to them as we walked back to the car with a fast pace. \"I won't hang around though, it's a little too risky for the three of us to be together. If something happens then I'll be your backup, okay?\" \"Sure thing, just be careful okay?\" Dad said to me as we climbed into the car so I shot him a grin. \"Question.\" Sarah stated, lifting her hand and we both turned around in our seats to look back at her as she sat comfortably in the back seat. \"How come you're like a professional spy when you don't even work for the CIA?\" She asked and I began to explain. \"Well it all started with dad teaching me how to box, then I just got into the martial arts so I trained in all kinds of styles. Then there was military summer camp where I'd go on training weeks and they taught me how to handle rifles and stuff like that. Everything else I learned from dad. He taught me all kinds of stuff over the years to help me with my writing and although I'll never be quite as good as he is at his job, I'm not too bad myself.\" \"Don't be so hard on yourself, you'd be an asset to the CIA if you wanted to be. You know they've been asking about you enrolling for the past five years.\" Dad said to me but I only shrugged in reply. \"I prefer writing. I like it when all the action stays on the page and doesn't try to jump out and kill me.\" Dad inclined his head in agreement, having no real argument about it as we drove to the college, Sarah leaning forwards from the back to talk with us. \"This is kind of cool I guess, I feel like I've walked into my own movie.\" She said with a blissful sigh. \"My life was beginning to get pretty boring until you guys showed up. Maybe this is a sign it was meant to be.\" She continued to chat and I joined in, happily engaging in conversation where we talked shoes, shops and past relationships. I especially enjoyed that, Sarah had had some really whacky boyfriends and even worse dates, they put all mine to shame. Dad and Sarah went into the college alone after I'd called ahead to the library on a safe phone to ask that they let my dad and Sarah through as a favour. I sat in the car with a disguise, tapping my thumbs against the steering wheel a few blocks away from dad, however I began to receive this creepy sense of trepidation, almost as if someone was watching me. I looked around but saw nothing out of the ordinary so I dismissed it, however I turned on the engine just be safe, my eyes scanning my surroundings inconspicuously. When I noticed two guys walking towards my car wearing smart suits and carrying briefcases, looking like ordinary office workers, I became suspicious. Slowly I nudged the car forwards, watching them out of the corner of my eye and sure enough, when it seemed like I was about to pull away, they bolted straight towards me. Without hesitation I slammed my foot against the accelerator and bolted, flying out onto the busy street, ignoring the angry horns that blared after me as I took a sharp left and tried to escape for freedom. Within seconds I had SUVs after me including a helicopter above. Crap, I'm in huge trouble. I don't do car chases, I can only fight straight up front. I really need dad here for this kind of thing. Sirens began to wail and ahead I saw police cars beginning to block the road so I swerved, slamming a palm against the horn to warn people that were crossing a road and I drove straight towards them, hearing them scream and quickly part like the red sea. There were a few crashes behind me and I glanced in my rear-view mirror to see a small pile up of cop cars and one of the SUVs however several more broke through and came roaring after me. Eyes glued to the road I grit my teeth slightly as I wove in and out of traffic, knocking a few cars out of the way when they failed to move fast enough, creating a huge mess of car wrecks in my wake. I managed to get out of sight of the SUVs so I quickly flung open the door and stepped out as the car swerved, spiralling awesomely as I walked away and into the throng of people, disappearing as the car turned on its side and ended up wrapping itself around a lamppost which dropped, smashing into the ground as the SUVs came hurtling around the corner and screeched to a halt upon finding the wreck. I kept my head down, ducking quickly into the thick mass of people and took off my wig, the thick blonde of my hair tied up as I turned the wig inside out so that the black became ginger and I also turned my coat around the other way, specially made so that the smart beige coat became a black jacket. Once my transformation was complete I stood up properly and craned my neck, pretending to be interested in what was happening but when officers began to move us along, I walked away slowly, hesitating to look back once more to try and see what was going on before I was forced to continue. My heart was racing in my chest, thinking about what had just happened. How did they find me? Did they know dad was here too? What should I do? Knowing full well that it would be dangerous for me to try and get into contact with dad at this moment, I settled for simply blending in with the people around me, steadily making my way away from the college and library as to make sure that no traces led back to that place. The general flow of people seemed to thin down as I turned down onto a narrower street, the business of the traffic behind me slowly dying away as I kept my head slightly bowed. A guy sat in among the dumpsters in ragged clothing so I instinctively pulled out my purse and handed him some cash, giving a small smile as I handed him a ten dollar bill then moved along, his bewildered eyes staring at the money before they turned to my back as I continued to walk away. I tried to plan my next move. I guess I could try contacting dad somehow but how would I do that without getting noticed by the cops or the CIA? Phones were out and they could have eyes on me this very moment and I wouldn't know. I walked around the corner, still deep in thought and only halted when I heard the click of multiple guns. Instantly my hands shot up into the air in surrender, looking forwards at the rather extravagant number of agents that had all their weapons aimed at me ready to fire, entering around and behind me also as I remained perfectly still, taking deep breaths as a familiar figure stepped out into view. William Cooper. My eyes flickered to a machine gun and several snipers up on the rooftops, making me snort slightly and lift and eyebrow. \"Really?\" Cooper's eyes followed upwards and he gave a little smirk. \"Can't take any chances with Frank Moses's daughter.\" He explained as he stepped cautiously closer, his own handgun trained on me. \"Now let's make this nice and easy. Keep your hands where I can see them, slowly turn around and let us take you in nice and quiet. This doesn't have anything to do with you, we just want to ask a few questions.\" \"Will the interrogation include guns or just the handcuffs?\" I questioned sassily as I slowly began to turn around. Headcount, twelve with six birds on the roof and the chopper overhead. There was very little or nothing I could do at this precise moment so I'll just have to play along. My body was slammed against the wall and my arms ripped back to be locked together roughly, however Cooper quickly ordered his men to be a little more careful and I watched him out of the corner of my eye. He was quiet, standing there observing the whole thing as I quietly allowed myself to be arrested and escorted to one of the SUVs, ducking my head as I was forced into the car before we drove off. Cooper was in the car in front, leaving me with the driver and three other guys with my hands firmly locked behind my back. \"You'll have to do my seatbelt.\" I announced to them however they just looked at me funny. \"I can't do my seatbelt by myself so you have to do it for me. What if we have an accident? I'll go flying through that window then I'm pretty sure I won't be answering any questions.\" I reasoned smartly however the bald headed guy next to me snapped back in irritation. \"Just shut up.\" So I remained silent. My eyes glanced from side to side then up into the rear-view mirror. There were four cars in total. One in front and the other two behind. This is looking tricky, what the heck am I supposed to do now? Just go with the flow I supposed, there's no point in trying to escape and get shot in the process, dad wouldn't be too happy about that at all. After a while one of the guys drew out a small case and opened it to reveal a serum in a syringe with a sharp needle, making my skin begin to tingle and crawl as I looked at it. Something set alarm bells in my head. If I let them put that stuff in me, I'll never wake up again. \"What's that?\" I questioned suspiciously however they didn't answer. \"The other guy grabbed me, making me yell out in defiance as the other grasped my wrist and started to insert the needle however I flung my foot up in a vicious kick, causing blood to open out down his face and the syringe fell from his hand as he yelled. I lifted up my upper body and slid my cuffed hands underneath as I rammed my head against the other guy with a yell as the agent in the passenger seat whirled around only to meet my foot in his face. My hands now free I grabbed the syringe and stuck it into my attackers neck, making him yell painfully in my ear as I squeezed some of the clear liquid into his system then yanked back my elbow, jerking it straight up the other's nose as the driver swerved left and right, losing control as I continued to lash out with my feet, keeping them all off me as best I could. \"Stun her! Knock her out! Something!\" They were yelling and screaming as I struggled against a head restraint, my teeth gritting until I managed to hook my foot forwards in the wheel and yanked it to the side, forcing the car to swerve violently and the guy to my left had his head smash through the window, knocking him out effectively and released me from his hold so that I could swing open the door and leaped for freedom, flying through the air as the others yelled behind me just as gunfire opened on the car, smashing through the windscreen and it flipped onto its side before rolling, crushing everything in its wake as I landed on the bonnet of a car, wrenching my shoulder and I yelped from the pain as the car screeched to a halt, the driver staring at me with wide eyes as I lay motionless for a while, dazed. Sirens wailed and the other SUVs ground to a halt, the one in front with Cooper having stopped and the agent was running towards me as I continued to lay perfectly still, unable to open my eyes enough to see outward. In my hand I could still feel me gripping the serum they had tried to inject into me, holding onto it for dear life. \"Hey! What the hell happened?!\" Cooper demanded, turning me over slowly though he still kept a gun trained on me. I think I mumbled something but not even I understood what I said so Cooper had no chance. Seeing that I was injured he slid his gun away and lifted me up slightly, checking my vitals before he yelled for an ambulance. By this point I was blinking myself awake, eyes searching the vast whiteness before me until slowly Cooper's face came into faint recognition. \"Hey, stay awake. You're not off the hook yet.\" He warned me in an echoing voice that hardly registered in my head. \"You're going to be okay.\" \"Cooper…\" I managed to force out his name before I shifted my hand and pressed the serum against his chest. \"Bastards…tried…to…kill me.\" And that was all I managed before the world went dark.[Chapter 5] I'M BACK AGAIN! And also, I bring with me another chapter! Yay! This one is a little longer than the last one thankfully and I hope you enjoy it ;) thank you to those who reviewed! My senses slowly came together once again, hearing the blip of my heart rate as it continued slowly in my chest, regularly breathing deeply though my chest hurt from doing so. My entire left side felt like it had been electrified before being hit by a truck and as I lay there, I kept my eyes closed to try and fall back asleep however I then became aware of a presence in the room with me. I must be in a hospital because I could feel myself wearing the hospital gown and the bed wasn't the most comfortable of things, also everything smelled so sterile. There were several leads attached to my body however when I felt something cold and heavy around my wrists, I realised I'd been handcuffed to the bed. Damn it. \"Miss Moses, are you awake?\" Cooper's sexy voice came into mind and I slowly opened my eyes, blinking once or twice before my vision focused in on him standing at the corner of my bed near my feet, eyes watching me carefully with his pretty eyes. \"Miss Moses?\" \"I'm awake. So screw you.\" I answered in a lazy snap, giving a sigh though I winced at doing so. \"You've broken several ribs and have severe bruising to your left side.\" He informed me in a surprisingly gentle tone. No Jean, no compliments about the enemy. They are not to be messed with. \"Also you dislocated your shoulder so the doctors had to put it back in whilst you were unconscious.\" \"Why am I here?\" I asked him wearily, laying almost completely still with my head only just turned towards him. \"This has nothing to do with me, whatever it is.\" \"You are your father's daughter and my boss viewed you as a threat, so I was instructed to bring you in.\" He replied, stepping closer as a small smile touched the corner of his mouth, his eyes still warm and inviting and the blip gave a little jolt on the monitor, making me feel wholly embarrassed. Don't be fooled Jean, he's just going to interrogate you for information in a way he thinks will work. Stay strong. \"Though it was requested I bring you in all in one piece.\" \"Great job maestro.\" I snorted slightly, looking away. \"Your men could use a little more training. They're sloppy and a shame to the CIA.\" Cooper was silent for a while but I refused to look back at him. Don't make eye contact, talk as little as possible and don't give anything away. I hardly know anything about this whole mess except for the fact these jerks are trying to kill my father. \"Miss Moses, that serum you were holding. How did you come by it?\" Cooper asked and I frowned at him, arching an eyebrow. \"Your fellas tried to stick me with it. Why?\" His eyes darkened slightly as he looked down at me. \"I had it analysed on a hunch and found it was a neurotoxin. The dosage would have been fatal even to a fully matured adult male.\" He described and I smirked inwardly. I knew there had been something fishy going on with that serum. The whole situation is just wrong. \"Also I went back to the scene of the accident. Upon further inspection, it appears that your vehicle was fired upon just moments you escaped. Someone was targeting you.\" \"Doesn't that set off alarm bells in your head? This is more than just a simple kill and hide job. They're targeting my dad and they're targeting me when I haven't done anything. Isn't it time you started asking questions?\" Cooper looked down at me blankly. \"I'm paid to shoot, not ask.\" I rolled my eyes slightly. Typical. They don't make agents like they used to. Old fashioned who throw out the rulebook and follow their gut instincts instead of just doing whatever it is they're ordered to do. \"Listen, if there's any information on your father you can tell us, it might very well save his life. All we want to do is bring him in but we can't do that if he's constantly making things worse for himself.\" Cooper began but I just shot him a dirty look. \"Save your breath, Cooper. I'm not saying anything. Primarily because I don't know anything. I don't know where he is, I don't know what he's planning and I most certainly don't know why the hell you guys are still trying to kill him. You're all such jerks. He's retired . He's not a threat to anyone but then you guys come along and basically destroy his house. It's nearly Christmas for god's sake.\" \"Miss Moses, I really don't think you understand…\" \"And stop calling me that, my name is Jean. 'Miss Moses' makes me sound like an old lady.\" I muttered tiredly as I lay back my head further into the pillows of the hospital bed. \"Now leave me alone. I'm tired of all this crap.\" Cooper hesitated, looking like he wanted to continue the conversation but I shot him another frosty look and he decided to call it quite. \"Alright, but I'll be back. Until then I suggest you refrain from trying to escape. We don't want any further injuries to be added to the list.\" He said however I only arched an eyebrow. He makes it sound like all this was my fault. I cannot wait to get out of these cuffs so I can pummel him a little as payback. He paused slightly, glancing over to the monitor before leaning closer and slipped something into my left hand, making me tense immediately as he fingers curled over mine. \"If you feel like talking about your father then just give me a call. I'll come running.\" He said with a little smirk, making me eye him warily as I felt the panic button being left in my grasp. Was this in case someone tried to kill me again? \"Are you literally flirting with the enemy?\" I asked him bluntly but he just smiled handsomely. Oh god, that smile. Why is everything about him just so goddamn sexy? This is totally unfair, he has a distinct advantage over me now. \"Rest easy Miss Moses, I promise everything will be alright.\" \"Leave my dad alone. He's not a threat.\" I answered back then looked away. \"Just go away already, you people make me sick. All you do is take orders like some dumb lapdog and never question your instincts. You just shoot whatever target gets pointed at.\" \"Can't help it if it's my job Miss…\" \"It's Jean! Didn't I say get out of here?\" I demanded, giving him the angriest look I could muster so he nodded his head and left without another word. The moment the door closed the room plummeted into frost. It felt chilly, as if he'd taken all the warmth with him. My eyes turned down to the panic button he'd given me, wondering what it was he was planning. Was he trying to isolate me so that I'd become desperate for human interaction and call him? Like that's going to work. I send most of my time alone with only Tinsel my pet cat. Really the only time I see someone else is when I visit dad or when I'm talking to my publisher. Jeez, I haven't even gone on a date in four years. What's wrong with me? I should probably try getting out more. I hear I have a lot of fans who want to meet me, maybe I should agree to a book signing or something? It'll be about time I suppose. Still, I've always liked the quiet life but something inside me wonders what it would be like to come home and have someone waiting for you, or for you to be the one waiting for someone to come home. That must be nice. With a sigh I closed my eyes and allowed myself to blissfully sink into the morphine which was keeping the edge of the pain at bay from my chest, allowing me to rest some more however after about a couple of hours, I suddenly snapped awake as my senses became hyper aware. It was dark and there was no one about, however I couldn't shake this warning feeling I had. Lifting my hands I felt the handcuffs still and cursed inwardly. What kind of idiot would cuff me to a bed when it was obviously clear that someone wanted me dead just because I'm my father's daughter? Honestly. I was under the impression that these Central Intelligence agents were supposed to be intelligent. Looking down I began to try and work one of the cuffs off my wrists, twisting and writhing slightly however they stuck fast, causing me to slump with an irritated sigh. Soft footfalls sounded outside and the handle of the door began to lower so I instantly pressed my eyes shut, feigning sleep though I looked out through a crack of my lids, watching as a hidden figure stepped into the room. My heart began to race as they approached slowly so I stayed perfectly still until they were standing at my side just by my feet and I heard a gun click. \"Shame. You're a pretty looking one as well.\" \"I also kick ass.\" I said and the guy started in surprise. My eyes flew open and I swung my leg to the side, giving a yell as my foot sent the gun flying across the room as my foot then hooked itself into the man's jacket and I hauled him forwards, quickly locking both my legs around his neck to restrain him as I looked down at my panic button then crushed it with my thumb, sending sirens wailing in the room and red lights flashed as the button began to blink at me as well. \"You dumb bitch!\" \"Ha, I've been called worse.\" I snorted, holding him down as he began to struggle against me. \"Now in about thirty seconds federal agents are going to bust through those doors. How would you like to say hello?\" I suggested however the strain on my chest was beginning to kill me and I could feel the pain screaming through me as my ribs protested at this pressure. Without further encouragement the guy threw off my grip and bolted for the door, escaping through it as I relaxed and let my head roll back against the pillows. This has not been my day. I probably won't live to see the morning at this point, I desperately need to get out of here. Sure enough moments later agents came bursting through the door, demanding to know what happened to I told them someone had come in and tried to shot me. \"We'll check the cameras. Circle the building! Find that guy, he needs to answer a couple of questions.\" The woman in charge ordered before coming over to me. \"Are you hurt? Tell me exactly what happened.\" I mumbled a few things at her before demanding for some more medication, feeling like my chest was on fire so she called for the nurse. \"Also…I kinda need the bathroom.\" I said, wriggling a little in the bed. \"Is there any chance you could let me go to the restroom?\" The woman looked at me blankly. \"I've been ordered not to let you out of those handcuffs. I'm afraid you'll have to suck up your pride and just pee into a bowl or whatever it is you have to do.\" That sounded disgusting, there's no way I'm doing that when my legs work perfectly fine. Still, I had spotted the keys in her pocket, they were hanging out slightly and threatening to fall. \"Well that's just stupid, how am I supposed to escape from a secure location like this? I'm not even a trained cop, let alone an agent, I can only just about throw a couple of good punches!\" I argued in irritation at her. \"This has got to be a violation of my rights. You're holding me against my will without a warrant or just cause!\" \"Orders are orders, ma'am.\" Again with the ma'am and the Miss. It makes me sound old! \"You guys are corrupt assholes.\" I muttered under my breath, eyes glancing towards the keys once more. \"Anyway, call Cooper. I want to talk to him.\" I said and the woman looked at me in surprise before nodding in acceptance. As she pulled out her phone and called up Cooper, my foot slowly inched towards the keys, lifting over the bed rails as she turned her back to me. My toes wiggled slightly to loosen them up and I crept towards my goal, watching and waiting until I gripped onto them securely and carefully drew them out. As the agent spoke on the phone I drew my foot back under the covers, smirking inwardly as I held the keys in my grasp. \"He's on his way. He'll be here in twenty minutes so just sit tight until then. He'll want to know what happened.\" She said to me and I nodded my head just as the nurse came in, all smiling and seemed perfectly oblivious to the agent there. \"Hello Miss Moses! How are we feeling this evening?\" Maybe I should get a tattoo on my forehead that says 'My Name Is Jean, Not MISS!' and then perhaps people will get the message. The agent left and I waited a couple of minutes for the nurse to give me some painkillers before I poked the keys out on the end of the bed. \"By the way, the agent said I could get up and go to the bathroom and stretch my legs a little if I wanted. Could you do me a huge favour and unlock the cuffs for me please?\" \"Oh sure! No problem at all.\" She beamed and I almost laughed at the ridiculousness of it all. She uncuffed me from the bed and I sat up properly, wringing my wrists to encourage blood circulation. \"Seems a little strange though to cuff you to a bed, it's not like you're dangerous or anything!\" She laughed before walking towards the door. \"I'm just going to fill out some medical sheets so that we know exactly what painkillers you've had then I'll be back, okay?\" \"Okay, thanks again!\" I said with a smile, swinging my legs carefully over the side then stood up. Now for the great escape. I shuffled towards the door after the nurse had gone, looked around then stepped outside, beginning to walk towards the bathroom. I actually really did need to go. They were all so suspicious around here. Oh well. Now that I'm up I may as well try and escape. I managed to sneak off the floor and down the back stairs, heading for the accident and emergency area where the ambulances were coming and going with wailing sirens. It was too perfect. I slipped forwards and checked for cameras, waiting until someone was walking past before slipping away, climbed into the back of an ambulance then hid myself away. It was hard to get comfortable on account of my ribs, however I managed to settled down and when the ambulance pulled away, I relaxed the further we drove from the hospital until I could hear the busy streets outside. The ride was bumpy and I was constantly being jerked about however when we stopped, I quickly had to open the back and run for my life, fleeing the scene and head straight into the darkness still only wearing a hospital gown and no shoes. Dammit, now what was I supposed to do? I can't go around practically naked all about New York! I could try Mrs Chan but I doubted I'd be able to get to her place without being seen and I don't have any of my disguises with me. I'm in a real fix here. Walking down the street I tried to plan my next move, however when I noticed a group of men coming towards me I stopped and thought about crossing the street but by that point, they'd spotted me. \"Yo check dis out man, we got a girl wearing a cloth for a dress!\" One of them called, a mixture of dark skinned and white men, all of them big, buff and a little intimidating as I began to shrink back. Were they a gang? Were they a threat to me? I knew the streets at this time of night were dangerous with high weapon rates and attacks on vulnerable citizens had only gone up in the past years. I could feel the sweat beginning to drip down my neck as my heart began to race. \"Hey back off all of you, don't frighten the poor girl.\" One of the Africanise guys said as he stepped forwards, slipping off his jacket and draped it around me, making me blink in surprise. \"What you doing out here dressed like that? You'll get sick.\" \"I'm uh…kind of trying to hide from some people who were trying to kill me.\" I admitted, pulling the jacket closer around me for warmth. \"So it might not be a good idea to get too close, I might get you in trouble.\" \"Nah, don't worry about that. We can look after ourselves.\" One of the other guys said as they all crowded around me, putting scarves around my neck and a hat went on my head as the snow began to fall. \"Look at you girl, you're all barefoot and shivering. You gotta have an interesting story.\" I gave a grin. \"You have no idea.\" \"Well, we'll get you someplace warm and find you some clothes. It's Christmas and we can't leave a cute girl like you out here. Right?\" There was a nod of agreement and my instincts quietened down, telling me I could trust these guys and one of them actually stooped down and lifted me onto his back, carrying me so that my feet wouldn't get cold in the snow. \"Thank you so much, this is really cool of you guys.\" I said to them and we all began to chat, the guys sounding like totally awesome dudes. They told me their names and that they were actually a gang but they were the good sort. They're like this superhero squad that protected the people of the city by just hanging out in the streets late at night where they could supress the other gangs as much as possible. They told me some of their stories how they'd grown up in bad circles but wanted to change themselves so they formulated this gang so they could be a good influence for the city and apparently, the network was beginning to stretch further and further as more people got involved. Kind of like a neighbourhood watch for the streets. It was amazing, I couldn't believe this was actually real. They brought me to one of the shelters for the homeless where I was given new clothes, shoes, a hot meal and they stuck around until they were sure I was safe and had a place to sleep and I make a mental note of all their details, planning to pull up their files later so I could maybe see if there was something I could do to help them. I lay in a cot that night, feeling warm and fuzzy though a little uncomfortable due to my ribs but I was so happy about my freedom that I couldn't help but go to sleep with a smile.

With a gross tonnage of 32, 336, she matched her contemporary, the MS Bremen. She was 697 feet long, had nine decks and a passenger complement of 751 passengers: 1,122, 287, or 275 in 1st class; 126 in 2nd class; 338 in 3rd class. The interior included a grand-sized ballroom with crystal chandeliers, an Olympic- sized swimming pool, a gymnasium, a library, several fine lounges in the new Minimalist style, and a large cargo hold. She had two boilers and four steam turbines with a maximum output of 60,000 HP rendering a maximum speed of 26 knots. Economical output of 53,500 HP gave a useful speed of 23 knots. Three 1,375 KVA Generators had an output of 6,600 kilowatt. One very noticeable feature was her drop-shaped funnel. To enhance comfort, two 5.0 m Stabilizers were fitted. In June 1959 she underwent new sea trials. Also in June of 1959, she was placed on the Bremerhaven/Southampton/Cherbourg/New York route. In 1960, the Lorelei was capable of carrying 30,000 passengers per year from Europe, across the North Atlantic to New York, occasionally crossing paths with the Italian Line's (Italia di Navigazione) the T/n Antonia Graza . The following year she was also placed in cruise service to the Caribbean and South America. On the 19th of May, 1962 the Lorelei floundered after an explosion in the boiler room on the starboard side. Approximately one-third of her length from the bow were blown to bits. The blast destroyed three passenger cabins, numbers 53, 54 and 55, to a depth of nearly 40 feet (12 m), and the keel. The explosion also destroyed many occupied passenger cabins and, at the lower levels, ripped open several of Lorelei's watertight compartments. The blast ruptured five fuel tanks on Lorelei's starboard side and filled them with 500 tons of seawater. Air was trapped in the empty tanks on the port side, contributing to a severe list. The ship's large fuel tanks were mostly empty at the time of the collision, since the ship was nearing the end of her voyage, but all the empty fuel tanks did was further increase the list, and she tipped to her starboard side and sank into the ocean. She issued a distress call off the coast of Labrador, which was answered by the Antonia Graza , who reported only one survivor; a Mr. Jack Ferriman of New York, whom they rescued along with several crates of gold salvaged from the cargo hold. Efforts to find the Lorelei after she sank were immediately launched, based on the coordinates wired to the nearest port by the Graza , but no trace of the wreckage of the Lorelei , her 723 passengers, 300 crew were ever found, neither was the ship that reported the accident, the Antonia Graza , which disappeared on May 21st, 1962, carrying 625 passengers, 500 crew members, Mr. Jack Ferriman, and the recovered gold. The Antonia Graza had a gross tonnage of 29,1000 tons and was 697 feet long. It had three decks and a passenger complement of 218 first class, 320 cabin class and 703 tourist class. The ship was powered by a Parson Geared turbine engine and could reach 23 knots. The interior included a grand-sized ballroom with crystal chandeliers, swimming pool, grand dining room and wall-sized murals by Gio Patito. The Antonia Graza was built in 1957 and provided elegant traveling for five years until it was reported missing on May 25, 1962 off Labrador. At the time of its disappearance, it was only carrying about 625 passengers. No message from the ship was ever recorded. The Graza was found 40 years later in November of 2002 floating, derelict, in the middle of the Bering Strait. A salvage boat, the Arctic Warrior , discovered the boat when a pilot from Anchorage, Alaska spotted her on one of his routine flights. The crew of the Warrior found her, according to sole survivor of the salvage trip, Maureen Epps. Ms. Epps also reported finding no trace of any bodies, save for the skeletal remains of a young girl hanging in her closet, believed by Epps to be a young Ms. Katherine Harwood, who vanished along with the Graza. The crew also found the gold salvaged from the Lorelei , along with signs that Epps believed meant that the crew murdered the passengers (bullet holes in the swimming pool and several gallons of rat poison strewn about the kitchen, and the forward boom cable was tampered with, having snapped and possible sliced across the deck of the ship) Ms. Epps' crew was lost when the Warrior exploded due to a faulty gas tank, and the rest in the haste to try to repair the quickly sinking ship so they could sail her back to Alaska. The ship exploded accidentally when they were attempting to rid the Graza's boiler room of water. Captain Sean Murphy, Eldon Greer, Eugene Dodge, Hector Munder and Alejandro Santos were lost when she went down. Ms. Epps floated for days in the Strait when she was picked up by a Russian passenger ship, the St. Peter and brought to safety on the mainland. The St. Peter was reported missing, along with the recovered gold from the Graza , on November 3rd, 2002. Records show no sign of a Mr. Jack Ferriman living in New York in 1962, nor aboard the Lorelei.

So I'm not quite sure where exactly this idea came from but then again as odd as it may sound – inspiration has a nasty habit of finding me, late at night when I should be sleeping! Anyways feel free to leave a review because feedback makes me day! Constructive criticism is also welcomed but please don't be rude. There's already enough hate on the internet and I mean there's absolutely no need for anymore. Nevertheless, thank you so much for taking the time to read this! And without further ado – enjoy chapter 1… \"So how do I look?\" As I gingerly put my golden, diamond-studded earrings on, I waste no time in turning around to face my little sister. Smiling softly at her, I speak in the same tone our mother would have used when complementing us, \"You look just beautiful Katie! Mother did an amazing job with that dress.\" Picking up the skirt of her dress, Katie blushes slightly before hesitantly approaching the mirror only to gracefully twirl in front of it, \"I think so too! Mother really knew what she was doing with this one.\" I take a second to study my little sister. Even at the early age of twelve, she's already looking like a porcelain doll. Everyone sees it and even I can't ignore how lovely a child she is. Not only is she the favored sibling when it comes to our grandparents but she is also the light of our mother's eyes. Am I jealous? A little but I love my sister and nothing will ever change that… Grabbing a nearby hairbrush off the table of our vanity mirror, I begin to brush her hair in the mirror as I stare at her reflection. Taking in each and every breathing-taking aspect of her beauty, I begin to brush. Her features are soft and youthful with a thin build. She has a deep hazel eyes and an adorable button-like nose, and she also has long flowing brown hair which already has a natural tint of red in it. And tonight she wears a tea-length pastel-blue taffeta dress with a lacy organza overlay. Her matching colored shoes look positively perfect as they complement her dress rather nicely. \"Amanda, did you hear me?\" The sound of Katie's voice sends me crashing back to reality. As I blink a few times and sheepishly shake my head at her words, I notice the soft frown which takes root on her lips. Sighing I place the hairbrush back where I found it before apologizing instantly, \"I'm sorry Katie. I'm just a little nervous right now. I have a lot of things on my mind, and not to mention you are my main responsibility.\" My little sister merely nods her head and I can see the guilt as it gradually begins to form in her eyes, \"I know – it's alright. I'm sorry for frowning. I just wanted to know if you were interested in heading up to the main deck, before heading to the dining room to eat dinner.\" \"That sounds perfect,\" I smile as I look at my own reflection in the mirror and begin to self-consciously eye myself. My features – much like Katie's – are very soft. I was blessed with beautiful rosy cheeks and naturally high cheekbones. I have large, doe-like eyes and – just like father – my eyes are a light emerald-green color! I have full even-shaped lips, and I'm very petite in size. Five foot – one to be precise… My dress – unlike Katie's – hadn't been hand sewn by our mother. Instead it had been bought in a boutique by our grandmother. She had insisted I let her make me a dress but unlike mother, our grandmother isn't very good at sewing. Besides she hadn't sewn a dress in years. Anyways the gown I wear tonight is a stunning golden color, and the bottom half is decorated with the glittery designs of roses. Something I found just delightful! The off-the-shoulder part of my dress is made of cream-colored organza, and is pinned in the front by three pearls of varying sizes. My evening gloves match the color and material of the dress's shoulders. Twirling around in it, I cannot help but smile as I feel my hair spin with it. Tonight I am wearing it down for Katie insists it looks just delightful, since it is both wavy and curly. Also while parted in the middle at the front of my head, two locks of hair hang loose and frame the sides of my face. Some of my hair is swept back and pulled into a large sock bun. Hanging from my ears are two small diamond earrings, which I know for a fact will twinkle in the moonlight. Seeing as Katie is sitting on the edge of the bed with her legs dangling off of it, and her feet swaying back and forth – I can see she is getting impatient. Making my way over to the wooden-made, gorgeously polished suite door – I open it before looking over at Katie with a bright smile. As I put my hand out to her, I can't help but feel the annoying rush of butterflies in my stomach, \"Shall we get going dear?\" Nodding her head eagerly, Katie jumps to her feet before running over to me in excitement. Suddenly she stops and by the look in her eyes – I can tell she's forgot something, \"Oh wait – I need to get my word puzzle!\" Skipping over to a nearby nightstand, Katie opens the drawer before pulling out the word puzzle only to return to me moments later. Locking arms with her, I lead her out of the bedroom and into the hallway. Locking the door with the golden colored room key, I make a mental note of which room were staying in. After all it's my job to play mother until we get to New York. \" A-404, A-404, A-404…\" OoooooooooooooooooooooooO The grand Mezzanine deck looked simply marvelous tonight! It had been decorated exquisitely, and the sound of Francesca's voice was just divine. Even though tonight she sounded so much more lively and energetic then she did most nights, it only made her singing all the more enjoyable. Katie and I sat in a secluded area, watching as the adults danced in merriment. The prominent frown on her face was bluntly obvious but honestly, I hadn't the slightest idea what to do? I myself was bored and so how on Earth was I supposed to help Katie, when I couldn't even help myself? Huffing in annoyance I stood up and allowed a sad smile to grace my features, \"I'm sorry.\" Breaking away from her thoughts, Katie glanced up at me. I could just tell by the way she tilted her head to the side that she was perplexed to say the least, \"Whatever for? It isn't your fault this ship isn't all I thought it would be.\" \"Yes but I'm sorry I'm not making things any easier. I should be at least trying to make this night a memorable one! And so far, all I've done is sit here and stare at the sky,\" frowning in thought I sighed gloomily \"please forgive me?\" The young twelve-year old let out a soft laugh as she kindly shook her head, picking my chin up with her hand before softly running her thumb against my cheek, \"Amanda you're doing a wonderful job! I mean who else would've spent so much time, caring whether or not I was enjoying my night?\" I nodded my head as a bitter thought comes to mind, \"Well, mother would have…\" \"Yes well, mother isn't here right now – is she? Now why don't you just go and enjoy yourself and I'll be right here when you come?\" Katie suggested in a sweet tone. I had to say the idea was tempting, and there was that man they had saved the other day who I was just dying to meet. But my parents and grandparents trusted me with Katie's life! My mother's instructions were clear as day. It was my job to watch over and protect my little sister until we arrive to New York. Shaking my head reluctantly, I politely recline the suggestion, \"Katie as wonderful as that sounds, I can't leave you! Mother and father trusted me to take care of you, and that's exactly what I plan on doing.\" \"But Amanda it isn't fair to you! Look, all I plan on doing is sit here and play with my word puzzle until I start getting hungry. You on the other hand should be enjoying this night,\" Katie explained, sounding just as convincing and clever as a salesman \"now run along and go dance!\" Rolling my eyes I once again make up a clever comeback. Sounding nonchalant as possible I scoot closer to her, resting my back on the large pipe, \"Katie in order for me to go dance, I need someone to ask me.\" \"Oh fine,\" Katie huffed in defeat as she went back to fiddling with her word puzzle. Gently twisting and turning it, she frowned sadly as she noticed it suddenly became caught on itself. Wanting to get some fresh air I stand up from the seat, and decided that I'd just go by the railing for a few seconds before returning to Katie. Giving my sister a firm look I begin to walk away, \"Stay still. I'll be right back.\" Approaching the railing, I instantly lean against it as I glance down at the pitch black sea. During the day time the water is a pristine blue color but at night? At night it looks as dark as the sky, which floats above it. This makes the moon shine with grace and beauty, lighting up the sky like a ray of hope in the darkest of times. Wishing I had more time to just breathe, I look over at Katie and realize she is still exactly where I left her. Standing next to her however is a waiter, in his hands I see the word puzzle. Then the waiter lets out a heartfelt chuckle and I can already see the rose-red blush forming in her cheeks. Seeing my sister blush forces a soft laugh to part from my lips, \"Oh Katie…\" Suddenly I feel someone tap my right shoulder. Turning my head to the side I smile as I realize I've never seen this man before in my life, \"Oh…hello sir?\" Standing there without saying I word, I couldn't help but take a moment to study him. Biting down my lower lip I began to blush. He was absolutely gorgeous from his ice-blue eyes, all the way to his dirty blonde hair which had not only been combed neatly but was being worn slick back. He looked rather fetching in a black tuxedo, and although his attire hid it rather nicely – his biceps were still just as evident. \"I'm sorry to bother you Miss, but I don't suppose you're Amanda Harwood, are you?\" I can see the smirk play out on his lips and something tells me he knows exactly who I am. Grinning in return I decided to counter argue before replying with a simple: yes. I knew better than that, \"And if I am? Why would that concern you?\" \"Well you see,\" his voice is like music to my ears; it's charming and altogether just a pleasant sound to hear \"I couldn't help but overhear your sister and you, speaking about dancing? And you were quick to say-\" \"No one has asked me to dance,\" I nodded in remembrance, after all the conversation had only taken place a few minutes ago \"that's correct and it's also true. I-I don't see how that would concern you though?\" Chuckling he grabs my hand and kisses it softly. I blush brightly but my cheeks aren't nearly as red as Katie's had been moments prior to all of this, \"I want you to dance with me Amanda?\" Nodding my head eagerly, I can't help but be a bit skeptical about this all. It seems this man had not only been eavesdropping on my conversation with Katie, but he also seemed a little ominous. And yet as sad as it may have sounded, I knew absolutely nothing about him. Just as I open my mouth to speak I feel as he puts his left hand on my hip and grabs my left hand with his right. \"So tell me, who are you exactly?\" This felt so odd. Dancing with a stranger made me feel like I had just given myself a way. All he had done is grab my hand, and now here we are – dancing. It's a strange feeling, to have given one's self away so lightly. Pushing these thoughts aside, I allowed his voice to lead me out of my tunnel of thoughts and back to reality, \"My name is Jack Ferriman. I'm the sole survivor of the Lorelei, the one they rescued a few days ago.\" Suddenly a curious spark ignites within me and my smile grows brighter. The sole survivor of the Lorelei had been quite the conversation starter, \"Oh really? So you're the one everyone's talking about! Well, it's an honor Mr. Ferriman.\" \"Oh no – I assure you, the pleasure is all mine Ms. Harwood! Tell me what brings you on the Graza anyways?\" His question left me perplexed. What did bring me to the Graza? What really brought me on to this boat? Originally it had just been Katie who was supposed to venture off to Italy for the summer. But after some heavy convincing, and various valid points on safety – mother decided it would be best if I go to Italy as well, \"My sister – mainly. But my parents also – I suppose? You see, my sister and I went to Italy for the summer to be with our grandparents. And now we're heading back to New York to be with my parents.\" \"Oh I see, well that's a very noble thing for you to do,\" Jack and I continued to sway to the sound of Francesca's voice. The moment was perfect, and if it hadn't been because his words left me so befuddled then perhaps I'd be enjoying myself more? But unfortunately I wasn't, \"Noble? Whatever do you mean by noble?\" \"I mean it must be such a pain having to deal with your little sister,\" the disgust in Jack's voice was indirect and I had to admit that was the polite thing to do, but at the end of the day she was still my sister. Frowning I shook my head as I took a few steps back, wondering how long he planned on dancing with me, \"Sometimes? But Jack, my little sister means everything to me! Not only is Katie my only sibling but she's also my best friend.\" \"Oh,\" I can tell by the shock in his piercing crystal-blue eyes that he was rather upset \"well, I apologize for my impolite choice of words.\" Nodding my head, I silently accept his apology but awkward silence begins to impregnate the air. No one says a word and after a while, I realize we aren't dancing because we want to. We're dancing because walking away would only make matters worse. Using an old trick my mother taught me when I was fifteen – for I am now seventeen – I stopped dancing and began to fake a migraine. \"Oh,\" I let out a softer whimper as I stop dancing almost instantly and begin to rub my temple with my hands. The concern in Jack's eyes makes me feel just a tad bit remorseful but that doesn't dare stop me. After all the show must go on! Taking just a few steps back I begin to excuse myself, \"J-Jack I'm terribly sorry but I think I'm going to head back to my c-cabin for the night. I just n-need to go retrieve my sister.\" The stuttering was a bit much, and I notice how Jack's expression goes from worried to skeptical in a matter of minutes. But he doesn't dare voice his skepticism, \"Alright. Sleep well Ms. Harwood, I hope you feel better in the morning.\" \"Thank you Jack, honestly I had a lovely time,\" lying with ease had never been one of my specialties but tonight I'm doing a pretty good job. Making my way back to where I left Katie, I feel my stomach drop as I notice my sister isn't where I left. Looking around, forcing my nerves to stay at bay – I begin to call out for her, \"Katie! Katie, where'd you go?\" After about only two minutes of searching, I finally spot her on the dance floor with the Captain. Gracefully twirling to the sound of Francesca's cover of Senzafine, I watch as a soft smile graces her features. Eyeing Katie I can't help but notice how happy she looks. The Captain – although he doesn't speak a word of English – is a very kind man. He's taken good care of Katie and me, and for that I am ever so thankful! Deciding I might as well play the part of a woman who's being forced to endure a serious migraine, I decide I might as well head back to the room and change into something a little less formal! Glancing around I make my way over to the waiter who had been talking to Katie only moments ago, and had even helped her with her word puzzle, \"Excuse me sir, do you think you can help me with something?\" Smiling down at me, the waiter nods his head before placing his empty tray down on a nearby table, \"Certainly Miss. Harwood! What is it I can do to be of your assistance?\" \"Well,\" looking back at Katie I can't help but feel the least bit apprehensive \"I'm going to go change into something a little more comfortable? I'm afraid I have a bit of a migraine, and I'd highly appreciate if you'd escort my little sister back to our room once she's done dancing with the captain?\" \"But of course! And I do hope you get better Miss. Harwood,\" he smiles at me and just as I am about to ask him for his name, he's quick to finish his sentence with \"oh and you can call me - Paolo!\" Nodding my head at how clever Paolo was, I waste no time in making my way off the main deck and down a short staircase. Heading to the dining room only took a couple of seconds, and as I swiftly make my way through the large crowd of people – I am completely oblivious to what's going on around me. Before I know it I'm walking down the large labyrinth of a hallway, and as I approach our bedroom door – I grin at how I had been able to memorize our room number. \"Room 404,\" smirking in triumphant, I hurriedly use the key to open our room before entering with haste. As I close the door behind myself, I speedily strip down to my undergarments before opening up our wardrobe to pull out a nightgown. Suddenly, just as I finish dressing for bed, a loud ear-piercing scream sends me flinching in fear. \" Katie,\" is the first thing which comes to mind as I run for the door, opening it with the utmost haste before darting out of it as if my life depended on it. Frantically running down the grand hall, I feel my body begin to tremble as I notice various passengers scurrying out of their rooms before finally collapsing to the ground. Scared and confused, I only watch as about a dozen men and women fall to the floor. Kneeling down beside a fallen girl - who didn't look a day over twenty one - I grab a hold of her frigid hand before speaking in a whispered tone, \"What on God's Earth happened to you?\" Looking up at me with empty eyes, she opens her mouth to speak but suddenly all that spurts out of her mouth is white foam. Screaming in horror, I instinctively back away from the foamy mess and I don't stop until I feel my back come crashing into the nearby wall. Suddenly more high-pitched screaming is heard, and the sound of footsteps becomes even louder. As the sound of Katie's shrieking begins to echo through my head, I force myself to stand up before making a bee-line down the hallway. As I watch more and more of my foaming crew mates collapse to the ground, I can't help but look away. However whether or not I'm doing it in either respect or disgust, I have yet to decide. As I make my way deeper and deeper into the hall, I eventually run into a hyperventilating Katie. I barely got a chance to look at her blood covered dress as she immediately wraps her arms around my waist, and gives me a tight squeeze. Even though I want an explanation more than anything, I'm thankful to God that she's okay... Hugging her back I feel as bitter tears begin to prick my eyes. Realization hits me like rocks, shattering a window as I being to comprehend that I almost lost Katie. Even though I wasn't a hundred percent sure what exactly was going on, I just knew murder was involved. Gripping on to her shoulders, I force her to take a few steps back as I kneel down to her level and begin to gently run my fingers through her hair. She's shaking and suddenly my eyes go wide as I notice the blood which has been splattered on to her light-blue dress, \"Oh Katie! What on Earth happened to you?\" Glancing up at me, she nervously begins to fidget with her fingers as I notice more and more tears begin to run down her beautiful pale face, \"I-I was dancing w-with the C-Captain when t-the wire went l-loose! The C-Captain, he d-dipped me so the wire wouldn't cut me and…\" Her silence, although it was a very grim sign of murder was also rather reassuring. A part of me wanted to play the part of the adult, the part of me who wanted to act just like a mother. But another part of me knew I could never play that role. After all in order to act in such a manner, it required for you to be fearless. And that was something I could never be, \"And then what happened Katie?\" \"The w-wire cut everyone b-but me,\" I felt as she shivered under my touch, the memories were like fireworks, each terrifying recollection kept flashing in her hazel-colored eyes, \"I s-screamed and then I r-ran to l-look for help.\" Feeling absolutely mortified for abandoning Katie to deal with the horror on her own, I wrapped my arms around her and hugged her closely. As fresh tears begin to run down my rosy-red cheeks, the sound of men yelling and women crying ruins the moment. And before I know it, all I can do is watch as it sends even more people in a panic race against time. \"Amanda wait, we need to find Paolo! He could be hurt or worse!\" Suddenly just as I turn around to run back to our room, I feel as my firm grip on Katie's hand unexpectedly loosens. Looking in her direction, I can only watch as she runs down the hallway and makes her way to Paolo's room. Frantically running after her, I pray to God we can find shelter somewhere? \"Katie, don't you dare run away from me! Katie, please stop?\" Running to catch up to her, I notice that she freezes in front of the doorway of - what can I can only assume is - Paolo's room Just as I am about to approach her however, a loud blood-curdling scream escapes her lips. Dashing away from the room and towards my direction, Katie grasps on to my hand before leading me down the hallway in a terror filled fright. \"Katie, what happened? What did you see? Katie, what the Hell is going on?\" I had so many questions and so far Katie wasn't answering any of them. Gripping on to my hand, she continued to lead me down various corridors as she looked back and screamed in distress. Looking back to see what it is that worries her, I feel my jaw drop and my body begin to tremble from the sudden panic. Two men dressed in light-blue uniforms, wearing the ugliest smirks I've ever seen are chasing after us. One of them is holding on to a bloody pocket knife, while the other has both his hands balled into harsh fists. Running pass them are a bunch of other passengers, who the men in blue waste no time in murdering right there and then. Looking away from the two, I haste fully stiffen my grip on my little sister's hand before zooming down the hallway, in attempts of finding our room. As I hysterically begin to look around for room A-404, I feel as pure and utter desperation begins to course through my veins. Although I had the room number and its location memorized – I could not find it! Surprisingly, just as I thought things couldn't get any worse a nearby man runs out of his room, collapses on to the ground and grips on to my leg. \"Katie, run and don't turn back!\" Those were the last words to escape my tender lips as I feel myself fall to the ground and flop instantly. I blinked a few times, trying my best not to let my tears blur my vision. I see Katie turn around and scream my name, tears running down her already tear stained cheeks. Her sobs make me want to run and save her, but that is something I just cannot do. Sighing in defeat, I witness in pure and utter relief as the two men merely leave me on the ground. However, just when I felt things were calming down - I see them starting to run after Katie! Even though I know it's my job to protect her, all I can do is – nothing. I've gone numb with fear. I feel empty and hollow inside. Surrounded by so many dead bodies whose eyes are wide open, leaves me feeling beyond traumatized. Disoriented and dizzy, I feel as if the world is losing its meaning. Biting down on my lower lip I began to contemplate my options. It wasn't like I was dead, all I had done is merely trip because some foaming man close to death had grabbed on to my leg. If I wanted to – I could run after Katie! I could save her and make sure she lives to see another day! Just like mother and grand-mamma would have wanted me to do. After all I was in charge of protecting her. But what was the point? At least now I could be the one who survived this horrible night. Studying my dead crew mates, I can only assume the foam is a result of the dinner they must have eaten tonight. Feeling ill they must have all retired early for the night, and when people started dying - they tried to run. Only to then discover that they themselves had been infected. Even though I wanted to, I just could not stop staring at the white foam. I had never seen foam escape human lips. I once saw a dog with rabies but other then that? Nothing... \" Poison,\" is the first assumption which comes to mind. Suddenly I hear the loud sound of bullets being fired. I hear more screaming, then there's the sound of splashing water and finally I hear…footsteps? And if that weren't odd enough, the footsteps are getting closer. Opening my eyes slightly I watch as the men in blue, drag my little sister down the hallway and closer to our room. More regret begins to fill my very being as I realized just how close I was to our room…only a few feet away. About a dozen more stumbling, foaming passengers run up and down the hallway. One man – on the brink of death – even tries to stop the men from taking Katie. But to no avail he falls to the ground, and I can only assume fatality is what took him next. \"Please, no! Please, don't! No!\" Katie screams as they begin to take her deeper and deeper into our suite. She begins to drag her feet, her shoes are scuffed and I continue to watch even though every bone in my body tells me to help her. The last thing Katie stares at is me. I can see it in her eyes that she thinks I'm dead. Even though it makes no sense, even though my death doesn't make a lick of sense for I have not been shot or stabbed - she thinks I'm dead. I close my eyes; pretending my demises have taken me just like it has all the others. But it's a lie – it's all just another lie, \"Amanda! Amanda, I'm so sorry I-\" No! Those were not about to be her last words! Katie had nothing to be regretful for! And if she was going to apologize to anyone, it was not about to me. I didn't deserve that. I was a coward! I was going to leave her to die… Biting down on my lower lip, I inhale sharply but just as courage begins to overcome the fear which has taken root inside of me – the door slams shut. Springing to my feet, I charge for the door but to my surprise – someone pulls me back. Looking back I'm surprised to see Jack merely standing there. He's gripping on to my arm as if he were trying to stop me. But why would he be doing that? \"Mr. Ferriman, what are you doing? I-I don't understand! What's going on here? Why is everyone dying? Who's responsible for all-?\" A loud gunshot echoes through the hall. I feel a sharp pain in the back of my head, I scream in agony and the last thing I hear is Katie. \"Amanda! Paolo! Somebody p-p…\" My body falls to the ground one last time and darkness takes over. Nothing else matters, nothing else has reason for all I can feel is the darkness as it takes my being and converts me. It converts me into just another pretty shadow… ","Summary":" A/N: Hey everyone!

And I am not taking credit for the Alyssa Rizzo either! Summary: It's been four years since Epps sunk the Antonia Graza, and saved all the souls held by Jack. Now she, and a new salvage crew come across another haunted evil ship, the Graza's sister ship, the Alyssa Rizzo. CHAPTER 1 The Alyssa Rizzo The year was 1971, and the Italian ocean liner Alyssa Rizzo was rolling like a pig in an unimaginable squall. The Alyssa Rizzo was a younger sister ship to the Antonia Graza, an Italian Liner that disappeared almost a decade ago back in 1962. The Rizzo was slightly bigger than the Antonia Graza, and more luxurious. The Alyssa Rizzo somewhat resembled the Antonia Graza despite her more advanced features, and both the Graza and the Rizzo were modeled after the S.S. Andrea Doria. The Rizzo was rocking all over in the powerful waters of the Atlantic. In the main dining room, despite the rough canting of the vessel, not many passengers were sick. A Valentine's Day Gala was taking place all over the ship, and many people were still able to dance, as long as they didn't wear heels. Among the wealthy, partying voyagers, a 10-year old boy was trying to get to the punch bowl, due to the large crowd around it. Buddy Langston, the young boy had brown hair, he had several freckles on his face. He wore a blue dress shirt with a white shirt underneath; he also wore black pants and a pair of black low tops. Buddy's mother was sitting at a table near where Buddy was trying to get a drink. An impersonator imitating 'The King of Rock' came out on stage, and started singing in Italian. Passengers danced to the rhythm of the impersonator's singing. Due to the canting of the Alyssa Rizzo in the storm, no one wore any heels while dancing. The ballroom/dining saloon on the Rizzo was a little fancier than the Graza's ballroom. A statue of the Greek Goddess of love stood in the middle of the ballroom, and one of the walls in the ballroom had a mural of famous celebrities from the fifties, and sixties. A huge skylight lay overhead in the form of a portrait depicting the Garden of Eden, including Adam and Eve. It was now at least 9:47 P.M. and the seas calmed slightly, and the ship didn't cant much now. Several people started heading back up to their cabins. Buddy remained in the ballroom enjoying the gala that was still going on. Buddy watched two teenagers get together and begin to dance near the Aphrodite statue. He watched as they pulled into a kiss, \"EWWW! GROSS!\" he shouted, as the Alyssa Rizzo suddenly began to shake violently. The entire ship shook like San Francisco back in 1906 The violent shaking caused the Aphrodite statue to fall over and crumble into pieces. The Garden of Eden skylight shattered and fell to the floor. \"The Ship is sinking!\" a passenger screamed, as terrified voyagers in the ballroom erupted into panic. Buddy was scoping for his mother amongst the panicking partiers, \"Mom!\" Buddy screamed, hoping to find his mother amongst the crowd. Down in the bowls of the Rizzo, several boiler rooms erupted into flash fires. The Rizzo shook violently as more, and more boilers exploded one after another. The gas lines that ran all over the ship also exploded, causing flash fires to engulf the lower cabins and up. The fires raged through hallways, lounges, bars, and cabins torching anyone in the way alive. In the ballroom, the flash fire engulfed the passengers, and the paneling of the ballroom. Up on the bridge, the captain, and several officers were watching in horror as the Alyssa Rizzo was being engulfed in flames. When the flash fire reached the bridge, the entire room imploded with fire, sending the captain and the officers flying like rockets into the ocean, killing them. Five minutes after the flash fires started, no one was left alive on the Alyssa Rizzo, the ship just sat there floating adrift, lifeless and in flames.

Some may find this offensive. The Ferryman's Tale The Crucified Son could not destroy us. Neither could his father, nor his imaginary friend. But they made our lives difficult; the gods require nourishment in the form of worship, and without it, they starve. It is worse for them than for mortals: mortals eventually die and escape their misery. Others, we immortal servants of the gods, had to find new functions. As long as some souls believed, as long as some mortal envisioned his trip to the afterlife as crossing a river, I was employed, myself and my boat and my beloved Acheron. But eventually even those souls died off, and I was left with a rotting boat and a dying river and a future of eternal boredom. Still, I refused to go begging to Jehovah, the way so many others had. (The number of demigods who offered to impersonate Satan for mere crumbs from Jehovah's table is embarrassing.) Jehovah had his own ferriers of souls, his angels, his reapers. He did not need me, and I could face boredom. All I had ever done was sit in my boat and wait. I was Charon, ferryman of the underworld. No upstart Judaean war god and his half-mortal spawn was going to change that. Mortals like to believe that the Crucified Son is meek and mild, but the boy has a temper. And when he decided that he was going to have the Ferryman at all costs, it was I who paid. I refused all his offers, and he cursed me, knowing full well that the Olympians were too weak to protect me. Immortals can only resist gods, not change their actions. We have no powers of our own. He twisted me into a creature forced to obey his rules. No more the egalitarian nature of Charon, in which everyone was ferried to the afterlife, but only the Crucified Son's anemic idea of \"righteousness.\" I could only capture souls deemed sinful by his rules, and worse, I was made to entrap them, spinning tales of gold and treasure and letting their own avarice damn them. Because I was so attached to my river, he banished me to the sea, to the bitter salt where no mortal lives for long, only allowed to touch land when necessary to acquire new ships, new souls. I was to bring him, and his co-conspirator Satan, souls for the by the shipload for the rest of eternity. But my gods were not entirely powerless. Aphrodite, born of the sea, still held some power, and would so long as she was invoked by mortals, either by admiration for beauty or in the poetry of love or for luck at dice, and many of the Crucified Son's otherwise devout followers still did. All she could give me was a chance of escape, but that was enough to prevent my becoming as twisted and perverse as the Crucified Son himself. Hope, as even Pandora knew, is that powerful. Not for eternity must I serve him, but only until a woman, the final survivor of one of my gruesome tasks, chose to come to me willingly, knowing the truth of who and what I am. A slim chance, in those dreary centuries where civilization knew hardly anything but Jehovah, when women seldom came to the sea, but better than no chance at all. And it has fattened these last years, as the world rediscovers all that the Crucified Son's followers tried to destroy, as souls unfulfilled by his black-and-white rules seek old ways and old gods and make them new again. The starvation of the Olympians has faded to famine; Aphrodite's power increases, weakening the Crucified Son's bonds. The sea is no longer the sole provenance of the male, and the women who sail it are no longer incapable of survival on their own. I chose them at random, as I always do. There is no pattern; if one crew should resist my lure, I simply move on to the next crew, as I threatened to do so that Murphy would agree to let me aboard. I did not even realize there was a woman on Murphy's crew until after I introduced myself. But once I did... I watched Maureen; I could not stop. She was strong and intelligent and a survivor, and I knew she was the sort of woman Aphrodite had had in mind. I hid the first flickers of hope in awkward flirtation, pretending confusion that any such woman would be on a boat such as the Warrior , as much to make her reveal more of herself as to make the crew dismiss me as a useless dilettante, which is always necessary to the early stages of the ruse. Thwarted hope as much as thwarted planning made me protest Murphy's decision to leave me behind when they first scouted the Graza —and then I saw the hint of softness towards me, as I offered her a jacket and listened to her story of an apparition. I watched her, gauging her reactions as I killed her friends, as I was compelled to; Santos, Greer, Murphy, Munder, Dodge. I had hoped to explain in my own time, but Katie, the innocent-souled brat, reached her first, tainted her mind with the horror of the Graza's final voyage. Murphy's death crystallized her resolve. My lips told her the lie that my curse forced me to tell, of a life of evil and an eternity of punishment, while my mind prayed to Aphrodite for the first time in two thousand years. Maureen banished me to the salt. Not only that, but she freed the souls I had worked forty years to snare, and I laughed as I watched them rise. For days she drifted, drifted in the water, drifted in and out of consciousness, unaware of my lurking presence. I warmed the cold waters that surrounded her so that she would not die of hypothermia, warned away curious predators lest she wind up in a shark's belly, pushed her toward the cruise lanes when she slipped into unconsciousness. When finally a ship approached, it was I who attracted their attention, firing nonexistent flares into the sky. She was the first hope I had glimpsed in centuries. I was not about to let her slip away. But the curse called, and once she was safely aboard I had no choice but to obey it. It dragged me through water and air back to Anchorage, where I had no choice but to make friends among the stewards waiting to board their new ship. I lured them with promises of wealth and stolen gold, while whispering into their minds all the ways they could increase their shares, and all the time I felt her presence, edging steadily closer to Anchorage. I timed our arrival precisely. Paramedics were loading Maureen— my Maureen—into an ambulance as we climbed the gangplank. See me, I willed her. See me and know what I am. In the second before the paramedics slammed the door, she did. She screamed desperately, trying to get someone's attention, but who would have believed her? There have been other survivors, and none has yet been believed. But the survivors always return to the sea. They always believe they are capable of stopping me. Their obsessions sometimes become so deep that they qualify as sins in the Crucified Son's eyes, and they become eligible for claiming. Many have fallen on the second encounter; none has survived the third. She will return to the sea, return to me. Hope strengthens me. The gods grow stronger. There are more survivors, more escapees. The Crucified Son grows angry, but cannot punish me as once he could. When she returns, she will free me. the end ","Summary":" Warning: This story mentions key figures of Christianity from a very pissed off non-Christian's poi"},{"Movie":"Ghost Ship","Title":"Katie's First Cruise","Author":"Angela-Bennet","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3673729","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A gleaming white ship stood in the harbour as onlookers and current passengers marvelled at it▓s beauty.

The magnificent blue sky and endless curves of the rocky spires that surrounded her were enough to make her forget. Forget for a short time that which she had obsessed for over two years. She was base camped down by the pinnacle of rock that was shaped like an upside-down amphora. She had been here for a week yet it felt like only hours. She enjoyed the solitude and quiet of the rugged landscape. The bones she occasionally saw were those of ancient sea creatures and dinosaurs. When she got out of this mess she would tell the museum people, who knows, maybe there would be an Eppsosaours in the deal for her. Dinosaurs were big in the badlands. Few people ventured here and her reason was therapeutic more than anything else. That eerie sea tug adventure of hers had drained her of all reality. Could it be that such things existed or had the doctors been right about the lack of water hallucination explanation? They had told her that the sea tug had exploded due to the poor maintenance of one of the diesel engines. That she was the only survivor. They poked holes in her story about Jack. Why, they asked would a Canadian airplane be patrolling US waters between Alaska and Russia. Canada ended in British Columbia and did not touch water till The Artic up north. She had simply given up maintaining her story to preserve her sanity. The next rise was across a sand washed dune with a hard rock spine. As she neared the ridge her eye caught yet another set of bones. She was happy she was so far from the sea and the events that had almost ruined her life. She closed on the bones most of which were on the side facing her. A giant sea monster with all of its body, fins and neck visible exposed by recent wind and storm. She walked along the 120 foot length of the skeleton until it's neck turned up and over the ridge. On the other side of the ridge she expected to find the long triangular skull with the razor sharp teeth set indicating that this was a fish eating sea creature. But the neck turned down and into the soft soil. She decided to dig it up with the small tool she carried. As she dug deeper the neck seemed to slide in her hands. Then with a movement as slow and as patient as all time itself the neck vibrated and slid back into the air. The skull on the end cap of the neck was visible, but nothing like she had expected. Instead of the triangular skull there seemed to be a human faced skull. The tendons still clung to a fleshy, puffy face just attached beyond the rotting outer layer. Hello Epp , said Jack's face in a very mellow and smooth tone. Not near the sea anymore, Epp? I've been waiting for you why, ..... seemingly Forever! , he chortled.Have you brung any more souls with you ? Epp answers back, Jack you have lost weight, as she looks at his boney ribs. Jack responds, Not bad eh, maybe we should have hatchlings? eh Epp ? Epp fainted and fell back onto the other side of the ridge. She fought with her imagination and sanity. Then blackness. When she awoke she could not tell how long she had lain there. Her watch was broken on a rock and her water bottle had emptied it's contents into the soil. She screamed and swore violently as was her nature, but nothing helped. The sea creature was lying there with the neck still running over the ridge. She panicked. She ran in any direction but toward the sea creature. Could Jack get her here in this sea of sand? Was she hallucinating again? Epp was thirsty and had no water, she walked for hours lost without any direction to guide her, night fell. She knew she needed to get to safety. Then see saw the road. A long black ribbon against a darkening sky and morose geomorphology. Her only way to safety now was to get a ride on the road to get the other way from Jack. She waited for a long time by the side of the road and then she saw the twin set of lights approaching. No it was just a reflection against some rocks from the full moon. She hated this and held the empty bottle to her lips as if that could magically coax more fluid from the canister. This time it was real, two lights one darker than the other. They approached and she held her thumb out. Whoever, what ever, she needed this ride. A sign by the side of the road, half blasted away by desert sand read Ghost Gulch Welcomes you. She makes out two dim lights coming her way which transform into two motorcyclists who stop to pick her up. Then through a misty haze her senses now playing tricks on her thirsty mind she thinks she sees they have ghostly heads, the rest of the bodies are kind of putrified but ok. One rider has a cool chopper style bike with an American flag motif the other, his sidekick has a dirt brownie/red bike with cobwebs all over. She trys to think as she gets on the back seat of the leaders bike and rides off with them but the lack of water and the halucination theory is running rampant in her mind. As they ride off our view stays at a vantage point from the road side were she got on the bike, watching them as they leave motoring down the dark road and disappearing ........... toward an ancient saltine sea called Salinejacks.

A little darling girl saunters by in stylish apparel with a raspberry beret while holding a small dark bunny as she whispers to it. Be happy Midnight, she says as she walks by, you'll be fine. Further down the street, another young woman, mid 20's dressed in red high heeled pumps, sheer stockings, an angled black miniskirt, topped off with a wide bar horizontal black and white top, with bare shoulders approaches George Ski at the Cafe. She smiles at him and does a small pirouette in front of him displaying her newly acquired prises.

Author's Note: I've rated this a T for sexual references and mild violence. It is not explicit or overly graphic at this point. Please bare in mind, however, if I choose to make this a full story the scenes will likely be quite gory... Jack can't help it, he's very scary :D. One Less To Worry About. \"Sometimes I think you're beautiful.\" It was the last thing he'd said to her. Now his strong, pale fingers had wrapped themselves around the soft, fragile flesh of her exposed neck. He could feel her pulse fluttering beneath his touch, could see the flush of fear and adrenaline across her creamy skin. He pushed his body into her, to hold her so much closer to the wall, and brushed his lips across her own. She trembled beneath him, her eyes wide and staring, all horror and disbelief. She was the woman that had dared to love him, just a fool like all those before her. Her form-fitting little black number made her body electric, and he sent his free hand trailing down the curve of her hip, resting it on her thigh where her body was warm and her flesh supple. Maybe she hadn't heard him right. She didn't seem to register the words, her eyes locking onto his own. His were dark and dangerous, filled with mystery - something she had once found so alluring, now a clear truth that stole her breath and sent her heart pounding. He pressed the kiss deeper, tasting the sweet cherry gloss she used, breathing in the rosy perfume she always wore. She didn't respond, too frightened to remember how to use any part of her. He didn't care; he could have just as much fun with her if she played dead. Just a prelude to the inevitable, anyway. He smiled through the kiss, then pulled away just enough that he could focus on her eyes again. They were chocolate brown, open wide with pupils narrow and small. The fear on her face was exciting, if only for him. His body was firm against her, immovable muscle sculpted over a slight frame. He was dressed as formally as she was, and despite her terror, she remembered her first thoughts when she'd seen him, an ironic echo of her naivety - he'd been the best-looking guy in the room. She'd lost all sense of self-restraint when he seemed to reciprocate her interest. Had she thought she could make it work? Three short months that had made her love every inch of him… though it was clear, now, that she had never had the full measure of him. Not at all. \"Jack.\" she breathed, the sound a shallow gasp between them. His eyes flickered over her face, an unfathomable expression settling onto his own. \"Jack…\" she tried again, unsure what she needed to say to him, unable to think clearly anymore. It wasn't the intoxication of too much alcohol, or the heady joy of private ardor… she was very sure he was going to hurt her, but she didn't have anything on hand that could save her. Words failed her, as if they could have helped the situation. Jack Ferriman just smiled. She'd never said his name quite like that before. She'd whispered it many times, urging him between the sheets, delicately persuading him to fulfill her every desire… this time was something new. She had no questions on her tongue, no ideas in her mind to voice, but he felt what she needed like a physical sense about her. She felt rigid beneath him, stiff and breakable. \"It'll only hurt a little.\" he promised her, and kissed her one last time. Maybe she sensed the inevitable, her own impending doom rapidly descending. Whatever it was, she lost any resistance she might have been building, let go her growing fear, her rising terror. She melted into him, her arms pushing into his back to draw him closer as though to merge their bodies together. One hand wound into his hazel hair, and she ran her fingers through its length. He responded with mutual hunger, pressing her into the wall even harder, every line and edge of his torso pressing against her. She tasted like strawberries and sunshine. That was when he stopped it. Suddenly, a hand held her face with less than ardent force. Her eyes grew fearful once again, not expecting this reaction from him. His other hand leant into the wall, his body no longer holding her down but still effectively trapping her there. \"Sweet, sweet beauty.\" he said, his eyes sparkling with a secret, a special knowledge he held. She felt no allure, no necessity to know what raced through his mind… she was sure it would terrify her. \"I love you, Jack.\" she tried. He sighed, a quiet sound that carried no heartfelt sorrow. Just a noise he could make, as the smile graced his lips once more. He released her from his grip, but traced an invisible line with a single finger down to her neck. His touch might once have sent rippling heat through her, now it inspired every hair on her body to rise in alarm. This was it . \"I just need one thing.\" Jack said, softly. He leaned in a little closer, so his mouth touched the crest of her right ear. His voice was husky and quiet, yet it filled with a quick, sharp menace. \"Tell Maureen I said hello.\" he pulled back instantly, the movement too fast. His eyes locked onto hers, and his were filled with something demonic and unnatural, a strength and power that brought with it a thousand horrific nightmares. His smile was a grin of the sadistic, a twisted promise of all the sins the world could bring to bear. \"Your mother always was a bitch.\" he added. She opened her mouth to speak, and he engulfed it one last time. The kiss held no passion, nor pleasure. It silenced her words, and then her scream. The hand at her neck curled round it once more, and now it burned, fierce and white hot. Agony ripped through her, but the louder she cried out, the more he smiled, trapping the sound in her throat. She turned limp, and he stepped back to let her drop down to the floor. The fresh scar on her broken neck was mottled, an angry red-brown of dead tissue and congealed blood. It was a curious shape, a nautical mark that branded her to him for as long as time permitted, until he dragged her into a Hell beyond the reality she had just faced. Jack laughed to himself, an insane snickering that would have sent chills up and down a mortal spine. The girl before him was lifeless and still, a cooling corpse that only faintly resembled the woman he despised. No soul defied him. He had vowed to silence every living member of that bloodline. Evangeline Epps was just one less to worry about. End. Hope you liked it! As I said, I am considering developing this - please let me know if you'd like to read more!

With a hammer in hand, Fridge looked to his newfound group of friends for approval before he proceeds to destroy the video game that changed their once normal lives. Just as he was about to hit this cursed thing with his hammer, smoke rose from the game. Green smoke. He held his hammer tightly, bewildered and unsure if he should continue what was planned as if the smoke meant something terrible was about to happen. His concern was immediately answered when the smoke cleared and before his eyes stood none other than Dr. Smolder Bravestone. He let out a gasp unfit even for him, and dropped the hammer as Bravestone towered over all four of them. He could not believe his eyes and the first thing he thought of, which he unknowingly said out loud, was \"What the hell?\" Hearing this brought Spencer out of his momentary daze. He shook his head as if to clear his mind and attempt to analyse the situation. Standing there, in front of him was the man he once had been, in all his smoldering intensity. How this is happening, he had no idea. Before he could formulate all the possible theories, they were enveloped, yet again, in green smoke. Bethany instinctively covered her nose as she waved her free hand in front of her in an attempt to reach out to her friends. The smoke-turned-fog has become thick very quickly and all her eyes could see was green. \"What is going on?\" She tentatively took one step forward but not before stumbling against someone and losing her balance, fell to her bottom. \"Sorry!\" came the voice of someone she didn't think she'd ever hear again. She looked up to see his hand reaching out to her. \"Are you alright?\" the smoke cleared to reveal the face of the man she didn't think she'd ever see again. \"Oh my god. Alex?\"[Chapter 2] He took a step closer, a wave of confusion passed his features before saying, \"I don't believe so. Last time I checked, I'm Seaplane McDonough.\" He reached for her hand and helped her up as she furrowed her brows in puzzlement. Awkward silence settled between them and before long, the fog started to dissipate. Turning his head, Seaplane surveyed his new surroundings, bewildered at the thought of being somewhere apparently not in Jumanji. He noticed in the corner of his eye, the figure of a woman in karate stance and recognition was evident in his eyes. Bethany followed his gaze to find Ruby Roundhouse in full-on defence mode. She was looking around as if assessing the situation she's in before spotting the two of them. She relaxed after seeing Seaplane and walked to their direction, \"where are we?\" \"Is that you, Roundhouse?\" The figure of a man materialized from what remained of the fog, carrying a backpack. \"Oh thank god I'm not alone in this wretched place! I can't believe this is happening. Where's prof and Bravestone? You know, we really need a map. At least we got you, Seaplane. If things take a turn for the worse, let's have some of your margarita shots.\" Ruby just rolled her eyes at him and he would have noticed if he hadn't realised the presence of a female stranger. \"Who're you?\" What remained of the fog quickly disappeared, like steam dissolving into the air, and before Bethany could speak, she spotted Martha and the rest of her friends. \"We're here, guys!\" She called out, waving her hand. \"Prof, Doctor!\" Seaplane and his group met them halfway, relief taking over his features. \"Are you guys alright? Other than being utterly confused, we're all fine here.\" \"We're clearly not in Jumanji and the kids here confirmed that.\" Bravestone looked to Spencer expectantly, as if asking him to explain what he knew. \"W-well, as I was telling Dr. Bravestone and Professor Shelly, you guys are in our world.\" \"Just what the heck does that mean?\" Finbar couldn't help but interrupt, tightly gripping his backpack. \"It means,\" Fridge, having long recovered from his mental shock, \"you came out of Jumanji and into our world. We have different worlds, but for some reason, you're here and none of us knows why.\" \"He's right,\" added Spencer, \"we should probably find the crystal first.\" Bravestone was clearly surprised at the mention of the crystal. Professor Shelly voiced out his concern, \"How do you know about that?\" Martha, stepping forward, \"you'll be surprised how much we know. We once saved Jumanji so you guys can trust us. I don't think now is the time for discussion though. Spence is right, we should find the crystal.\" The rest of the group agreed and Fridge turned to look behind them when he noticed the place where he left the video game is now empty. Frantically, he started searching for the video game instead and when he could not find it anywhere, he said \"Guys… I can't find the game.\" \"What game?\" Bravestone asked. \"The game where you guys came from. Jumanji.\" Fridge replied.[Chapter 3] \"That's not good news, Fridge. It was just there, wasn't it?\" Panic was evident in Bethany's voice as she looked to Fridge expectantly. \"Without it, how are they gonna get back inside?\" said Martha. \"I have no idea where it went, okay? It couldn't have just magically grown wings and crawled off somewhere! I left it exactly at this spot right here,\" Fridge points to the empty spot beside him. \"So, we can't seem to find the crystal and now we've lost this.. um.. game which, you're saying\" Professor Shelly briefly looked at Martha \"is where we came from.\" Martha slowly nodded. \"I don't know exactly what this implies but I think we're basically doomed.\" The professor concluded. \"Think, think, think.\" Spencer murmurs to himself, eyes glued on the ground, as he unconsciously brings his thumb up to his mouth and start biting his nails. His panic didn't go unnoticed by Bethany and she stepped up to offer an idea. \"Why don't we all sit down, first. I think we're getting too anxious to make sense of anything right now. Let's all go to my place, since that's the closest and my parents are out of town.\" \"She's right,\" said Seaplane as he glanced at her, not without wonder in his eyes. He was impressed by how she's handling this when all of them are at a loss for words. She smiled at him when she caught his gaze and something in him was stirred. He felt warm for a very brief moment before he was abruptly pulled out of his reverie when Bravestone spoke. \"You're right. Let's do that.\" Bethany took the lead. They all walked a good fifteen minutes to find a big house in one of the exclusive streets. It's surrounded by thick white walls, 10 feet high, connecting to a huge gate in front. Bethany walked up to a wicket door before fiddling with her keys inside her purse. After unlocking it, she pushed the door inside and held it open for the rest to come in. Martha stared in awe at the small mansion, surveying the entire place with her eyes. \"Wow. You really are a rich kid,\" said Fridge as soon as he entered the gate. \"Shut up\" was Bethany's comeback as she turned towards her house. Everyone followed her as she led them to a living room that can easily fit a basketball team. The inner walls were also white with stylishly modern patterns of grey flooring. \"Okay. You guys stay here. I'll go get something for everyone to drink.\" Before Bethany could turn to the kitchen, Seaplane waved his hand and volunteered to help. \"Drinks happen to be my one of my strengths, let me help you.\" Everyone agreed and Fridge added, \"yeah, dude, you make the best margarita.\" If Bravestone and his team were surprised at how Fridge knew this, there was no hint of wonder in their faces. Seaplane ran up to Bethany and they both made their way to the kitchen. Roundhouse let herself fall on one of the sofas before taking a deep breath and exhaling loudly. \"I can get used to this place. At least it's not always trees and the jungle in your world.\" She looked to Spencer, smiling for the first time since their arrival. This got Martha curious. \"What's your house like in Jumanji?\" Roundhouse opened her mouth to say something but nothing came out. She realised... she didn't know if she ever had one. \"I... I don't know.\" Confusion was clear on her features and she looked up to Bravestone. \"Come to think of it, I don't know what my house is like either\" came the voice of Finbar. \"Hey, all I can seem to remember is my time in the jungle. I'm racking my brain right now and I can't remember anything else.\" Professor Shelly's eyebrows were furrowed together and when he couldn't evoke any memory outside Jumanji, he glanced at Bravestone and shook his head. \"That is weird. Although, knowing that you guys are game characters, it kinda makes sense because you were programmed only with what's according to the storyline.\" Spencer finally spoke up, inwardly patting himself for making a sensible deduction. Bravestone, however, was less glad about this revelation. \"Are you saying we're some kind of robots?\" ","Summary":" Hi all.

No, this particular day hadnbeen filled with paperwork. Not just any paperwork though, these werenguardianship papers. Joenremembered the morning he had been told about the girl. He had beennin his office, reading. It was his habitnto read the newspaper, when he had free time in the morning. Just asnhe was finishing a story about the new air blimps that were becomingnso popular, the phone rang. Shufflingnmadly through stacked flight plans and loose blue prints, Joe managednto unearth his phone and answer on the third ring. \"Hello?\" Therenwas a pause as the person on the other line cleared their throat.n\"Hello… is this… a Mr. Joe Sullivan?\" Joentried to contain his sigh. A fan or news reporter was just lookingnfor a story. \"Yes.\" He said neutrally, attempting to conceal hisnannoyance. \"Ah…nGood. I am Mr. Poe. I'm sorry to say, but I've called to tell younabout some rather unfortunate events.\" Joenraised his eyebrows. \"Oh?\" It figured. If someone wasn't askingnfor an autograph, they were asking to be rescued. He drummed hisnfingers on his desk and wondered who needed saving this time and whatnmodifications Dex would need to make on his plane. \"Yes,nbut… let me see… you are the son of a Mrs. Cassandra Sullivan,nwho was the elder sister of a Mrs. Lily Baudelaire?\" Joe'sneyebrows climbed even further. This was family business? \"Yes,nbut I've never met my aunt. My mother,\" he paused and considerednhow to put his mother's anger into more appropriate words, \"saidnshe and her sister didn't agree with each other. Didn't see eyento eye.\" \"Yes…ndo you know anything of your aunt?\" Mr. Poe pressed. \"No.nWell… I've seen a few pictures.\" \"Hmmm…nYou see Mr. Sullivan, the thing is… your aunt has perished alongnwith her husband in a terrible fire.\" Joenwas surprised at the news, but it didn't really affect him. It wasnthe disconnected feeling of loss that one gets when they learn of anvery distant relative's death. Still, there must have been a reasonnas to why Poe contacted him. Maybe he was needed at the funeral?n\"Oh?\" \"Yes…nMrs. Baudelaire and her husband were survived by three children.nMiss. Violet Baudelaire, Miss. Sunny Baudelaire, and a Mr. KlausnBaudelaire.\" \"Okay...\"nJoe felt like he was pulling teeth, the way this man was dancingnaround what he wanted to say. \"Younsee… you, and a Mrs. Rosetta Cromwell are the only living, capablenguardians for these children.\" \"WHAT?\"nJoe stood up in his shock. \"Mrs.nRosetta and her husband are willing to take in Miss. Sunny, and Mr.nKlaus, but they can not support Miss. Violet as well. Apparently, anteenage girl is just too much for them to handle. So… are you ablento take in Miss. Violet?\" Joentried to grasp words that were just out of his reach. Finally henmanaged to stutter. \"What about Montgomery Montgomery? Surely he'dnlove to take her in?\" \"Henalready has. He took her and the other two children in. Sadly, he tonhas passed away. Snake venom.\" Joentried again. \"What about Josephine and Ike?\" It wasn't that hendidn't want to take care of the girl, per se, just that he didn'tnfeel a military base was a safe place for her, especially with allnthe men running around. And he couldn't leave her alone in thenapartment, what kind of guardian would that make him? \"Bothneaten by Lachrymose Leeches.\" He winced in sympathy. Even in hisnaquaplane, he wouldn't tangle with the Lachrymose Leeches. Joenhesitated on the last one he knew of. He hated to subject the girl tonthis, but he had to ask, \"and CountnOlaf?\" \"Thatndastardly fiend!\" Cried Mr. Poe. \"He was the children's firstnguardian, but all he wanted was their inheritance. He is solelynresponsible for the death of Mr. Montgomery, and Mrs. Josephine. Heneven tried to marry Miss. Violet to get to her money. Then hendisappeared. So either way, it is completely out of the question!\" Joenwinced again, and sat back down. He rubbed his forehead, feeling annintense headache growing. \"So I'm it?\" \"Unlessnyou can not support her. Then she will be put up for adoption.\" Joensighed, and thought for several silent minutes. \"It won't be verynglamorous,\" he said after a time.n\"She'll have to be able to adapt quickly.\" Desperately, henhoped she wouldn't turn out to be another Polly Perkins. Therenwas something that sounded suspiciously like pride in Mr. Poe'snvoice. \"Don't worry sir. Violet isnquite a capable young woman.\" Afterna week of rifling through personal belongings and boxes, searchingnfor photographs of the Baudelaire five and letters between his mothernand aunt, here he was, signing the last of the papers that would turnnViolet over to him. Finally, he was done. Then he turned to study thenyoung girl whom he'd never met, but was now the guardian of. Shenwas younger. He guessed around sixteen or seventeen, with brown hairnand brown eyes. And she looked… familiar. Shensmiled hesitantly at him as she played with a long silk ribbon.n\"Hello.\" Joensmiled back, when suddenly it hit him.nThe smile, he recognized it from some pictures of his aunt and mumnfrom their childhood. \"You look like your mother.\" He said,ncausing Violet to return a stronger smile. Mr.nPoe cleared his throat. \"Mr. Sullivan. I trust you'll take goodncare of Miss. Violet.\" Joennodded, and shook the man's outstretched hand. \"Don't worry,nshe'll fit in perfectly here.\" He turned to Violet. \"Speakingnof taking care. We need to leave soon if we're to get back to thenbase before it's dark.\" Mr.nPoe nodded his agreement. \"Don't forget.\" He told Violet. \"Youncan call me any time.\" With that he nodded to Joe again, and leftnthe room. Violetnrolled her eyes at his retreating back. Joenchuckled, and bent down to get her suitcase. \"Shall we?\" Hengestured to the door.[Chapter 2] TimnFortune—Glad you like the idea! EllinanHOPE-- I'm glad I've piqued your fancy. Sorry it wasn't longer,nI try to make my updates about 4 word pages long. But thank you fornthe reminder about the detail. That's one of the areas I'm tryingnto work on. And don't worry, it's really hard to offend or bothernme. Thisnisn't going to be a Joe/Polly. I like Joe, I like Polly, I don'tnlike them together. So they're just going to tolerate each other.nSorry. Disclaimer:nI don't own anything yet. Maybe someday. Thencar ride to Joe's apartment was quiet. Each of them was lost inntheir own thoughts, wondering what was going to happen next. Violetnwas still twisting the ribbon around her fingers; Joe assumed it wasna nervous habit of sorts. Henglanced at his cousin out of the corner of his eye, and took in hernoutfit. While it was a beautiful dress, it wouldn't do to dirty itnby wearing it to the hangar day after day. Henmade a mental note to call Polly. As much as he didn't likenthe woman, he tolerated her, and knew that he'd need her help.nShe'd probably jump at the chance to help this poor little… girl. \"Donyou know who Count Olaf is?\" Said poor little... girl askednsuddenly. Joenwas surprised at the topic, but hid it. \"Yes… I'm not sure hownhe's related to the family and I've met him, but I do know ofnhim.\" \"And…nyou know what he looks like, right?\" Joe could hear the distress innher voice, and when he looked at her, he saw it in her eyes. \"Yes.\"nHe assured her. \"I know what he looks like.\" \"Henwears disguises sometimes.\" She mumbled softly, as if she thoughtnhe wouldn't believe her. Joengave her a small, encouraging smile as they slowed to turn a corner.n\"I'm not that dense, contrary to what my men seem to think.\"nThat got him a small laugh from her. Good, it was good to hear hernlaugh. \"Besides,\" He returned his attention back to the road, \"ifnI for some reason have a lapse in sanity, just tell me. I trust you.\" Hensaw Violet give him a real smile. \"The others never listened tonus.\" She said, by way of an explanation. \"Theynnever listen to the important people.\" He knew exactly what shenmeant. Some of the police force looked at his work as more ofnvigilante justice. Nonetheless, Joe was trying to cheer her up. Itnwas hard for him to see her so sad. But his comments seemed to benimproving her mood. \"Now…\" He paused to think. \"Mr. Poe saidnyou were something of an inventor?\" Violetngave a small nod. \"Nothing big and important,\"nshe said in her soft voice. \"Just things that make life anlittle easier.\" Joenchuckled as he thought of Dex. \"Trust me. When it comes to makingnlife easier, it's the little inventions that mean the most.\" Violetnsmiled a little at that, but she could feel that he had meant to gonsomewhere with that particular conversation topic. \"Why do younask?\" Thisntime, an amused grin spread across Joe's face, one so contagiousnthat Violet found herself grinning too. \"I have a friend, Dex. He'snalso an inventor, and I have a feeling that you two will get alongnsplendidly.\" Oncenthey made it to the apartment, Joe tried to help Violet unpack, untilnshe finally kicked him out of her room, saying there were just somengirl cousin things that boy cousins should not see. Amused,nJoe made his way to the living room to make a few phone calls. Hendidn't even question the sibling-like closeness that had sprung upnbetween the two of them. Perhaps it was something they both needed. Thenfirst call went to Polly. As much as he didn't want to speak tonher, Violet really needed another female in her life, for moralnsupport or something. \"Hello?nPolly Perkins speaking.\" Joe gritted his teeth at the honey sweetnvoice on the other end of the phone. \"Polly,nIt's Joe.\" He managed to ground out. \"Well,nwell, well, you're the last person I expected to hear from.\" Herntone was condescending, and Joe could almost see the smirk on hernface. He tried to restrain his disdain as he curled his hands intonfists. \"Yes,nwell… I have a cousin who's just moved in with me, and she needsnnew clothes and all that. I thought it'd be better for her to shopnwith someone who understood fashion. Besides, I'd like her to havenmore contact with women. God knows she's going to be starved of itnat the base.\" He tried to keep his voice calm and neutral. \"Oh?\"nJoe sighed softly in relief. Polly was interested. That meant itnwouldn't be too hard for him to talk her into helping. \"But…\"nPolly hesitated. \"Why has she gone and moved in with you?\" Thisntime Joe sighed with annoyance. He really didn't want to tell Pollynabout Violet's parents. It'd just end up in the newspaper. \"Alwaysnthe reporter aren't you?\" Joe allowed his contempt to shownthrough. His anger was not lost on Polly but she reacted with ansugary bundle of lies. \"I'mnjust asking, Joe.\" Polly's voice had gotten sweeter, and she wasntrying to sound innocent. Joenrolled his eyes and went for the blunt approach. \"Her parents werenkilled in a fire. I'm the last family she has left.\" \"Oh.\"nThis time, she sounded more regretful. \"I'm sorry.\" \"Just…ndon't mention it to her,\" Joe ordered. \"And don't you darenput her name in the paper!\" His temper flared up, more than awarenof the damage that one story printed by Polly Perkins could do. \"Ifnyou do…\" He let the threat hang. \"Oh,nJoe!\" Polly was exasperated. \"I'm not that cold hearted.\" Joenrolled his eyes, but was silently proud of ruffling her feathers.n\"I'll believe that when I see it.\" \"Hey!\" Joenhad to smirk; now it was she who was mad at him. \"Look, just comenover on Saturday. Now, I have to make another phone call.\" Hensmiled at her attempts to speak, and quickly, albeit gleefully hungnup. Thennext call was an easier one to make, but Joe still felt a bitnnervous. Mr. Poe had called him, then Violet had come in the nextnweek, which was spent preparing the spare room and cleaning thenapartment. He hadn't really had a chance to tell anyone at the basenabout his cousin. Then again, sometimes he just forgot to tell thenguys at the base anything, and so they had no clue what was going on,nor why. It really only bothered the newbies, anyway. So a heads up,neven a late one, should pacify them a bit. Thenphone rang three times before Dex answered. \"Dex Dearborn.\" Joencouldn't help but smile when he heard his friend's voice. \"It'snJoe.\" \"HeynCap'n!\" Joe could hear the smile in Dex's voice, an answer tonhis own happiness. Any negativity left behind by Polly was erased bynDex's bubble gum attitude. \"Dex…\"nJoe hesitated, not quite sure where to go with the conversation. \"I…nI thought I'd give you guys a heads up.\" \"Oh?\"nDex sounded a bit sarcastic, but there was an under-lying hint ofnamusement. \"About what?\" \"Well…nsee… I'm the new guardian of a cousin.\" He heard Dex crack hisngum, as the man thought about how to reply to that. Hisnanswer was slow and careful. \"Okay… how'd that happen?\" Joe'snsmile returned. That was why he loved Dex. The man handled everythingnthrown at him with a deceiving innocence. \"Her parents werenkilled.\" \"Ah.\"nThat was said softly. Dex knew what it was like to lose parents,nhaving lost his when he was younger. Joe opened his mouth, trying tonfind something soothing to say when Dex cleared his throat. \"When'snshe coming?\" His regular voice was back, masking the memories andnfeelings that had been dredged up. Joenrubbed the back of his head nervously. \"Actually… she's herennow.\" Henwinced away from the phone at Dex's yell of surprise. \"Jeez Joe!\"nDex sounded absolutely annoyed with his commander. \"Thanks for thenwarning!\" \"Atnleast I remembered to tell you.\" Joe said slightly plaintively. Thatngot a chuckle out of Dex. \"Yeah, I guess I have to give you that.nSo are you bringing her by later?\" Joenglanced back to the bedroom; he could see Violet moving aroundnthrough the view offered by the slightly cracked door. \"No. She'snunpacking, and I want to give her time to settle in. I'll bring hernin tomorrow, though.\" \"Sonwe've got time to hide all the secret classified stuff.\" Joencould hear the teasing in Dex's voice. \"Exactly.nSee, I can be courteous.\" He could almost see Dex rolling his eyes.n\"Don't roll your eyes at me.\" The coughing that came from thenother end of the line proved he had guessed correctly, and he hadnalso accidentally made Dex swallow his gum. \"Sorry about that. Oh!\"nHe sat up straighter as he remembered something. \"And Dex?\" Therenwas only a hint of curiosity in his genius friend's voice. \"YeahnJoe?\" \"Don'tnhide everything away. Violet's quite the inventor, I'm told. She'dnprobably enjoy looking at some of the gadgets you've come up with.\" \"Whatevernyou say Joe.\" Dex sounded bored, but Joe could hear the concealednglee. Dex loved talking to other inventors, or would-be inventors.nJoe had been right, Violet and Dex would get along splendidly. Suddenlyna loud thump came from the bedroom Violet was in. Joe leaned forwardnand tried to get a better view of what was happening in his cousin'snroom. \"Dex,nI've got to go. I'll see you tomorrow.\" \"Seenya Cap.\" Joenhung up the phone, and made his way to Violet's room, wonderingnwhat all the commotion was.[Chapter 3] Lexie—Thanknyou so much for the review!

Whennhe arrived, he found Violet standing off to the side of her room, andnher dresser face down on the floor. He crossed his arms over hisnchest as he shook his head. \"Do I want to know?\" He askednglancing between his cousin and her furniture with a raised eyebrow. Violetnrubbed her chin before smiling sheepishly. \"Sorry.\" She moved tonthe side of the dresser. \"I was just trying to see if somethingnworked.\" Joenwent to the other side of the dresser, and helped lift it up. \"Anninvention?\" Violetnshrugged a little as she struggled with the piece of furniture. \"Annidea for an invention.\" Joenwatched as she sat on her bed, looking a little lost. \"You shouldnexplain it to Dex tomorrow. He'd love to hear about it.\" Shennodded and gave him a halfhearted smile. He absently noted that shenwas twisting the ribbon around her fingers again. Joenleaned against the doorframe and studied her for a few moments,ntrying to figure out what to say or do. He wasn't used to dealingnwith a girl who he wasn't going out with, and it showed. In fact,nhe wasn't used to dealing with girls for much longer then the spannof a few hours, much less a teenage girl. Thennhe realized why she looked so sad. It reminded him of how his mothernused to get when she looked at pictures of her younger sister,nViolet's mother. So he decided to voice an idea that he had beennconsidering in the back of his mind since he first heard that he'dnbe taking in his cousin. \"I'venbeen thinking…\" He trailed off, waiting for her to look at him.nWhen her solemn brown eyes met his, he continued. \"It's notnreally fair to you, or your brother and sister, to be separated afterneverything that's happened.\" Violet'sndark eyes widened slightly and her jaw dropped a little. \"You…nyou want to send me away?\" Her voice quivered a bit as she lowerednher gaze to her lap, where she was still twisting that ribbon. Joenshook his head quickly, reaching a hand out to her, even though shenwas a few feet away and far out of touching range. \"No. Actually…nI wanted to invite Klaus and Sunny to live here. I'd need to find anbigger apart…\" Henwas interrupted when Violet jumped up and hugged him. Joe was caughtnoff guard, but managed to keep his balance by bracing agents thendoorframe. He returned the hug awkwardly at first, but slowly relaxedninto it. \"Thanknyou so much!\" He could barely hear her voice, as she was pressed upnagainst him in her tight hug. \"Inknew you were missing them.\" He said softly as he glanced down atnher. EventuallynViolet pulled away. She had a slightly guilty look on her face. \"Indon't want you to do this just to make me feel better. Don't takenthem in if it can't work.\" Joenwatched her sit on her bed, then sat beside her, marveling at thensimilarity between her, and pictures of her mother and his mother. \"Inwouldn't have offered if I couldn't take them in as well. BesidesnI remember how much my mother missed her sister. Even if they didn'tnget along.\" AgainnViolet smiled as she realized that her cousin really wanted this, andnthat he could do this. All she could do was give him another hug.n\"Thank you.\" Joenreturned the smile, and gently tugged one of Violet's braids. Shenplayfully swatted his hand away. \"Now, I'll let you finishnunpacking.\" He stood, and started to walk away, but at the door henstopped and turned to face her again. \"And I don't mindninventions. Goodness knows I put up with enough of Dex's. Justndon't…\" He looked over the room and then back at Violet, whonwas beginning to tie her hair back. \"Don't destroy my apartment…nat least until I have a chance to sell it.\" Thatngot a small laugh out of her and she nodded. \"I'll be careful.\"nShe had meant with the furniture and the building in general.nEveryone and their dog knew that she could get a little messy whennbrain storming and then inventing whatever creation spawned from saidnbrain storming. Butnafter hearing her words, Joe's look softened. \"You had betternbe.\" Then Violet realized he was talking about her. That left hernspeechless, and she watched him give her another smile and head backnto the living room. Dinernthat evening was quiet. Both of them were fairly emotionallynexhausted, and kept the conversation light. Violetndesperately wanted to ask Joe about his mother and her mother. Shenhad heard tantalizing bits from him, but no solid explanation. Butnshe wasn't sure how to ask, or when to ask. She didn't want tonbring up unpleasant memories for the man that had taken her in, andnthen, after not even one day of living with her, offered to take innboth her brother and sister. Afterndiner, she helped wash the dishes, and then leaned against thencounter thoughtfully as she gave her cousin a thoughtful look. \"Yes?\"nAsked Joe, once he'd noticed the look. Violetnsmiled slightly, and blushed a bit when she realized that Joe hadncaught her. \"I was just wondering, you talk a lot about… is it…nDex? Who is he?\" Ansmile came to Joe's face as he thought about the answer for a fewnmoments. \"Dex… he's… one of my best friends.\" He seemed toncome out of his reverie. \"He's also a co-worker. One of my bestnmechanics, and he's an inventor too.\" Violet'sneyes lit at that. He had told her about that before, but now she hadna chance to really talk to him about it. \"Really? What has heninvented?\" Joenlaughed at her eager look. \"Oh a bunch of things. He's managed tonmodify my plane so that it can go from flying to operating perfectlynunderwater, like a submarine.\" Violetngasped softly in awe. \"That's… that's wonderful!\" Joennodded, still chuckling. \"Yeah… that's Dex for you though. He'dnbe able to tell you more of his inventions, and their specs. I'mnjust the pilot.\" Violetnnodded as his admission brought out even more questions. \"So that'snwhat you do? What type of pilot are you?\" Her look was eager andninterested but she was obviously asking for intellectual purposesntoo. Joenwas surprised. He'd never met a girl (aside from Franky, and henwasn't quite sure she counted as \"a girl\") who was interestednin what he actually did. They just wanted him and the title that camenwith him. Not his job. \"Well…\" He had to pause to actuallynthink about the answer. \"I'm a fighter pilot.\" \"Likenfor the army?\" He had her full attention now. Joenshook his head. \"No, I was an air force brat though. My dad was annofficer, he taught me how to fly. But I have my own unit. I guess youncould call us an air force for hire, but most of the time we helpnwhen people need us to, usually for free.\" Violetnseemed completely fascinated. \"And I'll get to see where younwork, and meet Dex, and the others you work with?\" She askedneagerly. Joennodded. \"Tomorrow, if you feel up to it.\" Violetngrinned and fingered the ribbon that had appeared from seeminglynnowhere. \"You'll be hard pressed to keep me here.\" Joe laughednand swatted at her with a dishtowel, wondering just what had hengotten himself into by \"adopting\" this mysterious VioletnBaudelaire.[Chapter 4] Roughnecknsquadleader—yep I call that a chapter. I'll try to update morenoften. And say hello to Marius and Kory again for me. EllinanHOPE—yeah, I'm sorry it takes me so long to update, I try though,nreally I do.

That's reallynabout it. ----Tonall the reviewers, especially Ellina HOPE, I am truly sorry that it'sntaken me so long to update. I find that once I start writing, thennthings flow. But it takes me a while to work out the beginning. Thatnand, on occasion I need a swift kick to the butt to get me tonactually sit down and write. So I'd really like to thank EllinanHOPE for that swift kick. I promise I'll try to make it so that Indon't need anymore.---- Thennext morning, Violet was up almost before Joe was. She was excited tongo to his base, see what was there, and she was really excited tonmeet his friend Dex, and it showed in the speedy way that she gotnready in the morning. Butnwhen she walked into the living room, she stopped and stared at herncousin. Joenwas sipping a cup of coffee and flipping through the newspaper; itnwas an almost completely normal set-up. He saw her movement out ofnthe corner of his eye, and looked up. He smiled when he saw Violet.n\"Morning. Sleep well?\" Violetndidn't respond; she just continued to stare at him. \"Yes…?\"nJoe asked hesitantly. He was starting to feel a bit self-consciousnunder her gaze. SuddenlynViolet seemed to come back to herself. She smiled in a teasing way atnher cousin. \"I can see why all the girls here like you.\" \"Hunh?\"nJoe looked and felt completely baffled by that comment. Violetnwatched him, then looked away with a slight smile. \"No shirtntoday?\" She asked, biting her lip to keep from laughing. But shencouldn't stop herself and dissolved into giggles when Joe made anhasty exit. Henmock glared at her as he returned from his room, buttoning his shirt. Violetnignored him, and continued making breakfast. \"So I get to meet Dex,nand see the base today?\" Joengrinned despite himself. Her excitement was contagious, not that hencould stay mad at her for long anyway. Violet's teasing was veryndifferent from that of other females he had encountered like, say, anMiss Polly Perkins. \"Sounds like a plan.\" Normally,nJoe felt that the drive to the base was rather boring, andnuneventful, but as he watched his cousin stare at the scenery flyingnpast, and answered her occasional questions, he decided that thendrive was rather nice if one took the time to really pay attention.nOr maybe, he thought as he glanced at the mesmerized Violet, it wasnjust the company. Either way, Joe decided that this was the mostnenjoyable drive to the base that he'd ever experienced. AsnJoe drove up to the main hangar, he smiled discretely as he watchednViolets eyes widen even further. \"Have you never been to an armynbase, or even an airport?\" He asked in amusement as he opened herndoor. Violetndidn't even bother to look at him. \"This is different.\" Shensaid as she got out of the car. Joenchuckled, and led the way. He only had to stop twice to remind hisninquisitive cousin to not wonder off and please don't bother thenmechanics quite yet. Asnthey entered the hanger, Joe nodded to a plane on the left. \"That'snher.\" He said, trying to keep his pride out of his voice. Violetngasped. \"That's your plane!\" She looked the machine over. \"CannI… can I take a closer look?\" She asked hesitantly. \"Ofncourse.\" Joe led her over to the plane, and began telling her aboutnit. While he would deny it to the end, he was acting much like anproud father boasting about his prodigy child. Joendid his best to answer all Violet's questions, but eventually henlaughed and threw his hands up. \"I think it's time to find Dex.nHe'd be able to answer everything much better then I can.\" Violetnsmiled as she faced her cousin before turning around in a slowncircle, searching the vast space. \"Okay… so where is he?\" Joenglanced back towards where Dex's desk was, near the back of thenhangar. \"You know, I'm not sure. He should have been out by now.nUnless…\" He trailed off and smiled at Violet. \"Unless he'snworking on something new.\" Violet'sneyes lit up. \"Really? You think so?\" Butnbefore Joe could respond, three laughing people walked in through thenmassive door. Joe and Violet turned to look at them. \"Well there'snDex…\" Joe didn't look happy. His \"not happy\" look turned tonsheer annoyance and displeasure when he saw Dex laugh again. \"Whonare the others?\" Asked Violet. Just as the words left her mouth,nthe three people came into a more lit area and all three of themncould be clearly seen. Violet abruptly drew back behind Joe, hidingnbehind him and feeling very small. Joe'snhands tightened into fists. He knew all three people. One Dex, onenthorn in his side, and one who should have been shot on sight yearsnago. \"Joe!\"nDex called with a smile as he saluted. He walked up to his boss andnfriend, slightly surprised to see Joe's body tense and rigid. \"Younall right, Cap?\" \"Joe,\"ngreeted Polly with barely concealed annoyance, as she followed Dex.n\"I hope you don't mind, but General Grigorsen has such a keenninterest in planes, I thought I could show him around the base.\"nShe didn't sound like she particularly cared whether Joe minded ornnot. Joenbarely heard her or Dex's words. His attention was focused on thenthird member of the group: the so-called General Grigorsen. \"Getnout!\" He growled. \"Joe!\"nPolly sounded, and looked shocked. EvennDex looked surprised. But not at the order, he was surprised at thenvenom behind it. He couldn't remember ever hearing Joe sound thatnangry. He studied his long-time friend and noticed the girl huddlednbehind him, hiding from something. Dex titled his head to one side,ncatching her attention. He waved hesitantly and she smiled a littlenbefore clinging closer to Joe. \"Don'tnworry my dear boy.\" Said the 'General' after removing a pipenfrom his mouth. \"I promise not to steal any of your state secrets,\"nhe turned a smile on Polly, \"but perhaps your charming women.\" Thencomment caused Polly to laugh a little and blush. \"Inmay not like Miss. Perkins,\" Joe snapped, \"but I wouldn't evennwish you on her.\" Pollynlooked ready to slap Joe, and Dex had put his hand on Joe's arm,ntrying to calm the man down. It worked, but only slightly as Joe'snstare lost a fraction of its murderous intensity. When the 'General'ndidn't move, his temper flared again and Dex lost all hope ofnkeeping the peace. \"Insaid GET OUT! Olaf!\" Joe snarled. \"Indon't know what you're talking about dear boy.\" Said then'General'. \"Who is this handsome debonair Olaf you speak of?\" Butnbefore anyone else could say anything, the imposter found himselfnlooking down the muzzle of Joe's gun. \"Eithernget out, or I'm going to shoot you.\" Joe's voice was low, sonlow it was hard to hear. However the 'General' got the message,nnot that it was hard to comprehend. \"PerhapsnI should try ba...\" \"Comenback and you'll wish I had shot you.\" Joe hissed, \"now getnout!\" Thenman turned to Polly took her hand and kissed it. \"Maybe some otherntime Miss. Perkins?\" He walked out of the hangar, tossing onenglance back. One that Joe could read clear as words on paper. \"Younwon this round, but I'll be back.\" Joenwas brought back to his surroundings by a sharp slap. He stared atnPolly who had her hands on her hips, glaring at him furiously. \"Nonneed to get jealous Joe.\" She turned and hurried after then'General'. Joenbriefly considered going after her, but felt someone squeeze his arm. \"Letnher go.\" Said Dex gently when Joe turned to face him. Joenglanced at Dex's hand, and to his disappointment, it was quicklynremoved. Joe pushed his thoughts aside and turned to find Violet. Hensaw that she had pressed herself back against the plane in thenshadows. He figured she had bolted when he pulled out his gun.nSighing, he returned the weapon to its rightful place in his pocket. \"Dex,nthis is my cousin Violet.\" He extended his hand to Violet, andnslowly coaxed her out of the shadows. She approached him slowly andnonly relaxed when she had determined, for herself, that Olaf wasnindeed gone. \"Violet, this is my friend, resident genius, andninventor Dex.\"[Chapter 5] 4 Luchia13—SorrynI spelled it wrong.

Joenwatched Violet through his office window. She was sitting on thenconcrete floor, beside one of the mechanics, who was simultaneouslynworking on one of the planes, and answering her questions. Shenand Dex had spent most of the morning talking about inventions andnthe trials of being an inventor. But after lunch Dex had sent hernoff to the mechanics. He had some paperwork to catch up on, andndespite how wonderful Violet's ideas were, she didn't really havena strong grasp of how to make them out of anything other then whatnshe found lying around. He had thought that maybe the mechanicsncould give her more of a solid grounding. \"Younlook thoughtful.\" Said a lightly amused voice from behind Joe. Joendidn't have to turn around to identify who was standing behind him,nbut he did anyway. \"Do I?\" He turned his patented smile on Dex. Dexnsmirked as he put some rolled up blue prints on Joe's desk. \"Wellnmaybe that's the wrong word. You look… like you do when you looknat your plane. Like a proud father.\" Joenhad to chuckle at that as he pored himself another cup of coffee. n\"Well… yeah. I know I haven't known her long, but shenimpresses me tremendously.\" Dexnperched on the edge of Joe's desk as Joe sat in his chair. \"Hownlong have you known her?\" He asked after a few moments ofnconferrable silence. Joenrolled his eyes. \"C'mon Dex. Just ask what you want to. Younknow me well enough by now to not dance around the issue.\" \"No.n I know which issues I don't need to dance around. She's yournfamily Joe. That's a completely different category.\" Joensighed, and took a sip of his coffee. \"I have some vague memory ofnher being mentioned, but technically I've known about her fornlittle over a week. The first time we met was yesterday.\" Dexnjust nodded. He had expected it to be along those lines, judgingnfrom how much warning time Joe had given him. \"So your mom neverntalked about her or anything?\" Joenshook his head. \"No… my mother and her sister… didn't getnalong with each other. I know my mother still cared about hernsister, but they never talked.\" \"Whynnot?\" The question was soft, and Joe knew he didn't have tonanswer it if he didn't want to. Joenlooked into his coffee for a few moments. \"Well… it had to donwith Violet's father. My mother was quite taken with him, butnalways the shy one. She was still working up the courage to speak tonhim when her younger sister, Violet's mother, waltzed up andnstarted flirting with him. My mother was so angry that she refusednto go to there wedding. Her sister was insulted and hurt. Theynnever managed to close the rift.\" Dexnnodded again, and let Joe have a few moments of silence to get lostnin his memories. After a few minutes, he decided to broach what wasnsure to be a sensitive subject. He hesitated at first, then justndecided to ask. \"Who's Olaf?\" Joensighed and rubbed his temples. He didn't speak right away, and Dexnhad almost decided to take the question back. \"An… uncle ornanother cousin I think.\" Joe said, his voice had dropped annoctave. \"Younthink?\" Dex spoke before thinking. \"Sorry.\" He saidncontritely. \"I spoke before I thought.\" Joengave a chuckle. It was mostly mirthless, but there was a touch ofnhumor. \"I'm not sure exactly. Relatives are rather… spreadnout in my family. Personally I think my family just had too manyngrudges they weren't willing to give up.\" \"Isnthat why you were so… angry? A family feud with him.\" Dexnlooked over at Joe when the man didn't respond. He was surprisednto see a very dark look on his friends face. \"Joe.\" He reachednout to grasp the man's shoulder. \"Hentried to kill her!\" Joe snarled lowly. \"Violet, and her brothernand sister. All for money!\" He spat the last word. Dexnwas surprised, but only tightened his grip on Joe's shoulder. n\"Joe. Joe! You know him, you knew him when he came here. You'llnkeep her safe. She's safe here Joe. She's safe.\" SlowlynJoe seemed to come back to himself. He sighed and buried his face innhis hands. \"Never let him come back here Dex. Promise me you'llnnever let him come back here.\" Dexnsqueezed Joe's shoulder. \"I promise Joe. I promise.\" Justnthen, the real world decided to come crashing in, and both theirnattention was dragged to the commotion outside the office. Joenreached the door only moments before Dex. \"What's going on?\" nHe reached out and snagged one of the pilots that were running downnthe hall. \"Emergencynsignal from Boston Sir.\" Said the man, doing his best to stand atnattention while his collar was in Joe's fist. \"Whatntype of emergency?\" He asked coolly and calmly as he released thenman and joined him in sprinting to the planes. Subconchesly Joennoted that Dex had already headed to his desk so he could startnworking on fighting tactics, and to receive incoming radio signals. Thenpilot winced slightly. \"I'm not exactly sure Sir.\" He said,nbracing himself for the dressing down he was going to receive fromnhis commanding officer. \"We know they're under attack.\" Tonthe man's complete surprise, Joe took this in strides and justnnodded. \"Do we know what's attacking them?\" \"Uhh…\"n The man's words stumbled in his surprise at not being yelled at. n\"They said something about giant beetles…\" He trailed off,nknowing how ridiculous that sounded. Joenstudied the young man he was running beside. \"You're one of thennew recruits aren't you? One of the regular army defects.\" Thenman winced again. \"It shows.\" Joenlaughed. \"Only army brats think that I'm going to yell at themnfor telling me everything they know.\" By then they had reached thenmain hangar. Joe shook his head. \"I like you. You'll fly covernfor me.\" Thenman was so surprised that he actually stopped running. Then his mindncaught up with him. \"Yes Sir!\" He called after Joe as he wentnin a different direction towards his own plane. Joenlaughed to himself, but had a body stopping surprise moment himselfnonly moments later. \"Vi!\" He said in complete shock when he sawnher standing beside his plane. \"What are you doing here? Thisnarea isn't safe for you to be in.\" Violetnshrugged without looking at her cousin. \"Then where is safe?\" nShe asked softly. Joengrasped her shoulders and made her look up at him. \"Go to mynoffice k? When the troops are out of here I'll have Dex get younand you can stay with him until I get back. Ok?\" Violetnhesitated, then threw her arms around Joe in a quick hug. \"Bencareful.\" Joensmiled and returned the hug. \"Don't worry, I'll be back beforenyou know it.\"[Chapter 6] 5 Ellina HOPE—HavenI told you that I love you?

Violetnthought that the first time around, she had seen Dex's office, butnthe office in times of relaxation was nothing like how it was whennthe Sky Captain was in the air. It wasn't just Dex's officenanymore. Actually there seemed to be an inordinate amount of peoplenin the room. The impressive thing was that they seemed to know hownto work efficiently if not effectively when they only had a 12 inchnby 12 inch square to call there own. Withnexpert skill Dex managed to guide Violet to his desk with out runningninto anyone else, comprehend snatches of conversations that werenbeing yelled across the room, and dolling out orders in a way thatnwould put a five star general to shame. Violetntried not to smile at the contrasting personality that Dex wasndisplaying. Under normal circumstances he reminded her of a happynpuppy, now… now he reminded her of a happy puppy that wasnpretending to be a bid dog, although she supposed it kept hisnassistances in line. Dexngently put the girl in his chair and grabbed some papers from anbreathless man who had just run up to him. He barked something andnsent the man on his way and looked over the papers. He glanced downnat Violet to make sure she was handling everything ok. She wasnrandomly tracing her finger across a map on his desk, but to hisnsurprise, her lips held a small smile and her eyes held amusement. n\"What's so funny?\" Violetnjust shook her head and continued her tracing. \"Tellnme, or I'll tell Joe you're not cooperating.\" He threatened. Violetnlooked up and let herself smirk. \"Right. You like me too much fornthat.\" And before he could comment, she continued. \"I was justnthinking about how do you manage to get your people to work sonquickly? It's not like you're very scary or anything.\" Dexnblinked at her and cracked his gum. Dam! There was no doubting thatnshe was Joe's cousin. They both had that patented, copyrighted,ntrademark smirk. She also had the un-nerving ability to see rightnthrough him. Insteadnof responding and giving her an opportunity to create a come-backnthat was Joe worthy he just rolled his eyes. \"I'll tell you whennyou're older.\" Violetnmerely raised her eyebrow in that annoyingly elegant way that allnwomen had, with the expression of 'I know exactly what you meant bynthat.' Which was annoying because Dex didn't even know what he'dnmeant by it. Thenradio saved Dex from having to think too long on that topic, and itnwasn't one he wanted to deeply think about at the moment. \"Younthere Dex?\" Joe's voice was laced with static, but calm in annalmost arrogant sort of way. He was The Sky Captain after all. Dexnmade a mental note to check Joe's radio after the plane returned tonbase. Joe's stunts were dangerous enough; he didn't need to benput in more danger by missing or mishearing orders or comments overnhis radio. \"Right here Cap.\" \"AndnViolet?\" Anyone other then Dex would have missed the slightnconcern colouring the man's voice. \"Onnher way to etiquette school. Your cousins got a smart mouth on her…nkinda like you.\" Therenwas a pause, and then the sound of laughter filled there littlencorner of the room. Dex reveled in the feeling that he knew that henwas the only person that could make Joe laugh like that, like the manndidn't have a care in the world. Violetnpretended to look hurt for all of two seconds then giggled. \"Younjust don't know how to act around a Lady.\" She proclaimednloftily with a smile on her face. Dexnsnorted, but internally wondered how long it had been since Violetnhad been this playful. She'd grown up at a young age, and Dexncould sympathize. He was happy to see her smile and act like thenchild she was, not the adult she was forced to be. He also wonderednif he and Joe would always be the only one's to gain that reactionnfrom her. To his surprise, a small part of him hoped that that'snthe way it would be. \"Sonhave we figured out why there are giant bugs attacking Boston, andnhow we're going to stop them?\" Joe's voice broke into Dex'snmusings. There was only a touch of humor left in Joe's nowncompletely casual voice, but Dex knew that the man's eyes held whatnhis voice lacked. Dexnrolled his eyes again, eliciting another giggle from Violet. \"Stillnworking on it Joe.\" \"Wellnwork faster.\" Joe's voice was still casual and teasing. \"Whyndidn't I think of that?\" Dex muttered to himself, and shared anknowing grin with Violet. Joenrolled his shoulders to get the tension out as he walked into hisnoffice. The sight before him made him pause, and smile slightly. nDex and Violet were on either side of his desk playing some sort ofncard game, and discussing… Italy of all things. However, it wasnnice to see the two of them getting along so well. Dexnglanced up from his hand when Joe walked in. He smiled, but itndidn't reach his eyes. As if Dex already knew the answer to thenquestion he was about to ask, and he didn't like it. \"You took anlong time coming in?\" Joenshrugged and hung up his jacket. \"Polly wanted an interview.\" Joenknew Dex wouldn't respond to that, and the man didn't disappointnhim. Dex simply nodded and turned back to his cards. Joe shook hisnhead and sighed softly. He would never figure out what Dex'snproblem was with Polly. When the woman was around, Dex was nothingnless then a gentleman, but when it was just the two of them, Dexntended to avoid the woman, even in the most neutral of topics. Joenlooked up and smiled at Violet who was looking at him. There was anlook on her face, but it was replaced by a smile before Joe could pinnthe look. A voice whispered in the back of his head that the looknwas pity, but Joe couldn't figure out what he did to earn thatnlook. Henglanced at the clock and winced. He hadn't intended to abandonnViolet for the whole day. \"Dex, you want to stop by for dinner?\" Dexnsmirked as he picked up a card. \"Thanks but no thanks Joe. I'vengot to go over that plane of yours and finish up some paperwork.\" Joenfrowned lightly; he was disappointed at the turn down. \"You don'tnhave to work so hard you know.\" Dexnlaughed softly. \"I don't normally, which is why I'm so behindnin my work. And I really really have to go over your plane. It'snbeen needing an overhaul for a while now.\" Joensighed, knowing he'd been outmaneuvered. \"Some other time then?\" Dexnnodded. \"Yeah. We'll set something up.\" \"Tomorrow?\"n Joe hoped that the hope in his voice wasn't evident. Tonanyone else, it wouldn't have been, but Dex knew the man too well. nAnd Dex found himself smiling softly. \"Yeah tomorrow would be ok.\"n Dex kept his voice neutral and he knew that no matter how well Joenknew him, Joe wouldn't hear the happiness in his voice. He wasnwrong, but Joe didn't comment on it. \"Sonshall we go Violet?\" Violetnglanced at Dex. \"Finish this tomorrow?\" \"Wenhad better.\" Said Dex as he gathered the cards. \"I'm planningnon winning.\" Violet laughed. \"You wish.\" Later,nmuch too later for Joe, he and his cousin arrived back at thenapartment. Joe groaned and continued to try and work out his sorenmuscles. Violetnturned to him. \"Are you ok?\" Concern colouring her features. Joennodded after a moment. \"I'm just sore.\" He said tiredly. Violetnnodded knowingly. \"Go take a shower, then get some sleep.\" Shensuggested. Joenopened his eyes a sliver and peered at her. \"I left you alone fornmost of today, I'm not going to do it for dinner.\" Violetnsmiled softly and a touch of blush tinted her cheeks. \"Well… ifnyou're as stubborn as I am, then there's no changing you mind. nHow about you just go take a shower and I'll make dinner, then wencan eat?\" Joenstudied her for a moment longer, but couldn't find any hiddennagenda in that plan. Besides, she had looked so surprised andnflattered when he said he wasn't going to leave her alone forndinner. \"Ok. So what we having?\" \"Puttanesca?n I don't know I haven't decided yet.\" She shrugged and headednto the kitchen. Joenchuckled and headed to the shower.[Chapter 7] 4 Sanskrit—Thanknyou for reviewing!

I will try harder to update more consistently. bowsnhead in shame Disclaimer--- Inown nada! Violetngratefully, yet elegantly, collapsed in one of the empty seats thatnoccupied the small room in the Empire State building where peoplencould wait for family and friends that were arriving by zeppelin. nThe day had been rather hectic, in an exciting sort of way, and nownshe was just ready to see her brother and sister. Thennight Dex had come over for dinner, Joe had mentioned that he wasnlooking for a new apartment. One that was bigger, with enough roomsnfor all three Baudelaire children, as well as himself. Ofncourse, there were other criteria, an agreeable rent, close to a goodnschool, in a safe area, ect… Uponnhearing that, after teasing his friend about finally becomingnresponsible, Dex mentioned that the new apartments across the streetnfrom his apartment building might be exactly what Joe was lookingnfor. From what Dex knew, the apartments were large, and rent wasn'tntoo bad. There were a few different schools near that area, and manynmen from the base sent their children to those schools. Joenpromised that he'd look into it. And Violet had the uncannynfeeling that they'd probably end up in that apartment anyway. Itnwas across the street from Dex after all. Anfew days later, Joe took a tour of the complex, and decided that thenapartments fit the bill. So he canceled the lease on his old one,nand they moved into the new one. Just that morning they had finallynfinished setting everything up. Joe had been hesitant to do a lot tonKlaus and Sunny's rooms, because he didn't know them, aside fromnwhat Violet had told him, and Violet had a shopping appointment withnPolly Perkins to keep. Duringnsaid shopping trip, Violet not only picked up a few new skirts andnblouses along with some other necessities, but she also picked up herncousin's dislike for the reporter. The woman had tried constantlynto get Violet to tell her something about Joe, anything. nSpecifically what it was like living with the 'dedicated bachelor'.n She clamed it was for her own use, after all, Joe was quiet anfetching man. Her words, not Violets. But Violet seriously doubtednthat excuse, and kept quiet. Easily steering the woman to andiscussion that completely centered around Polly Perkins. Which wasnrather boring, but Violet only had to say a few things every couplenof sentences, and all the woman's thoughts about Joe were pushed tonthe back of her mind. So,nafter finishing the move, and finishing shopping, Joe and Violetnheaded to the Empire State building to wait until the Zeppelin thatnKlaus and Sunny were on entered New York air space and docked, andnfor the two wayward Baudelaire's to reunite with their oldernsisters. Joensmiled at his cousin as he sat down beside her and handed her a soda,nwhich she accepted blindly. He knew that she was tiered from all thenrunning around. And that was what anyone else would see, a tirednteenage girl, aimlessly twisting some of her hair, obviously notnwanting to be there. But the tension in her shoulders and the waynshe was twisting the braid around her finger practically screamednthat she was nervous and excited. \"Youndon't have to be so tense.\" His smile softened when Violetnlooked up at him startled. He gently pulled the braid out of herntwirling fingers. \"You've only been away from them for about anweek. I'm sure they'll remember who you are. And if not, we donhave a few pictures back at the apartment.\" Thatnearned him a glare, which, after a moment turned into a weak smile. n\"Thanks, but I'm still gonna hit you.\" She said, a touch ofnhumor in her voice. Joenchuckled, shook his head, then gave a mock yelp when Violet's hadnconnected with the side of his head. He looked at her, surprisednthat she would go through with her threat. Shensmirked, with a little less worry in her eyes. \"I said I would.\"n Was all she offered him. Joenshook his head, but before he could make a reply a voice over thenloudspeaker caught their attention. \"Zeppelin Ludendorff arrivingnfrom Germany by way of London.\" Clamed a booming male voice, muchnlike that of a train conductors. Joenlooked at the ceiling for a moment, as if he had x-ray vision andncould see the passengers departing. \"Well…\" He stood. Henturned to Violet, and offered her a smile and his hand. \"I guessnit's time I met this brother and sister of yours.\" Joenand Violet quickly approached the arrival gate, seeing that thenpassengers had already started coming off the Zeppelin. Joe, usingnhis height to his advantage, started to scan the passengers, hopingnto spot the two children, but it was Violet who saw them first. \"Joe!\"n She exclaimed softly, grabbing his arm. Joenglanced at his cousin, and saw the worried expression on her face. nHe fallowed her line of sight and spotted two children, a boy and angirl, who he could only assume were Klaus and Sunny. However,nlike Violet, both of those children looked worried. But instead ofnlooking around franticly for their sister, both children were lookingnat… what Joe thought was a man in a black suit who was standing anfew feet away from them. Joencouldn't exactly pinpoint why, but he had a gut feeling that this…nman was bad. He grabbed Violet and quickly strode over to thenchildren. \"Violet!\"n Klaus cried out when he saw his sister. Moments later, Violet wasnbeside him, and in front of Sunny. Blocking the younger girl fromnthe man. Joe was barely a second beside her. \"Andnyou are?\" Asked a rather high pitch voice, coming from the man innblack. Antingle went up Joe's spine. He knew that voice. It didn'tnmatter how high or low it was, or what accent tried to cover it, henknew that voice! Joenturned to face the man that had spoken and he grinned. It was morenlike baring his teeth, ready to attack and rip the man to shreds, butnhe was also aware that he was the Sky Captain, and that this was anpublic place. \"You know who I am.\" He said in a deadly pleasantnvoice. \"And I know who you are Olaf.\" He noticed that Violetnhad picked up Sunny. \"Now if you'll excuse us.\" He placed onenhand on Violet's shoulder, and one on Klaus' shoulder, ready tonsteer them away from the dastardly if stupid Count. \"SirnI'm Mr. Sage and I'm with child services. Unless you can providenproof that you are in fact the guardian of these children, I'llnhave to take custody of them.\" \"Donyou seriously think that I'm that stupid?\" Joe calmly askednOlaf/Sage with a skeptically board look. \"Wellnsir, I doubt that I'm the best person to judge your mentalncapability. However, I still need your papers, or the children.\" Joensnorted a humorless laugh. \"What are you going to do?\" Henasked, not waiting for an answer. \"Call the authorities? SorrynOlaf, maybe back in England you had some sort of power, but I'm thenSky Captain. I have not only diplomatic immunity, but also some verynpowerful friends.\" For the next bit of conversation, Joe lowerednhis voice so that only Olaf and the kids could hear. \"And all Inhave to do is say the word and you'll find yourself in a world ofntrouble. I'll give you one last chance to leave, but if I see younagain… let's just say it won't be pretty.\" With that, Joenturned away from the disguised Olaf and quickly made his way out ofnthe building, to his car, with the three children in tow.[Chapter 8] AN: I'm just reformatting the chapter, sorry! AN: I am a truly horrible person! I haven't updated in forever, and… I'd like to say that real life got in the way… and it did to some extent, but mostly… I'm just horrible! Not to mention, I've got new stuff I want to post, but I promised I'd finish my current stories first. If anyone is still reading after all this time, I adore you, and beg for your forgiveness. Dedication: Ellina HOPE, for she is my SAVIOUR! And without her I am nothing! Disclaimer: I don't own anyone you might recognize, those you don't… I might not own them either. After letting the three children in ahead of him, Joe slowly closed the apartment door, making extra sure that it closed and latched. The car ride had been a bit tense, which hadn't surprised Joe in the least; after all the children had just had another run in with that… well, man was hardly an appropriate term. Still, he was a little concerned that Klaus hadn't even tried to start up a conversation with his older sister. Surely there were many lost months to discuss. Sunny… made a little more sense, as she was just a little thing, and he had a feeling that her communication skills were rather… lacking. Normal children were usually very talkative, between themselves or with anyone who would listen. Then again, seeing as they were related to him, the Baudelaires were probably the farthest things from normal. Abnormal ran in the family. Finally the door was secured for the night. Joe could no longer avoid turning around, and he schooled his features to hide the slight apprehension he was feeling, and put on one of his most charming smiles. Once he had, he took a careful look over all three of his wards. He was pretty sure that Violet was all right; she was a little flushed and her eyes constantly darted to her younger siblings, as if to make sure they wouldn't disappear, but it was the other two that he was concerned about. He regarded the boy and younger girl with a little bit of trepidation, unsure as to how to go about greeting them. Klaus had a slightly guarded look on his face, as if he couldn't decide if being here was a good or bad thing. The youngest, Sunny, seemed content to suck or chew, rather, on her small fist and gape up at him with the innocence and wisdom that only a very small child could contain. He smiled down at her, his usual cocky grin a bit watered down with nerves. She returned the grin, best she could with her hand in her mouth. \"Gwaat!\" Which Joe took to mean \"hello strange man in the fancy jacket.\" His smile took on a bit more smirk, and he nodded at her before turning his attention to Klaus. The boy still looked nervous, but there was also a bit of... awe? Joe was use to being admired, but it was a bit different when it was his own blood. Klaus exchanged a worried glance with his sister, as if seeing what she thought of this adult man who was somehow related to them. She offered him back an encouraging smile and a subtle gesture to Joe. As if to say, 'yes, he's all right you don't need to worry.' \"I'm very... that is to say, thank you for, you know... taking care of my sister and me... I know that taking us all in... and we... we're a bit of a burden... but I'm... well...we are grateful.\" He stuttered slightly with nerves, and his eyes didn't stay on Joe. They blinked rapidly from behind his glasses and jumped from Joe to Violet to something far over Joe's left ear then back to his sister. Finally, he settled on staring down at his shoes. Violet and Joe shared an understanding smile, before Joe turned his attention back to Klaus and gave him a full smile. He didn't want to say too much, after all, they were men, and men just… well they had appearances to keep up. \"He knows Klaus,\" Violet said softly, with a smile just for her brother. \"He knows.\" The rest of the evening was spent in mostly silence, with tentative questions asked by Klaus, which were either answered enthusiastically by Violet, or gently by Joe, who wasn't quite sure how to act around Klaus yet. The boy was still so guarded. The silence was also punctured by gurgles and other such noises from Sunny who was actually managing to carry on a very interesting conversation with Joe, between the understandable questions. \"Grick!\" Which Joe took to mean, \"why did you take all three of us in?\" Joe titled his head and responded mildly with, \"because it doesn't seem fair to keep all of you separated.\" He flashed a smile to Violet, who responded in kind and laced fingers with her brother. \"Besides, someone has to keep you three out of trouble.\" Sunny made an affronted half-squawk so he quickly amended, \"I mean, someone has to keep those two,\" he jerked his head at the elder Baudelaires, \"out of trouble.\" \"Dwack,\" replied Sunny, which Joe took to mean, \"why yes, I quite agree, Mr. Sullivan.\" \"Joe suits me just fine,\" he said humbly. Sunny only nodded solemnly as Violet attempted to hide her giggles behind one hand. It caused Joe no small amount of amusement to think that if Dex was here now, he wouldn't assume that Joe had lost it. He'd know all along that Joe had gone off the deep end. Well, okay so Dex already knew that, or he at least suspected it, but conversing with a monosyllabic baby cousin would probably just confirm it. Or… or he would get that look… the look he got when Joe cornered a new pilot at the base to make sure he was fitting in all right. The look that was a strange combination of admiration, pride, and gentle amusement, and afterwards, Dex would just shake his head when Joe asked him about it. After dinner, Violet swooped Sunny up and went off to show the younger girl her new room. It was actually connected to Violet's room, that way she'd be near for any reason. Klaus's room was across the hall, Joe showed him to his room. They stood in the doorway; there was a bed against the far wall, a dresser, a desk, and a book shelf. Violet had mentioned that her brother was a very strong, avid reader, so the empty shelves would be filled in no time. There was also a decent sized window that overlooked the street and other buildings. Joe ran his hand through his hair and grinned sheepishly down at the boy. \"Sorry it's so… plain. I… I wasn't sure what you liked, and then Violet decided we should just leave it for you to decorate. If I'm off early… we could go out tomorrow afternoon and… get things… for your room.\" The boy slowly stepped into the room, and took a good look around, before turning to face Joe. There was a hesitant smile on his face, which was marginally better then the nervous look that had been there throughout dinner. \"That would be… fantastic.\" The smile reached his eyes, and he looked truly pleased with the idea. Joe chuckled, reaching out to ruffle the boy's hair. \"We can also pick you up some clothes, and other things.\" At the boy's slow nod, Joe smiled again. \"Good, now get some sleep.\" He was about to leave when Klaus spoke up. \"Um… Joe?\" Joe turned to face him, and found the boy looking at his shoes again. \"Th… Thank you for… watching over Violet, and… keeping her safe. No one else… has stayed around long enough.\" The boy shook his head. \"And… all Olaf wants is the money… he tried to marry her you know?\" It was just another reason Joe had to hate the man – forcing Violet into what would amount to a loveless, abusive marriage... among other things. \"Just for money,\" the younger boy hastened to add, as if he was convincing an audience that included himself and not just Joe. Klaus stopped speaking for a moment, collecting himself. \"So… thank you.\" Joe smiled at the young man, and put his hand on Klaus' shoulder, waiting until Klaus looked up before speaking. \"It's my honor.\" He said seriously. \"And I will do whatever it takes to make sure that all three of you are safe.\" With that and a parting smile, he left the other boy to his own thoughts. Joe paused in the doorway to Violet's room; he could hear her talking, and Sunny warbling from the other room, though he couldn't see either of them. He let them be, and headed back to the main rooms. He ventured into the kitchen and decided to wash the dishes from dinner, not that they had a lot of dishes: take out was meant to keep things less messy. Normally he wasn't very big on making sure that everything got clean right away. Oh, it got clean eventually, but it was never an urgent matter. However, at the moment, he wanted a chance to think, and washing dishes was a good way to do something productive, and still think. Mostly, he wanted to think about the children. It wasn't like he'd never entertained the idea of having children of his own some day… though he'd have to find the right person first… but he'd never wanted them to come about from such tragic circumstances. And that was the other thing on his mind. Sunny, well, she was living up to her name, and she seemed fairly content with how things were going. Joe didn't think that she didn't know what was going on. The younger a child was the better intuitive sense they had, at least that's how it was from his experience. But she seemed to be working with the changes, simply happy to be with her brother and sister and safe. Violet… well she still had her reservations, but maybe it was being the oldest, or maybe it was just a female thing, but she was handling everything fairly well. He could tell that she was still sad, sometimes when she didn't think he was looking, he saw a sort of… melancholy come over her. She had really enjoyed being with Dex the other day though, and Joe was already plotting ways to get them back together. It wasn't for her sole benefit either; the young mechanic/engineer needed friends outside of the boys working at the base. But Klaus, he was the one that Joe was rather… worried about at the moment. They boy seemed to be handling things rather well, but he was so hesitant. Joe didn't get the feeling of shyness from him, so he doubted that was any part of the problem. It was just… he wasn't as outgoing as his sisters seemed to be, though Joe could not honestly say if this was just the way Klaus was, or not. There was also the possibility that Klaus had taken it into his head that he needed to be the… protector of both the girls. As the man, that was his job, now that his father was gone. And now that they were with Joe, he wasn't sure either how to relinquish that role, or if he trusted Joe enough to give the responsibility up. \"You worry too much.\" Violet's voice startled Joe out of his thoughts, and his head jerked up to look at the girl who had managed to pull herself up on top of the counter beside the sink, without Joe even noticing. \"What?\" He asked, once he was able to form words again. Violet smiled at him. \"You worry too much. I'm fine, they're fine, you're fine, everything's going to be alright.\" Joe sighed and looked at the soppy bubbles, floating merrily along in the sink. He nodded. \"I know. Really, I do. It's just…\" \"Strange?\" Violet offered when he hesitated. Joe finally felt himself relaxing and he nodded, chuckling. \"Yes, strange.\" \"You know what would be really strange though?\" Violet asked, after a few moments of silence, watching Joe pull the drain on the sink. Joe was also watching the bubbles and water disappear. \"What?\" \"Not introducing Klaus and Sunny to Dex.\" Joe turned to look at her, smiling at the slightly mischievous grin on her face. \"Guess we've got plans for tomorrow then don't we?\" Violet nodded. \"Sounds like it.\" ","Summary":" Thisnis based of the movies of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, andnLemony Snicket a Series o"},{"Movie":"Red","Title":"I'll Always Want You Back","Author":"elsiecarson","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11545338","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Victoria wakes up in a posh, elegant Paris hotel under a cosy duvet with one hand laying flat on the bare chest of the man who saved her in Washington. Clothes are strewn across the floor of the hotel room. Victoria smiles. Ivan is lying next to her. They were in a relationship years ago, but due to Victoria's job and Ivan's nationality they were forced to separate. Victoria snuggles into the duvet as she watches the snow fall over Paris. Ivan is still asleep and Victoria doesn't want to disturb him by trying to slip out of bed. She merely snuggles closer to Ivan and deeper into the duvet and tries to go back to sleep for a while. Ivan squeezes his eyes shut as he registers in his mind that it is morning and that there is snow falling. He notices this through the crack in the drapes in the room. He looks down upon Victoria and runs his fingers through her pearl grey hair. She's so resplendent even when she's asleep. He thinks about last night and how alluring she looked in her crimson evening gown. She's so serene all the time and especially now. The gloomy sky depresses Ivan and he wishes the weather were less wintry while they're in Paris. Victoria's eyes flutter open for the second time that morning. She and Ivan have imbibed two wonderful bottles of wine at dinner the night before so they're both sleeping later than usual. As he eyes slowly open she notices that Ivan is awake finally. She sits up in bed and leans against the headboard. She is wearing an alabaster, lacy nightgown that falls to her ankles. \"Shall I order us some breakfast?\" Ivan asks as he buttons his indigo pyjama top. \"That would be lovely. I'm starving. What shall we have?\" Victoria asks as she slides out of bed and grabs the hotel room service menu. Ivan's jaw drops when he gazes at Victoria in her nightgown. He doesn't remember that outfit from last night. \"I don't know about you, but I'm going to need a very large, hot pot of tea. We had too much to drink and not enough sleep. This breakfast ought to be superb.\" Ivan remarks. Victoria picks up the phone and orders a scrumptious breakfast. She sits down on the edge of the bed. Ivan draws near to Victoria and perches on the bed next to her. She leans towards Ivan and kisses him. Ivan brushes Victoria's hair back from her face and kisses her temples. Victoria lies back on the bed and Ivan kneels over her. Ivan kisses Victoria's cheek and then kisses her neck. The knock at the door surprises them. Despite the fact that Victoria had ordered room service the noise startles them. Ivan smoothes his pyjama top, grabs his wallet, and opens the door for the hotel worker. Victoria ties her silk robe around her waist as she sits down to breakfast. \"My God, you are so beautiful. How did I ever let you go?\" Ivan asks as he sits across from Victoria. \"I don't happen to think it was entirely your choice. I had a decision to make: show that I could kill you or be assassinated by my own people. It was a difficult decision to make and I've rethought the decision I made many times. I don't like the decision I made then. I don't know that I would make that decision again, but I was scared.\" Victoria says as she pours herself a cup of tea. \"How have you stayed so gorgeous? I've gotten old and fat and you don't look any different.\" Ivan asks as he spoons up some fruit salad. \"I stayed in the CIA until 5 years ago. I had to stay in shape in order to stay alive. I was working out every day until that time.\" Victoria explains as she pours milk into her tea. \"My body would have survived that and my metabolism would have kept up.\" Ivan says as he pours himself a cup of tea. \"You're so silly, Ivan. You make me laugh and you make me happy. I can't believe we're finally together. I never thought I'd ever see you again when I left you that night and I certainly didn't know you were living in Washington. I would have tracked you down otherwise. I have come to talk to you.\" Victoria says she eats a bite of French toast. \"I would have tried to seduce you and it would have worked too. You would have given in to me.\" Ivan says as he wiggles his eyebrows at Victoria. \"You mean to tell me that if I'd walked into the Russian Embassy you would have embraced me with open arms and loved me like you used to? You have got to be kidding me. You would have tried to have me killed.\" Victoria says as she spoons rhubarb yogurt over her fruit. \"I would never have ordered you killed. I would have yelled at you and been angry, but I would never have wanted you dead.\" Ivan says honestly. He's always loved Victoria. Victoria finishes her fruit and yogurt and continues to drink her tea. She stands up, goes to the window, pulls open the drapes, and stands there watching the snow fall onto the monuments of Paris. Looking at the amount of snow that has already fallen Victoria judges that it's been snowing for about six hours. Victoria holds his china teacup and saucer in the palm of her hand. Ivan comes and stands behind Victoria and wraps his arms around her waist. \"I'm sorry the weather isn't nicer for our time in Paris.\" Ivan whispers. \"Paris is just as beautiful in the snow as it is in the spring. We will still be able to enjoy Paris even if it is snowing. We can still go out to dinner and the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower. We can go where we like.\" Victoria says as she snuggles against Ivan. \"If you are willing to go out in this weather I will certainly go with you wherever you want to go.\" Ivan says as he runs his hands up and down Victoria's arms. \"Of course we're going out. We came all the way to Paris. We're not going to let a little bit of snow stop us.\" Victoria says as she brushes her hair back off her forehead. \"I'm going to have another cup of tea and then we can get dressed and get going.\" \"Alright, I'll go have a quick shower and then I'll start getting dressed.\" Ivan says as he walks towards the bathroom. Ivan would fall on his knees and do everything and anything for Victoria. If Victoria wants to go out in the snow and wind of Paris then that is exactly what will happen. Ivan goes to sort through his suitcase to find warm enough clothes to wear to go out in the winter weather. Victoria smiles as Ivan walks away from her. She never thought she would get to be this happy especially because if her chosen career path. She drinks the dregs of her tea and walks into the bedroom to sort out an outfit. She knows Ivan will just be picking out warm pieces, whereas she's looking for an actual outfit. She never wears something that doesn't go together. Victoria hears the water running in the bathroom and smells Ivan's body wash waft through the room. She pulls a white sweater, black leggings, white boots, and a white coat out of her suitcase. Ivan comes out of the bathroom just in time to see Victoria bend over to slip clean panties on. Ivan's breath hitches in his throat. Victoria sits on the edge of the bed and begins to carefully pull on her leggings. Luckily for Ivan he wore his wool, three-quarter length coat on the plane over to Paris. He pulls a dress shirt, a sweater, and a pair of wool blend pants out of his suitcase. \"Do these pieces go together?\" Ivan asks as Victoria pulls a pair of socks on. Victoria looks over at the pieces Ivan's chosen to wear. Surprisingly, despite Ivan's lack of fashion sense, he's managed to put together a polished, sophisticated outfit. \"That looks lovely, Ivan. It's very sophisticated.\"[Chapter 2] \"Let's go to the Louvre first then.\" Ivan says as he watches Victoria pull her coat on and zip it up. \"Perfect,\" Victoria says as she smiles at Ivan. They walk down the hall to the elevator and when they reach the lobby Ivan requests a taxi. As they sit in the lobby waiting for their transportation Victoria tries to take in the opulence of the hotel. \"How did you pick this hotel?\" Victoria asks as she turns towards Ivan. \"You don't remember? I thought for sure you'd remember this hotel when you say it again.\" Ivan says sadly. Victoria frowns and furrows her brow as she looks around the lobby again. A look of realization dawns across her face slowly. She reaches for Ivan's hand and looks at him tenderly. \"This is where we made love for the first time. I can't believe you brought me back here when we got back together. That is so romantic!\" Victoria says as they climb into the taxi. \"I just wanted to prove that I remember how wonderful our relationship was before. I wanted to show you I had no hard feelings over you shooting me. I wanted you to know I love you with every beat of my heart.\" Ivan says as he slips his arm slowly around Victoria's shoulders. \"I never doubted you for a moment. I watched your eyes when I shot you and I couldn't believe the amount of emotional pain I saw there. I'm surprised you even wanted me back after I did that.\" Victoria says wiping a tear out of her eye.[Chapter 3] Ivan pays the taxi driver when the taxi stops at the Louvre. Victoria steps out of the taxi into the wind and snow of Paris. Ivan follows her out of the taxi. They rush across the cul-de-sac into the foyer of the Louvre which is mostly deserted. Ivan pays for two entrance tickets and they slowly walk through the wings they didn't get to see the first time they were in Paris. They saw the Mona Lisa the first time, so at least they don't have to stand in line for that painting. They stand in front of several grand, iconic paintings that neither ever thought they'd see. Ivan stands just behind Victoria with his arms around her shoulders and Victoria leans back onto Ivan's chest as they look at each painting. Victoria sighs as they continue to walk through the vast rooms of the Louvre. \"Are you alright, Victoria?\" Ivan asks as he glances at her. \"I'm hungry and I'm tired. There's too much to see in the Louvre all in one go.\" Victoria whispers, trying not to disturb the other people in the gallery. \"Why don't we go get something to eat then? I know a couple of wonderful, small cafés around here.\" Ivan says as he reaches for Victoria's hand and walks towards the exit of the Louvre. \"That sounds like a wonderful idea. I'm craving a Parisian espresso.\" Victoria says softly. \"You want more caffeine? Haven't you had enough yet?\" Ivan asks leading her down the street and around the corner from the Louvre. \"You can never too much good Parisian espresso.\" Victoria says as she and Ivan blow into the café. \"Bonjour Monsieur Simanov! Long time no see! Who's your lovely lady friend?\" The café owner says. He's known Ivan for a long time. \"This is my girlfriend, Victoria. She and I are back in Paris for the second time together.\" Ivan smiles at the café owner and Angélique, the waitress, as he speaks. \"How lovely! Welcome back to Paris! What can I get for you?\" Angelique asks as she pulls out her notepad. \"I'll have an espresso and a chocolate crepe.\" Victoria orders off the menu. \"I'll have a cup of tea and a croissant with cheese.\" Ivan requests gently. \"You two are adorable together! I'll be right back with your drinks.\" Angelique says sweetly. \"This is a lovely, little café, Ivan. How did you ever find it in the middle of Paris.\" Victoria whispers. \"I was here on assignment about 15 years ago and I was told about this café by a friend. I come here every time I'm in Paris. By the way I booked us a reservation at the Eiffel Tower restaurant tonight.\" Ivan smiles sheepishly at Victoria. \"Oh Ivan, that's so romantic! You didn't have to do that, but I'm glad you did. That was so sweet!\" Victoria smiles widely. \"We won't be able to dress as elegantly as we would like to because of the weather, but we'll enjoy it all the same.\" Ivan says sadly. Angelique brings over their drinks. \"Merci Angeliqe.\" \"That's alright. I don't mind at all. As long as I'm with you, I don't mind how we're dressed.\" Victoria says gently. \"I love you, Ivan.\" \"I love you too, Victoria. I'm glad I got the opportunity to finally tell you so.\" Ivan whispers as he holds Victoria's hand. Angelique brings over their lunch remains silent. She doesn't want to interrupt their special moment. They seem very close and Angelique is surprised that Ivan didn't mention her before. Victoria breathes in the lovely smell of warm cheese, chocolate, fresh crepes, and croissants. \"It smells heavenly.\" Victoria says as she picks up her cutlery. Ivan doesn't say anything in return. He's already pulled his croissant in half and is starting to eat. Soon the food is gone and Ivan is leaning back in his chair, happy and content. \"Shall we head back to the hotel and have a leisurely afternoon before we go to the Eiffel Tower for dinner?\" \"That sounds wonderful. I could use a nap before we go out for dinner.\" Victoria yawns. \"We'll have to walk back in the direction of the Louvre if we are going to get a taxi back to our hotel.\" Ivan puts a 10 euro note on the table. \"Let's get moving then. It's not a short walk back to the Louvre and it's still snowing heavily.\" Victoria slips her white coat back on and zips it up. Ivan takes Victoria's hand in his and walks towards the exit. \"Merci Angelique!\" Ivan calls happily. \"De rien, Ivan. Come back again soon!\" Angelique calls after him. \"She was very nice. Did you used to date her?\" Victoria asks as they walk back towards the Louvre. \"How did you know?\" Ivan asks incredulously as he hails a cab. \"Oh Ivan, I only had to look at her looking at you to know. She was crushed when you introduced me as your girlfriend. I could see it in her eyes.\" Victoria says as they pile into the cab.[Chapter 4] The cab drives across Paris slowly in the snow. \"Where would you like to go for Christmas?\" Ivan asks as he puts his arm around Victoria's shoulders. \"I'd like to be at home for Christmas. I sort of already invited the team to spend Christmas with me.\" Victoria says sheepishly. \"You're welcome to come, of course. You are part of the team.\" \"That's fine by me, but I was rather hoping that I was more than just a member of the team.\" Ivan says sulkily. \"Of course you are, but if anyone asks, the official reason you're at my house for Christmas is because you're a part of the team. That makes us less conspicuous together.\" Victoria says teasing him. \"Someone will figure out what we are to each other. They already know what we were to each other before. What do we do when they do figure it out?\" Ivan asks. He likes to plan ahead. \"Of course someone will figure it out. We're former spies. We're meant to ferret out secrets. We'll admit it when someone calls us on it, but I'd like to try to keep it a secret for a while.\" Victoria says as the cab comes to a stop. Victoria and Ivan climb out of the cab and head up to the room.[Chapter 5] \"What time is it and what time is our reservation for?\" Victoria asks as Ivan opens the door to the suite. \"It's two o'clock now and I booked our reservation for seven thirty. We've got lots of time.\" Ivan says as he unbuttons his coat and slips his boots off. \"That's lovely. I think I'll take a nap now then. I'm tired; it's been an eventful day.\" Victoria yawns. She unbuttons her heavy coat and pulls it off. She sits on the edge of the bed and pulls her boots off. \"A nap sounds wonderful. I can't believe how tired I am from walking through the snow.\" Ivan says as he pulls his sweater off. Victoria lies down on the bed and pulls the covers over herself. Ivan climbs into bed and sets the alarm clock for 5:30 so that they have enough time to dress for dinner before the limo comes to take them to the Eiffel Tower. Soon Victoria is fast asleep and Ivan stays awake watching the snow continue to fall on Paris. He isn't as tired as he told Victoria he was. He just wants to be near her. Victoria starts snoring gently and Ivan can't help but smile. He doesn't remember her snoring when they were together when they were younger.[Chapter 6] Victoria groans in complaint when the alarm clock goes off at 5:30. She reluctantly climbs out of bed and goes into the closet. She pulls out a silver evening gown with sleeves and fuchsia trim. She finds her fuchsia peep toe pumps and starts to get ready. \"Are you sure you want to get all dressed up? It's awfully snowy out there and we'll have to walk a ways.\" Ivan asks frowning. \"We're going to the Eiffel Tower restaurant for dinner. We have to dress up! We'll take a cab over and back. We'll be fine in our nice clothes. Please Ivan, do this for me.\" Victoria requests. \"Come and zip me up.\" \"All right, all right,\" Ivan says as he steps in behind Victoria and zips up the dress. Victoria shivers when she feels his fingers on her back. Victoria opens her purse, finds the lipstick she wants and puts some lipstick on. \"I got you a present.\" Ivan says as he picks up a jewellery box from the bottom of his suitcase. It's a blue Tiffany's box with a white ribbon around it. Tears fill Victoria's eyes. \"Go ahead and open it.\" Victoria reaches out with shaking hands for the box. She wasn't expecting a gift from Ivan. She slips the white ribbon off the thin, wide box. With trembling fingers she slowly opens the lid of the box. Inside the padded box lies a diamond necklace. Victoria's hand flies to her mouth. \"Ivan, I can't accept this. This is a terribly extravagant gift.\" Victoria is in shock. \"Now listen, there's a story behind this necklace. I had the diamonds when we were together the first time. I had Tiffany's set the diamonds into a necklace then but I never got a chance to give it to you. The necklace was designed for you and I couldn't imagine give it to anyone else, so I locked it in my safe deposit box. When we got back together I went and retrieved it. This was always meant for you.\" Ivan says as he carefully lifts the necklace out of the box and clasps it on. \"Go take a look.\" Victoria again wipes away tears as she stands up and walks over to the mirror. \"It's so beautiful, Ivan. You have impeccable taste.\" \"It's beautiful just like you are Victoria. It enhances your beauty. Wear it tonight for me.\" Ivan pleads gently. \"You don't have to persuade me. It goes well with my evening gown.\" Victoria smiles and fingers the necklace that Ivan has given her. Ivan is now dress in his tuxedo and is trying to tie his bow tie. He sighs in frustration when it doesn't go right. Victoria steps in behind Ivan and unties his bow tie and then nimbly reties the black, silk fabric beautifully and straight. \"How do you manage to do that?\" Ivan asks as he puts his cufflinks in and pulls his tuxedo jacket on. \"I used to tie my father's ties for him. I got quite good at it. It's come in handy in my adult life.\" Victoria says as she passes Ivan his coat and then slips her own white coat on and buttons it up. She goes over to the coat rack and grabs their scarves. She ties her own and then walks over to Ivan, wraps his scarf around his neck twice and then ties it in an elegant knot.

After Epps is released from the hospital she begins trying to move on with her life. It was hard till a man came into the picture who understood her. - Chapter One: Prolougue - Epps was still broken and torn from the recent, yet not so recent events. Losing the fatherly figure she had and the man she had deep desires and feelings for, Dodge. Not to mention her three other friends. Santos, Greer, and Munder. She walked down the street acting normal, well as normal as one could act especially after such tragedy. Now the hard to get over roadblock. Moving On. Could she move on? She had to right? The real question was though, Would she allow herself to move on with life? She needed to begin a new path one with smooth soft sand with no rocks, pebbles, or ruts. She needed to look in the light not the dark. As she glanced up she decided to test her ability to move on. She was going to have a fresh start. No move, nor new house. Just a fresh path. She would stay a salvager. It was what she loved. She just had to find someone who needed a crew member on a low count salvage crew. Giving a deep sigh she looked around the town. It hadn't changed. Not one bit. It was still the same. But she. She had changed so much. She had lost Three friends, a parental figure, and a secret love that didn't know she loved him. That was the worst thing about all of this. Never being able to tell Dodge she loved him. Looking at the sky she played with the small heart locket that had belonged to Katie Harwood. She was going to wear it to keep it as a trinket to remember her as, how the little ghost girl helped her find out the truth and get off the sinking ship alive. Maybe that was a sign she lived on because she had a path, and a life ahead of her many could only dream of. Reaching the apartment building she lived in she opened the door and looked around. Nothing changed of coarse except she welcomed the smell after being in the medicated smelling hospital. She walked through the small living space before sitting down. She then grabbed a cigarette and lit it. Taking a long drag from it she blew the smoke out through her lips and let out a relieved sigh. Boy she needed that. Maybe later that night she would clean the place. Maybe go shopping or something. She needed a small get away and maybe new clothes would help her, Even if she was a tomboy. Finishing her cigarette she dashed it in the ash tray and stood. She cleaned out her closet except for the few things she really liked. She placed it in a garbage bag and changed after showering and cleaning up. Dressing into something clean and decent she grabbed her wallet and headed out the door. Finally reaching the store she began looking around grabbing some jeans, shirts, shorts, underwear, a few bras, and shockingly a skirt she went to the dressing room to try things on. She had changed. More than she thought.[Chapter 2] AUTHORS ANNOUNCEMENT To anyone who read chapter two (which i have taken down) and went \"what the hell is this?\" I apologize that chapter was meant for another story and I do not know how it got into this story. but it is now down and in its proper story - I will be updating this fic soon with its proper chapter - sorry for the confusion and I hope it has not turned you away from my writing.

Luckily he has Frank Moses on his side (Post-Movie, friendship Cooper/Moses, violence, language). AUTHOR'S NOTE: Nothing's mine. And beware. English is not my first language, but I hope the story is readable. CHAPTER 1 William Cooper stood motionless in front of his door. The biting wind made him shiver, but he didn't move from his spot. He saw soft light coming from the living room and knew that Michelle was waiting for him. This wasn't unusual, but dread was still curling in his chest. Since the disaster with Frank Moses their marriage was strained. Michelle had grown distanced and Will couldn't really blame her for it. He understood her feelings and he had tried his best to reassure her and the kids. He had offered to look for a new home and he had tried to spend as much time as possible with them. Of course Michelle had been aware that his work wasn't an ordinary 9-to-5 job, but there was a big difference between knowing something and experiencing it firsthand. Will had explained that Moses would bother them never again and that they never had been in any immediate danger, but Michelle didn't believe him. And Will still couldn't blame her for it. She hadn't met Moses. She knew nothing about the man. Will sighed softly and opened the door. Time to face the music. \"Will?\" He sighed again. His wife's voice sounded tired and strained. This was the fourth day in a row he came home this late and he felt guilty. \"Yeah, it's me. I didn't think you'd be still awake.\" Michelle was sitting on the couch. Her left hand was clenched in her grey cardigan and Will instantly knew that this meant trouble for him even though her face was impassive. The agent got out of his coat and suit jacket and draped the garments over the back of the couch. Will stepped closer to Michelle and leaned over to kiss her, but she turned her head away. \"We need to talk, Will.\" He sank heavily onto the couch. Deep down he knew what Michelle was about to tell him, but he didn't want to acknowledge it. Maybe it was just another mundane problem and she only wanted to hear his opinion. \"Will… I don't think I can go on like this.\" \"Like what?\" \"You know what I'm talking about. I don't feel safe here anymore. I jump at every damn shadow. Gracie and Jack are scared too. This isn't our home anymore!\" Will knew all of this. It was not the first time Michelle had told him this after all. He answered like he had done before, \"We can move, Michelle. That's no problem at all.\" \"Move? Where? Into a bunker ? What guarantee can you give me that we will be safe?\" He could give her no guarantees. Will longed to restore her sense of security. He longed to restore their previous life. But he couldn't. \"Michelle, please…\" \"No, Will. No.\" Michelle rose and nervously paced the length of their living room. \"I'm sorry, but no. You know what I want.\" He felt ice-cold. He wanted to protest, to beseech her, but no words came over his lips. Michelle looked close to tears as she said, \"I want a divorce, Will.\" \"Michelle… We…\" He had to take a deep breath. \"You want to throw our marriage away? Just like that? We can…\" \"We can what !? There's nothing we can do. And do you really think that this doesn't upset me as well? Do you think that I don't care? That this is easy for me? I love you, Will, but I can't live with you anymore. I have to think about Jack and Gracie. And…\" Michelle fell silent. Tears were streaming down her cheeks and Will had a lump in his throat as well. He wanted to rail at her, but he knew what she was talking about. He didn't want to admit it, but he had always known that having a family in his line of work was bordering on insanity. He knew that he had been selfish. Reckless, even. But he loved Michelle. He remembered their first meeting as clear as if it had been yesterday. It had been love at first sight. It had been fucking perfect. Their life together had been fucking perfect. And now it would be all over? Will didn't want to accept this. There had to be another way to solve their problems. \"Do you want me to quit my job? I'll do it. I'll find something else.\" She shook her head. \"You love your job.\" \"I love you and the children more.\" Why was she still shaking her head? He meant it. Michelle wiped her tears with a shaking hand away and said, \"I can't ask that of you.\" \"You don't have to.\" \"Will… This won't work.\" \"Why? Tell me what you want.\" Her hands knotted again in the folds of her cardigan. After several moments of strained silence she finally answered, \"I've met someone.\" What? Will couldn't believe what he had heard. He felt like someone had sucker punched him. She had met someone? The words were fairly tumbling out of her mouth and her voice was getting louder as she explained further, \"His name's Ben. He is an architect and works from home. I met him at the coffee shop near Gracie's school. He is good with children. He… He is good for me. I didn't plan this. It just happened.\" Will's hands had balled into fists. It had just happened ? Ben? An architect? He would find and kill this fucking wife-stealing asshole! He just couldn't believe it. Yes, they had problems, but not even in his darkest nightmares he would have thought that Michelle would cheat on him. How could she? He had done everything in his power to save their relationship and she went and fell for this fucker Ben! \"I can see you're mad at me, Will. I understand that. But I simply can't live with you any longer. I hope you can forgive me someday.\" The fight suddenly deserted him and left him exhausted and sick to his stomach. She couldn't live any longer with him. He had blown it. He wished that he at least could blame his failing marriage on Frank Moses, but even that was impossible. Moses had only shown him how vulnerable he was in his personal life; he never would have really exploited this weakness unlike many other potential enemies. At least Michelle, Gracie, and Jack were only scared and not dead. Will rose and collected his jacket and coat. He slipped them on and said without looking at Michelle, \"I'll get my stuff later.\" \"You don't have to. We will move in with Ben.\" Of course. Will only nodded silently and turned to leave. He needed some space. Michelle made no move to stop him. It was over. TBC.[Chapter 2] CHAPTER 2 FIVE MONTHS LATER Sofia, Bulgaria Frank Moses rolled onto his back and threw an arm over his eyes. It was three in the morning and sleep was tenaciously eluding him. He always had been a light sleeper who only needed a few hours rest, but his sleeplessness was starting to take a toll on him. It had started almost a month ago. Things between Sarah and him hadn't worked out like he had hoped. At first everything had been great. He genuinely liked Sarah and found her sometimes a bit naïve enthusiasm very endearing. And she seemed to like him back. After their second month together everyday life had ended their honeymoon and the first problems had cropped up. Frank was reluctant to talk about his past with Sarah. A lot of things were too terrible or too dangerous to tell her, but she wouldn't drop it. A part of him could understand her curiosity and her wish to get closer to him, but another, bigger part resented her for her prodding. Frank had long ago made his peace with the past; he just didn't want to talk about it. Their talks had turned into discussions; their discussions had turned into fights. Another problem was Sarah's growing realization that their lifestyle was not at all comparable to her romantic novels. Frank and the other R.E.D.'s were good, but not every mission was a cakewalk. Sarah didn't have their training and their experience; it was only natural that she felt often out of her depth, especially when one of them got injured. He knew that she felt helpless in these moments, so he had asked Victoria to take Sarah under her wing. The two women had formed an unlikely friendship and Sarah could only benefit from Vicky's skills. Sadly, this hadn't worked in the long run either. Sarah and Frank had drifted apart and decided to end their relationship. It had been painful for him, but strangely relieving as well. Frank didn't know what to think about that. With a barely suppressed groan he sat up and swung his legs over the edge of his bed. Had there really been love between them? Frank wasn't sure, but he missed Sarah. He missed the connection they'd had. Frank rose and silently dressed himself. Sleep was out of the option and the little hotel room was suffocating him. He needed some air. Despite the late (or early) hour, Sofia was still awake. There were still people on the streets and the somewhat dingy looking bars near the hotel were open. Frank was aware that he should lie low. Tomorrow was their big day. They had planned to infiltrate the Mexican embassy and to take out a high profile drug runner. No problem for them, but they shouldn't attract any undue attention beforehand. Frank nevertheless entered one of the bars. He wanted a drink. And he needed some sort of distraction. The bar was seedier than Frank had anticipated. A handful of patrons were slouching at the bar, some of the rickety tables were occupied. Most of the men and women were obviously drunk and seemed to have no better places to be. It was a sad tableau. Frank moved deeper into the bar. Nobody was paying him any attention. He ordered a whiskey and ambled over to the far end of the bar. He just wanted to take a seat, when a man sitting in the remotest corner of the room grabbed his attention. He couldn't see his face, but his posture was familiar. Frank strolled closer. A slight grin curled his lips, as he said, \"I didn't think I'd meet you here, Cooper.\" The young agent lifted his head. He looked terrible. Someone had beaten him, although judging by the state of his hands he had given as good as he had received. Dark circles ringed his hazel eyes and he was radiating weariness. His hair was disheveled and longer than Frank remembered. His stubbled cheeks and informal clothes made him look strangely unfamiliar. Frank pulled one of the chairs closer and sat down. Cooper took a swig of something that looked like vodka and finally replied, \"What are you doing in Bulgaria?\" \"I'm here for a job.\" \"Do I want to know?\" Frank grinned again. \"Probably not.\" Cooper took another swallow and simply nodded. Frank's amusement faded as he studied the younger man closer. Cooper seemed downtrodden. An air of melancholy hung around him. And this close his injuries looked quite bad. Had someone actually tried to strangle him? \"Do you need a doctor, Cooper?\" The agent grinned mirthlessly and answered, \"Have my medicine right here.\" He saluted Frank with his glass, drained it, and ordered another shot. Seeing this made Frank feel strange. With some surprised dismay he finally identified this nagging feeling as worry. Why the hell was he worrying about Cooper? The man was a trained agent and more than capable in his job. His injuries were most probably quite painful, but surely not life-threatening. Cooper would never take such a risk. Or would he? Frank felt suddenly unsure. Cooper's demeanor was unusual. And Frank had to admit that he had a bit of a soft spot for the agent. He had liked the younger man right from the start. His single-mindedness and general approach to the job reminded Frank of his own methods. And he had taken Cooper's attempts at apprehending him never personal. He knew that the agent had simply followed his orders. He knew that feeling; after all most of Frank's career had comprised of nothing but following orders. But Frank was also aware that the others didn't share his view about Cooper. Marvin or Vicky would already have tried to kill the agent for his past transgressions. The younger man suddenly asked, \"Are you here to finish the job?\" Frank blinked. He had no idea what Cooper was talking about. What job? They had spoken a handful of times after the VP-affair, but they had never broached topics like their respective missions. Cooper could impossibly know about their job in the embassy. But what else was he talking about? Frank had already opened his mouth to question the younger man further, when Cooper's posture once again came to his attention. At first glance the agent looked calm. Almost relaxed. But Frank could clearly feel the tension in his frame. As if he was readying himself for an attack. \"I'm not sure I know what you're talking about\", was finally his cautious answer. Cooper tossed his shot of vodka back like it was water and replied, \"Didn't think you'd play coy with me.\" \"I'm not playing coy . I just have no idea what you're talking about.\" Frank was not ready to let the cat out of the bag. Their infiltration was none of Cooper's business. \"I'm referring to your repeated tries to kill me. The car bomb. The hidden sniper near my house. The poison in my shaving cream, which was a nice touch by the way. The 'botched' burglary. Should I go on? Honestly, I'm a bit surprised that you try a frontal assault now.\" Frank wasn't sure what surprised him more. The fact that Cooper thought he was trying to kill him, or the unemotional way the younger man had talked about his several near-death-experiences. He took a sip of his terrible whiskey and said, \"Why the hell should I want to kill you? We parted on good terms. And really, poison in your shaving cream ? I'm almost insulted.\" This was not Frank's style and Cooper was well aware of that. The agent silently stared at Frank, who calmly reciprocated the look. In this case he had nothing to hide. At last Cooper nodded and ordered again. What was wrong with him? Frank didn't want to pry, but his curiosity got the better of him. \"What's up with you? You seem so… different. Has something happened? Is your family okay?\" Cooper's mouth twisted and Frank was quite aware that he was doing the same thing Sarah had done: stirring up the past and nosing around in private matters. And Sarah's curiosity had been understandable and normal, whereas Frank had not really the right to question Cooper. To Frank's further surprise the agent answered him, \"My family… Michelle left me and took the children with her.\" Shit. Frank hadn't expected that. Cooper and his wife had seemed so close. Like an unbreakable unit. Frank had the nasty suspicion that their split had at least in part to do with his home invasion, but at that time he had seen no other option. His fear for Sarah had obliterated any other concerns. \"Cooper… Dammit, I'm sorry. I…\" The agent interrupted him, \"Don't. It's not your fault. Fucked it up all on my own.\" Frank doubted that but he wisely kept his mouth shut. He asked instead, \"When did she leave?\" \"About five months ago.\" \"Does she know about the attempted hits on you?\" \"Nah. We haven't spoken much.\" Frank rubbed his face. \"When was the first hit?\" \"About two months ago.\" Christ. This was getting better and better. \"What does the company say about this whole mess?\" Cooper shrugged. Frank stared at him in exasperation. The agent surely couldn't be serious. \"You haven't told them?\" Suddenly something occurred to him. \"You think they sanctioned the hits on you?\" The younger man shrugged again. \"I'm not sure.\" Frank sighed deeply. It would not be the first time the CIA turned against its agents. And Cooper had been embroiled in some very sensitive matters. Frank drained his glass, gestured towards Cooper's face, and asked, \"Was that your would-be-assassin?\" \"Nah. That was just work.\" Frank had to admit that he was curious, but he didn't ask further. Cooper's job was none of his business. So he just nodded and ordered another whiskey. Cooper and he sat in companionable silence. Frank was actually quite surprised how comfortable he felt around the younger man. He pondered for a moment if he should offer his help, but he squashed this impulse almost as fast as it arose. Cooper probably would only be insulted. And Frank certainly had his own problems to contend with. The minutes ticked by. Frank alternated between watching Cooper and the sad crowd around them. He wasn't sure which depressed him more. After his third whiskey he rose, threw a few bills onto the table, and said, \"I'll better get going. See you around, Cooper.\" The agent saluted him again with his refilled glass and slouched back into the shadows. Worry gnawed at Frank, but he didn't turn back when he left the bar. He had a job to do. TBC.[Chapter 3] CHAPTER 3 TWO MONTHS LATER Somewhere in America Will was in pain. No, he was in agony . His left shoulder was dislocated again and he hadn't been able to properly set it on his own. His back felt like someone had poured acid over it. Several lacerations hindered his movements and fresh blood was steadily running downwards and soaking his shirt and dark blue suit jacket. He was sure that he had at least two broken ribs. Then there was a broken right wrist and several deep cuts on his right hand courtesy of a shattered window. Driving his car had nearly been impossible in his state. He was actually surprised that he had come this far. He didn't know if his attacker was still pursuing him. Maybe he had managed to kill the man, maybe not. When his house had started to burn, Will had decided that it was time to leave. He had felt a distant pang at seeing the destruction, but all the good feelings he had associated with his home had evaporated when Michelle and the kids had left. Will killed the engine of his car and carefully opened the door. Every movement sent harsh jolts of pain through his body. He slowly shambled around the car and braved the short distance to the nondescript house. He didn't know why he had come here, but it had been the only place that had popped up in his brain. Will reached the front door. He knocked with a shaking hand on the white painted wood and frowned with dismay at the streak of blood he left there. He was debating internally if he should try to remove the stain, when the door suddenly opened. Will unsuccessfully tried to contain a flinch. He hadn't heard anyone coming to the door. He should pay more attention. Will blinked a few times and forced himself to focus on the person in the doorway. It was Moses. Who pointed a gun directly at his face. After a few tense seconds the former agent lowered the weapon and said, \"Cooper. Didn't expect you to visit. Wanna come in?\" Moses didn't ask how Will had found out about his new home. He didn't comment on the bedraggled state the agent was in. Will slowly shuffled over the threshold. He felt dizzy and desperately wanted to sit down. Or lay down. Suddenly it occurred to him that he should warn Moses about his attacker. He cleared his throat and mumbled, \"Maybe I've a tail.\" \"Maybe?\" Moses didn't turn around. He disappeared in the kitchen and Will followed him. Maybe he could sit down there. And maybe Moses had a glass of water for him. When Will entered the kitchen nobody was there. He slowly looked around in the nondescript room, and then shambled over to the table. With a barely suppressed groan he sank onto one of the wooden chairs. He tried in vain to find a more comfortable position. But sitting was at least better than standing. His eyes drifted close. A hand touched his left shoulder. Will jerked awake. He had been badly startled and fresh pain exploded in his dislocated joint. God, he wanted to die. But no death was forthcoming; instead a pair of gentle hands was starting to divest him of his jacket and shirt. Moses carefully took hold of his left arm and said softly, \"Brace yourself.\" Before he could prepare himself, Moses wrenched his shoulder joint back into its customary place. Will couldn't hold back any longer. His pained cry echoed through the room. Will was shaking like a leaf in a storm and the queasy feeling of faintness had intensified. He wasn't sure if he could stay conscious for much longer. Why did his shoulder hurt this time much more than the first? It was fucking unbearable. Moses gave him a few moments, and then he started to methodically clean and bandage Will's wounds, who desperately wished for unconsciousness. After a seeming eternity Moses was finally finished. He helped Will to his feet and said, \"C'mon, kid. You should lie down a bit. I have a spare bedroom.\" Will automatically wanted to protest, but he swallowed his words. He was in dire need of some rest and a safe place. And Moses could provide these things. He should simply take what was freely offered. They finally reached the small bedroom on the first floor. Moses maneuvered Will carefully down onto the mattress and efficiently stripped him of his shoes, socks and slacks. Only clad in his underwear, Will curled around himself. He was just dimly aware that Moses tucked him in, before his exhaustion overwhelmed him. TBC.[Chapter 4] CHAPTER 4 Frank sat beside Cooper and watched him. The younger man had slept for almost ten hours and now was slowly stirring. A frown marred his beaten face and it was clear that he was in quite a bit of pain, but Frank didn't dare to dope him up too much. He needed Cooper as lucid as possible. Cooper's frown deepened and he slowly blinked his eyes open. They were glassy and unfocussed and Frank suppressed a curse. He needed some answers from Cooper and his sad state wouldn't be helpful for their little interview. He suppressed a sigh and asked softly, \"Are you thirsty, Cooper?\" The agent nodded weakly and Frank helped him drinking. After Cooper had settled back into the bed, Frank decided that there was no time like the present and he started his questioning. \"Cooper. What happened? Who attacked you?\" Cooper blinked sluggishly and hoarsely answered, \"He was there. Wasn't careful enough. Jumped me.\" \"Who, Cooper?\" \"Don't know.\" Great. Frank assumed it was the same guy that had repeatedly tried to off Cooper in the past. Apparently he had gotten in a lucky hit. \"Where did he attack you? Cooper?\" The younger man's eyes had closed again and he sounded far off as he whispered, \"Home.\" Cooper's breath evened out and Frank let him rest again. He knew the basic facts, now he was debating how he should proceed. Of course Cooper could stay with him as long as he wanted, at least as long as he had somewhat recovered. But should he maybe do more? He liked Cooper and he actually hated seeing him like this. Whoever the mysterious assassin was, he had attacked the young agent viciously. Those injuries were not meant to kill, they were meant to hurt. The knife slashes were far too shallow for killing strikes. It looked like the attacker had just played with Cooper and Frank was surprised how much that thought infuriated him. Frank decided to investigate a little. \"Please, Victoria. You don't have to do anything. Just watch over him for me.\" \"Fine, Francis. I will watch over Agent Cooper. This one time. And just because it is you that asks.\" Frank sighed with relief. Pestering Vicky into caring for Cooper had been nearly impossible, but he didn't want to leave the younger man alone at home. Cooper was feverish and restless and Frank feared that he wandered off in his daze. She was his only option. Cooper's home was a wreck. The house had burned and was now nothing more than a ruin. Frank stood on the trampled front lawn and silently examined the agent's home. He wondered not for the first time what he was doing here. Cooper's assailant was surely long gone and he wouldn't have dropped some helpful hints if he was moderately proficient in his line of work. This was a dead end. And still Frank was here and stared at the destruction. He could almost picture what had happened here. Cooper, coming home after a long day at the company, entering his house. Maybe he had been just tired. Maybe he had been distracted by something. The assassin had probably lain in wait close to the front door and he had struck as soon as Cooper had entered the house. That was what Frank would have done in his place. Their fight had probably ranged through most of the ground floor and somehow a fire had started. Frank suspected that the source of the flames had been the kitchen. And then Cooper had cut his losses and luckily managed to get away. \"Did you know them? The Coopers, I mean.\" Frank turned sideways. Cooper's neighbor, an elderly lady with steel gray hair and a benign expression, had ambled over to him. He had seen her, when he had arrived, poking around in her garden. Obviously her curiosity had gotten the better of her. And Frank was sharply aware that the neighbor was referring to the Coopers in the past tense. \"I know Will. What happened here?\" The neighbor touched a hand to her lips and compassionately replied, \"Oh, didn't you hear already? It's terrible. First Michelle and the children left, and now this tragedy. It's simply terrible.\" Frank suppressed an annoyed sigh and he asked again, \"Did something happen to Will?\" \"The poor dear was in the house when it burned down. I really hope he didn't have to suffer. What a terrible way to go. Anyways, I'm terribly sorry for your loss…\" The neighbor was nattering on about the dangers of life, but Frank wasn't listening any longer. He made appropriate noises at the appropriate moments, but his thoughts were far away. So there had been a burnt body inside the house. Had Cooper actually managed to kill his attacker and hadn't even noticed it? The younger man had been pretty out of it when he had reached Frank's home, but he surely had been more alert during the actual fight. Something strange was going on here and Frank's interest was piqued. He disentangled himself from the neighbor and made his way home. TBC.[Chapter 5] CHAPTER 5 \"We need to talk, Cooper.\" Will slowly opened his eyes. Two days had passed since his fight with the assassin. His fever had broken overnight and although he was still in a considerable amount of pain he finally felt a bit better. Moses was standing next to Will's bed and was watching the agent with an unreadable expression on his face. Will supposed that Moses wanted him gone. And he couldn't blame the man for it. Were their roles reversed, he would be anxious as well. Will's attacker was probably still out there and looking for him and it was not fair to drag Moses down with him. He didn't want to cause problems for the other man. Moses took a seat and said, \"I was investigating a bit while you were unconscious. Apparently there was a body inside your house. Your neighbors think that it's you.\" \" What ?\" \"Is it possible that you killed your attacker?\" Will repeated his \"What\" and elaborated, \"Nah. I don't think so. He had the upper hand. No. I would know if I had managed to kill him.\" Moses looked thoughtful. \"I was asking around a bit. Every official channel reports that you're the dead man in the house. Apparently you were the victim of an unfortunate accident.\" Will frowned. Maybe it was the repeated hits to his head, but he couldn't understand why the company wasn't clearing up this misunderstanding. His confusion must have been apparent, because Moses said, \"That are not good news, Cooper. Officially you're dead. Now they can do whatever they want with you.\" \"Nobody can stop me from sorting this fuck-up out.\" \"No. But do you really want to go public? There must be a reason why they are hushing things up. They have put a body there, if you didn't kill this punk.\" Will felt suddenly very cold and his breathing got shallow. Moses leaned forward and placed a gentle hand on his uninjured shoulder. \"Cooper. What's wrong?\" Nausea churned Will's stomach and he mumbled, \"Michelle. The kids. They think that I'm dead…\" \"Jesus…\" Moses's voice sounded faint and he gently squeezed Will's shoulder. \"Look, Cooper… Will. It will be alright. We'll sort this out. We'll find a way. I promise.\" \"How? How can we sort this out? It's… They…\" \"Easy, Will, easy.\" Will wanted to howl. His job always had come first in his life and he had served his country faithfully. And now they were doing this to him? He didn't deserve this shit! He wanted his goddamn life back! He wanted his job and his family back! Why him? Will became aware that Moses was talking to him. The older man's voice sounded soothing as he said, \"At first we need to find out why the company is out for your blood. Think, Cooper. Why would anyone want you gone?\" Will took deep breaths and tried to calm himself. He thought back to the last few months. Nothing untoward had happened. He had done his job as usual. Since the VP-affair his life and his work had been unremarkable. He haltingly said, \"Fuck, Moses, I don't know. I just don't know.\" Moses sighed softly. \"Looks like I have to investigate a bit at the company.\" \"Moses… Don't.\" Will didn't know what to think about all this. On one hand he was almost touched by the concern the other man showed him and he was glad to receive some help, but on the other hand he didn't want to drag Moses down with him. It was far too dangerous. \"Just… Just give me another day and I'm outta here. You don't need to involve yourself further. I shouldn't have come here in the first place.\" \"Yeah? And what the fuck is your plan? You're barely able to stand let alone defend yourself. They will be after you again and the next time they'll kill you. Come off your fucking high horse and let me help you.\" \"This has nothing to do with my pride, goddammit! I just don't want you to get into this too deep. If you snoop around at the company, they will come for you too.\" A soft smirk flitted over Moses's face and he said, \"Aw, Cooper. I didn't know you cared that much.\" \"Fuck you.\" There wasn't much heat behind Will's curse. He didn't really mean it and his energy was slowly fading. Exhaustion was gnawing at him and he wanted to rest. His eyelids grew heavy. Moses's voice barely registered with him, when the other man said, \"Rest, Cooper. We'll talk later again.\" Will mumbled, \"Just be careful, Moses.\" A few moments later Will was asleep again. TBC.[Chapter 6] CHAPTER 6 Frank sat at his kitchen table and nursed a drink. His earlier infiltration hadn't been a roaring success. Cooper had told him the truth. There was nothing unusual or suspicious around him. Frank thumbed again through some of the files he had managed to copy. A soft knock on his door roused Frank out of his reverie. He grabbed his gun off the table and made his way to his front door. Before he could check, who was visiting him at this late hour, a familiar voice called out, \"Do open the door, Francis. My feet are getting cold.\" Frank put his weapon away and unlocked the door. Vicky swept inside, kissed Frank lightly on the cheek, and marched directly into his kitchen. He sighed and followed her. \"Do you want a drink, Vicky?\" \"Please.\" Frank fixed her a whiskey and then took a seat opposite her. Vicky took a sip and asked, \"Is Agent Cooper still with you?\" Frank nodded. \"Do you think that this is a wise decision, Francis?\" \"What am I supposed to do, Vicky? I can't toss him out on the streets. They'll kill him.\" \"You are under no obligation to help him. In case it has slipped your mind, he tried to kill you the last time.\" \"Wait a moment. He never tried to kill me. He tried to arrest me. Big difference.\" \"Oh, please, Francis. Now you are splitting hairs. Fact is that Agent Cooper got on someone's bad side and this someone tries now to kill him. I just don't want you to get caught in the crossfire.\" \"I really appreciate your concern, Vicky, but I know what I'm doing.\" Vicky took another sip of her drink. \" Why are you doing this, Francis?\" Frank drank too to give himself some time to think. Why was he doing it? He reluctantly answered, \"I don't… He's one of the good guys, Vicky. He's good at his job and he still has his moral compass. He doesn't deserve this shit. His family doesn't deserve this shit. I just want to help him out a bit. Just like he helped us out with the whole vice president situation.\" Vicky smiled suddenly and said, \"You like him.\" Frank automatically wanted to deny it but he said instead, \"Kind of… Yeah, okay, I like him. Happy now?\" Vicky smiled some more and then asked all business, \"So. What's our next step?\" \" Our ?\" \"Of course. We are a team after all.\" Well, Frank couldn't argue with that, so he told Vicky everything he had managed to unearth so far. Which was admittedly not much. \"So you don't know yet who tries to murder our Agent Cooper?\" \"No. There is nothing off around him. Looking at this evidence alone I'd say that the company isn't involved in the hits on him. But they released a statement that he's dead. Why would they do this, if they weren't responsible?\" Vicky hummed softly to herself and finished her drink. \"Looks like we need to talk to Agent Cooper again.\" Frank could only agree. Will groggily blinked his eyes open. Something had woken him rather abruptly. For a terrifying second he thought that his assailants had found him again, a look around his room showed him that it was only Moses. And Victoria, who perched on the edge of his bed. What was going on here? Will pushed himself up into a vaguely sitting position and reached with an unsteady hand for the glass of water on his nightstand. Victoria leaned forward and assisted him. He nodded his thanks. Will cleared his throat and asked Moses, \"How was it at the company?\" \"Uneventful and rather unenlightening. Everything looks inconspicuous.\" \"I told you so.\" \"'I told you so's' aren't going to help us, Cooper.\" Victoria ended their gentle bickering by saying, \"Agent Cooper, please try to remember if you have any enemies outside of the company. If they are not involved in the assassination attempts then it has to be someone else.\" Will snorted. On his missions he had acquired plenty of people who wanted to see him dead, but he couldn't think of anyone who would want to see him dead that badly. And he told Moses and Victoria that. Moses looked doubtful and Victoria said, \"Well, someone does want to see you dead, Agent Cooper. And it would be helpful if you could point us in the direction of some of your enemies. Sitting here around isn't accomplishing much. And I would rather hate to see get Francis caught up in your deadly problems. So tell us who wants to eliminate you and we'll kill this piece of shit for you and then we can hopefully get all back to our lives.\" Will settled back against the headboard. He thought for several minutes. Neither Victoria nor Moses interrupted him, they both waited patiently for his conclusion. Finally he said, \"There was a weapons dealer in Eastern Europe. He had his base in the Ukraine. We… I ended his career quite… brusquely a few years ago. He managed to evade capture, but he lost everything. He never resurfaced so we assumed that he died. Maybe he isn't dead after all.\" \"What's his name?\" \"Nikolai Shermetjew.\" Victoria asked, \"Is there anybody else?\" Will racked his brain again and he finally came up with two other possible candidates. Manuel Delgado had been a drug lord and Stephen Canterbury had been a former soldier, who had betrayed some sensitive information about the American missions in the Middle East. \"Those are the most obvious candidates. I can't think about anyone else.\" Victoria nodded. \"Well, that is at least something. We will investigate. And you should rest some more, Agent Cooper. You look rather alarming.\" She patted his shoulder, rose, and left the room. Moses lingered a few moments longer and said reassuringly, \"Don't worry, Cooper. We'll take care of it.\" Of course Will knew what Moses and his compatriots were capable of but he felt nonetheless unhappy with these developments. He felt like he was letting Moses and the others down. They were about to fight his battle and he hated that thought. This was his problem. It was bad enough that he had dragged Moses into this fucked-up situation and now Victoria was involved too. He wouldn't be able to forgive himself if something would happen to them. Moses had watched Will the whole time and now a crooked smile appeared on his face. \"Just accept our help, Cooper. Right now you can't do anything else. Your shoulder is still a mess. Your wrist and three of your ribs are broken. You are a liability. Vicky is right. You look like absolute shit. So rest, relax, and accept our fucking help. Wasn't that the reason why you came to me? To get my help?\" Yes, Will had hoped for Moses's help, but it still rankled that he had to rely to this extent on this help. He wanted to do something. But Moses was right. He was fucked up. Even heading to the john was a major undertaking for Will. It looked like he had to bite the bullet and sit this one out. So Will just nodded. Moses smiled reassuringly and left Will's room. \"Stephen Canterbury is dead. Shot in the head. And Manuel Delgado is in prison.\" Frank leaned back into his chair and sighed. That left Nikolai Shermetjew, who was apparently something like a phantom. The man had simply vanished from the face of the earth, but he was their only suspect for now. \"Nikolai Shermetjew is still unaccounted for. But I found a Yuri Shermetjew, who seems to be Nikolai's brother. Maybe we should have a little talk with him.\" \"Vicky, you are the best. Where is Yuri now?\" \"His last known location is D.C.\" \"What a coincidence.\" \"Indeed. Ivan has put his feelers out as well and we are quite sure that we have found the new address of Yuri. Do you fancy a quick talk with him?\" \"I'd love to.\" TBC.[Chapter 7] CHAPTER 7 Yuri Shermetjew was a rather slight and mousy-looking man. He was non-descriptive to the extreme and completely unassuming. He was wearing a non-descriptive and cheap suit, his hair had a non-descriptive cut, and his pasty and weak-chinned face had no distinct features. Frank had met men like him a thousand times. Yuri was bland, but there was something about him that rang every alarm bell in Frank. He wasn't sure what rubbed him the wrong way, but the second he saw Yuri, he knew that there was more to him than met the eye. Maybe Frank's gut-feeling was wrong, but he was sure that Yuri had something to do with the hits on Cooper. Vicky, who sat beside Frank in his car, looked contemplative as well. Apparently she had detected something as well. \"What do you think, Francis?\" \"Maybe I'm mistaken, but I think the little rat is our man.\" \"Maybe you are mistaken, but there is something about Yuri that I don't like.\" Marvin, who occupied the backseat, added, \"I don't like him either. He looks fishy.\" Yuri entered his house. Frank, Vicky, and Marvin exited the car. Frank and Marvin ambled over to the front door; Vicky went to the backdoor in case their mark tried to escape. Frank rang the bell. \"Why are we doing this, Frank?\" \"Marvin…\" \"No, this is insane. Totally insane. We are talking about helping Cooper. Cooper ! He is one of the bad guys and here you are running around trying to help him. You should have taken him out when he first came to you.\" \"He isn't a bad guy, Marvin. He helped us. I trust him. We can trust him.\" Marvin still looked unimpressed, but they had to put their discussion on hold, because someone was coming to the door. Yuri opened the door and looked at them. \"Yes?\" \"Yuri Shermetjew?\" \"What? Who… Who are you? What do you want from me?\" Slight panic had made its way into Yuri's voice, which surprisingly had almost no detectable accent. Frank shoved the small man forcefully back into the house and directed him into the kitchen. Marvin closed and locked the door and trailed after them. Frank pushed Yuri into one of the simple wooden chairs. \"Sit down, Yuri, and shut your trap.\" Shermetjew looked intimidated and did what he was told. Was this little mouse really behind the attacks on Cooper? It seemed farfetched. Frank took a seat too and watched the squirming Yuri for a long and silent moment. Marvin leaned against the doorframe and seemed wholly engrossed in his piggy. \"I have a few questions for you, Yuri.\" \"Questions? I don't know you. I don't know what you are talking about. What are you doing here? I… I want you to leave. I will call the police. Please leave.\" Frank ignored Yuri's nervous blabbering and asked instead, \"Do you know the name William Cooper?\" Shermetjew visibly blanched but he said nervously, \"No. No I don't know this name. What do you want from me?\" Marvin said without looking at them, \"Don't lie to us, you little shit. What do you want from Cooper?\" \"I don't know what you are talking about.\" Marvin simply opened his piggy and extracted a fearsome looking knife. Yuri gave a little squeak and cowered deeper into his chair. Frank sighed. \"Just tell us all you know and we won't need to hurt you. So, what do you want from Cooper? Is your brother behind all this?\" Yuri seemed to fold into himself. His voice was wavering, as he answered, \"Nikki is dead. He killed himself two years ago. He said he couldn't live any longer like this. Always looking over his shoulder, always on the run. These bastards ruined him! They destroyed him!\" Frank didn't really feel any sympathy. \"He was an arms dealer. He got what he deserved.\" \"He was not!\" Yuri had righted himself in the chair and stared furiously at Frank. \"He was no criminal! He was tricked by your CIA! They destroyed him! They took away everything important to him! He had to hide and live like an animal! And it was all this Agent Cooper's fault! He destroyed Nikki!\" \"So you decided to get even with Cooper.\" Yuri nodded defiantly. \"Yes. I have money. I know it doesn't look like it, but I have money. I hired an assassin. One of the best.\" \"But that's not the whole story, right, Yuri?\" \"No. It's not.\" \"Then why don't you tell us the rest of it?\" Shermetjew licked his lips and finally told them, \"I bought Cooper.\" Frank blinked in surprise. \" What ?\" Even Marvin looked up and seemed somewhat taken aback. Yuri elaborated, \"I contacted your CIA and told them I wanted Cooper. We came to an agreement. I paid some money and they said I could take him out without repercussions. And that's what I did. But Cooper somehow managed to kill my assassin so I have to send out a new one. Sooner or later I'll get him.\" \"With whom did you speak at the CIA?\" Yuri shrugged. \"The name was Thompson or so.\" Thomason. The new agent in charge of Cooper. Frank filed this information away for later. Cooper would surely want to have a conversation with this bastard. At first they had to take care of Shermetjew. Frank saw the little man in a completely new light. The guy had actually contacted the company and had bartered for one of their agents. Frank didn't know if Yuri had balls made of steel or if he was simply insane. Either way, the man had to be stopped. Sooner or later one of his assassins would get in a lucky shot. Frank didn't like it, but Shermetjew had to go. He pulled out a gun. Yuri watched his move with wide eyes, but he didn't say anything. Frank had expected begging or bargaining, but Yuri kept his silence. Another surprise for him. Frank decided to make it fast. As much as he despised Shermetjew for his underhanded tactics, he didn't plan on torturing the man further. So he simply rose und dispatched Yuri with a bullet to his head. Marvin grunted and petulantly asked, \"Are we finally done here? Can we go now? I want pancakes.\" Frank sighed and nodded. \"How are you feeling, Cooper?\" \"Better. Thanks.\" The younger man was half-sitting, half-lying on the bed and stared listlessly out of the window. Frank didn't like the look in Cooper's eyes, but he didn't comment. Instead he simply told him what had happened at Shermetjew's house. Cooper listened silently. He didn't move a muscle and there was no hint of any emotion on his face. Finally he said musingly, \"So it was Thomason.\" \"Looks like it.\" Frank paused for a second. \"Listen, kid. You need help with this?\" Cooper resolutely shook his head. \"Nah, I'm good. I'm going to take care of it myself. Thanks for the offer, though.\" Frank nodded. He hadn't expected anything else. He was aware that Cooper had absolutely hated the fact that they had helped him out, but there had been no other way. \"What are you going to do with your family?\" Cooper sighed and a look of profound unhappiness crossed his drawn face. \"To tell you the truth, I have no idea. Of course I want them to know that I'm okay. I want to see my kids again. But I don't know… I need to think about it. I don't want to endanger them further.\" In moments like this Frank was almost glad that he had no family. Sometimes it could get very lonely, but at least he didn't have to worry constantly about the safeness of the people he loved. How could the agent bear this? Cooper's gruff voice startled Frank out of his morose thoughts, \"I think I should get going. I imposed on you long enough.\" \"Don't be an idiot, Cooper. Stay a few more days. I don't mind.\" \"Okay.\" Silently they watched each other. Suddenly Cooper said, \"He was an arms dealer, you know.\" \"Who?\" \"Nikolai. I observed several of his transactions. We had ample documentation. He was the real deal. He was not innocent.\" Maybe he was mistaken, but Frank thought that there was a faint thread of anxiety in Cooper's voice. He hastened to soothe the other man, \"I know, kid. I know. It's okay. You did your job.\" Cooper nodded, but there seemed to still hang an air of melancholy around him. Frank was surprised that he actually wanted to make the younger man feel better. He knew exactly how Cooper felt. He had felt exactly the same several times in his life. He wanted to help, but at the same time he wasn't sure how. He didn't want to make things worse. So he kept his silence, gently patted Cooper's uninjured shoulder, and left the room. \"You really ready to go, Cooper? You can stay longer if you like. I really don't mind.\" Will couldn't help it, he had to smile. He'd had no idea that Frank Moses – the deadly and famed Frank Moses – could be such a mother hen. It was almost funny. \"I'm good, Moses. I need to take care of my business.\" \"Be careful, kid.\" \"Sure. Thanks for your help, Moses. I really appreciate it.\" Moses shrugged. \"No big deal.\" Will gave a half-smile and made his way to the door. As he reached for the doorknob, Moses said, \"Don't be a stranger, kid.\" Will nodded and left Moses's house. He paused for a second on the porch. He still wasn't sure what he would do now, but he would find his way. At first he would pay a visit to Thomason. Everything else would come to him in time. THE END.

When I heard that they were making a second movie, I wasn't entirely sure how good it was going to be. I am happy to say that I was very pleased with the new movie! It is a welcomed addition to the movie I love so much, and I have no doubt that the spectacular Robin Williams would be proud of this production. And to top it all off, there was some pretty good eye candy, too! Yes, the man who had once terrified me as a child is now one of my top obsessions as of lately. The new and improved Russel Van Pelt has my heart, along with a few other men I don't need to mention ;) So, I just couldn't help myself and here's a love story with him :) :Summary: Emma Adams is trapped within the now-videogame Jumanji, taking on the player avatar Jessie Jinx; a young archeological geographer that was once apart of a successful group lead by Dr. Bravestone. When four new players start the game, Emma finally meets the ruthless man that has been hunting them down for years. They were struggling to survive before- now Emma's unexplained connection with this deadly enemy may get them all killed. :WARNINGS : Mild swearing Suggestive themes May contain sexual in later chapters, but only if you guys ask for it :) \"Heh, I defanged a snake.\" A loud chorus of agitated groans started up from the small group of four, all of them turning to glare at their short friend and yell, \" Fridge !\" in sync. \"We get it – you defanged a snake,\" a tall, muscular man uttered to his former friend. \"Good for you. Now just drop it.\" Fridge's face quickly morphed into one of offense. \" Excuse me? That wasn't just some ordinary damn snake, Spencer; that was a black mamba ! Just two drops of potent black mamba venom can kill a full-grown human adult! Like cobras and coral snakes, the venom of a black mamba contains neurotoxins, which are fast-acting toxins that destroy the nerve tissue and shuts down the nervous system and-\" \"-Paralyzes its victims, painful destruction of tissue, causing almost certain death, yeah, yeah, yeah ! We get it, Fridge, alright? You defanged a cobra! Good job for the hundredth time,\" Spencer groaned, desperately trying to end the tiring conversation once more. Fridge huffed and crossed his arms over his chest, his face scrunching into a scowl. Thankfully, he seemed to have finally let the conversation go. The group could hardly hold their sigh of relief as they were finally able to walk through the small town in relative silence. To any passing person, the small group of four would have looked no different from the last nor the next. However, the group wasn't normal like the village people who were currently ushering around them, going about their normal daily lives like any other. Or, was it the villagers who were not the normal ones? Fridge's wasn't all too certain anymore. The four people that drudged through the happy marketplace were anything but ordinary. The bodies they currently inhabited were not their own - well, neither was this world. The group was, in actuality, young teenagers who had all decided to play the fateful video game Jumanji. F ateful that game was, indeed. After what had seemed to be a shortage in the wiring or something of the sort, the teens - who would not normally be considered friends back in their own world - were sucked into the video game, taking on their previously chosen character avatars. Now they were stuck in a strange place with odd rules with three other people they would not have bothered to talk to on any normal day. Unfortunately, this was not just any other normal day, and the only thing that currently made any sense to Fridge was the fact that he couldn't eat cake because it made him explode and he was an expert on animals; so much so that he was able to defang a snake within a second's notice. Neither of these two facts made very much sense to him still. Everything was so confusing and so wildly different that Fridge wasn't exactly sure how to act; should he treat this as though he were merely in some sort of coma-induced dream, or as though everything was actually real and truly dangerous? He did not know, so Fridge did the only thing that made any lick of sense - he had become angry and would remain that way until he figured out how to properly react to everything. He crossed his arms gruffly over his chest and mumbled under his breath, \"it wasn't no dang cobra. I defanged a black mamba, that's what it was.\" \" Fridge !\" He was about to retaliate once more when suddenly he felt a harsh tug on his arm. He turned to glare at whoever had grabbed him, thinking it was one of the villagers trying to sell him some unneeded object or unwanted food, but his words lumped in his throat and caught instantly. The person who had grabbed him wasn't some little begging child ready to rob him blind the first chance they got, nor was it another potbellied old man trying to make him to explode by giving him more pound cake to eat. It was a woman. Her small hands were grasped around his arm loosely as she looked up at him eagerly, her shoulder-length golden hair swaying in the light breeze, causing the loose curls to graze along the sides of her rosy cheeks. He was taller than her by only a few inches, but it still felt like an accomplishment for the short male. Feeling a sense of pride by this small feat, he dared to flash the woman a charming smile and boasted, \" well hey there.\" \"Franklin Finbar,\" the woman gushed, her bright green eyes sparkling brightly as her red lips grew into an innocent smile. \"Thank goodness I have found you! You must hurry, all of Jumanji needs you!\" Fridge couldn't help but laugh. He looked back at his bewildered friends and puff out his chest with pride. \"You hear that? She said Jumanji needs me.\" \"Wait, you need him ?\" an overweight middle-aged man asked with a raised brow. \"'Cuz I think you meant him,\" he pointed towards the towering Spencer. \"Shut it, Bethany, she said she needs me !\" Fridge glared at the woman trapped within a man's body. Bethany raised her hands in surrender and hissed, \"jeez, sorry .\" \"Um, hi - excuse me, Miss?\" Spencer spoke up, leaning down to eye level with the blonde woman. Her eyes flickered to his, her face dropping into a blank stare almost immediately. \"Well, ah, you see, we have this map that has a missing piece. We came here to find it but only found a little elephant underneath a black cobra and we were wondering if you knew where to begin the climb, by any chance? Or, better yet, do you know where the missing piece is?\" \"It was a black mamba.\" \"I don't think that really matters right now, Fridge.\" \"It matters to me, 'cuz I was the one who defanged it!\" Spencer elbowed the shorter man in the ribs then looked back at the girl with an expectant smile. The stranger simply stared back at him, her pale face devoid of any emotion. Then, her eyes darted back to Fridge. Green eyes lit up once more and she smiled a large, toothy grin. \"Franklin Finbar!\" she exclaimed once more. \"Thank goodness I have found you! You must hurry, all of Jumanji needs you!\" Spencer's face fell and he clapped his hands together in agitation, realizing instantly that she must have been an NPC. \" Right . I don't know why we keep trying that.\" \"You must hurry, all of Jumanji needs you!\" \"Should we go with her?\" a tall woman with red hair asked softly. She felt the eyes of her friends all turn to her, and she averted her gaze shyly. \"I-I mean, maybe she'll lead us to the missing piece?\" \"We? I think you mean me ! The girl asked for Franklin Finbar, not any of y'all,\" Fridge argued, sending a glare at the group as he shook his hands at them in warning. Biting her lip, Bethany spoke up, \"but what if, like, you need to fight a dinosaur or something?\" Fridge suddenly looked less sure of himself. \"Hmm... Didn't think of that,\" his lips flattened as he mulled over the possibility. In any normal circumstance, he would have laughed at the ridiculous thought. However, the small group of four teenagers had been trapped inside an actual video game for Lord knows how long and he still wasn't entirely sure he knew what the game's limits and rules were yet. And with only three lives to spare, they had to test the waters carefully before treading too far at sea. Suddenly, he reached out and snatched Bethany by the sleeve of her jacket and pulled her up next to him. \"That's why you're coming with me. After all, you are the paleontologist!\" \"What? Wait- no! I was only kidding!\" the poor, portly woman shouted and tried to squirm out of his sturdy fingers. However, Fridge's grip was strong, and he wrestled against her attempt to flee. \"Hey, hey!\" Spencer boomed over the squabbling two, glaring at the bickering teens like a scolding parent. \"We'll all go. Together , alright?\" The stranger – who's face had grown utterly blank through the entire ordeal - popped back into her excited state and she chirped once more, \"you must hurry! All of-\" \"Jumanji need us, yes, we get it,\" Spencer cried as he ran his hand over his face. \"Just - just lead the way already.\" The happy woman's face grew even brighter seeing that the group was finally going to follow her, and when she turned and began scurrying down the crowded road she practically bounced with each step. The group quickly raced after her, trying to keep her waving golden hair in sight as they struggled around the densely packed people. \"Hey! Miss, wait up!\" Spencer called out. \"Don't go so fast!\" Bethany whined. They weaved in and out of the people's way, not knowing where they were headed or if the woman they were so mindlessly following was leading them into a trap or puzzle or another level of the game. She may have even been leading them nowhere, for all they knew. The woman was surprisingly fast, the group quickly found out, and on more occasions than one they had thought to have lost her. However, every time they were ready to give up their seemingly fruitless pursuit, they'd see the crimson red of her lips or a flash of the sandy color of her outfit once more. The small glimpses of the stranger were just enough to keep them going. Spencer had just side-stepped around yet another annoyed villager when he caught sight of a group of large, burly men further down the path. They were pushing the innocent villagers out of their way with great force and yelling curses and threats about them, not caring if the person on the other end of their assault was man, woman, or child. Occasionally, one of the men would grab an unsuspecting villager by the collar of their clothes and begin demanding to know where the \"strangers\" were. Spencer had a pretty good idea who the strangers they were looking for were. Instantaneously, his heart began pounding overwhelmingly in his ears as his chest tightened in panic. He settled a firm hand on both Martha and Bethany's shoulder, stopping them in place as he managed to say one single word; \" run .\" With that said, he turned and bolted in the opposite direction. The remaining three friends didn't process his word quick enough. With a loud shout from one of the burly men, followed by a chorus of hearty shouts, they knew they had been spotted. The group scattered, looking for places to either escape the streets or hide from their enemies. Fridge jumped behind a pillar and flattened himself between the hard stone and a carriage full of odd looking fruits, praying no one had seen him. His prayers were seemingly answered when two men three times his size stampeded right past him and his safe haven. He let out a long sigh of relief, his heart thundering loudly in his ears as he tried to steady his breath. \"Franklin Finbar!\" Fridge shouted out in shock as he was suddenly face-to-face with the beautiful stranger from before. She smiled innocently at him with her wide smile and big eyes. \"Thank goodness I found you! You must hurry, all of Jumanji-\" \"Is in danger, I know, but right now I'm the one in danger, so keep it down !\" Unfortunately, his efforts to stay hidden were in vain. One of the men had heard his shout from further down the street and had easily pinpointed Fridge's location from there. Letting out a mighty battle cry and raising a sword as thick as his arm over his head, the gorilla of a man came charging towards Fridge like a mad bull. Fridge froze on the spot, his body going into panic mode and enabling him to move. He was being run down by a giant behemoth of a man and he couldn't do a thing to protect himself. There was a sudden tight grip on his wrist, and before he knew it he was yanked out from between the pillar and carriage and was being pulled along through the streets by the strange woman. They ran hand-in-hand fast and hard, the large man right on their heels as the two desperately tried to get to safety. When he heard gunshots, everything began to pass Fridge by in a blur. He hardly noticed at all where he was headed, let alone when the guiding grip on his wrist had disappeared. The only thing that processed in his mind in that moment was to keep on running. The path luckily was now clear of any innocent townsfolk, allowing him a straight shot to wherever he was running to without a worry of running someone over. He made a sharp left, only to be stopped dead in his tracks as he saw a large brick wall directly in front of his previously clear path. He was in a dead end. He just barely noticed a gleam of light in the corner of his eye and he darted his gaze towards the fast movement, only to see something soaring through the air right towards his face. Just as the object had gotten mere inches away from his nose, a hand shot out and caught the deadly weapon mid-flight. Fridge blinked hard, his dark eyes nearly going cross-eyed as he tried to see what had been thrown at him. It was a knife. Fridge was so overcome with stunned relief that he very nearly crumpled to his knees. His eyes followed up the large, muscular arm of his savior, and Fridge came face-to-face with the face of Spencer. Spencer glanced down at him, silently asking if he was alright. \"I hate this game,\" was the only thing Fridge could muster up to say. The man that had thrown the dagger charged, but Spencer met him halfway. He reared back his arm and slammed the man into a table, then literally threw him up into the ceiling. Fridge, along with Bethany and Martha - who he had only just realized were also there - could only gape at their nerd of a friend in pure awe, completely stunned with the new-found strength as he skillfully dodged and attacked the four remaining bad guys; he had even managed to punch one through a brick wall and snap another's neck. However, their victory was short-lived as a loud gun shot went off right behind them. The four whipped around with startled shrieks, only to be met by their remaining pursuers. The larger men were standing shoulder-to-shoulder across the alleyway, successfully boxing them into the small area and blocking their only means of see-able escape. They had been caught. In the lead of the men stood another; he wasn't quite as bulky or as broad as the other men, but he was taller and still very muscular. He looked at the four teenagers as intently as a hawk would study its pray, with his head cocked to the right and a sneer on his tanned face. Fridge couldn't help but be reminded of the previous school year in his zoology class. They had been studying amphibians, so the class was required to dissect frogs. He could remember exactly what he had felt in that moment as well as he could the day he made his first touchdown. It was the strange feeling of having complete control over something; the growing feeling of learning everything there was to know about something so small with a simple passing glance; the quick feeling of disgust after the curiosity had passed. He had felt all of that for a simple science project - for a long-dead frog used for learning. Now he was the frog, and this man was the unamused scientist studying his trapped specimen from underneath the dark shadows of the buildings. \"Man, I hate this game,\" Fridge said again, backing up further away from the threatening men. \"Quick, Fridge,\" Spencer elbowed the shorter man. \"Get my boomerang.\" \"Yeah, okay,\" he said, quickly slinging his backpack over his shoulder while not allowing his eyes to leave the image of the horrifyingly towering men. He flipped open the top flap of the bag and began rummaging through its contents with haste. The longer his hands searched, the more anxious he grew. He even dared to look away from the danger and further rummage through the contents of his bag, but to no avail. \"Um, Spence?\" he said, his voice cracking slightly. \"It's not in here.\" \"What? What do you mean it's not in there?\" \"I mean, it's not in here!\" \"How can it not be there?\" \"I don't know how it's not in here, but the thing ain't in here!\" \"Hey Mouse,\" they heard a honey-smooth voice call. All eyes turned to the wall behind them, and Fridge was instantly met with the sparkling green eyes of the stranger from before. Her face held nothing but laughter as she sat on the edge of the rock wall, swinging her crossed legs without a care in the world. \"Looking for this?\" she cooed, holding up Spencer's boomerang. She laughed at the look of bewilderment and shock on their faces as she dangled the wooden weapon carelessly within her fingers. She tossed the boomerang up into the air and snatched it back, her grip tightened around the object as she swung her legs around to the opposite side of the wall. Using her unoccupied hand, she kissed the tips of her fingers delicately and blew a kiss. \"Good luck,\" she sang with a wink. Then she was gone, the only evidence that she was ever there being the gentle laughter that echoed through the small space and buzzed around their heads. Fridge stomped his foot, his face scrunched in both fear and anger as he did so. \"Man, I hate this game!\" The group turned their attention back to the men in front of them, all of whom looked mildly confused at what had just taken place. All but the tall stranger with the single blind eye. He stared at the vacant spot the girl was seated just moments before with an indifferent look, then back to the group of four. With a dark leer, the man spoke in a low, demanding tone that turned the group to ice. \"Get me that stone.\" His men were instantly snapped back to reality. Without a moment's hesitation, they began closing in on the small group, readying their weapons as they did so. The group huddled close together, eyes darting around the enclosed area, all silently trying to find a means of escape that didn't involve the wrong end of a gun. The men raised their weapons and took aim as evil, broken grins spread across their gruff faces. The group could do nothing but huddle closer together and pray for a miracle. A miracle came, then, with a quick shout and smoke bombs. As a dark gray cloud of smoke began to fill the air, another stranger jumped from the shadows and began quickly ushering the small group of four away from the chaos and into the safety of a nearby building as gunfire began to ring out. The last thing they heard was an icy, booming voice shouting, \"kill them!\" and the loud stomps of heavy footsteps chasing after them before they took cover in an underground tunnel, not yet fully understanding what had just happened, who the tall man with the icy stare was, or the blonde woman who stole Spencer's boomerang right from under Fridge's nose, or if the woman was a friend or enemy. A/N: Hope you enjoyed! Please follow and favorite if you did, and a comment to tell me any pointers or notes you may have. Love keeps me going :*[Chapter 2] A/N: Sorry this one is kinda long; I just couldn't bring myself to cut it in two! Hope you enjoy :) The young woman lounged back in her hammock, lazily throwing and catching the wooden boomerang continuously as she let the warm breeze swing her gently back and forth. Her green eyes were trained on nothing in particular as she caught the delicately carved wooden stick once more, listening to the sound of the birds singing their songs and little monkeys chattering away without a care in the world. The sun was slowly falling from the sky as the moon prepared to rise, causing warm and cool colors to fight for the remaining spaces in the sky. The receding streaks of light beamed from the enormous bowl of blue, trying to touch as much of the jungle as it could before the twilight finally beckoned the stars. Vermilion, sangria, and amethyst emblazoned the sky in a great mix of smears and smudges, then darkens to obsidian. The ever-growing dusk was a welcomed source of peace for the woman. It was her favorite time; it wasn't fully day, and yet it wasn't fully night either. It was just... Peaceful . She leaned further back into the ropes of the hammock and breathed in the scent of the surrounding forest, a semblance of a smile forming on her dark lips as she sighed sweetly. In that serene moment, she allowed her mind to think back to earlier that day; back to the marketplace. As soon as her eyes had spotted them, she knew what they were. The strange group wandering the marketplace that day were not simply NPCs the game had conjured up. No, there were four new players added to the game. And if luck was on her side, one of them was carrying the Jewel. And maybe this new group would finally help her and her companion get back home. The game Jumanji had the unfavorable habit of adding in certain levels that could only be completed successfully by a player with certain skills; skills in which neither she nor her fellow comrade Alex Vreeke possessed. The two had tried on multiple different occasions to complete the game on their own, but the more they had tried the more it became apparent that the game could only be beaten when all six of the character avatars were occupied. Emma had been in the game for years; well, at least, that's what it felt like to her. She knew that she couldn't have been in the game for a couple of months at most, but it felt a good deal longer. The first week she had arrived in the new world, every day seemed to rush past her in the blink of an eye. Now the days dragged on and the most she did in a day was going to the market or some other small village town. She and Alex both had long since stopped trying to defeat the game. To start the game, a player is given three lives. Alex had already lost two when Emma had met him, and she had done everything to preserve her only three. Ever since she had lost her first life to falling off a cliff while trying to beat the next level of the game, the two had decided to lay low for a while. They couldn't afford to play the unbeatable game. And now, here they were; all six players ready to finish the game and destroy the curse for good. The new players had not been in the game for very long – at least, not to her knowledge – and already they had caused the game to act significantly different than what it had with both her and Alex. One particular thing that stood out to her was exactly who had shown up in the village that evening. Yes, she had fought the random goons driving motorcycles on many different occasions, but never before had she seen him . In all honesty, there wasn't much reason for her to remember that one man out of the entire group of thugs that had arrived to kill the four new players. After all, he seemed to be just like every other bad guy the game seemed to never run short of. And yet, there still was something different about him; something she could not put her finger on but definitely noticed. He was very intriguing, and she found herself wanting to see him again. The sound of a loud conversation quickly intruded into her thoughts, and the sound could not have met her ears any sooner. The heavy clumping of footsteps against the old wooden stairs lightly shook the large tree house they were in, causing her hammock to swing a bit more. Once the group had stepped up onto the balcony, she spared a glance over her shoulder to make sure her only friend was truly with them. She easily spotted his scruffy, handsome face and the untrimmed black hair of the young man and she smirked. \"It's about time you got here, Seaplane,\" she called out to him. The plethora of voices had stopped as soon as they heard her own, and she could feel the four strangers all staring at her, startled by her sudden reveal. \"Hey, isn't that the girl from the marketplace?\" she heard a faintly familiar voice start uncertainly. The accusation in his tone was quickly evident to her, but it only made her smile as he shouted and jabbed an accusing finger at her. \"She stole from my backpack!\" \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" she said sweetly, feigning ignorance. The group easily saw through her act. \"Hey- that's my boomerang!\" shouted another man. \"Here, take it -\" she tossed the boomerang over her shoulder with no warning, causing Spencer to just barely catch it before it smashed against his chest - \"I was bored with it anyway.\" As she said this, she pushed herself up from the hammock and jumped down. The group instantly took notice of the elegant way she moved, the softness of her steps as her toes gently touched the floor. When she turned to the group her face broke out into a smile, one that was both kind and mischievous. She stalked towards them as quietly as a cat would when stalking its prey, and that's exactly how they felt when pinned under her striking green gaze. \"Everyone,\" Alex announced with a broad smile of his own. He cuffed an arm around her thin shoulders and brought her into a firm side-hug. \"This is the chick I was telling you about!\" He gave her a tight squeeze, chuckling when she passed him a glare at his rough-handling. Giving him a playful roll of her eyes, she met the group with a welcoming smile and an outstretched hand. \"Hello,\" she said in a soft, yet sturdy, voice. \"My name's Emma Adams; player Jessie Jinx. A pleasure to meet you.\" She offered her hand to Spencer, who stared at her small appendage with suspicion. He wasn't completely sure if he should trust her, seeing as how she had stolen his boomerang, however, Alex seemed to trust her. Alex had saved their lives and already he was proving to be a welcomed addition to the group. Spencer decided, then, that if Alex trusted her, then he would, too. Besides, she had returned his boomerang with no fuss or lies. His large hand enveloped hers. \"Spencer Gilpin. I'm, uh, also Dr. Bravestone.\" \"I thought you were him,\" she said and shook his hand, her grip surprisingly firm. She moved on to greet the next two, which happened to be Bethany and Martha. She was quite eager in getting to know the two, her smile honestly excited. \"You don't know how boring it can get when all you have for company is him ,\" she jabbed her thumb at Alex, who feigned at being hurt by the comment. Emma rolled her eyes while the girls giggled. She moved on to the last one of the group. She smiled and stuck out her hand for him just as she had with the others, however, he did not take her up on her friendly gesture quite as easily as the others had. \"I ain't shaking her hand,\" Fridge shook his head while shooting daggers at the woman and crossing his arms firmly and securely. \"She might steal it if I do.\" Emma blinked in surprise at his harsh words, honestly shocked by his hostility. Then, she began to laugh. Her steady laughter grew to the point she had to cover her mouth with one hand while the other wrapped around her stomach as she doubled over. The chuckles were soft and airy and they sounded terribly foreign in the suddenly tense atmosphere. The cotton-laughter were sparks in the dangerously electric air and the group began to feel uncomfortable, almost as though they believed a real explosion would happen if her laughter continued any further. \"I'm sorry, Dr. Mouse - I'm not laughing at you,\" Emma managed to finally say between gasp for air as her laughter began to die down. \"I'm simply not used to people getting mad at me for stealing. It caught me off guard.\" \"Not used to it?\" his brow scrunched and his frown deepened as he exclaimed. \"What do you mean \"not used to it\"? How the hell would people not get mad at that?\" \"Well, usually the townspeople don't catch me.\" She almost seemed proud of this reveal, showing a care-free smirk and raising her head just a bit more. The group wasn't sure how to feel about it and they awkwardly shuffled from foot to foot, trying to make sense of what she had said. Seeing their confused stares, Alex decided to step in. He wrapped an arm around her shoulders once again, this time choosing to ruffle her golden hair in the process, to which he received a playful swat on the chest. \"Emma here is my little thief,\" he stated, looking somewhat proud, just as she had. \"It's one of her weaknesses, so don't get too hurt by it.\" \"A weakness?\" Spencer spoke up, his face scrunched in a similar confused look as the rest of his group. \"Why would stealing be a weakness?\" Alex gave a nonchalant shrug while he began picking small twigs out of her hair. \"We're not sure. We figured it had something to do with her backstory, though. You really need clean out the hammock before you jump in, Jinx.\" She huffed lightly and crossed her arms over her chest, then gave a queer look to the group that caused both Bethany and Martha to giggle lightly. She always hated when Alex turned his\"big brother\" mode on. Although, she knew she couldn't live without it. Trying to ignore the prodding of her hair from Alex. \"Sorry about the boomerang fiasco. It's just that, we don't see very many people who aren't NPC's. Actually, we haven't met anyone other than you guys, and we kinda took advantage of that.\" \"So, you were just pulling a prank?\" Fridge deadpanned. Emma shrugged her shoulders lightly. \"Yeah, I guess that's what it was.\" \"And you knew those goons were coming?\" \"Oh, no!\" both she and Alex exclaimed as Emma quickly shook her head. \"No, we had no idea they would be there. That was just a coincidence. If we had known, we'd have gotten you all out of there a lot sooner.\" Spencer asked, \"but, you knew that Alex would save us when you took off?\" \"Yeah,\" Alex confirmed, flicking a twig he had pulled from Emma's hair with his fingers. \"It was short notice, but we had a plan. Kinda. It worked out well enough, at least. It was pretty rad, though!\" The group all passed their own glances about themselves, not completely sure what to make of what they had just heard. Their lives were never truly in danger, and that was a relief. \"Hey, guys?\" Bethany suddenly spoke up. Her brow was scrunched in uncertainty, however, she also seemed somewhat sure of herself. \"Didn't that guy from the beginning say something about Emma?\" Martha's face brightened with her own realization and she nodded, confirming Bethany's suspicions. \"Yeah, I think so. Wasn't she apart of Dr. Bravestone's group?\" She looked to Emma, who only gave her a clueless look. \"Don't ask me – your guess is better than mine.\" \"You're right,\" Spencer said, nodding to both Bethany and Martha. \"Nigel mentioned her, but I don't think she was in the cutscene. I think her and the group had a falling out before the events of the game took place. Must have had something to do with her weakness. Why don't you remember your backstory?\" Emma, who had been trying to silently fight off Alex's advances in picking out sticks from her tangled hair, turned to messing with his own black locks. \"I never met Nigel. You really need a haircut, Seaplane.\" She had said it so simply that the group almost didn't catch it, but when they did, it hit them as suddenly as a rushing train. They all shouted their own concerns and questions, although the one that was most asked was \"you didn't meet Nigel?\". Alex plucked at a stick that was tangled a bit more than the rest, causing a small spark of pain to blossom across her temple. She yelped out in pain and slapped his hand away, to which he only laughed. She glared, however his laughter was infectious and she felt her own smile tugging at her lips. Trying and failing to hid her growing smirk, she slapped her palm against his chest and lightly shoved him away. \"Rude,\" she huffed. \"Now you have to make me an apology margarita.\" \"I know that's supposed to be a punishment, but I will go do that because I want one, too.\" With that, Alex went around the homemade wooden bar and began setting up to make the alcoholic drink. \"I'm going to give you a haircut later, too!\" Emma called, laughing at the groan of agony from the young man. When she turned back to the group before her, she was surprised to see them all looking at her with wide, expectant eyes and dwindling patients. \"Oh, right. Yeah, I never met Nigel.\" She turned and began walking back towards her hammock, this time brushing away the what twigs or leaves had fallen before jumping back up on it. The group of four followed her with their eyes, still trying to gather exactly why and how she had not met the one thing in all of Jumanji that even half explained what Jumanji even was. Spencer cleared his throat in order to get her attention and he questioned loudly, \"so, why haven't you met Nigel, exactly?\" \"Stranger danger,\" she shrugged nonchalantly. \"I had just been sucked into a video game and dropped into the middle of an unfamiliar jungle. Within the first five minutes of my landing from being dropped from the sky, I was being chased by hippopotamuses and monkeys were throwing rotten fruit at me. I wasn't about to jump into the first vehicle I came across; especially one where a strange man was already driving it. Who knows what could have happened!\" She said it as though it was the most obvious thing in the world. At the time it had seemed logical to the group, but with the way she had put it, they almost felt embarrassed by their choice - even though it was the correct one. \"So, does that mean you don't have the Jewel?\" Martha asked. Emma shook her head. After shuffling around in the hammock for a few seconds, she managed to shimmy a rather large hunting knife out from somewhere – whether it was a holster strapped to her hip or from inside her boot, the group wasn't sure – and began to clean her nails with the tip of the blade. \"So then, there are two Jewels?\" \"I don't have a Jewel either,\" Alex told Martha. He had already mixed the tequila and triple sec with a blender and was now pouring it into six, salt-rimmed glasses. \"You see, besides making margaritas, flying is one of my strengths. Although I did get shot down by a couple of orangutans in fighter jets, so maybe not that great at it. You see, I had put the Jewel in a sack and had tossed it in the back, so when my plane went down and I was reanimated, the Jewel wasn't with me when I dropped.\" \"What does that mean?\" Bethany questioned. Alex brought out a knife, followed by a bright yellow and dull green objects from somewhere behind the bar. He set the two fruits on the table and then pointed the knife at Bethany. \"Lemon or lime?\" he asked. \"Lime me up!\" Fridge said eagerly. Alex smiled and nodded before he began to cut the green citrus fruit. \"It means, Bethany,\" Alex started again while slicing the lime in half, \"if we lose the Jewel, we only have so long to find it before it pops back up in the beginning with Nigel.\" A look of shock passed over the group and they all felt the creeping hand of worry grip around them. \"Does that mean we'll have to start over?\" Bethany urged Alex to continue, hoping he would tell them of some miracle way of regaining the Jewel. He gave a shrug in response and Bethany's face fell. \"I think so,\" he said. \"After all, all of the traps reset at night, along with the villages and the people. It's like the game resets itself or something, and the only part that stays the same is the part that we're in. I can only imagine that the levels would reset too, so if we did have to go back to get the Jewel, then we would have to re-do everything. So I guess we'll just have to hold on to this one, huh?\" He said the last part with a smile as he held up two glasses filled with margaritas, handing one out to Bethany and the other to Fridge. Fridge wasted no time in snatching his glass while Bethany first looked over the beverage uncertainly. Once she had finally taken hers, Alex offered two more to Spencer and Martha. \"Make yourself comfortable, dudes!\" he said, to which the group nodded and lumbered off to find somewhere to sit and mull over the new information about the dreaded game. Alex stuck a slice of lemon into the rim of the remaining glass that wasn't his. Fridge gave the drink one look and grimaced. When Alex handed the glass to Emma, Fridge made a grand show of displaying his distaste for the choice of fruit. \"Why the hell would you put a lemon in a margarita?\" \"I like lemons,\" Emma said simply, taking a sip of the alcoholic beverage. She smiled at the taste of the tequila and lemon that invaded her taste buds and she snuggled further into the hammock. \"Why the hell would anyone like lemons ?\" Fridge argued, trying to antagonize her further. However, she wasn't reacting in the way he had hoped. She simply smiled and moved an arm under her head as a rest. \"Lemons are a beautiful, bright color, while the inside is so sour and dull. And yet, some people still like them. I'm not exactly sure why, though, Dr. Mouse.\" She took another sip and sighed blissfully. \"Stop it with the \"Dr. Mouse\" already, alright?\" Emma hummed softly and smirked. \"I think we're going to be great friends, Mr. Mouse.\" \"My name ain't Mouse! It's Fridge , got it?\" he huffed and took a larger-than-needed gulp of his drink, very nearly downing the entire cup. Emma only laughed softly, her eyes fluttering shut as she stifled a yawn. The darkness of the night had finally overtaken the brightness of the sun, and the activities of the day had gotten to them all as they all began to yawn. All except Fridge, who got Alex to make him another margarita. \"These things are great!\" Spencer and Martha had tried their margaritas, however, they obviously had never had a margarita – or any alcohol, for that matter – and had set the glasses aside as soon as they had spit the liquid back into the cup. Bethany had set hers aside, too, the drink going untouched by her as she explored around the tree house. \"What's up with all the candles?\" she asked out of the blue. \"Alex's got a bug problem,\" Emma said with a laugh. Alex threw a glare at his friend's back. \"It's not a bug problem; it's a mosquito problem.\" Bethany's brow scrunched and he quickly clarified, \"mosquitoes are one of my weaknesses. Which is kind of a bummer when you live alone in an open hut out in the jungle.\" Bethany nodded, then quickly turned away so as to hide her growing smile. \"He's single!\" \"What am I – chopped liver?\" Emma asked with a pout. Alex simple waved a dismissive hand her way and rolled his eyes. \"You're like my sister; I have to live with you.\" Emma was about to retaliate, but quickly cut herself short. It took a moment of thinking, but when she finally realized what he had said, she felt her chest swell. Had Miss Bethany caught the eye of her Little Alex? The thought made Emma smile. She hoped something would become of them – Lord knew Alex needed somebody. A sudden frown tugged at her lips, the swelling in her chest changing to that of a sharp sting. If Alex got with Bethany, would that mean she would lose her only friend? Now that there were more people, would Alex abandon her? Will she be left alone again? She took a large gulp of her margarita, successfully emptying the cup while driving away those unwanted thoughts. However, it only worked for so long. In order for her to get a good buzz, she needed in the very least four drinks, however, Alex was already fishing out the extra blankets to make pallets for the group of four and she didn't want to bother him this late. She'd have to deal with her thoughts. Emma pushed herself up and jumped down from the hammock to helped Alex set up the beds. Then she cleaned the margarita glasses with a bucket of fresh rainwater. Luckily, she was able to at least drink Bethany's untouched glass. She could have had more, but she wasn't exactly up for drinking Spencer and Martha's spit drinks; no matter how much she longed for the airy, carefree feeling of alcohol. Fridge, however, seemed to be getting a bit wobbly in the knees and a good deal happier than what seemed to be his normal just from the two he had. He denied that he was drunk, although Emma had the feeling that if she had left the two tainted glasses of Spencer and Martha out, Fridge wouldn't have had any second thoughts. Fridge, who had been wandering around the tree hut, suddenly called out,\"who's this?\" Emma glanced over to where he was standing and she knew what he was referring to instantly. \"Who's Alan Parrish?\" he asked again as he eyed the tree with the words \"Alan Parrish was here\" carved into the thick branch. \"He's the guy who built this place\" Alex called back to Fridge as he set out a blanket on the ground; a makeshift bed for one of the new four. \"Wait, you mean other people have been stuck here too?\" asked Spencer with a similar bewildered look as Fridge, Bethany, and Martha. \"Well, yeah,\" Emma nodded. \"I mean, this is Alan Parrish's house. We're just living in it.\" With this newfound information about the strange and lethal video game, the group quickly fell silent as they decided to help Alex and Emma make their pallets. No one seemed to want to talk as they mulled over the thought of how many kids had been here before them, or how many had actually managed to get out. With their beds made and the sun finally set, the group was finally able to lay down and get some sleep. However, sleeping seemed to be the last thing on their minds. \"So, Alex, tell me,\" Bethany spoke lowly in case someone was asleep. Even so, her voice still seemed foreign in the cool jungle air. \"How long have you and Emma been in the game?\" Alex breathed out a huff of air. \"Ooh, it's tough to say; time is kinda funny here. A few months at least, right Em?\" The group gasped in shock, all appalled by the thought of being stuck in the game for so long. \"Yeah,\" he said again once everyone had quieted down. \"I just can't seem to make it past the Transportation Shack.\" \"Transportation Shack? What's that?\" questioned Martha. \"It's the next level of the game. The first time my hot air balloon wouldn't even take off, and then there was the whole plane thing I mentioned. And once I got down to my last life, I realized I was screwed. And that I was never going to get out of here by myself. Half the stuff that came at me I had zero way to deal with. You know, you can't kill a black mamba with a margarita.\" \"You're damn right!\" Fridge slurred as he drunkenly puffed out his chest. You need a zoologist for that!\" Alex gave him a tight-lipped smile and a short nod; neither which truly reached his eyes. Emma could clearly see the downcasted look that clouded over him; she could see the hurt within his brown, sorrowful orbs. Alex had been in the game a lot longer than she had, and she knew it was hard for him not to be able to return home. She reached over and placed a small hand over his, giving it a comforting squeeze. His dark eyes flickered to her and she gave him an encouraging smile, one that he thankfully returned. \"Once I found Emma, I thought we had a chance,\" Alex started again, this time his voice holding a tone that she could not exactly place. It was not sad, and yet not entirely happy. He was glad to have her, but she knew he would have preferred his home. His tone was just, thoughtful . \"But none of her strengths can help very much when we have an entire canyon to get across. So, we've just been chilling out here, trying not to get killed.\" \"But we can try again!\" Spencer exclaimed, his excitement showing on his handsome face. \"You and Emma have been here for a long time – you know the game. And between us, we've got a lot of strengths.\" \"Yeah,\" Mumbled Martha, looking up at the suddenly passionate Spencer with a look Emma could not place. \"We're actually pretty good together.\" Emma smiled softly at the two. They seemed cute together. Her childish thoughts were quickly shattered when she saw the panic slowly overtaking Alex. \"Guys,\" she spoke up, her hand squeezing his a little firmer, \"we can't risk it. At least, not now. We have no idea how the game will react to you guys and acting now will only cause more danger. We should wait before we do anything.\" The others looked close to persisting with coming up with some sort of plan, but Bethany stopped them. She also saw the horrified look in Alex's eyes and the way Emma held his hand so tenderly, and she knew that whatever Alex had been through must have been so much worse than what they had. After Bethany had taken Alex and Emma's side in the argument, they all decided that they were too tired to argue any further and they let it go. The group of four shuffled and rolled on their blankets while Emma and Alex lounged in their hammocks, trying to get some sleep. The group was out as fast as a light once they had gotten comfortable; all except Emma. The young woman laid back in her hammock, gazing up at the twinkling stars, wandering and contemplating a multitude of things as they passed through her mind. What would Jumanji do now that all six players were playing? Would the traps get harder? The animals more dangerous? Would Alex be able to handle coping with the certainly new and dangerous environment? Would they be able to survive? All of this and more swirled around her head like a raging storm. One thing in particular that kept jumping back into her mind, though, was the Jewel. She wondered as to what it looked like and how big it was. She had never gotten the chance to see it since she had not received it from Nigel, and she had met Alex sometime after he lost it. She wondered what made it so special to the game and why those goons wanted it so badly. What good could there be in a simple stone? Even she thought that to be silly. She knew the corrupt needs of man's greed, so it really wasn't that surprising to her that so many people were after it. She was simply looking for a reason to be this interested in it. It was a mere stone that the jungle wanted returned; nothing more, nothing less. Then why was she still thinking about it? Why was her chest thumping so loudly in her chest? Why was it calling to her? It wasn't calling her, she told herself. It was merely interesting. However, this did little to settle the feeling within her gut; the tingling in her hands. Before she realized what she was doing, she was out of her hammock. In even less time, she was standing over the sleeping Fridge, eyes glued to the discarded backpack next to him. 'I just want to see it,' she told herself. As quietly as though she were a ghost of a breeze in the late autumn air, she fell to her knees next to the large bag and opened the flap. Her hands grazed against the many objects, mindful not to let them clang against each other. When her hand uncovered what must have been a shirt, her eyes widened. The Jewel was big. No, it was massive . It must have been the size of her head! And it glowed . It glowed such a brilliant shade of peridot that she had to keep herself from gaping at the magnificent sight. Pins and needles were in the palms of her hands now; the same feeling she got when she wished to steal something of actual value – not the simple bread from a passing cart or fine jewelry - something truly costly and dangerous. Something exhilarating . In that moment, she pulled herself away from the glowing object. She knew instantly that there was something wrong with the Jewel; something evil. She attempted to push herself up and go back to bed, however her body made no such movement. She stared unblinkingly at the closed sack, knowing very well what was just under that single flap of fabric. 'I'll just hold it for a few moments,' her mind reasoned with her. 'Just a few, harmless little moments.' It worked. Her hands were moving away the fabric of the sack and within mere seconds she was holding the Jewel. A strange and sudden surge rushed through her and she nearly dropped the Jewel in shock. Instead, however, her small hands gasped the Jewel even tighter as she held it against her stomach as rushing electricity filled her, pulsated through her, empowered her. As soon as it had hit her, the feeling was gone. She was left silently gasping for the air that had been stolen from her, grasping the Jewel so tightly that her knuckles very well could have split from the tension. She blinked up at the stars, those same exact stars that she had been looking at ever since she had arrived at Jumanji, and noticed that they were different. Very different. She didn't remember there being this many stars before. Her ears perked up at the plethora of sound that suddenly hit them. When had the jungle become t his lively? She inhaled deeply; she could smell the freshly baking bread from the village, ready to be sold at the market in the morning, along with the smell of smoking wood, wet plants, and soil. Why was everything so... clear now? There was an odd shuffling, almost scratching sound off to her left. Her head jerked to the object as quick as a whip and her glowing eyes locked on to a tarantula. The creature was no bigger than her hand and it marched across the wood almost lazily, without a care in the world. With unblinking eyes, she stared at the eight-legged arachnid with a fiery intensity, watching as every one of its legs moved its fat, little body along; how its little hairs whisked in the breeze. It suddenly went rigged under her sturdy, unmoving gaze. Its entire body tensed up and it looked as though it were preparing to bolt, but instead, it turned to look at her. She stared deeply into its dark, oil-drop eyes, her face devoid of any emotion, her mind bare of thought. A bright, electric spark of green flashed across the spider's eyes, and it was suddenly crawling towards her. Without thinking, she lowered a hand to the wooden floor palm-side up. The spider crawled into her hand without hesitation, and she brought the creature up to her face so she could inspect it. It stared back at her blankly, non-moving. Her eyes flickered down, then back up to the spiders. Then, it was moving up her arm. A wicked smile broke across her face; she was controlling the spider! She twisted her arm around and back, moving it this way and that way, all the while telling the spider where to go. She almost laughed as she did so; it was as easy as moving a finger! She stopped the spider back in her palm and she brushed a finger gently across its back to gauge its reaction. It did nothing more than stare blankly back at her. It was as though the spider wasn't there anymore; just a hallowed out toy she could manipulate. That was, until, its eyes flashed green once more. However, this wasn't like the previous bright flash; this green was darker in color, and she somehow knew that it wasn't her doing it. Now, as she stared into the eyes of the spider, it wasn't a simple empty case – something else was looking back at her. A cold, biting shiver raced down her spine as she stared into the cold eyes of a stranger, unable to look away as fear began to slowly pull at her chest. She found that she couldn't move, and she began to panic. She couldn't even scream for help. With another dark green glint, the paralyzing presence was gone and she could suddenly breathe again. Her mind was racing and all of the power she had felt was gone. Her heart thundered in her ears as she breathed heavily, trying to calm herself down before she woke anyone up. A prickling on her palm caught her attention and she realized that she was still holding the spider. She almost didn't want to look back in its eyes in fear that the terrifying presence would be there, but when she finally willed herself to look at the spider, she knew nothing was there. At least, not anymore. In fact, as she stared into the eyes of the arachnid, its eyes now bright black and shiny, she realized that even she didn't have control over it anymore. It began to try and crawl back up her arm she quickly set it back to the ground, watching it as it began marching its way away from her, it previous lazy movements back like nothing had happened. She then turned her gaze to the stone that sat on her lap, a million and one questions shooting through her mind. She could breathe normally now, and as the seconds ticked by she could finally think more clearly, too. She picked up the Jewel and held it up, inspecting every inch of it. Satisfied that nothing interesting would happen again, she set it back down. Her eyes moved to gaze out into the dense forest foliage, looking for what, she did not know. All she knew was that the stone had done something to her - had given her something powerful – and someone out there was even more powerful than her. And they knew about her. Things just got a lot more interesting. A/N: Did you like it? Did you hate it? Have any comments? I'd love to hear them! Please follow, favorite, and review to show me and this story some love :)[Chapter 3] A/N: Please read this important note before continuing: To start off, I am one of those people who does not like to read - nor write - quick romances. I am all for fire flirting and cute crushes, but anything else (like love) just irritates me. It's completely unrealistic to the real world, and when a sudden love appears it just takes me out of the story. Although I will admit that some authors are able to pull this off (which has been happening in more and more popular books and movies as of lately), I for one have grown quite tired of them. I'm a woman who needs a slow-burning love that starts out as a mere spark; a flame that is both beautifully exhilarating and terribly painful to behold as it grows, yet still has you coming back for the increasing burn. And you can't bare to stop coming back for more, and you keep prodding the glowing embers until you can no longer bare the fiery intensity raging within your chest. And that's when true love begins. Although I am sure my store will never be as great such as the one I have described for you above, I still don't want my story to be a sudden, \"Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo, *poof*, romance !\" kind of thing. So, with that being said, I will be changing the future of the story. It's nothing too dramatic; I'll just be expanding the time Spencer and the group were in Jumanji so that I have more wiggle room to work with. I will add in some new, never before seen scenes, expand on further character growth, and I will attempt at writing and recreating the burning romance I love so much. Whew, glad I got that little rant off my chest, haha! :Lulu: I would also like to give a shout out! (My first one ever!) First, thank you all so much for the comments; they motivate me to keep going! I just wanted to say a few quick things to Lulu because she actually brought up a lot of good points in her comment that I would like to discuss real fast. For most of your questions, they will be answered later on in the story, but I'll answer as much as I can. Being a thief is not a crippling weakness for Emma. She can usually help herself around normal things, however the more interesting the object is, the harder it is to keep from stealing it. The Jewel – being a creation of the game – knew this and called to her, taking advantage of her weakness. And, yes, her thievery is one of the reasons her character had a falling out with Bravestone's group. As for her personality, Emma cares very greatly for Alex (reasons that will be later answered) and would never put him or anyone in harms way (she's actually very tender-hearted). One of her personal weaknesses that she brought back from the real world is the need to be strong and brave for everyone else, however, this sometimes blind-sights her and gets her and others into trouble because she fails to see the true magnitude of the situation. She always tries to give off the allusion that she is stronger and braver than what she really is and will do everything herself if it meant that no one else was harmed/bothered. Despite this, she is also pretty positive and doesn't realize how big a problem is until it's too late, then she feels responsible for the trouble. Hope I answered all of your questions! (At least the ones I can at this time). Thank you for the wonderful feedback! Emma Adams sighed wearily and rubbed the back of her hand across her brow, brushing away the beads of sweat that had formed from the heat of the early morning Jumanji sunlight. The sun hadn't yet climbed its way fully over the horizon, but it was already enough to give Emma a piercing headache and she wished she had gotten more sleep. Despite the drumming of her head and the drooping of her eyes, she managed to keep them trained on the rolling hills below her, searching for any abnormal signs of movement against the tangled green foliage. Emma was in the process of scouting out enemy troops. This was not a new thing to her, though. In fact, both her and Alex had mapped out many of the patrolling groups surrounding their area fairly well. They could guess which route a group would take, how many would be apart of the unit, and the time they would be patrolling an area. However, that had only ever been mere speculations. The game was smart; it knew better than to keep the same routine every day. Although the days were very similar, certain things changed often enough that Emma and Alex would regularly keep tabs on troops or how active certain areas of the jungle were. Overall, nothing that would cause alarm for them had happened. That was, until, Dr. Bravestone and his group had arrived. Ever since they had spent their first night in Emma and Alex's treehouse, the spawn of bad guys had increased at an alarming rate. The units had tripled in number and carried a greater number and the scheduling of the patrols were greatly clustered, sometimes to the point the patrols were merely an hour behind one another. They were also packing much larger weapons than what Alex and Emma speculated was normal; and everything was utterly random. Emma was always so sure of what would come up from the other side of a hill or marched around a corner. Now she felt as she had the first day she played the game; completely unsure of herself and filled with anxiety. Because so much had changed, Emma and Alex thought it best to lay low for a while; at least until the bad guy population decreased a bit more. After a few close calls when the group had decided to be stubborn instead of safe, they had finally agreed to stay put in the treehouse. No one wanted to take any unnecessary risk; they needed all the lives they could get if they were hoping to beat Jumanji . At first, Emma was intrigued by the thought of something like this happening. Because she had mapped out the game so well, things had quickly become boring. Now she wished things would go back to the way they were. She felt so selfish and idiotic for ever wishing the game would do something different. It was no longer just her and Alex now; she had an entire group to look out for. Maybe if it was still merely her and Alex in the game then she would feel different and things might be more fun, but that was no longer the case and now all she cared about was getting everyone through the day. She would have been lying if she said the first couple of days had not been fun and entertaining with all of the new and dangerous aspects of the game, however, after many members of the group had come too close to losing their life, she realized the severity of everything and that she needed to be more careful. Emma's eyes darted to one of the larger hills after seeing a flash of black, however, it was only a bird. She let out an inaudible sigh and ran a hand over her face and up into her hair, knocking her topee off as she did so. She rested her arm against her knee and squeezed her eyes closed as her other hand pressed against her temple. She wished she had gotten more sleep. She had not been able to sleep in days. Ever since that incident with the Jewel, she had hardly even closed her eyes. She hadn't told anyone what had happened. She didn't even tell Alex. She didn't want to tell him unless she absolutely had to. Of course, she wondered what it would be like to tell everyone; maybe she could even use her new-found powers to defeat Jumanji and send everyone home quickly and safely. However, she knew this could not happen. She didn't even know what this was, or how to properly use it – if she even could. So far she could only manipulate bugs, and only for a short length of time before her powers died out for the night. She wasn't even sure if she should call this a power. This is why she had not yet told anyone. How could she when she didn't even know what it was? She couldn't lie to herself. The real reason she had not told Alex is that she was afraid. Afraid of how he would react - afraid of what he would do. Even if by some miracle he didn't immediately abandon her, she knew him; he would start constantly worrying about her and trying to keep her out of any possible danger. He would be overprotective. Their relationship had always been fifty-fifty. They had each other's backs - they looked out for each other equally and it had worked perfectly this far. If that changed and Alex spent all of his time looking out for her and he ended up losing his life because of it, she would never be able to forgive herself. She couldn't risk him for something that she didn't understand – something she could handle herself – so she kept her mouth shut. Against the horizon, she saw movement. A few moments later, the troop she had been looking out for were marching down the grassy hill, plowing down a pathway in their wake. Making sure she was well hidden behind the brush, Emma dared to peak out further onto the edge of the rocky outcrop she was crouched on. She counted sixteen men this time around; four less than the day before. Their numbers were decreasing and their patrols were becoming less frequent. She watched the marching unit as they passed right below her, completely unbeknownst that one of their enemies was literally right on top of them. When the troop came to a fork in the path around a quarter of a mile from where Emma sat hidden, they turned right. She concluded, then, that they should be the last group to pass by that area until late that evening. The first group that had passed by had come from the small village a mile to the left of the fork. That meant that this part of the jungle would be clear for at least a couple of hours. Being absolutely sure that the group wasn't going to double back – something they didn't do often but had done before – she stood from her crouched position and stretched her arms above her head and twisted her body left and right, popping her stiff back in the process. She wiped her brow once more before placing her hat back on top her head and gazed across the rolling valley, looking for anything suspicious or worrying. After a few moments of scoping out the area and making sure that everything was clear, she headed back to the treehouse. As she stealthily made her way through the forest, careful to make as little sound as possible in case a passing patrol or predator was prowling the area, Emma couldn't help but notice everything . It appeared to be a side effect from the so-called \"powers\" of the Jewel. Every small animal that scampered about the forest floor or tiny bug that crawled on a branch or buzzed around her head had become painfully obvious to her. The loud chirping and buzzing of the creatures echoed in her ears and the fresh smell of wet leaves and soil invaded her nose in a way she had never experienced before. It took all of her self-control not to try and use her powers on something. Her right hand twitched lightly at the very though, but she restrained herself. She had learned her lesson about the consequences of over-using her powers the first night she had gotten them. Once she had laid down and had the opportunity to actually process what had happened that fateful night just three weeks before, the true magnitude hit her like a brick to her chest. When it was happening, it hadn't registered to her just how insanely dangerous touching the stone was. She had no idea what had gotten in her to make her think that any contact with that Jewel whatsoever would be alright. Now she was stricken with a curse – or, something . Had something else really been looking back at her? Or was that just a mix of the spider's gaze and her tired mind? She couldn't be sure, and not knowing absolutely annoyed her to no end. All throughout that night she was either tossing and turning about on her hammock or waking from a restless hour-long nap, her mind a mix of confusing emotions and thoughts that refused to let her rest. When she had awoken for the eighth time that night and saw the first beams of the horizon peaking out from behind the treeline, she knew she would not be getting anymore sleep that morning. Emma never was one to stay in one place for long. She wasn't a fan of doing nothing nor did she like being alone, but she didn't want to wake up Alex. So, deciding to do some light exercising until the rest of the group woke up, she swung herself out of her hammock. This plan was quickly discarded, though, when she realized the person sitting on the edge of the treehouse. She could tell by their small stature that it was Fridge. He was seated silently on the edge of the balcony as he watched the slowly rising sun, his legs swinging off the side as he silently took in the jungle dawn. Emma saw this as her chance to speak with him without the constant watchful eyes of the group; to attempt to mend their distrustful relationship. It had been three weeks since their meeting and their relationship was still a little rocky. She didn't want her stupid excuse for a joke to be the reason they couldn't be friends, so she decided to apologize to him. However, as soon as she had sat down next to him he had pointed out her apparently obvious lack of sleep in a way that only Fridge could. She went to retort back in the same snapping way he had, however, the words he used to cut her off turned her very core to ice. \"What's up with your eye?\" he had asked. Thinking he was referring to crust left over from her attempt at sleep, she quickly shot up a hand to her left eye, rubbing at it with the palm of her hand. \"No, not that eye – the right one,\" he said, trying to peer around her arm to get a better look at her. \"It's all foggy-looking.\" Her heart very well could have dropped to her feet at this, and she wasted no time in jumping up from her spot and rushing for the stairs of the treehouse and towards the first-floor room. That area was mostly used for when there was a storm and they couldn't sleep outside, so it didn't have much furniture besides what had been left behind by Alan Parrish – the man who had built the treehouse. The walls were spotted with strange paintings and old maps while the few shelves carried strange nick-knacks and artifacts – all of which either she, Alex, or Alan Parrish had found during their travels of Jumanji . On one of the walls hung a mirror. The frame was made of beautifully carved elephant tusk encrusted with rubies and gold, and she had fallen in love with the thing the very moment she had laid her eyes on it. It was quite a task smuggling that out of the marketplace, and she was eager to eventually tell the new members of the group the story. Now she wasn't sure if she should be grateful for the mirror or not. She stared wide-eyed into the reflective glass, looking at herself in horror. Her left eye stared back at her; the same, emerald green colored orb she had grown up with. Her right eye, however, was just as Fridge had said – foggy . Underneath the grayish-white film that had settled over it, she could scarcely see the familiar green of her eye. However, it was faint beneath the fog. Her eye looked like a swirling storm of misting water over a dark forest. That wasn't an exaggeration; the fog was literally swirling like a hurricane. As the smoke whirled in a tight circle, it began slowly dissipating until it had finally dispersed and disappeared. Her eye was back to normal; the same, emerald green as the other. In a state of shock at what she had just witnessed, she slowly and awkwardly made her way back up to the balcony; a million and one questions jumping around her mind. She knew what had happened had something to do with the Jewel, but that was all she knew. When Fridge asked her what was wrong, she forced herself to flash him a smile. \"It was nothing,\" she said. \"It does that when I don't get enough sleep.\" He didn't seem to fall for her lame excuse, however, the others had begun to wake and he chose to leave it at that. Ever since that incident, she hadn't even looked at the Jewel, let alone try and use her powers again. Although, that did not quiet the urge within her to do so. \"It's about time you got here,\" she heard as she climbed the familiar wooden stairs to the balcony, the snarky tone snapping her out of her thoughts. Fridge was lounging in her hammock, looking just as bored as he had the day before and the day before that. Emma felt bad for him and the others; they didn't want to sit around the treehouse, hoping for something exciting to happen – they wanted to go home . Alex and Emma wanted to go home as well. Sadly, they had grown used to sitting and waiting. \"Did you have fun stealing ?\" She suddenly felt less sorry. Ignoring Fridge and his biting comment, she instead made her way to Alex, who eagerly awaited her report. \"Anything different?\" he asked. \"A unit of twenty left the West Village and headed North while a unit of sixteen headed further West. They were an hour apart and both carried light-weight weapons.\" \"That makes five patrols, right?\" Alex asked, to which Emma nodded. \"That means the West part of the jungle should be clear for the rest of the night.\" \"Yeah,\" said Emma, \"up until late tomorrow morning or early noon. Anything new in the East?\" \"The routs were the same. There were sixteen men in each group and their weapons were the same as yesterday.\" \"What does that mean?\" Martha spoke up, the rest of the group baring the same eager looks as she. \"Can we leave the treehouse yet?\" Spencer asked, his eyes darting from Emma to Alex. The group of four had now eagerly grouped around Alex and Emma, desperately awaiting the good news that they could leave the treehouse and actually do something besides sit around. Alex quickly held up a hand to the anxious group. \"Now wait a minute guys,\" he said as he shook his head. \"It's too late to do anything tonight and we're not sure what it will be like tomorrow.\" His words were met with a chorus of disappointed moans as Martha, Bethany, Spencer, and Fridge slumped and pouted. Emma eyed the sunken four sadly. She didn't like being cooped up in the treehouse any more than them, however, she didn't have much room to complain. While they were stuck betting on snail races every day, she was out watching over either the Western or Northern side of the jungle. At least she got the chance to see something new. Then, Emma perked up as she suddenly got a spectacular thought. \"Wait, Alex,\" she said quickly as her lips began to form a beaming grin. \"The West half is clear for the night, right?\" \"Yeah,\" he said, his brow raised as he tried to guess at what she was suggesting. \"Well, doesn't that mean the West Village is, too?\" Her smile grew even more at the thought. Alex knew what she was insinuating as instantly as her sweet words were out and his own lips quirked into a smirk. \"I guess it is. Hey guys,\" he turned to the confused group, who were all nervously shifting their expectant gaze from Emma to Alex, then back again. \"Who want's to go to a party?\" And that's how the group found themselves stumbling through the dark jungle trees and bushes, trying not to lose sight of Emma and Alex as they lead the way to wherever – or, whatever - the West Village was. They weren't sure for how long they had been following the eager pair, but they were all beginning to get agitated with their constant prodding and desperate urging along. They both were practically galloping through the dark with excitement as they occasionally threw a \"hurry up!\" over their shoulders. It wasn't until they had arrived at the shore of a small creek when they heard cheerful sounds on the wind. They followed the creek upstream towards the loud mingle of voices and music and a few minutes later there was light to accompany the joyful sounds. After climbing up a small hill, the group of six finally found themselves on the edge of the West Village. The Village was small and the homes were built into a large circle around the town square. Currently inside the large, open space were the people. Some were dancing and singing or playing an instrument while others were talking on the sidelines; not yet drunk enough to have their go on the dance floor. Emma spared a glance at the others and was happy to see their eyes widen and their stunned smiles form. Alex noticed too, this giving him all the courage he needed to step in front of the group and welcome them with a dramatic wave of his hand and a bow. \"Welcome, my dear lads and ladies, to your official welcoming party!\" he announced broadly with a stiff, announcer voice. He straightened up and, still with his stoic butler persona, began giving the group a tour of the place with a simple pointing of his finger. \"Over there you will see our special live band performing before the dance floor. And over here we have some of our lovely staff ready to fill your cups to the brim as you so will need-\" Emma stepped up and elbowed him in the side. \"Alright, dial it back there, Seaplane,\" she joked as he and the group let out a laugh. Although Spencer, Martha, Bethany, and Fridge's all seemed airy and disbelieving. \"It's been so long since I've seen a human being!\" Bethany breathed out. Spencer nodded, but his brow quickly scrunched as he realized what she had said. \"Wait, but we're all human-\" \"You guys don't count,\" she quickly interrupted him. \"After spending three weeks with you guys, you all have become animals.\" \"What is that supposed to mean?\" Fridge suddenly jumped into the conversation with a beaming, hopeful smile and a loud, \"it means you all stink and I need a drink. Now let's go!\" He began charging into the village square, but Emma quickly snatched his arm and pulled him back. \"Wait, guys, you can't go yet!\" she whispered loudly, trying not to draw any unwanted attention to themselves. Fridge stomped his foot and whined. \"Aw man, why not?\" \"Because we have some things to go over first,\" said Alex, sending a quick warning glare to whoever looked like they were going to try and make a run for it. When he decided that everyone was going to stay put the moment he let his guard down, he spoke in a loud and firm tone, \"alright, we still don't know a hundred percent whether or not this place is clear of patrol. If you notice anything weird, gather up as many of the others as you can without drawing attention to yourself and meet back here. \"If something happens and we get split up, find the creek and follow it downstream until you get to a small pond. The pond isn't too far from the treehouse, but I'd rather you stay there than get lost trying to find it. If anyone goes missing then either me or Emma will check the pool every morning and evening.\" \"We have also carefully hidden weapons throughout the villages, so unless you've somehow gotten yourself far enough to where we haven't mapped it, you should be good,\" added Emma with a pleasant smile. \"But, how will we know where the weapons are?\" Martha asked. Emma waved a hand dismissively. \"We didn't really hide them all that well. The villagers don't even notice them.\" \"Are there any other questions?\" questioned Alex. After waiting for a few moments with no one speaking, his lips formed a lop-sided smirk. \"Well alright then! Let's go have a good time! And by the way, welcome to Jumanji!\" A/N: Hey guys! Been a while, huh? Well, I wanted to apologize about that. I've been dealing with a lot lately. My school work has piled up so much, my boyfriend broke up with me and has been making me feel like a monster because of it, and I've been stalked by a forty-something-year-old man who stole my dad's phone and thinks it's okay to constantly text me pretending to be my dad (like he thinks I'm stupid and don't know how my own dad text). It's all just really stupid and stressful and I'm sorry I haven't updated like I should. I'll try to do better! I was supposed to have two chapters up this time, but chapter 4 is still under construction and I really wanted to get this out. So chapter 4 should be done by tomorrow. I know that these past chapters may be a bit boring, but I really want to dive into the actual characters more than what the movie had, so I just needed to get some of the background blugh stuff out. And don't worry, our two special characters will finally be meeting up very soon ;)[Chapter 4] A/N: Hey guys! Here's chapter 4! Things are really getting crazy in this one ;) playlist: Lost Girls by Lindsey Stirling. As soon as she had stepped out from the shelter of the old hut's shadow, Emma had almost immediately been swept into the mass of dancing bodies by some man who was too drunk to realize that she was a stranger. Thankfully, the entire village seemed to be that way, so no one noticed the six newcomers wander into their village. Alex and Emma already knew they wouldn't have to worry about being discovered, though. They had been to this specific village many times before. There were three other villages that they knew of that had some little celebration at night, but the West Village was their favorite. These events were just one way out of a hundred where both Emma and Alex could forget about where they were. Or, at least, pretend to forget. Emma didn't like to admit it, but before Alex had found her, she was in a bad place. At first all she bothered herself with was trying to get back home. She very nearly drove herself into the ground trying to defeat the game. After being stolen from your home and family – your very world - and dropped into the dangerous jungle of an actual video game, Emma couldn't imagine anyone acting any different than what she had. Unfortunately, Alex had already had his run-in with death twice before their meeting. He had first lost a life from being bit by a black mamba, then by crashing a plane while trying to cross the canyon. He refused to risk himself again, for one last mistake would truly be the end of him. Alex was the only thing that could have gotten her back home, and he had already given up on beating the game. With this daunting realization stuck in her mind, Emma soon fell into a depression. She gave in to her stealing impulse to the point she didn't even know what she was stealing. Once she discovered the nighttime celebrations, she would be found at the villages downing whatever alcoholic beverage she could get her hands on and acting like everything was merely one big joke. During the day, she would be found asleep wherever she had passed out the night before. She just didn't care anymore; she had lost hope. Alex helped her to get through this. He continued to let her stay in the treehouse with him even when she was openly bitter and angry towards him. He stayed by her side every single night and made sure she didn't get into trouble, no matter how drunk she had gotten or what stupid thing she did. And he was there when she was finally able to let reality sink in and she needed a shoulder to cry on. After that specific night, she decided to finally pull herself together; and he was there to help her along the way. And this is how Alex saved her life, as well as how she saved his. Because she hadn't known him before, Emma didn't take notice of the almost overgrown look he had. She didn't realize the dirty and un-kept clothes that he wore. She didn't know that the scruffy beard and shaggy hair wasn't him- she just assumed that was his character. It took her losing herself for him to regain his life. Her needing someone's support and comfort was his wake up call. When Emma was brought into his life, Alex knew he had to pull himself together in order to save her. He knew he had to help her because she was going through exactly what he was going through. He was hit just as hard by this entire situation as she had been - the only difference was that he had to fix himself while she had him to lean on. She hadn't known it at the time, but he needed someone's help just as much as she did. And with this downfall and rise, they helped save each other. And it is this reason that Emma Adams would give her everything to protect Alex. Emma laughed heartily as she was spun and dipped by whoever happened to be her partner for the song, passed around from villager to villager as the songs changed. She had even gotten to dance with some children before their parents decided it was too late for them to be out. She laughed and danced and conversed with the villagers, finally allowing herself to have fun again. Because of the new circumstances, she hadn't been able to let loose in for what seemed like forever. When Emma had finished a couple of dances with the merry villagers, she found Martha and Bethany still standing on the sidelines. Martha was staring at the crowd with such wide eyes that Emma would have thought them to fall out if she widened them any further. Her arms were wrapped around her torso and, no matter how much Bethany dogged her, she kept slowly receding away from the bustling party. That's when Emma decided to jump in. She took the red-haired girl by her hands and pulled her closer to the edge of the town square, but not quite into the actual crowd. Something told her that might be a little too overwhelming for the poor girl. Emma began swaying to the upbeat, cheerful music that flooded through the warm air, moving Martha's hands along with her. Martha simply stared from Emma to the villagers, silently waiting for the crowd to attack her. \"Relax,\" Emma shouted over the music. Martha's eyes flashed to her's, only to be met with an encouraging smile. \"Don't worry about what they think. Just let loose and have fun!\" Hesitantly, Martha began to move her hips side-to-side in a tiny, almost jerking way. \"Yeah, there you go!\" Bethany egged her on. Martha's blue eyes bounced back and forth from Emma to Bethany like a beach ball. Then, she moved her hips a little more, carefully testing the waters. It was almost like the simple act would be met with chastising, however, both Emma and Bethany only cheered her on. Martha let out a small, uncertain laugh as her short and un-timed movements slowly became swaying. Before they knew it, Martha was dancing – albeit still a bit stiffly so. Soon after that, the three girls were swaying and jumping and wiggling to the music, not caring if they were in tune with the musicians or other dancers– or would have even been considered to be dancing at all. That didn't matter. The only thing on their minds was how much fun they could finally have. Eventually, though, Bethany wandered off to find Alex and Martha awkwardly took off with Spencer, all of them leaving Emma alone in a sea of moving bodies. She didn't mind, though. She was just happy everyone was having a good time. Well, everyone she could see, that is. It was around about the fourth time of seeing Spencer and Martha dance like the awkward teens they really were and hearing Bethany and Alex laugh obnoxiously to some joke unheard by her that Emma realized she hadn't seen Fridge since their departure. By then, the group had already been at the celebration for a good long while, and Emma found it strange that she hadn't in the very least seen Fridge moving about somewhere. Although, she would admit that she hadn't really been looking for him. That changed in that very instant. With the other four friends off somewhere and the men of the village approaching that point of drunkenness where they were less fun to be around, Emma decided to find and pester her short friend. Or, enemy. Or, acquaintance. She wasn't exactly sure what they were. That mattered little to her as she began wading through the ocean of people, trying not to get stepped on or thrown up on in the process. A few men had grabbed her and spun her around a few times before she could manage to politely decline between her laughs and continue on. It didn't take her long to find Fridge; he was exactly where she expected him to be. At the edge of the town square, there was a small shack that was what Emma assumed to be a bar. Inside, Fridge was seated up at the very front, right upon a stool stationed at the bar, laughing loudly at something only he found funny. Emma smirked at the image of the tiny man's large and unsteady movements, and when she slid up next to him she couldn't stop herself from laughing. \"Are you already drunk, Mouse?\" she asked. \"What?\" Fridge asked a bit louder than what he probably meant to, followed by his own laughter. \" No ! I've only had a couple drinks! I'm fine !\" \"Ma'am,\" said an older male from behind the bar. The man's eyes bore dark bags and his round chin was patchy, and he looked to be the only one in the entire village who wasn't having a good time. He spoke in a board, monotonous drone, \"this man has had many drinks and has refused to pay for any one of them.\" \"Just put it on my tab!\" Fridge laughed. The man gave him the same, tedious stair. \"I don't know what that is.\" Emma sighed and rolled her eyes, deciding she better defuse the situation before things got out of hand. The building they were in was a small one and there were only three seats stationed at the main bar, and Fridge was seated on the far left one. The only other open seat was on the far right. In the middle was seated a large, round man who was hunched over the table and grumbling quietly to himself; not paying either Fridge nor the actual celebration any mind. Emma tapped on his shoulder lightly, the corners of her lips tugging upward into a friendly smile. \"Excuse me, sir,\" she asked sweetly, \"but could you move over a seat?\" The man turned and gave a disdainful snarl at the young woman, showing off half a mouthful of yellowed and browning teeth that gave Emma a shiver down her spine. The stranger stared at her, his eyes scorching into Emma's very soul when suddenly, without warning, the stranger keeled over and slipped right off the stool, landing with a hard 'thud' on the dusty wood floor. Emma jumped back and gave a startled yelp, trying not to get her toes crushed by the stranger's weight as he fell. Then she quickly scanned the surrounding area, worried someone would stand and accuse her of doing something to the poor drunk, but no one did. She debated on whether or not she should check on the man, fully believing he was dead or dying when the stranger began snoring louder than anyone Emma had ever heard. Clearing her throat awkwardly and straightening her clothes with her hands, she turned to Fridge with raised brows. \" Okay , time to go!\" Fridge was quick to protest, shaking his head wildly and waving his hands about like she was going to attack him. Emma stepped closer to him – mindful of the sleeping man on the ground – and gently wrapped her hands around Fridge's right arm. \"Come on and dance with me!\" she pleaded, pulling on his sleeves lightly. \"You've been over here all night. Let's actually go and have some fun!\" Fridge rolled his eyes dramatically and sighed while making a talking motion with his hand, but he stood up anyways – albeit a bit wobbly. He didn't bother to wait for her as he marched his way towards the double doors of the shack, mumbling the entire way. Emma chuckled and shook her head at the sight. Leaving a handful of coins and crumpled dollars from out of one of her pockets on the bar, she called her thanks to the tired old barkeep and quickly jogged after Fridge, who had already made it outside. When she caught up to him, he snapped, \"don't be so fast .\" Emma only laughed, which seemed to catch him off guard. The band began playing the next song, which happened to be Emma's favorite. It was an upbeat tune that she had learned the moves to, and she wasted no time in dragging Fridge into the very front of the lineup. Fridge's dark eyes darted to hers in a slight panic. \"I don't know how to dance to this!\" he snapped at her. Emma chuckled and took his hand in hers and gave it a comforting squeeze. \"It's easy; I'll show you!\" She moved her hands to her waist. The short man hesitated only for a moment before following her action. Perfectly in sync with the rest of the townspeople, Emma stepped forward, spun in a circle, then stepped back in line. They repeated this for a second time, and Fridge did his best to copy what he had seen. He flashed Emma a nervous glance, but she only flashed her pearly white teeth happily. The group kicked out their left leg, then their right, then the left again and spun on their right foot. Fridge stumbled some and was a little behind, but Emma only giggled and yelled over the music, \"not bad!\" Then she hooked her right arm with his and skipped in a circle. Fridge nearly fell and this caused him to burst out into laughter, which was quickly followed by Emma's own soft giggles. They placed their hands back on their hips and stepped forward three times, one foot in front of the other, bouncing up onto their toes with each movement, then spun again. They repeated the process again and Fridge hardly tripped at all. \"Yeah, you're getting it!\" Emma laughed. They continued to dance to the music, laughing the entire way like two old friends. They even threw in their own movements into the dance, which only caused a slip up that had everyone laughing along with them. Fridge couldn't help but notice the way Emma moved about on the dance floor. She was like a delicate snowflake in the winter breeze or a blade of grace drifting in the sea. One moment she was laughing and moving along with the people, however, as though someone had flicked a switch somewhere deep within her mind, Emma Adams was instead dancing to the music. Emma inhaled deeply as she allowed her senses to absorb the smell of the jungle and taste the sound of the violin, her mind going foggy with a numbing bliss as she lifted her delicate body up onto the tips of her toes. Her arms left her body and raised above her head and bent lightly at the elbows, every one of her fingers pointed precisely as her jade-green eyes fluttered shut. Her body now was drunk on the heat of the dim, biting fire, her lips kissing the dulcet freedom that enveloped her in an abrupt and unrestricted away. Emma moved her arms out to her sides - her fingertips nearly touching from behind her slim back - then forward and back above her head. Her torso swayed back and forth with her arms as one, perfectly fluid and unique movement. Her elbows gracefully tore through the air in perfect rhyme with her feet as she pointed her right leg and leaped. As soon as her toes had caught her weight, she was spinning in a tight circle with her left leg bent with her foot flexed against her right thigh, only coming down for a split second to propel her spinning form. There was absolutely nothing that could calm her tempestuous gale as she spins to the music. Her arms oscillated above her face as she leaned her head back, a shadow of a smile on her ruby red lips. The flickering of the fire beside her casted licking and flickering shadows that dance eloquently along her fluent body. When Emma stopped spinning, she lunged forward again, her left leg a striking spear in the night. And as she swished both her body and arms forward then back again, far and reaching, her back arched and hands nearly touching the dirt floor beneath her, the moon's light graced her with her very own spotlight. The single, unthoughtful movement seemed to reject every last silent judgment from the world that was offered to her all her life. \"Wow,\" Fridge breathed, blinking his eyes hard. The sound of his voice shattered Emma's peaceful and solitudinous world, causing her to jump back into reality. \"What was that ?\" Emma chuckled nervously and began playing with a strand of her hair as she nibbled on her lip and downcasted her eyes, her cheeks suddenly flaming as hot as the fire as not only Fridge, but seemingly the entire village stared at her in complete awe. Whether it was an instant impulse or he was merely acting out of drunkness, Emma was not sure, but whatever it was, it drove Fridge to reach forward and brush her hands away from her face and instead pull her hair behind her ears himself. \" That,\" he said with complete seriousness, his deep brown eyes staring into her own. \"That right there – I don't know what that was but that was amazing !\" Emma couldn't keep back her surprise as she smiled at the man who had hated her just a mere few hours before. Although it was probably just a result of him drinking one too many drinks, it was still nice. \"Where'd you learn to dance like that? Is it one of your strengths like Martha's dance fighting?\" Fridge continued to pry. \"What?\" asked Emma, once again stolen from her thoughts. \"Dance fighting? I didn't even know that was a thing.\" \"Neither did we – continue.\" She chuckled. \"No, no it's not one of my strengths. I actually took dance lessons back in the real world.\" Emma didn't know how she felt about telling Fridge of her dance lessons. It was a trait brought back from the real world, and it was awkward for her to talk about the real world. Emma's worries that Fridge would pursue his questioning further were eased, though, when Fridge took her by her hand and instead began spinning her again. Both Emma and Fridge continued to dance to the next song, and the song after that. She even attempted to show Fridge and a few other drunk villagers some dance moves. Attempted, being the word. Everyone was having a wonderful time - she was having a wonderful time. That was, until, she felt something; something wrong. The hairs on the back of her neck prickled and her arms became covered in goosebumps. Her entire body went rigid as she felt eyes pinning her to the spot, watching her every move, deducing her very thoughts. The longer the eyes looked at her, the more they burned her, and the more sweaty and uneasy she became. She could fell her veins pumping thickly as her body unknowingly began searching for the source of the danger, tasting the very air around her. She snapped her head to the left. It was sitting on a high branch, hidden deep within the leaves and shadows, but she could see it. Its little bald head was hunched over as it's beady eyes bore into her own in such an evil way that a biting shiver snaked down her spine. It was a vulture, and it was staring directly at Emma. A random old man suddenly took Emma by the hand and spun her around as he skipped and sang an off-pitch tune that didn't match the playing song. Emma couldn't help but laugh as she politely declined, pulling her hands out of his grasp and raising them up in surrender. The man didn't seem to mind too much, and after spinning her one more time he wandered back into the crowd, singing and swaying as he went. She chuckled at the hearty old man, but she could still feel those beady, oil drop eyes boring into the back of her head like heated coals. Her eyes flickered back to the vulture, only to see that it was still watching her. Each second that their eyes were locked her heart seemed to pump louder in her ears. When she thought her chest was going to explode, the bird's eyes suddenly flashed that same, familiar dark green. Then it spread it's large, black wingspan and flapped hard, launching its fat body into the air with a terrifying, ear-splitting screech. Emma's heart dropped into her stomach. She snagged the still dancing Fridge's arm, snatching him out of his own happy world. \"Fridge,\" she said, her eyes never leaving the spot where the bird had disappeared off into the dark night sky. \" What ?\" he groaned, somewhat annoyed by her interruption. However, the look on Emma's face caused his smile to falter. \"W-what? What is it?\" \"Something's wrong,\" she said as she began pushing him further into the pulsating crowd. \"We have to find the others.\" Emma pushed her way urgently through the dense formation of sweaty bodies, keeping Fridge close behind her by a steal-trap grip on his wrist. Her eyes searched the unfamiliar faces of the crowd, desperate to find her four friends. She had no idea what that bird was, but she knew it was nothing good. She caught sight of Alex and Bethany and she made a direct B-line for them. \"Alex,\" she gushed once she reached them. \"Yeah?\" he laughed, turning to meet her. Once he saw the pale look of her face, his heart very well could have stopped. \"What is it?\" \"We have to go now . You, Bethany, and Fridge get back to the meeting spot and I'll find Spencer and Martha.\" \"No, you guys get to the meeting spot and I'll find Spencer and Martha.\" Emma could have strangled Alex then, but Fridge stepped in before she could exhale her comment. \"Look, we have no idea where they're at. They can be literally anywhere. I think we should split up.\" Bethany nodded as she silently tried not to panic. Despite their predicament, it didn't get past Emma the way Bethany held onto Alex's right bicep. \"Yeah, I'll go with Alex!\" Emma looked from Alex to Fridge to Bethany. She wanted them to get to safety, not split up. Seeing that she was outmatched, she sighed and nodded quickly, knowing there was no time to waste with arguing. \"Alright, that's fine. Bethany and Alex go that way and Fridge and I will go this way,\" she pointed the directions, then they were off. Fridge and Emma headed off in their direction, glancing over the heads of the strangers for the bald head of Spencer or the fiery red hair of Martha. \" Ugh ,\" Fridge stomped his foot in desperation. \"Where are they?\" Suddenly there was a loud shout from behind. The pair whipped around and gasped at what they saw. The music had stopped and the only sound that could be heard was light murmuring from the people. A hush had settled over the little village, along with a strange coldness in the air. The crowd had formed a circle, and in the middle of the circle was a troop of large, burly mercenaries, all wielding large weapons and ugly sneers. And in the lead of the group was a tall, broad-shouldered, dark-skinned, mismatched-eyed man that Emma had only seen once before at the bazaar, which now seemed so long ago. She had nearly forgotten the dark, creeping feeling of ice crawling through her blood whenever she last saw him, but she remembered now. A slight movement caught her eye from somewhere behind the evil group and, to her great relief, she saw that Alex and Bethany had found the other two and were edging their way towards the shadows of the hut homes. Emma smiled happily and her heart soared, overwhelmingly glad that they were able to get away. Then she felt a nudge on her arm from Fridge and her smile instantly fell. She had forgotten about Fridge. She needed to get him to safety. She regained her grip on his wrist and began tugging him further into the crowd and towards the forest. He jerked his head towards hers, silently asking what she was doing, but she only gestured with her head in the direction she wanted to go while also bringing a quieting finger to her lips. Getting the hint, he cast the mercenaries - who were now aggressively pushing and grabbing villagers in search of the teens with the Jewel – one last worrisome glance before ducking down with her and following closely behind. The two crept around the people as quietly as they could. Every now and then loud shouting and screams would erupt behind them, which would cause Fridge to squeak in fright and Emma to jump, ready to bolt within a second's notice. Some of the villagers would give them strange, terrified looks, to which Emma would bring a finger up to her lips once more, begging and pleading for their silence. So far, no one had decided to rat them out. Emma and Fridge were now a mere ten feet away from the safety of the trees. They were so close to getting away that Emma was almost thinking about making a run for it. Her dark red lips broke out into a relieved smile as she began to rush forward, dragging Fridge the along the way. That's when she heard another shout from behind her, and she made the split-second choice to look behind her. Towering over the villagers was an ugly man with a beard and shaggy hair on an egg-shaped head, and he was pointing a fat, calloused finger directly at Emma and Fridge. \"There they are, Boss!\" his voice seemed to shatter the world as her heart plummeted to her toes.\"They're getting away!\" \"Run!\" Emma shouted. Still holding onto Fridge, she darted forward and into the trees. She could hear the stampeding feet of the men behind her, which only fueled her to go faster. Fridge, however, stumbled and tripped in the dark, everything spinning uncomfortably as the excessive alcohol in his belly sloshed. She knew he could not keep up this pace with the state he was in for very much longer. Through the dark, she spotted an old abandoned hut. Perfect. They ran along the side of the hut then made a hard right, cutting around the corner of the house sharply. They ran along the building's side, their shadows displayed on the old, delipidated walls like a crude child's drawing, and once they had gotten around the second corner of the house, Emma flung Fridge into the bushes. She jumped into the foliage right after him, pressing his body between the house and hers. \"Emma-\" he started, but she quickly shushed him and pressed her chest harder against his own, trying to morph their bodies into the shadows. The entire jungle had seemed to go utterly soundless as Emma perked her head up, straining her ears to catch even the slightest sound of movement. Her ears, well trained after being trapped in Jumanji for so long, picked up nothing. \"Emma I-\" she pressed the palm of her hand against Fridge's lips firmly, willing him to remain silent as she returned to listening. No sooner had she done it, she heard the sound of approaching footsteps. They sounded... odd, however. It was slow and almost deliberate as they moved through the thick brush and thickets, something she had never known the evil goons to do. Emma might have even missed it if she had not been straining her ears like she was. She only picked up the sound of a single person, and whoever they were, they seemed quite accustomed to the forest. More than she was, that she was almost certain of. Their movements were careful and calculating, and every few seconds they would stop to listen. She prayed that Fridge would keep quiet long enough for this person to get away from their area. A few more excruciating moments passed as the mercenary repeated his process of stalking and listening, and, to Emma's outstanding relief, he seemed to be moving away from them. Her relief was instantly snuffed out when Fridge began fidgeting in his spot. The footsteps stopped. Emma's heart was thundering so loudly that she would have thought the man to hear it himself. Then, he started walking again, this time directly towards the corner Fridge and Emma were cowering behind. His steps were no longer practiced and soft but swift and clumping. Each thump of his steel-toed boots was like a volcanic eruption in the silent world, ready to destroy everything within a second's notice, yet still was painfully droll, like one would stroll down a park; why must the lion rush when the mouse was already cornered? He suddenly came to a stop, merely six feet away from where Emma and Fridge sat stone still. Emma's beating heart was like pulsating storm within her chest cavity and the blood rushed in her ears like a waterfall. Her breathing was heavy and she pressed a fist hard against her lips to try and keep herself from making any noise by mistake. Her head felt light as she waited for something to happen; anything . And then something did happen. Fridge back-handed her arm away from him. Her eyes snapped to his to see what was wrong, only to squint in disgust as Fridge leaned to the side and threw up. Everything stood still at that very moment as Fridge looked up at her in horror at what he had done, knowing full well he had messed up. Emma's mind began racing as she tried to come up with an escape of some sort, but when the footsteps began moving towards them again, any thought at all was thrown out the window. ' Fridge ,' she mouthed, hoping he would see. 'Stay here.' 'What?' he mouthed back. Drawing out every silent word, she droned out, 'stay. Here... And stay safe.' With that, she pushed herself up from her hiding spot and jumped out from around the corner. She came face-to-face with that man; the man she had seen at the bazaar, the man who was currently hunting her and her friends down like wild animals, the man with the single, blind eye. Before anyone had the second to react, Emma spun on her heels and began to run into the dark forest, not caring if she knew where she was going or that the man was right on her heels. All she cared about was that the rest of her group was safe. And that she got away with her head. A/N: How do you think the start of Emma and Van Pelt's relationship is working out for them? Please follow and favorite if you like the story, and a comment to tell me any pointers or notes you may have. I absolutely adore reading your comments![Chapter 5] A/N: Hey guys! Here's chapter five for you! Yay! Oh, and just so that everyone is not confused, I had gotten the name of the hat wrong before. Emma's hat is not a pith helmet, it's a Tilley hat. Sorry everyone for updating so late as well! My internet is crazy and every time I tried to edit this it would kick me off the page and I'd have to start over. Sorry guys! The loud chirping songs of the birds echoed through Emma Adams's head, slowly waking her from a deep sleep. Her head pulsated and throbbed harshly and she moaned in pain; how much had she had to drink last night? Her face screwed into a grimace as sharp pins and needles began to prickle across her body. She was laying on her stomach with her left arm trapped beneath her body while the other laid limply to her side. She dragged her arm out from under her and instantly took notice of the stiffness; how long had she been out? Groaning and wincing at the cracks and pops from her joints, Emma stretched out her arms and legs as far as she could, pressing her face further into the scratchy ropes of her hammock in the process. Her body didn't seem to appreciate her movements and so retaliated with the explosion of her brain. Emma whimpered and rolled over onto her side, wrapping her arms around her knees tightly as her brain pounded against her skull. Her nose instantly scrunched in further pain as a rather sharp stick jabbed her gut. She raised her hip as much as she could while her right arm began blindly trying to brush the branch away as her half-awake mind desperately tried to keep a hold of her sleep. Alex was right - she really needed to clean out the hammock before jumping in. Her hands gripped around the branch – which was a couple inches thicker than what she had first thought – however, it didn't move an inch when she tugged on it. It must have been tangled in the ropes, she thought, and decided she'd deal with it later. She shuffled her body away from the stick and ended up laying on her back. This new position proved to not be the better solution as the harsh morning light instantly hit her eyelids. 'Wait, sunlight?' her groggy mind questioned her own senses. When she had first set up her hammock, she had specifically chosen this spot because of all the shade it provided. Emma was a light sleeper and had always kept a pretty solid schedule and would naturally wake before the sun rose. If not, Alex would be the one to wake her; whether he meant to or not. Very few times had the sun actually been the one to wake her. What time was it? Too tired to care at that moment, she lazily slung an arm over her face, shielding her eyes from the sun. A few moments passed before she moaned out in despair, knowing full well that she would not be getting back to sleep any time soon. Emma was not one to sleep easily. Once she was awake, she was awake. The sharp stick, the piercing headache, the damned sunlight, and the constant chirps of the overly happy birds all taunted her attempt to get some well-needed rest. She was not even fully awake and already she was tired, but this did nothing to keep her mind and body from slowly beginning to wake. With a harsh huff, Emma flung her arm to her side, not caring if the barrier to protect her eyes from the sunlight or save her sleep from the daunting day was gone. She was awake now anyway, so there was no point in trying to sleep any further. Her red lips formed a pout as she sighed dramatically, trying to summon up the strength to push herself out of her hammock and start the day. Suddenly, a thick branch from somewhere up in the canopy of the trees fell, and it landed right on Emma's exposed forehead. \" Ow !\" she yelped, her hands coming up to press against her sore head, adding to the pain of her headache. This day couldn't get any worse for the poor girl. After a few moments of cradling her injured forehead, she ran her hands down her face and sighed loudly once more as she tried to force her eyes open. Her thick lashes fluttered as her eyes tried to adjust to the light. The overhead tree branches swayed lightly in the gentle breeze and the leaves rustled, sounding a lot like laughter to her. 'The trees are mocking me,' her inner thoughts mumbled as she glared at the sky above through the gaps between her fingers. Her brow scrunched and she blinked hard as a sudden realization dawning on her. The trees seemed to be taller than they normally were. Usually, the branches would be dangling mere inches from her face, and now they were many feet away from her. That's when Emma also realized that the breeze was swaying the trees, and yet she was not moving at all. Her fingers flexed and instead of gripping around thin white ropes, she got a handful of damp soil. Emma slowly pushed herself up into a sitting position, looking around her surroundings with wide, astonished eyes, her entire body as tense as stone as she took in the unfamiliar setting. She wasn't laying in her hammock in the safety of Alan Parrish's tree-house surrounded by her friends; she was laying on the ground in the middle of nowhere. Worse, she was laying in the middle of the Jumanji jungle alone. The towering, daunting trees and densely pack foliage crowded around her heavily, suffocating her and the small clearing she had woken up in, the only other thing to accompany her being the fallen tree directly behind her. Her heart began to beat in tune with her pulsing head as her breathing hitched. Everything suddenly seemed to be closing in on her, encasing her, trapping her. \"Alex?\" she whimpered out, her emerald eyes desperately searching the foliage for a familiar face, her mind drudging through her memories in search of what had happened. Images of the night before flicked through her mind, but she only remembered bits and pieces. She and the others were in the West Village. She and Alex had been trying to cheer up Spencer, Martha, Bethany, and Fridge when... they came. She was with someone, she knew. The group had split up, but she wasn't alone. Then she remembered the vomiting. \"Fridge?\" she called for him, hoping the short man was still somewhere close by. After a few moments had passed with no saving call, she dived back into her thoughts once more. What had happened after that? A single, white eye and looming shadow flashed across her mind. That's right; he had come. Fridge was in danger, and she lead that man away from him. She had blindly run into the ruthless jungle of Jumanji all alone with no clue as to where she was headed nor how far she would go. Or, how far she had now gone. \"Anybody?\" her voice cracked and she quickly bit her lip, trying to calm down her breathing as tears began to well up in the corners of her eyes. Emma brought her knees up to her chest and she wrapped her arms around them tightly like a child with their security blanket. The tips of her spine scraped against the rough bark of the fallen tree behind her, but she took no notice of the scratching pain as her rushing blood and growing fear ebbed into her conscious. She hadn't been alone since the beginning of the game, and the very thought of that terrified her. She hated being alone. A small whimper escaped her lips, but it was quickly silenced by the back of her hand as she covered her mouth, embarrassed by her own actions. She should be stronger than this. Emma angrily wiped away her tears with the palm of her hand, instantly attempting to fight back her growing panic and fear as she scowled and chastised herself. This was no time for tears; she had to get a hold of herself. Searching the bowl of blue in the sky, Emma was able to locate the flaming sun through the holes in the thickly packed branches. Luckily, the sun seemed to be slowly making it's way out of the sky as the growing evening approached. She breathed out a sigh of relief at this. At least night was approaching. Emma finally allowed the gentle breeze to calm her as it softly kissed her dirty and scratched face, bringing along with it the rustling laughs of the trees, the smell of fruit, and the chirps of the birds. Emma's brow scrunched and her head cocked to the side, her ears straining for sound. The birds were no longer singing. In fact, the only sound she could hear was the rustling trees, and the fruit smelled bitter and rotten. Her breath suddenly hitched in her throat as a loud, explosive-like sound hit her eardrums; it was not the trees' laughter filling the air, it was actual laughter. And by the gruff, obnoxious yells and shouts and the lingering smell of alcohol that followed, Emma had a bad, knowing feeling that it wasn't her rescue party. The first thing to process in Emma's mind was to escape. Her initial instinct was to run, but that plan was no good. She had no clue as to where the men were, let alone what direction was safest to run in. With her current luck, she would run directly into the enemy's arms. Her next thought was to climb a tree. However, one look at the enormous, swaying, creaking things instantly made her feel sick and dizzy. The voices were getting closer, and it became quickly apparent that there were far more men than what Emma could handle on her own. Her eyes darted around her wildly as the icy claws of panic slowly curled around her and squeezed painfully around her chest. A sudden movement caught her eye and her head jerked to the left. She only saw it for a few moments, but it was enough to cause her heart to jump into her throat; a man – no, three men – were stomping through the jungle, laughing and joking among themselves as one lazily swung at branches with a rather large and sharp-looking machete. Another man appeared from the brush, lazily following after the previous three. Then there was another, and four more on her right. The men were too far away to take any notice of her as of now. However, as the more passing mercenaries she witnessed edged dangerously closer and closer to her little clearing, the more her panic grew. Her breathing was quick and shallow, and she subconsciously began scooting herself away from the increasing danger. Her back pressed up against the scratching surface of something and she nearly jumped out of her skin as she whipped around, fully believing she had bumped into some deranged, maniacal NPC mercenary ready to tear out her throat. To her relief, it was just the fallen tree. An obnoxious explosion of laughter to her right nearly gave Emma a heart attack; they were even closer now, and she knew that any moment longer someone would spot her. Emma's feet began pushing her back again as she quickly scooted herself down the side of the rotting tree trunk. Once she had gotten to the end of the trunk, she would dive onto the opposite side of the tree and hope no one saw her. It wasn't the best plan, but it was a plan nonetheless. As she did this, the corner of her left hip suddenly snagged on a root, causing her to fall hard on her side with a sharp gasp. Emma bit her bottom lip hard and she pressed her palm to her injured side, trying to will the pain away. It hurt, but she had to keep going. She started to crawl towards the end of the tree as fast as she could manage while also paying careful attention to how much noise she was making. When Emma had finally reached the end of the tree, she could have cried out in joy for the surprising amount of coverage. The tree seemed to have been uprooted by the wind some many odd years ago; its roots had been ripped from the ground, creating a mound of mangled and dead tree parts and dried moss-covered dirt clumps while the base was completely surrounded by tall, lush ferns. Emma's dainty hands gripped tightly onto one of the roots as she hauled herself up and off the ground. Unfortunately, the root she had grabbed snapped under her weight and she fell forward hard. Lucky enough for her, she had landed on the upheaval of dirt that had been kicked up by the fallen tree and the only sound she caused was a low ' thump !' Emma nearly cried out to the heavens at her luck as she pushed herself back up. If the men hadn't spotted her first, her capture would surely be caused by her own ruckus. She was about to reach for yet another root to help her up, but she froze. Her right hand, which had been the one to grab the weak root, was now inside the tree. Emma's brow scrunched and she squinted hard, trying to see into the darkness of the dead trunk from around the thick ferns. The dirt inside the tree had crumbled inward, making a shallow dent within the long-rotted tree. Broken and tangled roots were dangling in front of the dent like a gaped, wooden curtain, and the grass around the tree stretched high and was thickly clustered, all elements that aided in hiding the shallow hole. Emma dared to reach her arm into the darkness, testing how deep it really was. Or, if there were any angry critters hidden inside. She watched as her arm was slowly eaten by the dark shadows all the way up to her elbow before she hit a wall of soft dirt. When nothing attacked her, Emma bit her lip and dived into the hollow, curling in on herself as soon as she was fully consumed by the shadows. The crawl space was only just big enough for her entire body to fit. Emma's eyes never left the entrance to her little hovel as she tried to calm her erratic breathing, watching and waiting for the mercenaries to hopefully pass her by and not decide to look into the dead tree's inside. Subconsciously, her fingers delicately toyed with her holstered pistol on her waist. She had never used a gun before in her life and she would rather keep it that way. In fact, she hated guns with a passion. She had actually wanted to leave the damned thing in the tree-house, however, Alex always made sure she had it on her at all times. After all, sharpshooting was one of her strengths. That fact was some sort of small comfort to her and Alex, even though she wasn't sure she could ever actually get herself to pull the trigger. The men were loud, and they stumbled through the forest like the big goons they were. They pushed and stumbled through the foliage and laughed and cursed at each other. More than just a couple times one would shoot at something with their gun, which was always followed by an ear-breaking chorus of laughter. And every time they did so, Emma's heart would sink dramatically closer to her toes and her body would tremble. She could now see the thick, lumbering boots and baggy jeans of the mercenaries stomping past her, some even bustling the trunk as they stepped on and over it. To her relief, none of them had noticed her quivering form silently hiding in the shadows of the deadened tree. That did not keep her from holding her breath and gripping the dirt and root wall as tightly as she possibly could. Just outside of her hidden hole, a man came to a sudden stop, his dark eyes catching sight of something. The towering man wore his too-large muscles like a protective blanket of steal beneath his baggy and dirty clothes. His big, meaty fingers reached up to scratch his round and scraggly head, then slid down to his patchy and graying goatee. The man then leaned down and snatched up what he first thought was a piece of fabric laying in the dirt. Upon closer inspection, he realized that it was a Tilley hat. The Tilley was smeared with dirt and the fabric was ripped and scratched. The large man pulled and turned and twisted the flimsy object within his massive hands as he studied the piece of clothing, even choosing to go as far as to give it a good sniff. It smelt of the jungle and looked too old to be of any further interest to him. He was just about to discard the hat when a sudden voice appeared behind him. \"What do you have, Vaughn?\" the voice asked. \"Just a hat, Boss,\" Vaughn said simply with a lazy roll of his shoulders. His words were slow and lumbering, just as his movements were indolent and tired. Russel Van Pelt peered at the Tilley hat with a dark gaze. Without a word, he took the hat from his henchman and began to study it. His large, calloused hands turned and moved the dirty fabric around gently, his deep brown eye as well as his milky white one searching every inch of the tanned surface. The hat was shredded and ripped and smeared with dirt and on the inside of the front rim, there was blood. The blood had easily bled through the framework of the Tilley and stained a merlot-colored splotch onto the fuzzy cloth, about the size of a coin. Van Pelt ran the pad of his thumb harshly against discolored spot, then held his fingers up to the ever darkening sky, catching the dying beams of the sun within his fingers. A tiny, nearly unseen smear of red was left smudged against his flesh, the rest of the blood having already dried on the hat. The hat could not have been left behind for long; maybe even within the past few minutes, Van Pelt concluded. The Tilley's owner was still in the area. He then brought the hat up to his face and inhaled, taking in the scent that was oh so familiar - one that he had nearly forgotten but heavily missed. The scent that infiltrated Van Pelt's senses and made his head swim was an odd mix of wet dirt, moss, and peaches; it was an old aroma he thought he would never have the chance to smell again. Although, as much as he wanted it to be exactly as he had remembered it to be, it was still not that smell. At least, not completely. The smell he knew so well was now also mixed with the scent of lemons. \"Boss?\" Vaughn's deep, rumbling voice brought Van Pelt back to the present. \"What now?\" Van Pelt clutched the brim of the Tilley tightly within his fingers as he thought, his thumbs subconsciously running little circles in the smooth fabric. Then, he nodded to Vaughn and said, \"keep moving. We need to get back to the camp.\" He turned his gaze up to the darkening sky, his mismatched eyes shining in such a brilliant way in the dimming light. \"Night is nearly upon us.\" Vaughn nodded robotically before doing as he was commanded. Emma held her breath as she stared at the steel-toed boots positioned so close to her, toes pointed directly at her. Any sound at all and she would be caught for sure. She was not entirely sure why the man hesitated for as long as he did; maybe he was listening for her, waiting for her to mess up and give herself away. Maybe he was simply enjoying the sunset. That thought was somewhat ridiculous, but not entirely impossible. And then, he walked away. Emma stayed hidden within the hollow until the sun was well below the horizon. She waited patiently until it was so dark that she could no longer see her hands in front of her face. She did not come out until the moon was high up in the obsidian bowl of the world and lit up the clearing with its dim, haunting light. She gingerly crawled out into the open from inside the dead tree, her eyes gliding across the clearing for any sign of an enemy – be it man or animal. The only sound she heard were the soft and elegant songs of the nightingales high in the treetops and crickets in the grass. Emma was grateful for their songs, for birds and crickets were the first to signal danger, and if they were in the area then it must be safe. Emma stood from her spot and stretched her crammed limbs, trying to return the feeling to her hands and feet, always looking over her shoulder. She groaned as her back popped and her extremities tingled, her ears still listening in caution to her surroundings. Then, she turned to the stars. The stars were a very odd yet beautiful thing in Jumanji . Unlike the sky back in the real world, the moon and stars above her now never changed shape, size, nor color. They were exactly the same as the very first day she landed in Jumanji , the only noticeable change being the rising and setting sun and moon. The sky above was a large, endless pit of sparkling jewels and glittering dust splattered upon a blank canvas. Most were white, however, some shone red, others twinkled green, and few blinked blue. Emma and Alex had taken notice of the spectacularly colored stars from rather early on in the game. It had taken them a while, but they fully believed they had figured the meaning behind the colors. The black, glistening world above them was, in actuality, a map. Alex had already begun making a map of the discovered parts of Jumanji by the time Emma had met him. Once they had realized the odd patterns in the sky, it was easy to map out the stars since they never changed. They marked down where every oddly colored light that was seen, and when compared to the map of Jumanji , they noticed key patterns. The twinkling green lights had all lined up directly over villages and towns and other notable places the two had discovered, while the blinking blue ones matched up with the sparse \"safe-spots\" they had found – one of those being Alan Parrish's treehouse. They were still unsure of what the red, shining dots meant, however. They had never been able to reach a location marked by a red dot. Still, the information they had been able to gather was enough for them to know what they were looking at; a pin-pointed map of Jumanji, marking the land as the group moved across the board. Although the stars were a fantastic way to find her way back to the treehouse, Emma was still a little skeptical with how well her mapping skills were. Neither she nor Alex had actually ever used the stars to find home; they never had a need of it before. 'Well, there's always a first for everything,' she told herself grimly as she searched through the branches for the familiar colors. There was one star that was just a little larger than the rest; just a bit brighter blue than the others. That star, she knew, would lead her straight home. The only problem was finding it. Once Emma was sure she had picked out the beautiful, gleaming stone from within the sea of game-generated specks, she was rushing in its direction, the face of the moon and the songs of the nightingales and crickets being the only thing to accompany her in her journey home. Following the star proved to be quite the difficult task; much more so than what Emma had first suspected and hoped. After only getting in a few good feet through the treeline did Emma really have to pay attention to where she was going. Every turn she took seemed to be riddled with grabbing thorns and winding vines and snagging roots, all of which she either skillfully dodge or tripped over. Many times Emma had gotten turned around trying to get around a clump of particularly thick briers and thorns and ferns and lost her sense of direction. So, she would have to either backtrack or keep pushing forward until she found another break in the canopy that showed her the blinking beaker marking her way. Emma had once again gotten stuck at a wall of thick, webbing vines and foliage and she huffed and groaned scornfully at the plants. Her pearly white teeth anxiously nibbled on her bottom lip as she repeatedly ran her hand through her hair; this was taking much longer than what she hoped it would. She should have at least reached some sort of break in the jungle by now! As Emma ran her hands through her hair, glaring scornfully at the poor, undeserving plants, she was suddenly and very painfully aware of the missing weight upon her head. When had she lost her hat? Things had been moving so vastly and suddenly that she had not taken notice of when she had lost the object, yet now that it was gone and she knew it, she felt a full weight heave in her chest. She loved that hat; she honestly did, and now it was gone. Emma didn't see these game-made bodies as mere, usable mannequins. She saw them as a form of art; a look into a different way of life, even. A look into a different world completely. It always mesmerized her, the thought of a game becoming advanced enough to create an entire world that real people could inhabit. She was by no means a scientifically or computer-qualified individual, but it still intrigued her. And despite all of the mishaps and general danger of the world, it was still beautiful. Because of this, she had felt a sort of attachment to her character – an admiration, even – which is why losing the hat seemed so utterly wrong to Emma. Emma's hands patted her hair in vain as her eyes began desperately searching the forest floor for the object, knowing fully well that, if it was not here, she would have to go back to find it. The hat was not by her feet, yet it was far closer to her than she would have thought. Her body went completely rigid as the little hairs along her body stood on end, her entire being suddenly begging her mind for the okay to bolt. Every last muscle in her body tensed to the point it caused her joints to ache, but the only feeling she felt was the intense fight-or-flight response The feeling had so quickly overtaken her that the voice she heard next completely paralyzed her feet to the forest floor, making her nothing more than a sitting duck waiting for the jaguar to attack. \"Hello, Jessie Jinx,\" the voice said, the hissed words snapping at Emma's paralysis like a snake flicking is forked tongue against the frozen mouse, tasting its radiating fear, listening to its quivering heart. The only thing Emma could manage to move was her head, which snapped around as fast as a fired bullet. It was there, with a wall of vines at her back and trees to her sides, that Emma found herself completely and utterly cornered by a mercenary. The man that had so sneakily caught her was standing directly behind her, his large body hidden under the shadows of the looming trees, which all seemed to wake and quiver as they laughed at Emma's predicament. The stranger took a step forward, allowing his steel-toed boot, half of his pant leg, and his blind eye to illuminate in the moonlight. \"Only,\" the man added dangerously, flashing her a perilous, lop-sided sneer that Emma could only faintly see,\"you're not really Jessie Jinx, are you?\" \"N-no,\" Emma squeaked, her feet quaking in her boots as she stared at the brooding silhouette of the man before her. Emma quickly swallowed the lump in her throat, embarrassment growing beneath the fear of her own cowardice. Although her feet were jello to her and she feared she would fall, she forced herself to turn around and face the mercenary head on, one trembling footstep at a time. As she turned, she managed to raise her chin up high, attempting to look defiant and un-fearful. She hoped the darkness would hide her true feelings. \"No. But how do you know that?\" she had meant to say it in an accusing tone, maybe even a demanding one, and she hoped that it sounded as such and not like the frightened little girl she heard. There was a low, rumbling chuckle that made Emma's heart quake as the man took another step forward, and then another, finally allowing the moon above to fully shower his face in its brilliance. The man was strikingly handsome, to Emma's surprise. He was nothing like the other mercenaries she had seen through her journey in Jumaji. His skin was beautifully darkened by the growing years of continuous kisses from the sun, which so contradicted his surroundings that he almost seemed too perfect to be placed in such a dark and mangled jungle. His face was strongly sculpted and was as intimidating as it was handsome, the only imperfection being the scruffy beginnings of a beard that reached across his strong chin. From beneath his pristine white shirt and tanned leather trench coat, Emma could faintly see just how powerful the man was, and for once she knew that she could not take on a single NPC by herself. The man's hair was as black as the night sky above – darker than the tree's shadows, even – and it sat on top his head tousled and disheveled from the touch of the jungle's creations instead of a hairbrush. His eyes- those mismatched eyes – they contrasted against the surrounding world so greatly that Emma nearly gasped when she had first caught sight of them. His right eye was a deep brown, nearly black from the shadowed frame of his thick eyebrows. His left eye, however, was as white as the sun is bright. She had first thought it to be blind, however, from the great intense look he now gave her and the odd hint of illuminating green that radiated from the white eye, she wasn't all too sure anymore. Emma could now put a face to who had been watching her through the spider's eyes that fateful night so many weeks ago. His next words only confirmed her growing suspicion. \"I know more about this place than you or your friends ever will.\" He said it with a sneer on his handsome face, looking both threatening yet somehow uninterested at the same time, like he already knew just how this would all pan out; like it had happened a hundred times over. \"Is that so?\" she asked, carefully allowing her eyes to roam the place for an escape. Since she now knew she could not fight this man alone, making a break for it would be her only chance, even though she absolutely abhorred the thought of running from a single, weaponless man. \"So who does that make you, then? You must be someone powerful to know so much.\" \"I am Van Pelt.\" \"Just Van Pelt?\" \"That is what you will call me.\" The authoritative tone he took on nearly caused Emma to scoff. It seemed as though every man in this game was programmed to have some sense of authority, so much so that Emma found it rather humorous now. The man, Van Pelt, either had not noticed her scoff or decided to ignore it, because he continued to speak. \"Now, which one are you?\" The question seemed more directed towards himself than anything, and it surprised Emma. So this man really did know that they weren't NPCs? Did he know how many there were? How much did he know about them? How much did he know about Emma? The look Van Pelt then gave her made Emma feel somewhat more confident; like she had a little more control over the situation as his eyes roamed over her, trying to see through the body for who she really was. He knew she was not who she seemed to be, and yet he really didn't seem to know much else about her. Emma nearly smirked. \"You can call me Em,\" she said. She wasn't all too sure why she had said it; no one had ever called her \"Em\" before. Van Pelt's scrunched brow mirrored her own inner confusion as his head cocked ever so slightly to the right. \" Just Em?\" he questioned, a look of curiosity playing across his handsome features. This time Emma did smirk; she even went as far as to flash the mercenary a sly nod of the head. \"That is what you will call me, Just Van Pelt.\" Van Pelt stared at the young woman, his darkened gaze seeming to pierce her very soul within a split second change of his previously avid gaze, and she began to worry that maybe she had taken her egotistical actions a tad too far. Just as her confidence began to dwindle before her, the man chuckled that deep, rich sound that seemed to match him so very well; daunting and clinical. \"It doesn't matter either way – I don't need your name.\" This sent a shiver down Emma's spine. Despite the cold feeling that had been violently sent her way, she swallowed thickly and responded with, \"no, you don't, because I'm not staying around long enough to get friendly.\" The man smirked again, the lop-sided look emanating absolute danger. \"You're staying, but we won't be getting friendly.\" And, with only a few steps more, Van Pelt was suddenly directly in front of her, his skin so close to her own that it nearly burned her flesh as her hairs prickled. Every instinct in her body screamed for her to run, and yet she could not move a muscle to do so. The towering man rounded on her like a stalking cat with its toy, ready to pounce and tear her to shreds, all with that daunting smirk displayed on his lips. His eyes met hers, and Emma thought he might laugh at her because it would have been obvious to any passerby just how terrified she now was. Instead of laughter though, she got something else entirely; he reached up a large, calloused hand and took a thick cluster of her hair within his fingers, twisting the yellow strands as his incompatible eyes stared back into her own. \"I need you for something else,\" he said, his voice now a low rumbling in her ears that buzzed her head much like a large gulp of good alcohol, \"something else entirely .\" He twirled the strands around his fingers, feeling the soft yet dirty pieces moving like fine silk against the palm of his hand, being oh so careful not to snag a tangle. Then, he began pulling her hair. Not hard enough for it to hurt, but enough to move her head closer to his, up to the point she could feel his hot breath playing against her exposed neck. She desperately hoped he did not sense the snaking shiver that slithered up her spine and entangled her chest, enabling her to breathe. Van Pelt hesitated for a moment, his lips slightly agape as they brushed the shell of her ear like a wisping ghost. Then, he spoke in a tone as rich as his laugh. \"I need that stone.\" \"You can't have it,\" Emma murmured inaudibly, but he heard her. He heard every word as clearly as a predator could hear the beating heart of its prey. \"I won't give it to you.\" \"I know you won't; you don't have it.\" Emma bit her lip, her toes silently fidgeting in place. \"I won't take you to it either.\" \"I don't need you to take me to it.\" Emma's fingers began to tangle then undo themselves. \"So, you'll let me go, then?\" \"I won't let you go, because then I'll follow you to you're hideout, and you're too smart to fall for that.\" Emma's sparkling, emerald green eyes peered up into his own incongruous ones, and she found that it was rather easy to be entranced within his dark gaze. \"Then what do you need me for?\" \"Easy,\" he said it as though it was the most simple thing in the world, and once he had said it, it was the most obvious thing. \"You're my bargaining chip.\" Emma suddenly broke from her frightened haze and she glared at him with a surge of great ferocity and might. \"My friends are smart, too,\" she growled at the man with new-found courage, her green eyes now set ablaze. \"They won't fall for any of your tricks.\" \"I don't need them to,\" he retorted simply again, giving her a small, indifferent shrug. Then, his eyes flashed that same dark green Emma knew she had seen before. \"And yet they're too foolish to get you back on their own.\" \"They'll find a way,\" she snapped, raising on the tips of her toes in order to get some sort of advantage over him. Although, it did not have quite the same effect she had hoped for; she had only managed to come nose-to-nose with the handsome mercenary, and she had gotten this close only because he was looking down at her as well. This did not discourage her though, and she hissed in the same brutality as before, \"they'll find a way to give the stone back to the jaguar, and if that means leaving me behind to do it, then they will.\" \"Now, that's not the truth, is it? We both know it's not,\" Van Pelt stated, instantly catching Emma in the trap that was her obvious lie. Emma bit her lip hard, her brain scouring itself for some sort of response; something that would defuse the situation, something to get her away from this man, but she could think of nothing at all. The tightening of his fingers that still entrapped her hair reminded Emma that she was still caught by his steel-tight grip, and she knew she had to think of something fast. Without having any sort of idea of what to do, she did the very first thing she could think of, which was to play along with his little game. She reached out and put her hands on the taller man's shoulders, willing her quickening shy gaze to remain on nothing but his own eyes as her chest quivered and her trembling fingers daintily danced across the fabric of his thick jacket. \"So, what are you going to do to me then, Mr. Van Pelt?\" she whispered, her feet edging ever so slightly to the right, pivoting towards a possible escape. \"Lock me up in an iron cage? Throw me in a bottomless pit? Tie me to a luxurious tree?\" Every question slithered off her tongue and into his ear, and every second she inched her feet further and further away, the movement seemingly going undetected by him. Her eyes dared to flicker to her right, then immediately back to his own, but it was enough for her to get a good look at an escape route. All she had to do was move him – just give him one good, unsuspected push – and she was home free. \"No,\" he murmured back, his fingers finally allowing her hair to drop back into place against her rosy cheeks, his hands instead choosing to set firmly against her hips. The feeling was of immediate fire as his hot flesh seethed her skin, even through the barrier of her shirt and jacket. It was not an unpleasant feeling, Emma would admit, however sudden and odd a sensation it might have been. A strange sense of harsh fluttering sprouted from his hands and mushroomed into the hollow cavity of her chest, giving her a sudden light-headed sensation she had never felt before. It was a very short-lasting feeling, however, because in the next moment she found herself facing the thick, nature-made wall once more as her arms were trapped behind her, her wrist entangled within a finely-tied string of inch-thick rope. \"You're coming back to camp with me,\" the mercenary said as he finished tying the rope, giving it one last harsh tug for good measure. Emma gasped as the flesh of her hands and wrist pinched and twisted. Without thinking, she whipped herself around as fast as a flash of lightning and landed a well-aimed boot to the man's side. Van Pelt grunted in instant pain and doubled over. Unfortunately, he did not let go of the ropes like Emma had hoped he would and instead held his side with only one hand. Emma reared her leg back again, fully intending to deliver a hard knee to his pretty face when the hand that had previously been holding his side suddenly shot out in front of him, catching the blow of her knee head-on and stopping her in her tracks. Emma glared venomously and let out a ferocious growl, jerking and twisting her body to try and get away from her kidnapper. Her fight was in all in vain, though, and within moments it became painfully obvious to the both of them that Van Pelt far exceeded Emma in both size and strength; those, unfortunately, being the determining factors of close combat. Emma did not have the strength of muscle or size, but she did have stealth on her side. Which, that only really helped when the enemy didn't know she was there to begin with. Van Pelt's smirk was gone, and instead his face held a glare far more sinister than what Emma's ever could be, and she was known to cast some dangerous glares. His hair was disheveled and strands dangled in his face, but he did not seem to care as his hands squeezed Emma's knee and wrist tightly. However, his glare had not lasted long. A soft, painful moan escaped from Emma's panting lips as her wide gaze stared wildly at the man before her, completely sure that he would kill her for what she had done. Van Pelt's own eyes widened slightly at the look of the poor girl. She seemed like a caged, feral animal; scared and hurt and cornered. And just like that, his glare was gone as well as the grip on her leg. Emma couldn't keep her sudden curiosity hidden as her brow furrowed at the man. Wasn't he the bad guy? Why did he suddenly look... she wasn't sure how he looked, but it was definitely not a face she would expect a villain to make. Before she could question it further, she was swung around – much gentler than the first time he had done so – and she felt a rough hand push against her back. \"Move it,\" Van Pelt hissed, the tone suddenly very detached. With her hands tied excruciatingly tight behind her back, one strong hand holding the ropes while the other pushing her forward, Emma was hit with the realization that she, Emma Adams, after being trapped in Jumanji for so many months, had finally been caught by the enemy.

I miss writing for this movie! Glad I got back into the swing after hating Fanfic for so long. Still to this day though I love RP because everyone can play off of each other.] The sun had just started to rise above New York City and had already taken the many skyscrapers and buildings into an ever growing sparkle. It was sunny, too sunny for her liking and would only mean one thing; breathing. Every single day Maureen Epps had begged whatever God was in the sky to just take her life already, be done with it. Her entire crew of the Arctic Warrior had been ripped from her grasp and out of her life. For someone who had never knew a father figure in her life she had surely found it in her Captain. Murphy, a kind soul that would never be forgotten no matter how much time had passed by. Seasons would come and go but the thoughts would always be there, always be of him. She had grown up in New York with an older sister who was the basic princess of the Epps family. Her mother was vain, selfish and a business woman who always wanted Maureen to be perfect. Like her sister anyway, Elizabeth. She was spoiled by their mother and always had the best money could offer and then some. The younger daughter of the family however was a rough and tumble tomboy through and through. Someone that Jennifer Epps could never pin down in terms of having a perfect and well brought up life. Maureen was a free spirit and never wanted to take no for an answer, she craved knowledge and wanted things to be done right. Never mind her father being the handyman, she was. If a sink needed fixing, the brunette was there. If the lawn needed to be mowed, then damn was she ever there. Her motto in life was to live it to the fullest and earn her keep. To never take hand outs was the key, it would always be the key. By the time her family had successfully put up a facade of being happy, her father had lost his job. The family drowned in an endless sea of depression and he resorted to alcohol. Wasn't that always how it was? The father would become a dead-beat and forget everything he had accomplished in his life. He would forget his family, his wife and his two loving daughters. He'd forget everything and eventually lose his mind. Now she too would understand what it was like to completely lose your shit, and then some. By the time Elizabeth had been hitched and had two kids, Maureen was already out working in the harbor to bring in the crates of seafood and fish on her tugboat. It was decent pay, but her mother wasn't happy with her and was never satisfied. She would never be satisfied, ever. No matter how much Maureen tried it would never be enough, Elizabeth would have to be the perfect daughter because it sure as hell wouldn't be her. There was a man who used to come out from the local pubs and sit out on the docks when her work hour ended. He'd just sit there for what seemed like a few hours as if lost in a complete haze. He had that look to him that told the story of a broken man without any real direction in life. Maybe he was happy once? Maybe he was smarter than he let on, but he had no will to use any of it. After a few weeks of finally getting to know him, she started to realize that there was someone out there with just about as many problems as she had. Maybe the dark haired girl wasn't alone. Maybe there was still hope. From there, Maureen had helped him ween off of the bottle and eventually they spilled their hearts out to each other and made a pact; help each other. No matter what the cost, they'd have their own tugboat, he'd be a Captain again and they would set off to find a crew. What came of those promises however was more than they bargained for. Murphy had been the Captain's name and he was the closest thing to a father that she could have ever known. Her family started to forget about her and her mother just stopped talking all together. It was all right though, there was a crew and there was a light at the end of the dark tunnel they had all been traveling through. A corridor of endless crap in their lives that had now been cleared. Devoid of any lonely misery so they could all share it. Dodge, Munder, Greer and Santos were the names of the crew. The Arctic Warrior was what they eventually named the tug and had taken on some of the dirtiest and most difficult salvaging jobs ever. But it paid and paid well, which would ultimately give them the reputation they needed. The best in the business, that's what they were. A team and the glue that would hold them all together. But as so many fairy tales do...this one had a tragic ending. Now it was back to the daily grind, her share of the company had given her a small profit but it didn't remove the weight from her shoulders. The guilt, the pain and the horror that they had all gone through. It'd never go away. Then again what was the point of wishing that it wouldn't? She had turned up washed out in the middle of the ocean and picked up by a soon to be boarded cruise ship. One thing that the disoriented young woman hadn't planned; that he'd be back. Jack Ferriman. The way his cold blue eyes stared back at her from the entrance plank was almost indescribable. Her cries had been too harsh even for her ears and all at once...nothing. Black. Everything had been black and the sedative that the paramedics had given her had finally worked. Eventually her talks of ghosts and soul takers had landed her right in a small psych ward and back to the drawing board. How the hell could Maureen possibly explain to them what had happened? They couldn't even fathom just what happened out there. Her therapists had thought she was crazy at first, prescribed her all sorts of medication to help the pain. But it just numbed it...and after a while, she felt nothing anymore. After a while she started to lie in order to get herself out and the medication would get less and less until finally they'd release her. She stood at the sliding glass door with a warm cup of coffee in her hands, decaf of course. Caffeine was probably the last thing she needed at this point in her life. Probably never again to be honest. The phone rang slightly and jolted her from her thoughts. Epps frowned at the realization that it had been the phone and not just her imagination. Quietly she set the mug down on the table and picked up the phone. \"Hello?\" her voice feigned a facade of normalcy even if she felt like screaming at the top of her lungs. Go figure, fatigue still was kicking in since it had been early in the morning. \"Hello, is this a Miss Maureen Epps?\" the voice on the other line had spoken in broken English. He had an accent that couldn't really be described. Perhaps a mix of both Swedish and Italian? It didn't make much sense really. Her brow arched at his words and almost wanted to scoff. \"You're calling me, aren't you?\" she shot back with slightly tired sarcasm. \"I'll take that as a yes.\" the man exhaled. \"So?\" her hand tapped onto the table and tried to keep herself from hanging up. Did this guy have no respect or something? Seriously, the girl had hoped that the newspapers would eventually leave her the fuck alone by now. But there was always one right? \"You are in danger.\" the voice said on the other end. This nearly made her eyes wide as saucers but Maureen just glared at the blank wall in front of her. \"And how am I in danger?\" she did a good job at masking the shake in her voice or the fear in her tone. In fact? They should give her a medal for this stuff. And like clockwork the line went dead. Well, that was extremely not cool. Her green eyes peered back at the wall and finally her hand hung up the phone with an irritated sigh. Danger? Was that the best they could do? Stupid pranks, always a prank or so. Always something stupid to make her seem even more insane than they thought she was. But there it was, a tapping at her door. Then it came into two solid knocks with someone's bony knuckles. She had just about enough of this shit already. \"Hold on!\" her voice upped its pitch a bit from still being groggy and now pissed off. Finally gathering her thoughts, Epps grabbed onto the door handle and pulled it open. What she saw however didn't exactly make any tender moments in the situation right about now. \"Hello, Maureen.\" Jack Ferriman purred nearly with a grin that could give the Cheshire cat a run for his money. \"Shit.\" the woman gasped and instantly slammed the door shut with her hands. She held it there with all her might in an attempt to keep him out. It was no use, he wasn't human and by the time the lock was flipped he had her instantly against a wall. \"Not happy to see old friends are we?\" Ferriman's demeanor had shifted in less than ten seconds flat to show his immense anger as his nostrils flared. His icy pale hand had her in a death grip around her throat. The more she tried to get him off the tighter his hand got. His lips turned into a sneer and he back kicked the door closed so there would be no disturbances. With his telepathic powers the door immediately locked by both the knob and the chain. That was pretty easy, too easy actually. Maureen clawed at his hand with all her might as her short nails left dull and bloody scratches on his wrist. He hissed in pain angrily and finally dropped her. Epps fell to the ground with a dull thump and held her throat hesitantly. She coughed while still rubbing her throat and tried to speak but failed at words. He got down at eye level with her into a squat and tipped her chin to look at him. \"You didn't think you'd get away so easy, did you? I mean, come on, Epps. No one escapes me and if I recall right...you're a sinner.\" his lips nearly upturned into a smirk and he slid his hand away from her chin to lightly slap her playfully. \"Get. The. Fuck. Away. From. Me.\" the tomboy glared at him and slid herself against the wall. Her knees were up just in case she had to kick him and she had grabbed onto a small paperweight from the middle table. \"Are you fucking serious right now?\" Ferriman nearly laughed at her. \"You blew up the ship, Epps. What happens when the ship goes boom?\" he was toying with her and it was pissing her off tenfold. Jack stood and brushed off his dull green button up as if disgusted by any dirt on it. Such a prim and proper asshole. Her eyes just glared daggers at him. \"Let me put it into words you'll understand, baby.\" he mocked her and loved every second of it. Hell, when was there not a point to degrade women? Especially how Francesca had it coming to her. But this one was different, she wasn't stupid and she had outsmarted him. That counted for something and management was already trying to chew his ass out for it. \"You blew me up too. You know what that means?\" like he'd even give her a moment to guess. He loved to try to scare her even if she was just ready to clobber him in the skull with the paper weight. \"You killed me, you sinned.\" his anger started to flair again and he advanced on her once he was able to stand. \"You cost me all my souls which was pretty much the fuck up of the year to Management. The balance doesn't take kindly to the tipping of its scales and let's just say you owe me.\" he held out his hand to her. Some of her curls fell into her eyes but she couldn't help the chuckle that rolled off of the tip of her tongue. \"Go to Hell.\" in retort to his offered hand. \"Been there, done that. You're coming along for the ride.\" new ship, new horrors... revenge was sweet.[Chapter 2] AUTHOR HAS A NOTE DERP: [It took a while, was throwing it around in my brain for a bit. So a quick heads up, the city is kind of like a major ground for a lot of serial killers, wannabes. When you get more into the story there's a pretty big reveal of the city and it's not all as it seems. Think of Saw meets The Collection/Collector. We'll get there!] Her mind had traveled back to what Murphy had said on their payday. She couldn't fix everything. Keyword being fix, fix the ships, fix situations, fix the mess she had created with a goddamn soul taker and his merry band of ghosts. Jack snapped his fingers with an irritated sneer on his lips, he was trying to get her attention. \"Wake up, Maureen!\" the man growled in both annoyance and impatience. He didn't have time for this, Management was ready to beat him senseless if he didn't get this little...incident over and done with. Epps snapped out of her dream state and glared up at his looming form. It was almost like he was a child. He didn't get his way? He threw a tantrum. Only difference with a child was they didn't kill people. \"Yes I can.\" she spoke absent minded with a far off look in her eyes. He furrowed his eyebrows and couldn't help but roll his eyes. Did she finally go off the deep end? Had he driven this poor human insane? \"Can what?\" Ferriman almost didn't want to ask because not only was it wasting time but he really couldn't care less. \"Fix shit.\" the woman smiled at him sweetly. He was puzzled but that was all it took for her to reel back a fist and slammed it up into the males jaw. In an instant Maureen was up on her feet and holding onto that paperweight as if it were her only hope out of this mess. Jack stepped back with his lightning fast reflexes a little too late. He held his jaw in pain and attempted to straighten it out. The girl had a damn good right hook, no wonder she had survived that long not only on his ship but with a group of guys on the cruel seas. That job in its own was no place for a woman. What did he know? He was just a sexist asshole who up until now had no respect for women. \"It's Epps.\" she narrowed her green gaze on him and still clutched onto the paperweight. Like it'd do anything to him? A threat, a useless threat. Sure there could be immense pain given to the soul taker but there was no such thing as death for him. That royally sucked. \"You're going to pay for that...\" his voice nearly dropped to complete monotone, as if he had done back on the ship when finally showing his true colors. Lifeless, without any type of expression or feeling in his voice. Epps wouldn't lie, it frightened her but she had to stay strong. After all that was what got her through this the first time. \"Jack, if you wanted to kill me so bad you would've done it already.\" her tone wasn't exactly the peachiest right now either. Maureen set the paperweight down on the table beside her but never took her eyes off of Jack. \"Clever girl.\" he nodded in appreciation. \"Enough bullshit. You're going to help me get the souls I need to fill my new quota. I mean, you don't really have a choice so I wouldn't exactly fight it if I were you. I gave you the opt out option once, I'm not going to give it to you again.\" finally satisfied that his chin didn't ache anymore he leaned back against the wall across from her and folded his arms over his chest. Fond memories began to swirl in his mind at the thought of him trying to drown her back in the Antonia Graza. She hadn't taken the bait, whether he was going to go through with it or not was an entirely different story however. Sure, once a passenger was marked he owned them...but he couldn't very well have a witness could he? Not that anyone would believe a ship wrecked crazy girl with laughable stories of ghosts. \"No.\" she stood her ground and made sure not to get in a relaxed stance like he was. Nope, always had to be on her guard. This wasn't playing house, this was real life and this was her living or dying. \"...You don't have a choice, Maureen!\" Jack pushed off from the wall and slid his hand angrily over the table which crashed over a vase and an empty picture frame. It made her form jump a little at the noise and the sudden action but she didn't budge. \"Someone will hear that.\" the tomboy commented bluntly. \"Hear what? I didn't hear anything.\" Ferriman took on his innocent routine and gestured towards the floor. Nothing. Nothing was there. The frame was right back where it had fallen from and the vase was still perched up on the surface of the table. There was fear in her eyes but more than anything Epps just wanted this over and done with. Finally she took her gaze off of the sadistic man in front of her and grabbed onto her jean jacket to tug it on. \"One question.\" her hand shoved her dark tresses in a messy but low ponytail after throwing Jack a glance. \"What else is new.\" the male spoke in a sarcastic tone. \"Where is Katie?\" Jack smiled a Cheshire cat-like grin and once again played the innocence card. \"Heaven. Didn't you see her float off with all the other souls after you destroyed my ship?\" She gave him a dirty look and had already guessed his ploy. \"Bullshit. You said yourself once a passenger is marked...they're yours. Considering she was the one you couldn't take then that means all the other souls are still tethered to you.\" her gaze landed on the wooden floor and sadness was hidden in her expression. \"Well, at least you liked the light show, right? To be honest, I don't give a rats ass where she went. How the hell should I know anyway? The souls are my priority, not the pesky ghost brat.\" Jack muttered and grabbed onto the small box in his pocket, a carton of cigarettes. The woman didn't exactly know if Katie was actually in Heaven or if Jack was just being an ass. She'd guess both only Katie was in Heaven and Jack was still an ass. \"Don't you know, smoking'll kill you?\" her hand reached for her door and started to unlock it. \" Funny .\" Ferriman exhaled a puff of smoke having taken out a cancer stick and lighting it before. She was too busy bothering with the stubborn locks to even notice anyway. \"You want my help? Open the goddamn door, Jack.\" In true Ferriman fashion he moved past her and unlatched the lock on the door. \"You don't know how to unlock your front door, Epps?\" he hid a smile. That was the first time he actually didn't use her first name. Good, one nasty habit taken care of. She hated the way he said it anyway, the only reason he found out was from the walkie in the past with Dodge and Munder. \"Shut up.\" her words were muttered underneath her breath when she realized he had purposely kept it locked even when she had unlocked it. Without further ado, Maureen shoved past him and opened the door nearly hitting him square in the face. \"Didn't see you, you know being a ghost and all.\" more sarcasm. She knew he wasn't a ghost, too bad...wasn't there some voo doo shit or something to cure her of that? Whatever that magic stuff was, her mother had never believed in it so neither had she. Boy, things really changed over time didn't they? He closed the door behind them and caught up to her side by side. \"Do you even know where we're going, Maureen?\" he sighed. Nope, spoke too soon! There he went again with the name. Epps was determined to ignore him and had been so infuriated with him that she had just been stomping off not knowing what direction to go. Hey, can't keep an independent woman from singing her own tune right? She stopped and looked up at him. \"After you.\" her tone suggested acid and in her mind there were plots of perhaps shoving him in shark infested waters one of these days. \"Don't be a smartass.\" he retorted back to her and headed down towards the docks. She was hesitant at first but had to keep reminding herself that she was doing this for Murph...for her freedom and so maybe they could rest in peace? That crew that had been lugging the gold onto the last ship had looked an awful lot like them but it hadn't been. Finally when it felt like she wasn't walking on eggshells anymore, the woman pressed on down the sandy hill and stopped at a motorboat tied to the edge of the dock. The hell was this? What did he plan to do, throw her overboard? Her mood shifted from anger to just plain confusion and finally looked up at him. He didn't want to talk anymore and forcefully shoved her down into the boat. Epps landed catching her hand just on the side of the boat and bit her tongue to conceal her pain. She stole her wrist back from where it had collided with the side of the motorboat and rubbed it. Jack untied the line and started up the motor in no time. Her heart was beating wildly in her chest as the horizon grew from the city, from the beach and finally out to the open nothingness of pure ocean. \"We're going for a little ride.\" he eased his form back against the side of the water vehicle and those words earned him a roll of the girls eyes. \"I hadn't noticed.\" she replied flatly. \"... My God , Maureen. If I had ever known stubborn bitches like you when I was alive I would have enjoyed myself more.\" he arched an eyebrow at her usual quips and proceeded to shut both of his eyes to get some rest. \"...I'm going to pretend that I didn't just throw up in my mouth a little.\" the brunette grumbled and leaned back against the opposite side and just watched him like a hawk. Ferriman stifled a yawn and started to drift off. She noticed a rolled up piece of paper in his pocket. It seemed too easy for her to just grab it...was he really asleep that fast? Trying her luck her form moved inches closer and slowly placed her hand near him to carefully take the paper. Nope! Not going to happen. His hand shot out in record speed and held a vice grip on her wrist almost breaking it. Epps elbowed him in the mouth and grabbed her wrist back as if he had just burned it. What the hell had he just done!? Didn't he do palms? Christ! \"What the FUCK did you just do?!\" she shook her hand after feeling the searing hot pain shoot up her palm. He smiled maliciously and took out the paper from his pocket; it was a map. \"You're like me now. You've got a job to do, Maureen. I own you. Management owns us both, get used to it.\" and with that he proceeded to get some shut eye once more leaving the woman bewildered, frightened and all together pissed off. Finally they hit land. Somehow her mind had drifted off elsewhere and there was a sharp poke in her side. Her eyes widened and instantly she jolted up startled. The loud buzzing of the motor had subsided and the boat was docked. In fact, Jack was already out of the boat and heading up onto the beach. \"What the hell is this?\" Epps asked as she slid out of the boat and onto land. \"Our first official gig, Sweetheart.\" his hand lashed out and grabbed onto her wrist once more only to tug her up onto the sandy hill. \"Faster, Maureen! Wasn't it you who told me to stop dragging ass?\" the male spoke coldly. She shouldered him away and headed up to the top of the hill. It was a city. But it was like an abandoned city unlike anything she had ever seen before. For once, the woman kept quiet having so much to take in from the sights and now sounds of the atmosphere. At first she didn't know if it was going to be a cruise ship; nope that was out of the mix. Was this an island? An island with a city. It felt like some episode of Lost only way more screwed up. \"The city of Wendell. Well, it's not actually a real city but it'll do. All I can say is blend in. Management rigged it so there's little to no law enforcement around here with plenty of souls ripe for the taking.\" he drawled on and on. Her eyebrow arched. \"In English, if there's no cops...then what the hell is so hard about it? There's a catch...\" she knew all too well. \"Well, yeah. I didn't say my job was easy. There are plenty of... possible victims. And I say possible because you're going to help me make them as such. Innocent people, like you and your crew having to be forced to do something that only Hell would accept. Considering if you make it through this...maybe I'll take you on a pleasure cruise, you know one of those fun Carnival ones? Make use of the gold, old favorite of mine.\" Her face paled. \"How many do you need?\" \"You mean we need? 4,000. Give or take. Managements pretty pick about their even numbers. Don't fuck it up.\"[Chapter 3] It was getting colder by the minute, she hugged her jean jacket closer to her slim form and her teeth began to chatter. This couldn't possibly be reality. Epps wanted more than anything to go back to the way things were. So television stations called her and asked her stories? Fine. People called her crazy? Fine again. Anything as long as it didn't involve killing people. But according to Jack these weren't ordinary people. They already were sinners, right? No! Snap out of it, Maureen! \"It stills sounds like bullshit, Ferriman.\" not even able to gather enough strength to call him by his first name. He didn't deserve that. After all, if all he would do was still call her Maureen then that was exactly what she'd do. Be a pain in the ass. They trudged up the hill which felt like it was going upward forever and finally seemed to be going sound of the ocean waves that had once brought her peace and thrill instead looked lifeless and morose. There was no light in her green eyes, only fear and anger. Emotions she had come to know very well over time. \"Do you do anything else other than fight me?\" Jack sent her a cold glare which in turn earned him a light growl from the female. Instead of answering him, the brunette started ahead of him in order to get up to the docks. \"Uh-uh.\" he tsked her and grabbed onto her wrist with an icy cold grasp. \"You don't even know where we're going, Maureen.\" his words were monotone and his eyes held a coldness that only a demon could possess. \"Anywhere is better than being within an inch of you.\" she murmured underneath her breath and shook his fingers off of her wrist. He allowed this and quickly let go as if the little gesture was anything short of abuse. He owned her, why couldn't her stubborn ass figure it out by now? The only thing that irritated him more than her angry woman bullshit was the sight of the heart necklace around her pretty neck. \"Thought I trashed that when the ship blew up.\" he hadn't even noticed the locket around her neck the last time they had met. He had been far too busy focusing on her screams, his dim-witted new crew and the look of horror on her face to even notice anything else. \"Or do you mean when I blew your ass sky high with a shit load of C4?\" Jack grabbed onto the chain around her neck and yanked. Immediately her hand came up into a fist and attempted to punch him in the jaw but he quickly avoided it as only a demon could. \"You're trying my patience, Maureen!\" it was almost a snarl, it meant business. Would he really kill her? What good would that do him? \"Give it back!\" her boots nearly stumbled against the docks and Jack found himself chuckling the way he had in the past when he had morphed out of the form of Dodge. \"It's insurance. It's mine for now. You get it back if you're a good girl.\" his tone held warning, no emotion and absolutely no life at all. As dull and as lifeless as a corpse for that matter. She knew now to shut her mouth and kept careful notice when he pocketed the locket in his navy blue windbreaker pocket. Insurance. Great, he was going to hold the only tie she had with Katie above her head where she couldn't reach it. Her hand immediately went around her throat from where he had nearly choked her with the chain and rubbed the smooth skin there. Jesus Christ that hurt. \"We're checking into Motel 6, no questions and no talking back. Do exactly as I tell you, say exactly what you're supposed to say or one more body hits the ground. I'll give you a hint-it won't be yours.\" his voice indicating that he'd take whatever soul he could find and let it stay on her shoulders as a burden to her conscience. \"Yet.\" adding the extra mile to his threat. Great. Classy, Jack. Really . Class act. Epps clutched her fingers into fists so hard that her knuckles turned white but she gave a firm nod as if to silently oblige. He didn't even smile, he knew he had her in the palm of his hand. They crossed the street. A mother and her little girl were holding hands and walking happily the minute the sign had read 'walk'. The brunette's heart ached upon seeing the red headed child and her equally red headed, Irish mother wandering to the other side of the street. Happy as larks. It reminded her of Katie. Of course it did. A part of her really just wanted to stand in front of traffic and let it be over with. But that would just be a mess and it wasn't worth it. If Maureen Epps died it would be for a reason not an easy way out. With a rough nudge, Jack shoved her forward as they walked across the street together and headed for a large, seedy looking parking lot. It reminded her a lot of New York City. For something that looked so dead at the harbor and docks it sure as hell was bustling with life when you got closer to it. Maureen scuffed her shoes along the puddles of past rain falls and finally stopped short in front of a door to a motel. Sure enough in those bright unwelcoming letters did it read 'Motel 6'. Ferriman never disappointed. Perhaps she could use that to her advantage later? He walked by her, as if he didn't even see her and opened the door to step inside. Just when the woman thought of making a run for it did he grab onto her hand and yank her inside. So much for a spark of hope. Jack walked up to the desk and pushed down onto the little bell. No one greeted them at the counter. He tried again and kept a suave smile on his lips. His smile fell and his demeanor grew cold and impatient. It was warm inside of the motel lobby and this prompted the brunette to slide off her jacket and tie it around her waist as quick as possible. No need for a certain jackasses eyes to get a glimpse of her form in the process. Jack caught onto this and rolled his eyes. Sure he found the girl attractive but that wasn't on his mind right now. Hey, better to be safe than sorry. Finally irritated of waiting any longer around him in this hell, the former ship salvager slapped her palm down on the bell in one slam and gave an irritated yell. \"Hey!\" Maureen's raspy voice carried and immediately a middle-aged woman stepped out from the break room and settled herself in front of the desk. \"Can I help you?\" she sounded tired but alas at least finally someone paid attention to them. Ferriman raised an eyebrow at the other's antics and instead placed a credit card down onto the surface of the desk. \"Two rooms please.\" putting on his naturally handsome and nice personality. The woman behind the desk smiled happily at how charming he was and Jack pretended to stumble his elbow into a small cup of pens on the desk. It was Maureen's turn to roll her eyes now and she simply leaned against the mahogany desk waiting for them to get their room keys. Jack must have materialized the credit card because she sure as hell didn't remember him having one before. Tricky, tricky. \"Sorry! I guess sometimes I can be a little clumsy.\" immediately his fake facade was plastered over his face and that earned him a soft giggle from the clerk at the desk. \"It happens all of the time Mr...\" her blue eyes glanced down at the card. \"Ferriman.\" not thinking anything of it. Why would they? Not like everyone in the world knew Greek mythology. He nodded apologetically and was finally greeted with the room keys. \"67 down the hall, take a right.\" the clerk's chubby finger pointed towards that direction. \"Wifi isn't free, it's 9.99 for twenty minutes and then after that the same price.\" it was the woman's usual speech, you could tell she was tired and uninterested in her job. Well, uninterested in everything except for Jack Ferriman. Women always fell all over him-except one. He hadn't even fully gotten Maureen's attention back on the boat despite having a close call with the cigarette sharing. Finally seeing the curly haired woman in front of the desk, the clerk frowned but tried to pretend she was peachy keen with everything. \"I don't mean to pry but is this your wife?\" quickly trying to find any wedding rings on their fingers. Immediately Maureen thought that she was going to vomit and she turned her head to hide the wrinkle of her nose. \"Holy fuck-no-.\" the tomboy nearly gagged quietly but could only mouth the words. \"Honeymoon.\" Jack quickly piped in. The thought itself made him want to throw up as well. Well, almost. Weddings, rings, touchy feeling bullshit didn't exactly get him off. That's why Francesca had been such an easy target. A vapid, rich whore who not only spoke Italian but she also was a greedy little thing with a nice ass and the homicidal skills really helped. Poor broad, didn't even feel an ounce of guilt for her really. older woman grinned as fake as possible. Now that the taller male had the key cards in hand they were all set to go. He gave a thoughtful nod and started down the hallway only to stop until Maureen followed as well. She was furious right now. \"Your wife? Really? You're so fucked up.\" not one to shy away from any type of bluntness or brashness. He liked that in her, she had fire and that meant she was a challenge. Well, a challenge that was currently a pain in his ass and one that screwed up his past plans as well. So right now? Not really a welcomed one. \"Yeah, yeah. Complaint box is back with that old bitch- go whine there.\" Jack waved her away and slid the key card into the slot of the door. The stubborn thing didn't want to work. This gave the other woman time to tap her foot on the carpet in turn royally pissing Ferriman off. \"Stop that.\" his voice held a ghostly chill, it didn't even faze her. \"Bite me.\" not able to keep the words from tumbling out of her mouth. He didn't reply, clearly almost considering her threat but instead shifted his gaze to the door and then back to the key card. Immediately it opened because of his demon abilities and he opened the door to be greeted to a nice, air conditioned room. \"Stupid woman, it's sub zero outside and she's got the A/C on.\" Jack sighed and waited for Maureen to get herself situated. With the light close of the door, he made sure to seal it from the inside just so he could keep her from wandering off. \"Oh, hell no. I want my own room.\" He silenced her almost immediately. \"Beggars can't be choosers, Maureen. Get used to it.\" she glared him down and moved over to the bed. Her fingers grabbed onto one of the pillows and took the extra sheet from the bottom of the bed only to put it on the floor. \"The day I sleep with you is the day Hell freezes over.\" it was muttered underneath her breath as she clearly was making her bed. The tomboy clearly was no princess so it wasn't like she'd request the bed. By all means, he could have at it. She wanted to be closer to the door anyway. \"The feeling is mutual.\" monotone once again as his bright blue eyes rolled and he tossed the key cards down onto the night stand and turned on the light. \"All right, we get settled in and then we're going out.\" \"Out where?\" she asked and leaned back against the bureau on the floor. It was as if a deja-vu she always ended up on the ground somehow. \"Dancing, what do you think?\" he snapped. \"Oh-you mean a murdering spree for your management?\" clearly sassing him. Man, she knew better. Time to knock it off before her ass was grass. He was sick of her sarcasm. Jack started searching for something in one of the night stand drawers and opened it to sift through it. \"Lost your bible?\" she could be just as goddamn monotone as he could. Finally finding it, Jack clutched onto the letter opener (really? What the hell was that doing in a motel room?) and sent it sailing across the room as quick as lightning. Inhuman skills, they always came with perks. She suddenly ducked like clockwork but the piece of metal met its mark-lightly grazing her cheek causing the littlest cut there. All right, she learned her lesson. Maureen's hand quickly went to her cheek and held her fingers down to clot the blood there with light pressure. \"Son of a bitch!\" With inhuman strength, Ferriman slammed her against the wall pinning her wrists against it so hard he probably left bruises there. \"Get off!\" she tried to kick him but he dodged as usual. \"Be a good girl, do what I say or the next cut won't miss. Do you understand, Maureen?\" he was leaning into her purposely making it look like he could use his weight to crush her lungs. Her heart beat wildly in her chest but still she fought. He leaned into the soft skin of her cheek where the blood was trickling ever so lightly and licked it. She shuddered and finally managed to buck him off. Maureen gagged and grabbed onto the collar of her shirt to wipe off her cheek. \"Fucking Christ, Ferriman!\" He smiled maliciously and licked his bottom lip. \"For a mortal, you taste sweet. Funny, I always pictured you as sour.\" voice back to emotionless state. \"What the hell are you now a vampire too?\" she looked disgusted, as if the woman had back in the Antonia Graza engine room. Jack rolled his eyes. \"No, Maureen. I'm a demon, demons kill shit and every so often we can enjoy pleasures too. If we feel like it-Francesca wasn't exactly second best, or third best. You? First. And if you're lucky I'll let you live. If not? Your soul will rot with the rest. What'll it be?\" Finally the soul taker got the stubborn mortal to shut up. Good, if that's all it took then they would be sailing (no pun intended) through this mission in no time. \"I get the message.\" finally looking as if she'd obey. \"Good. Get cleaned up, we're going out tonight to a dinner party to meet some very powerful guests. You thought the Antonia was a breeze? These are some of the most wretched and sinful pieces of work I've ever encountered. We'll have them begging to kill each other.\" Maureen furrowed her brows. He picked out a black cocktail dress from the drawer and placed it down on the bed. \"Wear it.\" ","Summary":" [Wrote this all tonight, it's 2:16 AM. I miss writing for this movie! Glad I got back into the swin"},{"Movie":"Ghost Ship","Title":"Munder","Author":"TheNotSoMutantTurtles","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6459767","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"Get the fuck off my boat.\" Murphy said, his voice pitched low, the anger he was feeling obvious below the surface. Jacobs' eyes were narrowed, he wasn't looking at Murphy, but rather at the young man standing a few feet behind him beside Epps. \"It's not me that needs putting off this boat Murphy and you know it.\" he sneered, his eyes flicking deliberately down to the cast around Munder's wrist, a malicious curl twitching at the corners of his mouth. Murphy's face twisted into a scowl and he stepped forward, blocking the view Jacobs had of Munder and Epps. He had known when he'd hired him that Jacobs wasn't exactly a team player, but he had needed someone along for the heavy lifting that needed doing with this salvage, Epps, for all her posturing wasn't strong enough to do the really heavy stuff, and Munder's skill was a little too valuable to jeopardise, especially with the way his right wrist fractured so easily. He hadn't expected the man to be violent. It hadn't been too noticeable at first, there were a few incidents between him and Epps, but that always happened in the first week before Epps laid down the law. Munder had been the only exception, the young man had arrived on ship very much the worse for wear, and hadn't made more than a joking pass at Epps, and that had been two weeks into the trip when he'd started feeling more at ease with them, and when Epps shot him down, as she did with everyone who tried, Munder had just grinned and the two had easily fallen into a sibling relationship. Murphy had kept him on, as he really was the best spot welder in Alaska, and he wasn't a sexist asshole where Epps was concerned. So when he hadn't laid off Epps when she'd told him 'No', Murphy had had words with him, and had considered the matter dealt with. He hadn't been aware Jacobs was targeting Munder as well, the man seemed to get off on intimidating people, and despite all his bravado and his big mouth, Munder was, sadly, the perfect victim. And he might have remained unaware had it not been for Munder stepping in when Jacobs got drunk and tried his chances once more with Epps. It had resulted in yet another fractured wrist for Munder and a black eye for Jacobs. \"You were drunk, and you assaulted my crew. That's all the reason I need to throw you off my boat.\" Murphy growled. \"Now get off.\" \"You gotta expect a bit of trouble when you got a woman and a Munder on your crew, 'specially that one.\" Jacobs sneered. Murphy took a step forward, and Jacobs stepped back, not out of fear, but disgust. \"S'all right Murphy, I'll get off your boat. Don't wanna work this shit pile anymore anyway, better work elsewhere.\" And he spun on his heel and left. With a final, wordless growl, Murphy turned and stalked to the bridge. Written, because there just isn't enough gen Munder fic... or hell, any munder fic. I have a whole backstory for him in my head, but I just can't seem to get it down proporly. Hopefully the little short's I've written will explain enough for you all to get a sense of it. Disclaimer: I own nothing.[Chapter 2] \"Murph.\" Munder tried again. \"Murph, I can get off next port.\" Murphy turned, frowning deeply at the young man standing behind him. \"You ain't going anywhere Munder.\" Munder ran his hand through his hair, tugging more hair loose from the messy pony tail at his neck as he did. \"Fuck Murph, I always knew this was a temp job. You've kept me on a lot longer than anyone else, and I'm grateful for that, but you gotta see it's losing you business having me on board.\" Murphy had to reign in the urge to reach out and fix the messy tangles at the front. The boy had barely an idea of how to look after himself, and Murphy knew that he'd be back on that pirate ship of a boat his brothers ran within the month; he'd seen it a few times over the past 6 years, since the 'Blackbeard' had started plying it's trade in Alaska; which was why he had been determined to have the boy on his tug permanent like. \"You're not leaving the boat Alex.\" He said again, hoping that by using his first name would impress upon Munder his seriousness. \"You're my crew, just like Epps and Greer are, and if anyone we hire can't deal with that then they can go.\" Munder heaved a small sigh. \"But Murph, seriously, your having to turn down big hauls because people won't sign up because I'm on board. Fuck man…\" \"Munder… Alex, what jobs I decide to take are my business, not yours. What crew I decide to take on is my decision. Now I can't stop you going if that's what you really want to do, but I don't want you leaving this boat if your next trip out is gonna be on the Black Beard.\" \"I'm not gonna tell them anything!\" Munder protested, going on the defensive immediately. Murphy sighed. \"Fuck Kid, I know your not.\" Would their first meeting always shadow Munder's dealings with him. The kid had only been 16, and had only done what he did because of some threat his brothers had made to him. Murphy hadn't reacted in the best possible way, but that was before he'd known that the three older Munder brothers were controlling and threatening Alex into doing what they wanted. \"I just don't want you on that boat. They've screwed up your life enough don't you think?\" Munder blinked. \"You're worried about me?\" he asked in disbelief. Murphy rolled his eyes, but decided to go with honesty. \"Yeah kid, yeah, I am.\" I may write out how they first met at some later date, we'll have to see.[Chapter 3] \"I'm looking for Munder, Alex Munder. I got word he might be on your tug.\" Epps shared a quick look with Murphy, who shared her concern. They didn't normally get people asking for Munder, and usually it was someone from his brothers ship with either a threat or a bribe to try and get him back to the ship. The last time it had been a threat, and Greer had been on hand to deal with it; but Greer was off with his girlfriend this port. \"What are ya looking for him for?\" Murphy asked. Epps cast a surreptitious glance back towards the door to the inside of the tug, so far they had managed to deal with all but two of these instances without Munder finding out, and she hoped they could keep it that way. When she had dragged him, drunk and injured, to the tug over two years ago she hadn't expected Murphy to know the kid, or for him to end up being some sort of genius underwater welder. She'd just let herself give into her nurturing side when she'd seen one of the men she now knew to be his brothers dump him in an alley. They'd gotten him drunk while he was on heavy duty painkillers and nearly killed him. That, the fact he only made a single half-hearted pass at her when he was feeling better, and the look of absolute surprise on his face when Murphy had offered him a place on the boat for a job and possibly a place on the crew if he wanted it, had cemented him forever as 'Family' to her, the little brother she was glad she hadn't grown up with. She'd never seen Murphy take to anyone that quickly. She later learned he'd been keeping tabs on the kid from he was sixteen, waiting for the opportunity to offer him a way out of his brothers' twisted shadows. Munder was family now, like Murphy was, and there was no way in hell he was ever leaving the Arctic Warrior unless he genuinely wanted to go. \"Look, I just need to know if he's here. If he's not I'll move on, whatever, but if you see him tell him I'm over in the Oyster Bar.\" The man said, shrugging and hefting his bag up onto his shoulder. \"You gotta name?\" Murphy asked, frowning. \"Can't be passing on any message without a name.\" \"Sure, if you see him tell him Dodge is looking for him.\" Epps studied the man for a moment, searching, like she knew Murphy was, for any hint this man meant Munder harm. \"Hey Murph, I found that… What's going on?\" Munder pushed his way on deck and blinked in surprise when he found his shipmates not working. Epps stopped herself from reaching out to push Munder back inside, feeling a little silly for even thinking about doing so. Munder peered over the side. \"Dodge?\" he said after a moment. \"Hey Alex.\" The man replied, with a genuine grin. \"Thought you were still in Spain?\" \"Got bored. Besides, I still owe you that money.\" Munder looked surprised. \"You've got it? Still?\" Epps frowned across the Murphy, questioning. He shook his head. \"Yeah, I still got it. Had to borrow a bit to get here, but most of it's here. Thought you were supposed to come pick it up?\" Munder didn't answer for a long moment, and Epps was surprised to see the same realisation pass over the strangers face as Murphy's and her own, that Munder's brothers had somehow been directly responsible for the delay, and that Munder had not actually believed anyone would actually keep his money for him. \"You want that I should just leave it and shove off, or are you gonna come have a drink with me?\" the man said suddenly, negating the need for Munder to answer. Munder didn't even hesitate, which told Epps and Murphy everything they needed to know about this man. \"Sure, drinks sound good. Give me an hour or so and I'll—\" \"Go on.\" Murphy said. \"Me and Epps'll take care of this.\" \"You sure Murph?\" Munder asked. \"I'm sure, go. It'll do us some good not to have to listen to your caterwauling.\" \"Hey! My singing's not that bad!\" Munder protested, but he was already heading for the gangway to the dock. \"Keep telling yourself that!\" Epps called after him with a smile, watching his disappear over the side. When he and his friend were gone she looked over at Murphy and raised an eyebrow. Murphy nodded and she smiled again. Looked like they'd be getting a new crewmember next trip out. Ok, wow... I am really bad at this snippit thing. But I just can't seem to get my head around writing an actual story based on this movie or it's characters. So I suppose it'll just have to do.

She twisted the word toy her parents gave her before they went to New York. She was on her way to join them. As she twisted the toy it got caught on itself so she couldn't spell what she was trying to. \"Allow me.\" A young steward said. Katie handed him the toy. With a quick twist he freed the block to reveal her message. It read: I AM SO BORED. He laughed. \"Me too.\" He handed her the toy. \"Thank you.\" Katie blushed. \"It was my pleasure, miss.\" He strode off to collect the empty Champaign glasses from the others. \"Everyone, dance.\" Said the young singer. Everyone stood and went to the dance floor. Katie heard footsteps. She looked over to see Angela running towards her. \"Katie!\" The captain stepped forward and offered to dance with Katie. She gratefully accepted and walked with him to the dance floor. Her blondebrown hair went passed her shoulder blades just slightly. Her bangs were tied up in a pale blue ribbon that matched her dress and ribbon around her waist. \"Katie, NOOO! I need to talk to you! It's important!\" Angela yelled. Her dark brown hair was up in a ponytail held by a dark blue band. Her dress and the ribbon around her waist were also dark blue. Angela and Katie met on the ship. Angela's room was across the hall from Katie's room. They became close friends. Angela watched as Katie and the captain danced. They heard a crunching sound. The lights were pulled down. The wire supporting the lights cut across the dancers. \"Katie!\" Angela yelled as if it would stop time. The captain bent to protect Katie. The wire stopped. No one moved. People starting falling apart where the wire had cut them. Katie and the captain were in the middle, standing to Angela's relief. Katie looked up. The captain had moved into the wires path and in return to his actions, Katie was alive. His body fell lifelessly to the floor. \"AAAAAHHHHHH!\" Katie and Angela both screamed. Hey yall, this is The Demoness of evil! i no this is Miss Yumi's story but i got stuck putting up the god damn chapter and all the others that follow. so ... um yeah ... what to say ... except that this is her first story! GO Yumi! Ok before i go bye bye ... i tell u all that Maroon Goddess is MG and i am DoE and now Miss Yumi will be M.Y Cool buh bye.[Chapter 2] Boonzie: Thank you so much for reading my story! DoE: You should give my story a try! See you tomorrow. RaineBeauxe: It will be good, just keep reading! Koolsam33: You'll find out in chapter 6. Jessica Hatchett: Thank you for the support. Chapter 2: The Aftermath \"Epps, get out of there right now!\" Murphy yelled into the walkie-talkie. They were salvagers. Boat salvagers to be precise. \"I'm almost done! The patch is a little thicker than usual so it'll take longer to patch! If you don't like how it's going, come patch it yourself! Now shut up so I can concentrate!\" Epps yelled into the talkie. 'God! Can't he give it a rest once in a while?' Epps thought as she continued patching the salvaged ships hull. \"Epps! Murphy said to get back to the tug!\" Munder called. No use. His call fell upon deaf ears. \"Damn it! Dodge grab the torch!\" The blond 27 year old did as he was told. Both jumped into the water with Epps. \"Murphy, we have to cut her loose! If she sinks, she's taking us with her!\" Greer told Murphy as his hands turned the wheel of the Arctic Warrior. \"Epps! If you don't get back here, I'll come drag you out myself! You know I'll do it!\" Dodge had the patch sealed and Munder had the news delivered to Murphy so they could get their well-earned money. Murphy walked into the pub to join his celebrating crew. \"Here's to the best damn salvage crew I know!\" He dumped wads of cash onto the table. Each one had a post-it with a name written on it. \"Epps?\" A voice Epps recognized as her cousin Lynn's voice. Epps turned. \"Lynn! How are you?\" Epps asked. \"Good, but our salvaged ship sank.\" \"That's too bad!\" \"Ehem.\" A man in pilots' cloths was standing at the table with a folder in his hand. \"Can I help you?\" Asked Murphy. \"Uh, yes. My name's Jack Ferriman And I was wondering if I could perhaps buy you a drink.\" \"Murphy doesn't drink.\" Said Epps as she and Lynn sat down at the table. \"Oh. Well, do you think I could talk to you in private?\" \"Anything you say to me, you say to my crew.\" Answered Murphy. \"Ok. I was wondering if you were interested in this.\" He pulled pictures out of the folder and handed them to Murphy. \"I'm a pilot and I was flying over the straits and saw this.\" \"Did you get a name off of her?\" It was Lynn's turn to ask. \"No. I put it out of my mind until I saw it again two days ago. I called the Coast Guard but it was in International waters so they had no way they could pick it up or whatever they do.\" \"What do you think Epps?\" Murphy looked at her. \"Big. Huge. Could be military.\" She responded. Murphy turned to Jack. \"My crew and I need to discuss this. Do you mind if we have a moment?\" Jack shook his head and went back to the bar stool he was originally sitting at. \"Murph, we just got back from six months on the sea. Man, I have a fiancé waiting for me. The wedding is in three weeks and I need to be there.\" Greer said the last part as a joke. \"If the sea offers you something you've got to take it.\" Murphy held up his hand as if he really caught something. \"Fine with me.\" Said Epps. \"Me too.\" Recited Munder and Dodge together. \"YO it's cool with me.\" Said Santos. They all looked at Greer. \"Whatever.\" He took a swig from his bottle of beer. \"Hey, Murph, Can I come along for the ride?\" Asked Lynn as she pulled back her soft red hair. Her white teeth sparkled as she spoke. \"As long as you can pull your own weight.\" Lynn smiled. \"That, I can really do well.\" Murphy chuckled. \"Ferriman.\" Murphy called. Jack hoped off the stool and walked effortlessly over to the table. \"Yeah?\" \"We'll take the job.\" Murphy kept glancing at the pictures. \"Ok. I'll take 20 of whatever she's worth.\" Jack looked at Epps and grinned. \"No not 220. I can give you 10, but not the 20 you're asking for.\" Murphy followed Jacks gaze. \"I can't let you take advantage of me like that.\" \"Take it or leave it.\" Jack thought for a moment. \"Fine but I go with you.\" Wat up? this is DoE happy times! well g2g![Chapter 3] Chaptern3: Voyage The little tug faced the storm head on. As itndipped and bobbed with the water their goal shone on the radarnscreen. Greer steered in the same direction as the ship they werentrying to get to. Greer saw that they were nearing the mysteriousnship and a shiver went up his spine, as if in warning. Epps was asleep on the small sofa, her head onnLynn's lap. Jack sat next to the coffee table and sipped his water,nwhile the others discussed their own ideas about what might be on thenship. \"I think there'll be loads of nothing butndebris. Maybe wine.\" Munder said as he inhaled his cigarette. \"I think there'll be porno magazines.\" Dodgenleaned back in his chair. \"You think, or you hope?\" Asked Murphy. \"We all know he hopes there's porno.\" Lynnngiggled as she said this. Greer came over the speaker. \"Hey, Dodge, get on the light fornme please.\" Greer said over the radio. He looked at the radar. Thenship was gone. \"Hey Murph, get up here, you havento see this.\" Greer waited for Murphy. Murphy walked into the helmnroom. Before either could say a word, Greer saw the ship. The realnnon-radar ship they were hunting. \"SHIT!!!!\" Murphy yelled. Greernput the tug in reverse to try to not crash into the ships side. Itndidn't help. The tug smacked into the ship sending everyone joltingnforward. \"Poor souls. They don't knowntheir fate.\" Angela stood next to Katie. The bitter wind whippednthrough them. \"Do you think they'll listen thisntime, Katie?\" Angela didn't have to look at Katie to see that hernface showed she had her doubts. \"I don't know. I pray they do.\" \"We have to be extra careful thisntime. He almost hurt us the last time.\" \"I know, I know.\" Katie looked atnthe salvagers below them. \"The Antonio Graza.nShe disappeared the 21stnof May in 1962.\" Murphy said as he scanned the ship with his eyes. \"1962?\" Epps repeated as anquestion. Murphy nodded. \"Katie, if they don't, you cannalways….\" \"Last resort and nothing more.\"nKatie watched as the salvagers doom was coming closer with everynbreath they took. \"She's huge!\" Santos said as hencame out with the rest of them. \"Yeah.\" Jack looked in amazement. \"I can't believe it!\" Lynnngawked at the enormous ship in front of her. Sorry this one is soooooo short but Insent this and the next to DoE to put up for me so you may continuenreading. PLEASE CONTINUE!!! IT GETS GOOD Chapter 4:nApparitions Disclaimer: Please don't sue me! Inneed the series of events to introduce everything! \"So, she's been out here for, say, 40 years.\"nLynn said as she watched the rain slide down the side of the Graza. \"Wow. 40 years is a long time to bensitting around unnoticed.\" Said Epps. \"You never know what happened tonher either.\" Jack muttered as he squeezed in between Lynn and Epps.nLynn had a bad feeling about this particular ship. She was known fornbeing somewhat psychic. Epps noticed her distant stare and followednher gaze. Of course Epps saw nothing, but that doesn't thatnnothing's there. \"What is it?\" Epps's questionnjogged Lynn from her trance. \"Huh? Oh! Nothing, I just thoughtnabout what happened to them.\" \"Them?\" Jack was puzzled. \"The passengers, I mean thenpassengers.\" Lynn looked down at the black water. \"We should wait 'till morningnbefore we go on the ship, Murph.\" Epps put a hand on Murphy'snshoulder as she said this. \"I guess you're right. We'llnwait for morning to come until we go aboard.\" Murphy turned to looknat Jack. They exchanged grins. Morning came all too fast for Lynn'sntaste. Epps was waiting for her. \"Morning.\" \"Morning, Epps.\" Lynn replied asnshe gagged on the coffee Santos made them. \"I know it's bad, but you don'tnhave to let me know like that!\" Santos was covered in engine oilnfrom head to toe. \"So that's why it tastes bitter.\"nLynn giggled at Epps's joke. \"They are still blind.\" Katie wasnsitting where she had been before she danced that horrible nightnabout 40 years ago. \"One sees us when others don't. Maybe shencan save us.\" Angela sat beside Katie. \"Hello Katie, Angela.\" It wasnAlex. He was a steward on the Graza. \"Hello Alex.\" Katie couldn'tnblush but if she could, she'd be blushing. \"I'm going to think of a plan tonget them to listen to us.\" Angela stood and disappeared. Katie wasnalone with Alex. She liked it when they were alone. \"Do you want to dance?\" Alex heldnout his hand. Katie just nodded and took his hand. They danced for anfew minutes. They stopped when they heard the salvagers coming. \"Katie, I was wondering if…\"nAlex had no time to finish because a gasp cut him off. Lynn stared atnthem. She slowly came closer. Angela didn't help the situation. Shenappeared next to Katie. \"Katie, Alexnsomeone's…\" She saw Lynn, \"Ooops.\" Angela whispered. Lynn watched them. They watched her.nA young girl, the one that didn't appear, spoke to her first. \"Listen, you need to leave thisnship now!\" Her accent was English. \"Don't hurt me!\" Lynn pleaded. \"Katie wouldn't hurt a fly!!\"nThat was from the one who had appeared. \"I must be loosing my mind!\" Lynnnmuttered to herself. She stumbled backwards and ran to meet thenothers. \"You ok?\" Epps looked at Lynn. \"Yeah, I just….\" She paused.n\"got a little sea-sick. That's all.\" \"Ok.\" Epps was suspicious. Lynnnhad always been a horrible liar. She had gotten worse with age. Chapter 5: MercynPlea Lynn felt dizzy. It wasn't the first time shenhad seen a ghost, but having a conversation with one was a newnexperience. They had sat in a circle next to the dance floor. The onenknown as Katie tried to avoid it altogether. \"Why are you here?\" Lynn askedntrying to sound as intelligent as possible but not quite managing. Itnwas getting dark and Epps would start to worry about her if shendidn't return shortly. They had spent the day wandering the Grazanwithout any appearances from the three ghosts. It had given Lynn anchance to think. \"We are trapped here. Please, getnoff the..\" Epps yelling for Lynn interrupted Katie. \"Lynn!!! Get your ass in here!! Wenfond GOLD, DAMN IT, GOLD!!!!!\" Epps yelled. \"Well we are getting off the ship.\" Lynn said as she stood and backed away. The three looked at each other innhorror. \"No.\" Angela whispered. \"I thought it would take at leastnanother day for them to find it!\" Katie fidgeted with the hem ofnher dress. Alex stood. \"I'll take care of this.\" Henwas about to walk away when Katie grabbed his hand. \"No Alex! He'll hurt you!\"nKatie looked him in the eye. \"Katie..\" Alex scooped her up innhis arms and hugged her with all the love in his heart. \"I'll be fine. He can't hurtnme.\" He gently kissed her cheek. \"I'll tell them. This time,nthey'll get the message.\" Angela said as she stood. \"No Angela, you can live a life ofnhappiness and joy once we're off this rust bucket.\" Alex's facenwas serious. \"He can't hurt me but he can hurt you and I can't go on living if I knew that.\" This ended thenargument. It was true. He couldn't hurt Angela if he tried.nAngela's shoes clattered as she approached the gangplank. The nightnair was just starting to chill. Angela shivered. Greer was waiting for Santos tonfinish working on the engine. The small white phone rang. \"Yes?\" Greer asked with a smile. \"Start her up!\" It was Santos.nGreer hung up. He took his time, waiting for the heat to kick in anlittle more. Angela saw Epps and Lynn. \"No! Stop! You can't go on thatnboat!!\" Angela screamed. A male figure dressed in black passednthrough her. Because he did not get her, he went for Katie. As henripped Katie away from Alex, Angela turned on her heel and ran tonhelp Katie. Epps watched in amazement. There werenghosts on the Graza. Her dazed expression turned to fear as thenWarrior burst into flames. \"Greer!!!!\" Epps yelled in hopesnof an answer. She dove into the water. Lynn stayed on the ship andnwatched the scared Katie be held by the young man who loved her. Lynnnwalked to Katie. \"Who was that?\" Lynn got nonresponse. \"Katie, tell me who that was.\"nLynn turned to Angela. \"Why did he pass through you likenthat? Couldn't he touch you?\" Lynn was so confused. Angela turned to face Lynn. \"Touch me.\" Angela held out anhand. Lynn hesitated. Slowly, she touched Angela's hand. Lynn'snfinger passed through Angela's palm. Lynn pulled back. \"Now, touch me.\" Angela shivered.nLynn cautiously touched Angela's out stretched hand. This time,nLynn's finger rested on flesh. \"How…What…\" Lynn wasnspeechless. Chapter 6: Undead \"I'm not like thenothers. Unlike them, I died in my dreams. I can be alive or dead, butnI can't be alive alive or dead dead.nI'm, well, undead if that's what you want to call it. I've beennthis way for 43 years. I'm 13. I too can't leave the Graza,nalthough I have gotten farther than most have.\" Angela went backninto her ghost-like self. \"This can't be happening.\" Lynnnsaid as she watched Alex hold Katie even closer. \"It is, you must understand this. You have to leave here before you, too, are killed.\"nKatie managed to say as the one she loved, but would never tellnembraced her even tighter. Angela saw them. She looked at Lynn. \"Come with me.\" Angela led Lynnninto the Graza towards her room. Alex turned so he could gaze intonKatie's eyes. \"Katie, I was trying to tell younearlier that….well…I love you Katie. I would do anything to makenyou happy.\" Katie's face showed the same passion for Alex. \"I love you too Alex.\" Katienrested her head on his chest. He gingerly lifted her chin. Slowlynthey drew closer. When their lips met, Katie savored every second. \"Well, well, well.\" Echoed a deepnvoice. It was one Katie knew and dreaded. \"Where are we going?\" Lynn askednas she followed Angela. \"My state room. AndnKatie's which is across the hall from mine.\" They reached theirndestination in only a few minutes. Angela pushed open the door. Thensmall room contained a small bed and a few furniture items. \"Katie's is much moreninteresting.\" Angela crossed the hall and entered Katie's room.nIt had the same furnishings, but there were dresses laid out on thenbed. Lynn wandered towards the closet. Katie had drawn what happenednthe night the Graza disappeared. Lynn was about to open the closetnwhen Angela spoke. \"I found her there,ndead of course. We were trying to find a place to hide when,\"nAngela hesitated. \"I couldn't save her. Katie can show you what happened. Only true ghosts possess that power.\" Lynnnbacked away from the closet. She wasn't afraid; she just didn'tnwant Angela to suffer any more than she already had. They exitednKatie's room. As they did so they heard Katie scream at the top ofnher lungs. \"Katie!!\" Angela disappeared.nLynn ran to get on deck. Angela appeared to find Katie, and only Katie, sittingnon the deck of the Antonia Graza. I got the idea of havingnAngela being 'undead' because I, myself, died in my dreams and Inthought it might be a cool idea in a fan fiction. Chapter 7: Take me away Katie sat shivering on the deck. \"Katie, where's Alex?\" Angelanasked. She already knew the answer. \"H-H-H\" Katie struggled to speak.n\"H-He took…he took Alex!\" \"You mean that guy you were withnearlier?\" Asked Lynn in confusion. Angela nodded to answer Lynn'snquestion. Carefully, Angela kneeled beside Katie. \"It's okay. We'll get him back.nI promise. Cross my heart and hope to die.\" Angela drew an \"X\"nover her heart and then made a slashing motion at her throat. Katienhugged Angela. \"No,\" She whispered. \"don'tndie. Live and be happy once we get off of this godforsaken ship.\" \"Katie, Angela, I'm going to getnEpps. She'll help look for Alex.\" Lynn said as she started to runnto where the rest of the crew was boarding the Graza. \"Epps! Get over here! You need tonsee this!\" Lynn yelled as Epps slumped onto the ship. \"Can't you see I'm busy?!\"nEpps retorted in a hoarse voice. \"No, you need to see this before you do anything else.\" Lynn pressured. Epps gavenin. \"What is it?\" \"You'll see.\" Lynn replied asnshe led Epps away from the others. Angela cradled Katie. \"Katie, it'll benfine. I swear, Alex will be fine.\" Angela tried to comfort Katie. \"You have to show them whatnhappened here. I would but I can't.\" Katie nodded in agreement.nThey saw Lynn return with Epps. Epps stopped. \"Wholly shit!\" Epps stared atnthem. \"We have to get off this ship! Theyncan explain it better than I can.\" Lynn pointed at Katie andnAngela. Angela rocked back and forth, Katienin her arms trying to calm her. \"Before we do anything else we havento find Alex!!\" Katie said as she imagined what he was doing tonAlex as they stood by and did nothing. \"We'll get him back, Katie. Calmndown!\" Angela put her hands on Katie's shoulders and held her atnarms length. \"We will get him back!\" Angelansaid again. Katie nodded. \"I-I'll show you.\" Katie saidnas she looked into Epps's brown eyes. \"I'll show you what happened onnthe Antonia Graza. But only after we find Alex.\" They nodded innagreement with her proposal. \"Who's Alex?\" Epps asked. Shenwas really confused. The one named Katie spoke. \"He's our friend.\" As Katiensaid this she looked down at the crumbling deck. \"Well, whoever he is, we'd betternfind him.\" Epps looked at Katie and smiled. She got a weak smile innreturn. \"Well, let's go!!\" Lynnnproclaimed as she gave the order. Chapter 8: Into the darkness Katie had gone with Lynn as theynsearched the darkest parts of the ship. Epps followed Angelanthroughout the lighter parts of the ship. Angela hated the dark. Itnwas where she died. \"Ummm..if you don't mind menasking, how old are you?\" Angela stopped to answer Epps'snquestion. \"I'm 13. Well, 56 if you countnhow long I've been dead.\" \"But this ship is only 40 yearsnold. How can you be 56?\" Angela hesitated. Could she trust thisnwoman? After all that's happened, Angela had to consider if shencould trust Epps. \"I died 43 years ago. Well, sort ofndied. I died in my dreams, and according to old wives tales, if youndie in your dreams, you die in real life.\" Angela saw the look onnEpps's face and continued. \"At first I didn't believe thenstories. But years passed and I didn't grow a day older. Then, Incame on this ship and…. that's when I knew the stories were true.nI'm still alive but I cannot leave. Half of me is dead but half ofnme is alive, although I can neither be one nor the other. I know, itnis very confusing.\" Epps nodded in agreement. \"You know, all bad people go tonhell, but if you don't help us….good people will be going to hellnas well.\" Epps was confused at this last part. 'What did she mean by that? Is shengiving me clues without getting anyone hurt?' Alex sat in the dark. There was nonway he could contact Katie or Angela. He had to warn Angela beforenshe found him, or Katie before she called for Angela. Either way,nAngela had to stay back or her weakness would be revealed. \"Why are you doing this to us?!\"nAlex screamed into the dark. A cold voice answered. \"Business is business you know. Inneed more souls. Not the pathetic half one, but the whole entity.\" \"Angela is not pathetic!! She andnKatie could kick your ass if they were in trouble!!\" \"Of course, she needs Katie.nUnmarked always stay together. You know why? Because they'renweak!!\" Greer sat at the old piano. In hisnhand was a bottle of wine. He held a picture of his fiancé innthe other hand. \"I knew I should have called yountoday! I'm sorry baby. I'll be home soon.\" He stood. As he wasnwalking away, he heard glass, not breaking, but as if being swept upnafter someone breaks a window. \"What the…\" He turned. Thentables were correcting themselves and the dust was swept away fromnthe floor and tables. The chandelier was being pieced back togethernand flew back to its place on the ceiling. Greer ducked to avoidnbeing cut or crushed. The small table lights flickered and came on.nPeople were clapping. Men appeared and continued clapping. Greernlooked over at the stage. The singer Francesca was standing therenholding the microphone in her hands. She was smiling. Her red dressnsparkled in the bright light. Slowly, she drew near him. Beside hernwas a child, dressed in blue. Katie looked everywhere in thendarkest places of the ship. \"Where could he have taken Alex?\"nKatie asked herself as Lynn looked through another door. \"Don't know, but he isn'tnhere.\" Katie wondered. 'Why would he take Alex? He can't leaventhe ship.' As Katie thought a light went off in her head. \"Angela! He's after Angela!\" \"After Angela? But why would henwant Angela?\" \"Besides you and the others, Angelanis the only one who can leave the ship! Alex is in the only placenAngela would be, where there is light! We have to find her!\" Dodge and Munder were in the kitchen.nOld rusted containers of rat poison lay undisturbed on the counter. \"Wow. Must have been one hell of anrodent problem!\" Dodge said as he opened up a can of beans. \"Are you sure this is safe? It'sn40 years old after all.\" Munder asked with a small look of concernnon his face. \"It's fine. It was sealed allnthis time.\" \"Well, who's going to try itnfirst?\" Dodge held up his hand in a fist. Ro sham bow. Dodge didnpaper and Munder did rock. \"No fair! I don't want to trynthat!\" \"Bone appetite.\" Dodge handed himna fork. \"What about sympathy?\" \"I don't have any sympathy. Eat.\"n Munder scooped up some beans. Slowly he raised it to his mouth. Henate the beans. \"MMM. That's delicious!\" Jack sat on the deck thinking aboutnlife, and death. He pulled the wool blanket up to his shoulders. Thensky was clear. A shooting star passed by. \"Make a wish.\" Chapter 9: Memories part 1 Disclaimer: I don't own \"Ghost Ship\"nBut I do own Angela and Lynn. I also own the name Alex, but not thenoriginal person and name. Angela and Epps walked down the cluttered halls. \"We've been looking everywhere!nHe's not on the ship!\" Epps yelled in frustration. \"He can't leave! Of course he'snon the ship!\" Angela yelled back. \"Well if you know he's on thenship, why the hell haven't we found him yet?\" \"You're asking me? \" \"What dose it look like I'mndoing?\" \"I need to think. If you need me,nI'll be in my room. We passed it two minutes ago.\" Angelandisappeared. Murphy stumbled around the ship.nSantos had died in the explosion, he couldn't find Epps or Lynn,nand he needed a strong drink. A very strong drink. Katie popped up everywhere. She camento he conclusion that Angela was in her room. She was right. Angelanwas sitting on her bed looking at the floor. \"Angela, are you alright?\" Angelanlooked up. \"Katie, you have to show them now.\" Greer had his arms around Francesca.nMusic was softly playing. She stepped away from him. The girl in bluenwatched. \"Wait, where are you going?\" Henfollowed her. She started to unzip the back of her dress. He stillnpursued her. That was enough and she knew it. Carefully she wentnbehind a couple of fallen beams. \"Hey, wait.\" As he said this shenstopped. He took off his thin jacket. He started for her. She wasnstanding in the opening of a doorway. She turned to face oppositenhim. As he went to caress her all he felt was cold air. Greer wasnpushed by someone and fell through Francesca. He plummeted towardsnthe bottom of an empty elevator shaft. After he hit the bottomnFrancesca turned and left without a care in the world. The girlnsmirked. Murphy sat in the captains'nquarters. His head was rested on his hands; a bottle of Brandy ¼nfull was in front of him. The bottle moved across the desk oppositenwhere he was sitting. Murphy sat up faster than you could say \"W\".nAn elderly man lifted the bottle. He poured a glass of the liquor andnhanded it to Murphy. \"Captain.\"nMurphy drank the Brandy. The captain thennhanded him an envelope. Murphy opened it. \"The Lorelei? The Graza wasninvolved?\" \"She wasn't responding to ournradios, we assisted her.\" \"I've heard the stories of thenLorelei. No survivors. They were all proclaimed dead.\" \"Actually there was one survivor.\"nHe then handed Murphy another photograph. Murphy stared in amazement. Epps stood with Katie. \"Here, take this. I want you tonhold onto it for me.\" Katie handed Epps her locket for safekeeping.nEpps headed out to find Murphy. Alex sat in the dark. Henheard a familiar voice. \"They think nothing ofnme What do I think of them? All I can say is I can't Wait for the day Katiencan marry him.' No, no, no. That's a horrible poem! This isnstupid! I want to get off this ship!!! Where the hell could Alexnbe??!!\" It was Angela. He desperately wanted to call to her butndidn't under the circumstances. Angela was in the lobynlooking for Alex on her own. It was fairly light in there so she feltnmoderately comfortable. \"Alex, if you can hearnme, yell at the top of your lungs!\" She got no response. \"Well, he's notnhere.\" She paused. For a moment she thought she heard movementncoming from a small closet. \"Alex?\" Angela movedntowards it. Alex pannicked. 'Shencan't find me!' Angela drew closer. Shenreached her hand out. 'I should get Katie.' She thought tonherself and disappeared. Epps carried anflashlight so she could see where she was going. Out of nowherenMurphy backed into her. \"Murph? Murphy?\" Henturned to face her. Instead of seeing her, he saw Santos, with anknife. He grabbed her shoulders and forced her into the next room. \"Whatnthe hell are you doing?!\" She landed onna chair. He picked up a harpoon gun and tried to hit her with it. \"Murphy!!\" She screamed inndesperation. As he was about to strike the final blow, Jack showednup. He hit Murphy in the face. Murphy crumbled to the floor. \"Oh my god. Are you all rightnEpps?\" She nodded. They dumped Murphy into one of thenplastic aquariums. \"You don't have to lock it,nDodge.\" Epps said \"Epps, he tried to kill you!\" \"Hey, has anyone seen Greer?\"nMunder asked. \"No. I'll go look for him.\"nEpps said as she and Lynn walked off. Angela appeared to find Katie in hernroom. \"Katie, I didn't find Alexnanywhere. You should show them now!\" \"Angela, I don't know if you'llnbelieve me, but Alex is somewhere in the lighter parts of the ship!\" \"He's not. Just tell them!!\"nKatie stepped back. \"You're right. I should tellnthem.\" \"They're coming. I saw them justnnow. They're looking for their friend.\" They both disappeared. Chapter 10: Memories part 2 Katie and Angela stood at the end of a darknhallway. Angela hummed a tune to make herself forget where she was. Epps and Lynn rounded the corner andnsaw the two ghosts. They started towards them. Something caughtnLynn's eye. \"Oh my god, Greer!!\" Greer was atnthe bottom of an elevator shaft. He was on top of four cut cablesnthat pierced through him. \"We want to show you twonsomething.\" Katie came closer to them. She put her hand on Epps whontouched Lynn. Angela held Katie's other hand. Katie and Angela didn't want to seenthis again but Epps and Lynn needed to know what happened 40 yearsnago. They saw the dance floor in the ballroom. Francesca was singingnher song. They saw the kitchen. The original cooks had been murdered.nThe replacements were dumping rat poison in the food and setting thenempty cans on the counter. They saw a family eating. The mother wasnbarfing up a white substance and the teenage son's ear wasnbleeding. Screams could be heard. They saw the dance floor on thendeck. Katie was dancing while Angela watched. The lights were pulledndown and the wire cut across the dancers. \"Katie!!!\" Angela screamed.nEveryone except Katie and the captain fell to the floor. Katie lookednup and saw the captain's face. He fell to the floor as well. \"AAAAAHHHHH!!!!\" The two girlsnscreamed. Angela jumped over the bodies towards Katie. She grabbednKatie's hand and dragged her off of the dance floor and into thenhallway. \"Katie, you have to hide!\"nAngela's voice sounded distant. There were other people in thenhallway. All were screaming. Angela pushed through the crowd draggingnKatie behind her. Katie's face was drenched in tears and spatterednwith blood. Suddenly Katie stopped. Angela looked in the directionnKatie was indicating. There, Alex was held by two men dressed innblue-gray uniforms. One shot Alex in the head. They started afternKatie and Angela. \"Run!!\" Angela yelled at Katie.nEveryone watched as Katie ran followed by Angela and four men. One ofnthe men grabbed Angela's dress. It caused her to trip. Katienstarted to double back to help her. \"No, keep running!!\" It was toonlate. Two men grabbed Katie and two grabbed Angela. It flashed back to the kitchen. Mennbrought in boxes and dumped the contents on the counter. Inside, werenguns and knives. Once again they saw Angela and Katie.nAngela kicked and screamed. Katie pleaded for mercy as tears streamedndown her face. The men took them to their rooms. The girls reachednfor each other, but failed. They stood unnoticed in Angela's room.nThey saw the men throw her on the bed. A man with red hair restrainednher. The other took out a knife. \"Shut up! Your friend's probablyndead by now!\" He raised the knife and went to strike. The knifenwent through Angela. She was in her ghost like state. \"How?\" Was all she said beforenshe used it to her advantage. Angela ran out of the room and intonKatie's. There, she saw Katie being carried to her closet. \"Katie!! Let her go!!\" Angelanyelled. No use. She charged at them but she was still a ghost. \"Katie, hold on!!\" Angela wasnloosing at the game, \"beat the clock\". She finally got back tonher old self just as they hung Katie. \"You bastards!! She's just anchild!!\" Angela yelled as she tried to help the struggling Katie.nThe two men grabbed her arms and took her to the other side of thenroom to watch Katie die. \"Do you want to die like that, orndo you want to get shot?\" Angela went pale as Katie's limp bodynhung there. \"Neither.\" Angela disappeared. They saw the pool hall. People werenbeing lined up along the side of the pool. Shots rang out followed bynscreams. Bodies sank into the red water and fell to the ground. Men scrambled into the room Epps hadnfound the gold in earlier. The door blew open. Crowbars went to worknprying open the crates. A man in white held up a bar of the gold.nThey cheered. Francesca walked up in her seductive way. The man innwhite came out of the room to meet her. He set the bar on the carnnext to him. He readied his gun and she smiled. Shots penetrated thenother men until none stood. He turned back to see a gun pointed atnhim. Francesca shot him in the chest at least 3 times. Epps and Lynn gasped. Angela turnednto look at Katie instead of watching the horrific scene. Francesca turned to see a man in antuxedo. She tossed the gun behind her. He came up to her and kissednher. Casually he backed away. She stood there puzzled. A hook camenand hit Francesca in the face. It lifted her off the ground. When shenstopped swinging he took off the glove from her right hand andnpressed his against it. After a second he looked at her hand. On itnwas a mark, burned into her flesh. He turned away from Francesca andnEpps saw his face. It was Jack Ferriman. They came out of the memory. Epps rannto where Murphy was. It took her about three minutes. Murphy hadndrowned. The tank was full of water. Chapter 11: Daddies little girl Disclaimer: Please don't sue me! Inneed the series of events to introduce everything! Please don'tnsue! Dodge and Munder had rigged up pumps to get thenwater out of the engine room. One of the hoses shriveled. \"Damn! Who's going to fix it?\"nMunder said. Dodge made the sign for row sham bow. Dodge did rock andnMunder did scissors. \"Shit.\" Munder got his divingnsuit on and went into the water. \"Hey, I'm going to take the wheelnok? Just come up when you're done.\" \"Yeah, yeah.\" Munder swam tonwhere they had patched the ship. That's where the hose was placed. Epps went towards the helm room wherenshe met Dodge. \"Murphy's dead! He drowned in thentank!\" \"What?\" \"That's why he had us fix hisnfucking ship! So he wouldn't lose it and everything else he needs!\" \"Whoa, what are you talking about?\"nJack walked in. \"I saw Murphy. What's going onnEpps?\" \"We don't know.\" Lynn answered.nShe had come in with Jack. \"Lynn and I will get Munder. Jack,nyou stay here with Dodge.\" Epps handed Dodge a gun. \"Take this.\" \"Katie, I think I know where Alexnis.\" Angela said as she led the way into the lobby. \"You found him?\" \"Possibly, in that closet.\" Katienwent towards it. The door swung open. Alex was in the corner of thendark closet. He crawled out. \"Thanks. It's bigger in therenthan you think!\" He looked at Katie and kissed her. Angela sighed. \"We can tell Epps and Lynn we foundnyou.\" Angela said. They started for the engine room. Epps and Lynn entered the waternfilled room. \"Munder?\" Epps asked to no one innparticular. Lynn looked into the water. \"Epps, he's dead.\" Munder'snmotionless body floated in the water. Dodge steered the ship past thenlittle islands they were trying to avoid. \"I'm going to go check on Epps.\"nJack started for the door. \"No, you're not. Wait.\" Jacknturned his back to Dodge. \"You're pathetic. You listen tonEpps as if you were a puppy. Pathetic.\" He turned to face Dodge.nHis monotone voice was cold and heartless. \"I can make your dreamsna reality if you'll step out of my way. You do understand, right? Incan give you anything if you just move!\" His voice became morenhostile. Dodge readied the gun. \"Die if you want to but you'venbeen warned. Now move!\" Jack leapt at Dodge and started squeezingnhis throat. Dodge fired and Jack fell to the floor. Dodge hurried tonfind Epps and Lynn. Epps had armed the c-4 by the timenthe three ghosts had arrived. \"What are you doing?\" Angelanasked Epps as she armed the explosives. \"I'm freeing you! Angela, stay innyour ghost form!\" Dodge slid down the ladder. \"Epps, Jack's dead. I shot himnmyself.\" \"Don't get too cocky.\" Lynnnsaid as she prepared herself for the explosion. \"Are you blowing up the ship?!\"nDodge asked as if he already knew the answer. \"Yup.\" Epps replied. \"But you can't! We'll die!\" \"We'll die anyway if we stay!\"nLynn yelled at him. \"I can't let you kill us all!\"nDodge took a step forward. Epps put her finger on the trigger. \"Fine! Kill us!\" Dodge yelled. \"Dodge, why haven't you asked usnwhere Greer and Munder are?\" Lynn asked. Dodge snickered. \"I already know where they are.\"nThe voice they heard was cold. Instead of Dodge standing in front ofnthem, it was Jack. Angela moved towards him. \"Angela, get away! That man is….\"nEpps started. \"That man…. Is mynfather.\" She turned back to Jack. \"You disgust me! I thought we were going on vacation! Mother and I would catch up withnyou when you were done with business, but no! You had to kill thenpassengers on the Graza too, didn't you?! You killed my only friendnand mother! I could kill you for that!\" \"Let it all out. Give in. You can't kill me.\" \"Wait, mother?\" Katie asked. \"Francesca was my mother. I havenher hair, eyes, and ability to make people think what I want them tonthink. Of course my weakness happens to be helping people in need atnany cost. I did try to save you, Katie.\" Jack put his arm aroundnAngela. \"You should have possessed me when you had the chance.\"nShe looked at Katie and the two made an unsaid agreement. Angelanturned to face her father. \"Dad…\" She jumped on him andnhad him pinned. \"Blow it up!\" Katie screamed asnJack forced Angela off of him. Epps did it. The ships interior blewnup just as they had planed it. Katie grabbed Epps and guided her tonan exit into the cold water. Alex followed with Lynn. The Graza rosento a horizontal position. Epps and Lynn swam towards the top of thenwater. They saw all of the ghosts swimming with them and thennvanishing. The last they saw of Alex and Katie was almost to thensurface, they had been kissing. The two women finally got to breathnin all the air they needed. Lynn got on an old suitcase and Epps wasnon a door that had been torn off one of the rooms. They watched asnthe Graza sank and continued to float in the water. Hours passed andnthen…. HONK!!!HONK!!! They looked up to seena life guard ship. The name read 'Anita Zavalla'. They were taken aboard and given thentreatment they needed. When they returned to the mainland twonambulances were waiting. Epps was in one and Lynn was in the other.nBefore the doors closed, the two saw men carrying crates. They werendressed in white uniforms. At least 4 crates were carried up beforenthey saw Jack. He was followed closely by Angela. He was dressed innthe same thing he was wearing when they met and Angela was wearingntennis shoes, jeans, a sweatshirt, and her hair was in a braid. Shengave a small smirk as she boarded the 'Castro'. \"Stop him!!! Stop her!!!\" Eppsnand Lynn yelled as they shut the doors to the ambulances. Angela gavena small wave as the ambulances sped off. \"Same 'old same 'old?\" \"That's right. You are daddiesnlittle girl.\" Angela boarded the cruise liner. 'Sorry Katie. I'mnworking with my father now. Forever and always, unfortunately.' Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Well, that's the end. I'llnprobably do a continuation as another story in Angela's POV. C U L8TER!!!! By the way, Anita Zavalla graduatednfrom El Molino with my mom. A week afterwards, she died. The shipnthat rescued Epps and Lynn is dedicated to her. She never got to takenher graduation picture but because of the ship she is portrayed as anlifesaver. May she rest in peace. ","Summary":" Ship of Nightmares Chapter 1: Before Katie watched her fellow shipmates as they danced to the sweet"},{"Movie":"Jumanji","Title":"Seaplane","Author":"Joseph Laban","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12796273","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A tribute to my favourite character in Jumanji WTTJ: Seaplane McDonough. I still haven't gotten over how cool his Nick-name is. 16-year-old Alex Vreeke was awoken in the middle of the night by a green flash in his bedroom. He could have sworn that he heard drum beats coming from that box on his cabinet labelled 'Jumanji'. He opened the box to find it empty save for a single video game cartridge. That was odd. He knew that there had been a board game there when he opened the box that afternoon. Curiously, he plugged the cartridge into his console to see what it was about. After a brief opening message about wanting to leave one's world behind, a character select menu appeared on the screen. Alex saw that there were five different playable characters to choose from. After thinking for a moment, he decided to select the one at the top of the screen: Jefferson \"Seaplane\" McDonough, pilot and rascal. That sounded cool and looked like it would suit him well. \"Welcome to Jumanji!\" chirped the game's narrator. Alex pressed start, and immediately drum beats began to play loudly in his room. A green light on his console shone brightly, and slowly, bit by bit, Alex felt that he was being sucked into the game. \"What's happening?!\" he cried, as he suddenly felt he was falling, crashing through branches and leaves. Then as soon as it had started, it was over. Alex found himself in the midst of a thick jungle. Looking at himself, he realised that his outfit had changed into that of a pilot adventurer. He also saw that the name tag on his new leather jacket read \"Seaplane\". As he ran to the river to catch a glimpse of his reflection, he realised he was in another man's body - that of Seaplane McDonough. He saw a hippo emerging from the water, and began running in the opposite direction. He had not run far before a man pulled up in front of him in a Jeep. The vehicle's door opened, and the driver introduced himself as Nigel Billingsley. Alex got in, and Nigel began explaining the backstory of Jumanji to him. Nigel informed him that he, Seaplane, was here to assist \"Dr. Bravestone and his associates\" in their quest, and that he must be ready to help them when they arrived. At the end of their ride, Nigel gave Alex the Jaguar's Eye and wished him Godspeed. He handed him a map of Jumanji, told him to go to the bazaar and gave him instructions on how to finish the game. As Nigel drove away, Alex found himself on a vast open plain. Opening the map, he saw that it was blank. For a moment, he wondered if it was a glitch in the game, but he soon recalled that there was a cartographer in the game's character select menu. Alex cursed. He suspected that only the cartographer had the ability to read the map, which meant that he was lost. He barely had time to appreciate the gorgeous scenery around him before the ominous Jumanji drums sounded again, and he had to flee from mercenaries on motorcycles. Fortunately, he was able to lose them by running into the jungle and jumping into a waterfall. After emerging from the waterfall, Alex decided to move towards higher ground. As a trained pilot, he was able to navigate using the sun and the stars; but without a map, he spent several days wandering around the island before he finally found the bazaar. At the bazaar, an NPC with the appearance of a young boy led him into a small rotunda, wherein was a basket containing his next clue. As soon as Alex entered the rotunda, the Jumanji drums sounded for the third time. Opening the basket, Alex was freaked to see a snake emerge from it. He ran screaming out of the rotunda, knocking over the basket in the process, and ended up taking refuge atop one of the bazaar tables. A nearby incense vendor explained to Alex that the snake was a black mamba, one of the deadliest creatures in existence. He also told him it was safe to go back into the rotunda - the snake was gone. Tentatively, Alex ventured back inside. He found his clue lying on the floor: a small elephant token wrapped with a note which read, 'When you see me, begin the climb.' Unfortunately, he had been found by Van Pelt's patrolling pet vulture, and Van Pelt soon arrived at the bazaar with his minions. Seeing them, Alex turned tail and ran. He managed to delay his pursuers a little bit by overturning tables and causing a ruckus as he fled. Suddenly, Alex spotted a manhole in the ground, removed its covering and climbed down into it. Unfortunately, the minions had seen him, and they followed him down into the sewer. Alex hid in the darkness, praying that they would leave. Suddenly, he heard loud, bloodcurdling screams coming from elsewhere in the maze of tunnels. A minion passed by Alex's hiding place, and Alex quickly knocked him out, stealing his weapons and supplies. Moving on, Alex saw two dead mercenaries pinned to the end of a corridor by spears. After plundering them too, he took care to avoid the flying spears. Later, he found another corridor littered by the sliced-up bodies of more dead henchmen. After a few seconds of observation, Alex deduced that sharp blades would spring out of the walls along the white bricks on the floor, and he navigated through the trap with ease. After passing by the blades, Alex encountered a watery pit of crocodiles. He fed a minion's corpse to the crocodiles, and found a wooden plank long enough to cross the pit with. Alex supposed that the video game always provided a way to solve its puzzles. Pressing on ahead, he found a door which opened to the jungle. Trekking through the jungle, Alex was distracted by birdsong. Looking up, he saw an abandoned treehouse, which was now inhabited by birds. He thought it was a curiosity, but decided to move on. He eventually saw a large shed in the distance, and supposed that was his next stop. Upon a closer look, he realised it was being guarded by two NPCs. Alex decided to wait until nightfall before sneaking towards the shed. Under the cover of darkness, Alex crept past the guards and killed them with a single shot from his stolen pistol. With the guards taken care of, he broke into the shed. Inside, Alex saw that the shed was filled with various vehicles, including motorcycles, cars, a bus, a plane and a helicopter. As it was dark outside, he chose to take a hot air balloon, hoping that the fire would provide him some light with which to see. He dragged it out of the shed and lit it up. Suddenly, a strong gust of wind came, and the balloon caught fire. Panicking, Alex tried to turn the leaking gas supply off, but it was too late. The hot air balloon exploded in a brilliant conflagration. To Alex's surprise, he respawned at daybreak, not too far away from the shed. Examining his wrist tattoo, he saw that it now consisted of only two bars where there once were three, and realised that he had two lives left with which to finish the game. He decided that he must make the canyon crossing in the daytime, and choose another vehicle with which to do so. Alex tried to advance towards the shed, but the guards spotted him and began firing at him. He took off running and barely escaped with his life. He realised that he had no choice but to wait for the guards to leave. In the meantime, Alex decided to return to the treehouse. He cleaned the place up and made himself comfortable there. He noticed Alan Parrish's name carved into a plank, and guessed that he must be the treehouse's builder. Feeling hot and sweaty, Alex went to take a bath in a nearby river. While bathing, he accidentally tapped his left pec and summoned his blue character stats menu. He learned that his strengths were piloting and margarita-making, while his weaknesses were women and mosquitos. Horrified, Alex quickly returned to the bazaar in order to buy some citronella candles for the treehouse. In a stroke of good fortune, the incense vendor allowed him to have them for free. Encouraged, Alex decided to celebrate, and purchased some groceries, a blender and an electric generator from the nearby stalls. Back at the treehouse, he made himself his first margarita and commended himself for his skill. Three weeks later, Alex saw that the guards had finally left. Seizing his opportunity, he snuck into the shed and narrowed down his transportation choices to a plane and a helicopter. Because his name was Seaplane, he decided to go with the plane. He took off successfully and flew away over the canyon in broad daylight, feeling optimistic. Suddenly, the Jumanji drums sounded again, and a couple of fighter jets piloted by orangutans appeared behind him. Desperately, Alex tried to manoeuvre his aircraft, but the merciless orangutans shot his starboard wing off. He screamed as he spiralled out of control and crashed, the mocking hoots of the orangutans ringing in his ears. Alex respawned near the shed once more. He saw that he had just one life bar left, and he was overcome by dread. For the first time, he realised just how immensely difficult the game really was, and he knew that he could not afford to make another fatal mistake. In fear, Alex hurried back to the safety of his treehouse. Once there, he made himself a margarita to help him calm down. While drinking, he took the Jaguar's Eye out of his pocket and looked at it. He remembered the other four characters mentioned by Nigel and the character select screen - Bravestone, Finbar, Oberon and Roundhouse. He wondered if he would feel better if he had been playing this game with friends, instead of by himself. Alex suddenly understood that unless he could somehow complete the game by himself, he was stuck there forever, and the jewel would never be returned to its destination. With just one life remaining, it would take a miracle for him to be able to do it now. He thought back to the night he started playing, and wished that someone had warned him about this game. He began to miss his home and his parents, and suddenly realised that he might never see them again. At the thought of all this, Alex burst into tears. He was all alone, trapped in a strange land with no hope of rescue and no realistic chance of getting out alive. In his despair, he vainly tried to drown his sorrows in his margaritas. Months passed by, and Alex resigned himself to his fate in Jumanji. One day, he woke up and went about his daily errands as usual. He opened the locked chest where he kept the Jaguar's Eye and his weapons, and took out his guns to go hunting. After an hour, he returned with a small deer. However, when he went to return his weapons to the chest, he was shocked to see that the Jaguar's Eye had disappeared. For a brief moment, he panicked and wondered if some animal or even Van Pelt had stolen it. He heard bikers roaring through the jungle below him, and hid himself so as not to be seen by them. He overheard their shouts, and was able to make out the words \"Bravestone!\" and \"Find them!\" Alex thought about it for a moment, hope rising within him. Bravestone? Find them? Could more players possibly have joined the game? If so, the game must have sent the gem back to Nigel so that he could give it to them… Excitedly, Alex rearmed himself and descended from his treehouse. If there were indeed new players in the game, he was sure he would run into them at the bazaar. Alex donned a bandana mask and snuck back to the bazaar. When he arrived, he heard a commotion, and peeked around the corner to see what was going on. He was amazed to see a strong hulking man punching Van Pelt's minions sky-high. Alex wondered if this man was a player, and how many others there were with him. Suddenly, Van Pelt himself arrived at the bazaar and the fight came to an abrupt halt. From his vantage point, Alex was able to identify the new players for the first time because they were all standing together in a group: The hulk, a short black man with a backpack, a really fly redhead in a crop top and shorts, and a fat bearded man in a pith helmet. No way! thought Alex. Could that really be all of them? Yeah! he realised a moment later. It was totally the remaining quartet from the character select screen! Somehow, they had all joined him in the game at last. The four newcomers were standing there in fear, unsure of what to do. Alex heard Van Pelt address the hulk as Dr. Bravestone, and he suddenly realised why Nigel always spoke of Bravestone as if he were the main character - because he was. \"We just want to go home,\" Dr. Bravestone said, in an uncharacteristically timid tone for a man his size. Van Pelt's minions cocked their guns to fire, and Alex realised he needed to act now . Alex took out a smoke grenade, pulled the pin, and threw it into the midst of his newfound companions. His solitary existence in the game was over. Please leave a review![Chapter 2] The helicopter scene from Alex's perspective. Alex was conflicted. He was in the Transportation Shed once again, this time with his new friends Spencer, Fridge, Martha and Bethany (who was stuck in a man's body despite being a gir - correction, woman ). Even though he had already told them that he wasn't a good pilot, the four newcomers seemed to be eagerly expecting him to know which vehicle to take; and worse still, to actually fly them to the Jaguar Statue! Martha bounded into the room, full of excitement after having single-handedly defeated the NPC guards. The others rushed to congratulate her. Good for her, and good for them, Alex thought. Every one of them still had two lives apiece, and he wished he still had that luxury and their confidence, to boot. However, Fridge did not seem as joyous as the others. Apparently, he had spotted the \"motorcycle freaks\" coming for them, and was telling everyone that they needed to leave right away. Alex knew what was coming next, and he wished he were anywhere else at that moment. \"Seaplane!\" Fridge called him, pointing to the helicopter. \"We need to fly, man!\" \"Nope!\" Alex replied dismissively. \"I can't do it. I told you, I'm not a good pilot!\" He looked about anxiously, and spotted another large vehicle nearby. \"Maybe we should take the school bus!\" he said, gesturing to it. Alex knew he was grasping at straws, but the last thing he wanted to do was to fly an aircraft again. \"But, we can't outrun no motorcycles with a d*mn bus!\" cried Fridge indignantly. \"You picked the plane and the hot air balloon,\" Bethany interjected. \"Maybe you were supposed to pick the helicopter!\" \"No, I can't do it, okay?\" Alex insisted. \" I don't wanna die! \" There was a brief silence from the four newbies. They almost couldn't believe such lack of courage and confidence from their rescuer. \"I'm freaking out, a little bit,\" Alex fibbed. In reality, he was absolutely terrified. \"Fine!\" barked Fridge drunkenly. \" I'll do it. How hard could it be, it's a helicopter!\" He then proceeded to give an overly-simplistic and totally inaccurate description of how to fly a helicopter; and Alex, having Seaplane's knowledge of flight, was fully aware of this. However, even the need to save the team from being killed by Fridge's horrendous piloting wasn't enough to coax the old aviator out of retirement. \"Alex,\" said Martha finally, \"if I can fight those guys, you can fly this helicopter, I know you can. Come on !\" Alex paused to look at her. She reminded him so much of his old gym teacher, who always used to encourage him in sports when he didn't feel like it. \"Alex,\" she said again, more persuasive this time; \" this is where we need you. \" \"Remember, you're the missing piece,\" Bethany chimed in. Alex looked at them for a long while, their words sinking in. This really was about them , he thought, not about him. He had been wrong. Up to this moment, he had been so self-absorbed, so concerned about his own safety that he had failed to take the needs of the other players into account. He had been playing Jumanji for twenty years , he now knew; but during all that time, he had never needed to look out for anyone but himself. But he was no longer alone. Providence had sent him four new teammates, and he was a part of their team, rather than them being part of his. Which meant that it was his duty to put the needs and interests of the Team, first . And right now, the Team's greatest need was for a pilot to get behind the controls of a helicopter and fly them all to safety! Slowly, Alex nodded in agreement, and broke into a smile for the first time in a quarter hour. \" Seaplane McDonough, reporting for duty, \" he said, putting on a pair of cool shades. \" Let's go, people! \" His four teammates cheered, and all the players trooped into the waiting helicopter together. Alex climbed into the helicopter's cockpit, while the others filled the passengers' seats. Tapping into Seaplane's flight expertise, he skilfully ran a blitz pre-flight check and started up the engine. The shed rumbled and shook from the draft of the aircraft's whirling rotor blades. Alex pushed the stick forward, and the helicopter burst out of the shed into the open air. Gunfire and rockets from the motorcycle mercenaries whizzed past them, but Alex did not care. He had to get his teammates safely to the other side of the canyon; he just had to! Suddenly, he heard a clang somewhere above him, and the helicopter controls jammed in his hands. The aircraft began to lose altitude, and Alex started to worry. He took off his sunglasses and quickly tried to figure out what had happened. \"What's wrong?\" Bethany asked him with concern. \"Something's broken!\" he cried. \"What!\" shouted Spencer. \"What do you mean?\" cried Martha with horror. \" Hang on! \" Alex told them, as the helicopter blades began to chew up the foliage around them. They were in serious trouble. Again . The rotors made contact with a tall coconut tree, and the helicopter started spiraling out of control into the canyon. The passengers screamed. \"Oh my God, we're about to die, we're about to DIEEE !\" Fridge yelled in terror. Alex barely heard any of it. He was strangely calm and in \"the zone\". All he could hear in his head was dialogue from the 1995 film 'Toy Story': \" Buzz! This is the part where we blow up!\" \" Not today !\" Purely on instinct, hardly thinking, Alex pulled and wrestled with the controls. Pull up , he said inwardly as he willed the aircraft to rise, pull up! Almost obediently, the helicopter began to stabilise and come out of its spin. Sure, they were still losing height rapidly, but at least they were roughly flying forwards again. Alex gave the controls a final mighty pull, and thankfully, the aircraft leveled out at a few feet above the bottom of the canyon. \"Oh my God!\" Martha wailed in fear. \"It won't go up!\" cried Alex desperately. \"What do you mean?\" asked Martha frantically. \"The collective is busted!\" Alex told them. \"What?\" called Spencer. \"It controls a plate up there, which tilts the rotors and controls the pitch. It's how we go up and down,\" Alex explained quickly, drawing from Seaplane's comprehensive knowledge of aircraft. Helplessly, the helicopter kept on flying a few feet above the canyon floor, unable to climb to a higher altitude. Suddenly, the dreaded Jumanji drums sounded again. \"Guys?\" asked Bethany worriedly. \"That can't be good!\" Martha declared. \"There's no way that's good news!\" Fridge agreed. The five heard loud thundering noises behind them, and Fridge was struck with horror when he saw what was causing it. \"Albino rhinos!\" he shouted. \"They're indigenous to Jumanji. They're huge, white, scary and stupid and they eat people!\" \"No!\" Bethany moaned in despair. At another time, the other four would have been amazed to listen to Fridge spout useful facts about jungle animals. But in a hairy situation like this, such information did little to comfort them. Desperately, Alex tried his best to manoeuvre the helicopter around the tight bends of the canyon. He was so busy trying to make sure they did not crash, that he had little time to listen to what his passengers were saying. \"My stomach is starting to bother me a little bit,\" said Fridge drunkenly. \"I think I had too many margaritas.\" \"Go up!\" Martha cried. \"I can't go up!\" said Alex again. \"You guys, what are we gonna do?\" asked Bethany fearfully. \"I'm gonna fix the helicopter!\" said Spencer at last, with resolve in his voice. \" Yes! \" Bethany rejoiced. \"Tell me what to do!\" he told Alex. \"Okay,\" Alex replied. \"You've gotta connect the flight control rod to the swashplate under the rotors!\" he instructed. \"Flight control rod - swashplate - under the rotors,\" Spencer repeated to himself. \"I'll be right back!\" he told the others. \"What?\" Martha asked in confused horror. \"Spencer, where are you going ?!\" she cried as she watched Spencer climb out onto the side of the helicopter. \"Hurry up!\" Fridge urged him. \"Be careful!\" Martha pleaded anxiously. \"No, no!\" contradicted Fridge. \"Just hurry up!\" Alex tried to keep the helicopter flying on a straight and level path. This was by far the most intense situation he had ever been in, and it seemed to become more challenging with every passing minute. He tried not to think about the fact that he was on his last life, or that failure here would result in the deaths of not just himself, but of his teammates as well. Every fibre of his being was focused on keeping the helicopter in the air for another second more. Meanwhile, Spencer was outside the aircraft, trying to fix the damage and help them ascend. Alex prayed that the Doctor would be able to restore the helicopter's flight capabilities quickly, for he was not sure how much longer he could keep the fancy flying up. Suddenly, the helicopter jerked to the side. The rhinos had caught up to them! Alex struggled to keep the aircraft steady. He heard Fridge and Martha screaming behind him, and he increased their flight speed by a tiny fraction in an effort to outrun the rhinos. The tactic seemed to work for a few seconds, but then a new problem literally appeared in front of them: A wall of rock lay a few hundred yards directly ahead, making the canyon a dead end. \" Spencer! \" called Martha, desperately trying to alert him to the danger. \"Hurry! Come on, fix it! \" With the dead end approaching fast, Alex had no choice but to slow the helicopter down in order to buy Spencer more time. This left the aircraft's tail at the mercy of the stampeding rhinos behind them, and the vicious beasts did not hesitate to butt the helicopter with their horns. This was a crisis. Alex's piloting skills were being tested to their very limits, and he was close to the breaking point. The aircraft was being battered repeatedly from behind, a wall of doom up ahead was coming closer and closer towards them, his passengers were screaming in terror, and Spencer still hadn't fixed the damage to the helicopter! This was it. It was now or never. They needed to pull up now or they would crash into the wall in a matter of seconds. \" We're running out of time here, Spencer! \" Alex cried out to his teammate frantically. His prayer was answered. There was a * click* below the rotors, and Alex heard Spencer's voice call out, \" Got it! \" Without wasting a second, Alex pulled up on the controls, and miraculously, the helicopter responded perfectly this time. Before anyone knew it, they were going up, up, up and away from the rhinos, the canyon and that dreadful place. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. They were okay! \"We made it!\" Bethany exclaimed joyfully. \"You did it!\" she said to Spencer. \"I thought we were gonna die. Yes! \" she whooped. \" Nice! \" called Alex, with the biggest smile he had had in years. \"Thank you,\" gasped Spencer, as relieved as everyone else to be alive. \"That was scary!\" laughed Martha. \"Whoops,\" said Fridge. Everyone turned to the zoologist. \"What?\" asked Spencer. \"I dropped the jewel,\" Fridge admitted sheepishly. \" WHAT?! \" cried Alex, Spencer, Bethany and Martha in unison. \"You dropped the jewel?!\" Bethany screamed. \"I leaned over, thought I had to puke and I didn't, and it came out of my backpack,\" Fridge explained. Martha facepalmed. Spencer and Alex groaned. \" We need the freaking jewel! \" Bethany shouted. \"I know,\" said Fridge lamely. \"That's, that's, that's the crazy part and I know we need it, so now we're in a pickle, we're in a pickle.\" \"Alex, turn around; we gotta go back and get it,\" sighed Spencer. \"Yeah, let's just loop around,\" said Fridge. \"Just look for it, guys! Everybody open your eyes. Let's all just look for it as a group.\" Reluctantly, Alex turned the helicopter around and headed back down into the canyon. Everyone kept their eyes peeled for any sign of the green gem. Bethany was the first to spot it. In reality, it wasn't that difficult to do, as the rhinos were all circumambulating the Eye as if it was a holy object. \"What are they doing?\" Martha asked. \"It's like they're protecting it, or something,\" Spencer remarked. Retrieving the gem from the midst of the rhinos would not be an easy task. \"Alright, how are we gonna do this?\" asked Alex, as he lowered the helicopter to give everyone a closer look. \"I don't know,\" Spencer replied, a look of concern creasing his brow. \"We've gotta go get it, right, buddy?\" Fridge asked him, with some chutzpah. \"What do you need? Do you need your boomerang? Maybe...maybe some scissors? A pipe wrench? Some shoelaces? I'm your valet. Whatever you need, I can get it for you, okay? You just say you want it.\" Spencer was giving Fridge a funny look. \"What?\" asked Fridge in puzzlement. \"I'm sorry, buddy!\" said Spencer regretfully. \"Sorry for what?\" asked Fridge. He didn't have time to say another word before Spencer hurled him out of the helicopter. Bethany gasped. But Alex understood; Spencer was using Fridge as bait in order to draw the rhinos' attention away from the jewel. Sure enough, the rhinos soon abandoned the jewel and went stampeding after the poor zoologist. Alex flew over them to where the Eye was, and dropped Spencer off to collect it safely. Having retrieved the McGuffin, Spencer threw it to Martha and climbed back into the helicopter. \"Turn us around!\" Spencer ordered, and Alex obliged. He flew the helicopter down the canyon in the same direction that the rhinos were travelling in. Of course, Fridge had been trampled to death by the beasts already, so Alex was wondering how exactly they were going to pick him up as he respawned. Suddenly, Spencer said, \"Alex, get ready to roll us to the side!\" \"What?!\" Alex asked. That was an odd move to make while flying in a helicopter. Just then, the chime of Fridge respawning sounded overhead, and Alex understood. They wouldn't need to land after all. \"When I tell you, roll 90 degrees to the right!\" Spencer instructed. There was a brief pause, and then Spencer shouted, \" Now! \" Alex rolled the helicopter onto its side, and Fridge fell straight down through its open left door. Spencer caught him on his way out, and the zoologist was left dangling by Spencer's arm out the helicopter's open right door. \"You pushed me out of the helicopter, jack*ss!\" Fridge shouted angrily. Nobody else was mad. They were all just too happy to have the jewel, a fully-functioning helicopter, and an open sky leading to freedom. Spencer returned Fridge to his seat, and Alex was free to pilot the aircraft leisurely at last. Glancing out of the helicopter's side window, Alex suddenly spotted a particular feature of the aircraft that he hadn't noticed before. Recalling what had just happened to Fridge, as well as his special 'backpack power', Alex realised something that made him facepalm. Why didn't we just shoot the rhinos?[Chapter 3] Bethany saves Alex's life. Alex landed the helicopter in a clearing atop a small hill as its fuel supply reached zero. He couldn't believe it - he had actually passed the canyon level at last. Behind him, Spencer, Martha and Bethany were whooping with joy at their success. The girls were fawning over Spencer and his incredible feat of fixing the helicopter in flight. \"Aw, thank you,\" said Spencer modestly, \"but he was amazing,\" he insisted, pointing at Alex. \"Our pilot - you killed it!\" he declared. Alex was having none of it. After all, he was only a pilot, but Spencer was the action hero. He joined the girls in showering praise upon the man-mountain. Their game of praise ping-pong was suddenly interrupted by Fridge. \"Excuse me?\" exclaimed the tiny man indignantly. \" Excuse me! I'm the one who was a human sacrifice!\" The zoologist blabbered on about how it had felt like to be trampled by rhinos, but Alex wasn't paying attention. He was just too happy to finally see the other side of that confounded canyon. He removed his leather jacket to celebrate, and took a moment to appreciate the lush scenery all around him. It was a sight he had never expected to see in two decades. He turned towards his four new friends. He would never have made it here without them, and he wanted them to know how much it meant to him. \"Guys, I've been trying to get across this canyon for like, twenty years,\" he cried. \"Do you realise how huge this is?\" Just then, Alex heard a familiar buzzing noise around his neck, and instinctively slapped it against his nape. It took him a second to process what had happened, but then it became terrifyingly clear. \"Mosquito!\" he gasped in horror. He didn't have time to say another word before his world went black. The next thing he knew, he was awake and gasping for air. He opened his eyes to see bright sunshine above him, blue sky, and Martha. Wait, Martha ? Alex's confused mind tried to make sense of what he was seeing. He got bitten by a mosquito, which meant that he was dead. If he was dead, this must be the afterlife. But if this was the afterlife, why was Martha , of all people, here with him? Shouldn't she be back in Jumanji with the others? Alex tried to sit up, and realised that Martha was not alone. He glimpsed Spencer and Fridge standing nearby, and realised that this was no afterlife - he was still in Jumanji. He was still alive and playing in Jumanji. How? \"What happened?\" he asked Martha in bewilderment. \"Alex,\" Martha told him breathlessly, \"Bethany gave you one of her lives.\" Alex couldn't believe his ears. With Martha's help, he picked himself up off the ground, and turned around to see Bethany lying beside him, exhausted. \"Bethany, are you okay?\" he heard Spencer ask her. \"I think so,\" she replied. \"Bethany, is that true?\" he asked her in amazement, helping her off the ground as well. \"You gave me one of your lives?\" Bethany gave a dismissive shake of her head, telling him not to bother about it. \"I mean, yeah, of course,\" she replied with a silly smile. \" Thank you! \" Alex exclaimed, wrapping his arms around her. She had literally brought him back from the dead, sacrificing one of her lives to do so. He did not know how he could thank her enough. In that moment, a childhood memory from Sunday School came back to Alex. In it, his teacher was telling the class the story of Jesus Christ raising Lazarus from the dead. He suddenly remembered the name of the location where the story took place - the village of Bethany . Alex laughed. He supposed that Bethany was truly well-named, and that her heroic action had just made him Lazarus. He had never expected to see the light of life again, but this brave girl had given him another chance to continue playing. He vowed to find a way to repay her someday. How many lives did each of them have now? Bethany now had one since she donated her second life to him, Fridge had one after being sacrificed to the rhinos, while Spencer and Martha both had two each. Which meant that three of them now had to be extra careful and not lose any more lives if they wanted to get out of the game alive. Still, Alex had hope. After all, he had managed to pilot the helicopter safely through gunfire and the canyon (twice!) with just one life remaining. But he hadn't done it alone. They had managed to pull through because Spencer had been present to fix the helicopter. Alex realised that if he had attempted the chopper flight alone, it would likely have resulted in failure for him once more. Together , he told himself. Only together did they stand any chance of beating the game. His mistake had been to try and go it alone, and he had lost two lives in the canyon as a result. But things were different now - he now had four real friends in the game with him, and they needed his help as much as he needed theirs. He supposed that with the right amount of skill and luck, there was a good chance that all of them could actually win and go home together. Alex joined the others as they all trekked towards the river to find drinking water. It would be a while before they found the next stage of their mission, and he was determined to enjoy the break while it lasted.[Chapter 4] Alex returns home. Alex came to himself in the midst of darkness. It took him a moment to realise that he was back in his own bedroom, in the real world. He looked down, and saw that he was dressed in the same pyjamas he had worn when he left. How long had he been gone? Spencer, Fridge and Bethany had told him that he had disappeared from his home for twenty years. But if two decades had gone by, why did his room look exactly like how it did in 1996 – posters, decorations and all? Did his parents care about him that much? Anxiously, Alex hurried downstairs to check the calendar hanging in the living room. To his surprise, it showed the date of his disappearance: December 15, 1996. No time at all had passed since he got sucked into the game! He was home – back in his own place, and in his own time. Alex gave a silent whoop of joy as he tiptoed back to his room and climbed gratefully back into bed. He had been wondering how he would explain his long disappearance to his parents, but now he didn't have to worry about that. Instead, the whole incident could simply be swept under the rug. Alex paused. No, he did not want to sweep Jumanji under the rug! How could he? Two decades living alone in a jungle, going on the adventure of a lifetime? The things he'd experienced, the friends he'd made – was he simply to forget them? Most of all, was he to forget Bethany ? The girl from the future who had sacrificed a life for him? He wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her! Every day he would live from now on was a gift from her, and Alex knew he would be an idiot not to honour her memory always. The thought of Bethany suddenly made Alex realise something else. His new friends had come from twenty years in the future – his future. Even though he had been laughing and joking with them only a few minutes earlier (according to his reckoning), he now saw that he would need to wait two whole decades to meet them again. Worse still, even though his house was familiar to Spencer, Fridge, Martha and Bethany, he had no idea what they looked like in real life, and he doubted if they knew what he really looked like either. How would he recognize them twenty years from now? Alex groaned. If he knew it was going to be like this, he wouldn't have shaken hands with Nigel so quickly. Instead, he would have exchanged a few more words with Bethany, asked the others where they lived, what their phone numbers were… Alex shook his head thinking of all the missed opportunities. Eventually, he realized that he needed to preserve everything he remembered about Jumanji and his new friends before the details faded from his memory. He leapt out of bed, pulled out his notebook, turned on his desk lamp and began scribbling furiously. Spencer Gilpin. Fridge, the football player. Martha, the bad*ss girl. Bethany , supposedly a looker in real life. What would a 'phone' be twenty years from now? The names, appearances, strengths and weaknesses of their avatars. The levels they'd gone through and the various ways they'd lost their lives. Van Pelt and Nigel Billingsley. Alan Parrish and his lifesaving treehouse. When it was all written down, Alex slumped back in his chair, exhausted. What else was he supposed to do now? he thought. His eyes wandered to his television set and his gaming console, with the Jumanji cartridge still plugged into it. Of course! he realised angrily. He needed to destroy the game so that no one could ever play it again! Alex yanked the cartridge out of its socket. He was about to snap it in two and hurl the cursed thing into the trash, until he remembered the time-travel movies he had watched as a kid. In Back to the Future , Marty McFly's actions in the past significantly changed his life in the present. Terminator 2 explored what might happen if people tried to alter future history by destroying something important today. And most pertinently, the protagonists in The Final Countdown actually allowed the attack on Pearl Harbour to take place in order to return to their own time. Could that be what he was meant to do? Alex wondered. His return to 1996 was, in a way, dependent upon Spencer and Co. joining the game in 2016. If he destroyed the game now, they would never find it and play it, thus potentially undoing the whole time loop. Alex massaged his temples. Time-travel questions like these were enough to give him a headache, even more so in the middle of the night. He never dreamed that all this would happen as a result of his dad finding a stupid board game on the beach during one of his early morning jogs. Come to think of it, why was the game on the beach in the first place? Could a previous player have tried to dispose of it in the sea, only for it to be washed ashore later? Alex remembered Alan Parrish, the mysterious builder of his treehouse. Could he have been the one who did it? Perhaps he was a passenger on a cruise ship, or something. Gradually, Alex began to see a way out. Supposing Alan had dumped the game into the sea to get rid of it, he had failed miserably. Somehow, the game had escaped destruction and managed to ensnare Alex, Spencer and their friends. If, however, Alex kept the game to himself, then perhaps he could have more control over it and actually prevent others from playing it. Realising this, Alex gently placed the Jumanji cartridge back into the board game case where it had first materialized. He would guard this rectangular box and its contents carefully over the next twenty years. When the time was right, he would donate the console and cartridge to Brantford High School, where he knew four teenagers would be serving detention come 2016. Alex looked out of his bedroom window and saw the first streaks of dawn begin to light the sky. It was a new day for him, in more ways than one. As he crawled back under the covers to catch up on lost sleep, he thought once more about Bethany. Man, did this remind him of that 1988 Tom Hanks movie called Big …[Chapter 5] The epilogue from Alex's perspective. It was ten days before Christmas, 2017. 37-year-old Alex Vreeke and his family drove up to Alex's childhood home, with a massive Christmas tree fastened atop their vehicle. Once they arrived, little Bethany Vreeke bounded out of the car and ran up the house steps to embrace her dear old grandpa. As the rest of his family opened the car doors and got out, Alex put on a jacket and gently took his infant son Andy out of the car. \"Dad, when you get a sec, would you give us a hand?\" he called out to his old man. \"Yeah!\" Old Man Vreeke replied, as he went to help untie the large tree from the roof of his son's vehicle. Out of the corner of his eye, Alex spied four teenagers standing nearby, staring at him open-mouthed. For a brief moment, Alex wondered who they were, but all of a sudden, it clicked, and he remembered. Jumanji. The jungle. Memories from long ago came flooding back to him. Could it really be them? he wondered. He had not been expecting this when he got up that morning. His four friends from the game - were they really here, now ? Alex quickly did some math in his head. 1996...twenty years...2016...2017 ... it's them ! They're here ! They're finally here ! he thought in shock. Twenty years had flown by in the blink of an eye, and now his life with Spencer, Fridge, Martha and Bethany had come full circle. \"Hey, Dad, would you give me a second?\" he asked his father, and the old man gave him leave. Slowly, Alex walked up to the foursome, hardly daring to believe they were real. He could see them clearly for the first time. There was a scrawny Jewish kid in a yellow raincoat, a tall African-American hulk in a football jersey, a fly blonde chick, and a shy redhead in a pink beanie. They all looked like they had just come home from school. Alex mentally tried to match these kids he was seeing with the characters he remembered from the game. Which one was Bethany? Almost as if in response, the blonde girl waved timidly at him. Alex paused, a little afraid of making a mistake. He pointed to the girl who had waved at him, and ventured: \"Bethany?\" The girl beamed at him, and Alex knew he had hit the jackpot. His excitement growing, he turned to the Jewish kid. \"Spencer?\" he asked, drawing a smile from the boy as well. Next, he looked at the red-headed girl, and marvelled at how much she resembled her character in the game. \"Ruby Roundhouse?\" he asked with a wry tilt of his brow, prompting her to blush. At last, he turned to the black giant among them. \"And that would make you Fridge,\" Alex finished. Fridge lifted his hands with a smile, as if to say, \" Bingo! \" and \"What's up?\" Alex silently congratulated himself for his memory skills, and tried to find the right words to say. \"I'm stoked to see you,\" he choked out. \" All of you.\" Bethany seemed as choked up as he was. \"You made it back,\" she finally told him. \"Yeah, I did,\" Alex replied. \"It spit me out right where I started, so...1996.\" There was a rueful tone in his voice. It was easy to forget, while they were all in the game together, that he was 20 years older than the rest of them. But now, that age gap was apparent to all, and was making their reunion bittersweet. \"And your parents..., and... your house?\" Spencer enquired quizzically. Alex suddenly remembered that while in the game, Spencer and Fridge had told him that his dad had grown miserable and his house had become derelict in the timeline where he didn't come back. \"Oh, yeah, I did,\" he told Spencer reassuringly, pointing to the house, which was now pristine and decked with Christmas decorations. \"All good, bro.\" Upon hearing this, Spencer gave a smile of relief. Bethany spoke next. \"You're an adult now,\" she said, her voice cracking. \"You have a... family.\" Alex did not miss the disappointment in her voice, and he knew exactly what she was thinking. They had both developed feelings for one another while they were in the game, but time had separated them between two decades. He needed to tell her what he had done for her. \"I do, yeah,\" he told the four quickly. He gestured to the infant he was holding. \"This is Andy, and...\" He saw Fridge give Andy a wave, and he continued. \"And then my daughter... my daughter's name is... Bethany .\" Alex wished he could remember the look on Bethany's face forever. \"We named her after the girl who saved my life,\" he finished. Bethany seemed unsure of whether to smile, drop her jaw, laugh or cry. All she could do was grin from ear to ear and shake her head in wonder. Alex doubted if he had ever seen another human being look as overjoyed as she did right now. Alex was feeling pretty over the moon himself. For the first time, he realised that his four friends had probably just emerged from the game, and were heading home. So it was over, he thought to himself. This must mean that their game of Jumanji was at last well and truly over. He marvelled at how a single game had bridged a night in 1996 with this afternoon in 2017, and how it had brought together two generations of kids - kids who would likely not have found each other otherwise. Alex chuckled to think about all they had gained by playing the game. He would not exchange this one moment with his old (or was it new?) friends for the opportunity to avoid the terror and torment of the jungle altogether. For the first time, he was truly grateful that his dad had found the board game on the beach. \" So stoked ,\" he told them again. THE END.

Mysteries abound, nothing is known, About this strange new world.\" Those were the opening lyrics to a song that was being composed by a tenth-grade student at Emberville Collegiate. The student's name was Michael Foster, and he was sitting in front of a grand piano in Practice Room Five. The bright sunlight that shone into the room reflected off of the piano's glossy black finish, and Michael could clearly see the mirror image of his face staring back at him. He casually brushed his short, brown hair to the side and adjusted his blue-framed glasses before placing his hands on the keys. They felt as smooth as glass beneath his fingers, and he began to softly play the underlying piano melody that accompanied the song's lyrics, while reading the sheet music that he wrote by himself on his iPad. His focus was suddenly interrupted by someone lightly knocking on the door. The door swung open a few seconds later, and Michael turned his head to see who was there. A fifteen-year-old boy stood in the open doorway. He had shoulder-length brown hair, green eyes, and a muscular build. He wore a Judas Priest T-shirt, along with faded blue jeans and black sneakers. It was Michael's best friend, Jason Hill. He slowly walked into the room and sat down on a nearby chair. \"What is it, Jason?\" Michael asked him. \"Well, I was just wanting to see what you were up to,\" Jason replied. \"I know you're on your spare period, and I figured you'd be here, as usual.\" He looked at the sheet music on Michael's iPad. \"Are you writing a song?\" \"As a matter of fact, I am,\" Michael said with a smile. \"It's called 'Planet X', and it will be over fifteen minutes long.\" \"Oh my gosh!\" Jason blurted loudly, and he stood up from the chair almost as fast as one can blink. \"I'm not sure who would even have the patience to listen to anything of that length!\" Michael told him, \"People who listen to bands like Dream Theater, Rush, and Genesis will happily listen to long songs like this. Don't forget, I also write shorter songs as well, if you want something that's a bit more concise.\" \"Oh, okay,\" Jason said with a hint of a smile. \"Well, I'll just let you carry on with your composition. We can talk later. Besides, I have to be at my English class in three minutes.\" \"Is it that time already?\" Michael asked. Jason didn't need to answer, since Michael was glancing at his watch. The display read 10:57 AM. \"Crap! I need to get going as well! Math is my next class.\" Jason hastily waved goodbye to Michael before sprinting down the hallway, leaving him alone in the room. Michael shoved his iPad into his backpack, closed the piano's lid, and ran down the hallway in the same direction that Jason was heading. He rushed from corridor to corridor, weaving his way in and out of hundreds of students who were walking in each and every direction. After ascending two flights of stairs, he darted down a shorter hallway, and he stopped in front of the fourth door to the left. It was a frosted glass door, and beside it was a brass plaque which displayed the room's number, 219. No one else had showed up yet, much to his surprise. \"Hmm,\" Michael said to himself. \"Math is my favorite class, but I've never been the first one to reach the door until now. The others are all gonna be late, I know it.\" As soon as the numbers on his watch changed from 10:59 to 11:00, the door swung open, revealing a nearly empty classroom with five rows of long tables. Other than Michael, the only person who was present was his math teacher, Mrs. Scheffer. She was a skinny, middle-aged woman with long, silver hair and thick-rimmed glasses that nearly covered half of her face. She wore a light-blue golf shirt, tan jeans, and black high-heeled shoes. \"Ah, I'm glad you made it in time,\" she said in a quiet but sincere tone. \"I hope you're ready for today's lesson.\" \"I always am, Mrs. Scheffer,\" Michael said reassuringly as he adjusted his glasses. He took his seat at the frontmost table, and slowly but surely, more students trickled in until all twenty-nine were present. \"Sorry we're late,\" one of the students near the back of the room apologized as he sat down. \"This one person in the hallway was—\" \"'Sorry' won't cut it for me, Sam,\" Mrs. Scheffer said sternly. \"Please don't make any more excuses like that again. Now, class, today we will focus on solving first-degree algebraic equations involving one variable, including equations with fractional coefficients.\" Michael grinned in excitement as Mrs. Scheffer switched on an overhead projector, and she tapped the screen of her iPad a few times to make it sync to the projector. As she spoke, she began writing her notes on the iPad with a special pen, and they appeared on the whiteboard in front of the class. After her brief lecture, she grabbed a stack of papers in her hand, and she walked around the room, handing a worksheet to each student. The stack gradually became smaller and smaller, and Michael received the last worksheet. On it were a series of algebraic equations, and Michael instantly tackled the first equation. Just twenty minutes later, he had finished the entire worksheet. \"I'm done,\" he told Mrs. Scheffer, who promptly took the completed worksheet from him. Meanwhile, everyone else was nowhere near done with their work. \"I'm not surprised,\" she mumbled as she grabbed a red pen, checking his answers. A few other people managed to hand in their worksheets before the bell rang to signal the end of the period. \"You did a great job, Michael,\" she said as he was about to leave the room with everyone else. She handed the worksheet to him, and an \"A+\" was written in red ink near the top right-hand corner. \"Thank you so much,\" Michael replied, stuffing the sheet into his backpack. \"Have a great weekend, Mrs. Scheffer!\" He waved goodbye to her and ran back into the hallway, which was once again packed with students. The rest of the day was rather uneventful. During the lunch period, Michael sat alone in the cafeteria and played video games on his PSP. In English, he was working on a book report of \"Brave New World\" by Aldous Huxley since he loved to read dystopian novels. His day ended with a double-period metalworking class, where he learned how to properly and safely use an arc welder to weld two pieces of steel blocks together. Once school was over, Michael promptly left the building to begin heading home, which only consisted of a fifteen-minute walk. His route normally led him down a long, residential street with large, modern homes on either side, but this time, he decided to take a different path, which stretched past a long strip mall with dozens of shops. As he turned onto this path, he felt a series of vibrations in his pocket, along with a very loud ringtone reminiscent of an old-fashioned phone from the 1950's. He took out his iPhone and swiped a finger across the screen. \"Hello, it's Mom,\" a female voice greeted. \"How are you, honey? How was school?\" \"I'm great, Mom, thanks,\" Michael replied. \"As for school, I just have my book report to continue working on, and as usual, math was excellent. We did some more algebra, and you can probably guess how I did on my assignment.\" \"You passed,\" his mother assumed. \"I didn't just pass,\" Michael boasted. \"I passed with flying colors. I got an A-plus.\" \"Great job, as always,\" she congratulated him. \"I'm proud of you. Well, I actually called to let you know that your dad and I won't be home until two in the morning, since we have a special event to attend.\" \"What kind of event?\" Michael inquired, his curiosity starting to grow. He was surprised that she had never told him about any kind of upcoming event recently. \"Well, one of your dad's closest coworkers is having his wedding ceremony tonight,\" she said, \"and we are excited to go.\" \"Congratulations,\" Michael responded. \"Make sure you tell the groom that I said that.\" \"I will,\" his mother said. \"Have a great evening, Michael. There's a sushi platter in the fridge if you wish to have some of it.\" \"Oooh, I love sushi!\" Michael said, rubbing his chest. \"Thank you so much. I'll see you tomorrow morning, I guess. I love you, Mom. Good bye.\" He tapped the \"End Call\" button to end the conversation. He put his iPhone in his pocket and took a moment to observe the area around him. Cars, trucks, vans, buses, and bicycles were steadily moving along the street in both directions, and just as he began to walk past a liquor store in the long, narrow strip mall, his phone emitted a short chime. He stopped walking and pulled the device back out of his pocket to check what he had received. It was a text message from Jason. Hey, sorry about the short notice (because as you know, I'm terrible at planning social events), but I'm just reminding you that it's my 16th birthday tomorrow! Since it also happens to be on Halloween, feel free to dress up in whatever kind of costume you want. The party will be held at my place, 6 Stone Rd, at 6:30 PM. Please RSVP, and I hope to see you there tomorrow! :D \"Oh, no,\" Michael whispered to himself, as a feeling of worry took over him. \"I don't know what to get him for a birthday present, and the party is tomorrow! I need to think of something fast. Maybe since I'm here, I could investigate some of the stores to find something to buy for him.\" The first few stores were a women's clothing shop, a jewelry store, and a hardware store. Michael walked right past them, knowing that nothing in any of those stores would be of interest to Jason. He soon came across a store that was named \"Cash For Gold\". The front door certainly looked like it had seen better days, since a sizable portion of the red paint had been peeled off, revealing several spots of brown rust. Judging by the prices on some of the items that could be seen through the store's large windows, he assumed the place was a pawn shop. \"Nope, I'm certainly not buying anything from there, since it looks rather sketchy,\" he muttered, turning his head away from the window that he was looking through. He was about to continue walking home when he heard a faint noise. Thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump. \"Sounds like...drums,\" Michael said, trying to figure out where the sound was coming from. He caught sight of a bright-red Ferrari as it sped down the road with its sound system cranked to the max. \"Forget it. It's probably just that person's music.\" His gaze followed the car as it stopped in front of a red traffic light, and when the light turned green, the car's engine roared loudly as it sped off into the distance. The sound of the turbocharged engine eventually faded away, but the faint sound of drums still pervaded the air as if the car had never left in the first place. \"Am I hallucinating or something?\" Michael asked himself in confusion. The drumming noise was starting to give him the creeps, and he began to feel as if he had walked onto the set of a horror movie. What's even worse was that it seemed to be coming from inside the derelict pawn shop. Desperate to locate the source of the sound, Michael steeled himself and entered the shop. The door creaked loudly on its rusty hinges as he slowly opened it, and it creaked again when he closed it. The store was filled from wall to wall with various items, including old TV's, used clothing, comic books, antique furniture, and a rack of china tableware. The air inside the shop was rather stuffy, and it reeked of cigarette smoke. A frail man who had to have been in his early eighties was walking around the shop with a vacuum cleaner, sucking up a thin layer of dust that covered nearly every square foot of the floor. There was no one else in the store except for him. Suddenly, much to Michael's surprise, the drumming stopped as if someone had pressed the pause button on a stereo. The man turned off the vacuum and hobbled towards Michael, stopping just two feet in front of him. \"May I help you, sir?\" he asked in a croaky voice. \"I...I thought I heard a drumming sound,\" Michael nervously replied, \"and I had a feeling it was coming from your store, so that's why I stopped by to investigate.\" \"I don't know what you're talking about, boy,\" the shopkeeper said to him. \"I can hardly hear nothing anymore, yeh know. I'm very old, and I only have about nine or ten customers who stop by on a good day. There are even days where I don't have any at all, so it's just me, standing alone in this place. I'm sad to say, but my store will be closing for good very soon, due to low sales and revenue.\" \"I'm very sorry to hear that,\" Michael responded, but the man immediately pointed a bony finger at his face. \"Don't feel sorry for me, please,\" he told him. \"As I said, I'm old. I've been working here for over forty years. When the previous owner passed away a decade ago, he put me in charge, and that's how it's been to this very day. It's about time that I move on as well.\" Thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump. \"There!\" Michael exclaimed as the sound of African drums filled the air once again. \"Don't you hear those drums?\" The man shook his head, and he looked at Michael as if he was going insane. The drumming grew louder and louder, and before long, the beats were so loud that he clamped his hands to his ears, but it was all in vain. He looked at the man to see that he was yelling at him, but he couldn't make out a single word. He might as well have been watching one of those old silent movies, but with skull-shattering drumbeats to accompany the scene. Finally, the man grabbed a piece of paper and wrote something on it. He showed it to Michael: PLEASE LEAD ME TO WHERE THIS SOUND IS COMING FROM. Michael nearly stumbled as he began to lead the shopkeeper towards the back of the store. They carefully navigated around a case of glass ornaments, and before long, Michael spotted a relatively large cardboard box that was sitting on a dust-covered metal shelf, right beside the door which led to the \"employees only\" section of the store. The drumming stopped as quickly as it started, and he sighed in relief. \"The drums are gone now,\" Michael told him. He pointed to the box. \"I have a feeling they're coming from inside there.\" Michael picked up the box, which was about as heavy as he was expecting it to be from its size. The flaps were sealed with a wide ribbon of clear tape. He rotated the box in his hands, and he noticed a small, white sticker on one side of the box, which was accompanied by a barcode. The sticker read, \"Jumanji - A Mysterious Board Game\", and the price was just $4.99. \"Ah, I see that you've found a most interesting artifact,\" the shopkeeper spoke. \"I forgot that it was in my shop.\" Michael was about to say, \"Well, clearly you need to keep better track of your own store's inventory,\" but he kept it to himself. \" Now I understand what you're talking about,\" the shopkeeper said, and a smile began to creep across his face. \"This game has a little story behind it. Nineteen years ago, in 1996, two girls from Montreal were on vacation here, and they found this board game half-buried in the sand on a nearby beach. They also said they heard drumbeats as they approached it, so that means you weren't the only one. They chose not to play it for some reason, so they dropped it off at my shop. We bought it in exchange for a rather large amount of cash, expecting it to sell quickly as a collector's item, but none of our customers wanted to purchase the game. Therefore, it has been sitting here ever since those girls dropped it off, and its value has depreciated over time, hence the reason the game is so cheap now.\" \"So no one wanted to buy it?\" Michael asked, and the man slowly shook his head. \"No one wanted to buy it,\" he replied, and his voice showed more enthusiasm as he continued to speak. \"Over the years, some children claimed to have heard drumbeats coming from this store, but of course, I never believed them, and their parents didn't let them attempt to find out where the sound was coming from, since they didn't believe their children either.\" \"So you're saying that adults can't hear the drums, but children can?\" Michael questioned. \"Apparently that's the truth,\" the shopkeeper said, looking away. \"So, what do you want to do? Would you like to buy it? If so, I'll cut you some slack and let you buy it outright. No haggling is required this time, since I just want this item to be gone from my store. I just feel so relieved that someone is finally willing to buy the game after all these years, so if you decide to purchase the game, you'll be taking a hell of a burden off my shoulders.\" \"Well, I'm stuck on what to get my best friend for his birthday,\" Michael admitted, \"and I don't see any harm in buying him a simple board game, even if it is a little on the mysterious side. We spend lots of time playing video games together, so I want to change things up a little bit.\" He walked over to the counter where the cash register was located, and he placed the box onto it before removing his wallet from his back pocket. He dug a five-dollar bill out of the wallet and handed it to the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper carefully put the box into a white plastic bag and gave it to Michael. \"Have a good night,\" the shopkeeper said, feebly waving his hand as Michael walked towards the door. \"You too.\" Michael waved back before exiting the store. Now that he had finally purchased a birthday present for Jason, Michael continued his journey home. Once he got there several minutes later, he unlocked the door and walked inside. True to his mother's word, the place was completely empty and silent. He was alone. Michael took his shoes off and ran towards the kitchen, and he put the plastic bag onto the floor. He lifted the box out of the bag, and he slashed the tape apart with a paring knife. His heart was pounding like a jackhammer as he opened the flaps and looked inside the box, which was full of styrofoam. He laid the box horizontally on the floor before removing the styrofoam, only to find another box inside. This one was made of darkly-stained wood. He carried the wooden box to the dining room and carefully set it down onto the table. The top of the box was emblazoned with an intricate design that was made with a lot of care and craftsmanship. Nearly the entire bottom half of the design was covered with ferns, and the top half consisted of a mountain range, and one of the peaks was emitting a thick stream of smoke, as if it was going to erupt any second. In each corner, there was an egg-shaped circle that framed a portrait of either an animal or a human. The top left circle was occupied by a person who wore a pith helmet. To his right was a monkey, and its long tail was curled up behind it. On the bottom right-hand corner, a menacing elephant could be seen, with one of its tusks clearly visible in front of its trunk. Lastly, on the bottom-left, there was a rhino with its single horn proudly pointing upwards. In the very center, a spear ran through the middle of a single word: \"JUMANJI\". \"I can't believe I bought this game for so cheap,\" Michael said as he ran his hand over the design, feeling each and every contour, bump, and indentation. With a click, he opened the lid, and it flipped over to one side of the board. He then realized that there were actually two separate lids, and he opened the other one, which flipped over to the other side, revealing the game's playing surface in its entirety. There were four paths made from white stone tiles, and they crisscrossed over each other in a serpentine fashion. Each path started at one of the board's four corners, and all four paths led towards the center of the board, which featured a black crystal orb. The inside of both lids had large text printed on them, but Michael decided not to take the time to read it yet. Without saying a single word, he closed the box and took it downstairs to the utility room in the basement, where he found a drawer with several rolls of wrapping paper. He chose a roll of black paper that had the words \"Happy Birthday\" written on it, complete with colorful pictures of balloons and streamers. He placed Jumanji into an oversized shoebox and wrapped it up, and then he made a simple birthday card to accompany it. \"Well, that was quite a day,\" Michael said a few minutes later as he took the sushi platter out of the fridge, and he breathed a sigh of relief as he reflected on the day's events. \"School went well, I got an excellent score on my math assignment, I got a start on composing my new song, and I bought Jason his, uh, birthday present. Something tells me that the party tomorrow will be rather...extraordinary.\" He grabbed a piece of sushi with salmon inside and took a tiny bite, and then another, allowing himself plenty of time to savor its taste until it was finally gone. He briefly washed his hands and grabbed a blue envelope from one of the cabinets. He slid Jason's birthday card into the envelope and sealed it shut before writing a simple \"Happy Birthday\" message on the front of it. He placed the envelope on top of Jason's present before helping himself to another piece of sushi. The platter was half-empty by the time he decided to finish, and he put it back into the fridge for his parents to finish the other half. For the next two hours, Michael played Grand Theft Auto V on his PlayStation 4, but even while preoccupied by the mission he was currently on, he couldn't help but worry that he made the wrong purchase. \"It was only five dollars,\" Michael told himself in an attempt to shrug his worries off. \"If there are any problems with this game, I'm certain that Jason will let me send it to someone else who would like to have it. If I—\" His sentence was suddenly interrupted by the sound of his iPhone ringing once again. The display read, \"Jason Hill would like FaceTime...\" About three seconds after accepting the call, Jason's face appeared on the screen. He was sitting in an armchair in his bedroom, wearing pajamas and eating from a large bag of Doritos. \"Hello, Mike,\" Jason drawled. \"Did you get my text from earlier?\" \"Yes,\" Michael answered, \"and I'm sorry I haven't replied yet.\" \"That's okay,\" Jason said, smiling. \"So, are you coming to the party?\" \"Of course I am!\" \"What will you be wearing?\" Jason asked him. Michael thought about it for a few seconds before making his decision. \"I want to go as a rock star again.\" \"But you dressed up as one last year!\" Jason cried. \"Come on, buddy, wear something different this time!\" Michael sighed and shook his head. \"Listen,\" Michael told him. \"I'm getting tired, and I don't want to rush myself with putting together a new costume. I hope you understand.\" Jason popped another chip into his mouth and bit into it with a loud crunch. \"No worries, my friend. I do understand. Thanks for letting me know that you're coming to my party, and I'll see you at 6:30 tomorrow evening! Smell ya later!\" Michael chuckled in response, and he gave his best friend a thumbs-up before ending the call. \"Well, I guess it's about time that I go to bed,\" he muttered as he ended his game and shut down the PS4. He ran to his bedroom, which was located just off to the side of the basement stairs. The room was a mess. The bedsheets were haphazardly draped over one side of his double bed, a heap of clothes were on the floor near his dresser, and his desk was cluttered with more than a dozen old receipts from fast-food restaurants and convenience stores. Michael quickly changed into his pajamas, and he didn't bother to brush his teeth before turning off the lights and climbing into bed. Once he laid down, he adjusted the bedsheets so that they were in a relatively comfortable position, and after removing his glasses, he closed his eyes, propping his head sideways on the pillow. Before long, he was sound asleep. He dreamt that he was watching Jason unwrap his birthday present, and a vicious thunderstorm suddenly began to take over the sky. A torrential downpour soaked the neighborhood, and dazzling bolts of lightning lit up the atmosphere, but instead of hearing thunder, Michael heard the pounding of Jumanji's drums. Author's note: I hope you enjoyed the first chapter of my story! I was trying my very best to describe the day's events just enough to introduce you to Michael and how he came across Jumanji, but I didn't want to go into too much detail about the mundane aspects of the day, because that would have made for a very boring chapter. Rest assured, the next chapter will be a lot more interesting, so stay tuned! :)[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 - Jason's Party Author's note: Hi, readers! I'm back with the second chapter! Before we begin, it's time to respond to your reviews: dragonserpent18, I'm glad that you're enjoying it so far. As for what's next, you'll find out very shortly! :) Guest, that's exactly what I intended to do when I described the pawn shop. They will begin playing Jumanji right at the end of the chapter. Now, on with the story! Michael got up relatively late the next morning. Once he finished dressing and grooming himself, he went upstairs to have breakfast with his parents. \"Good morning, everyone!\" Michael exclaimed as he entered the dining room, where his mother and father were waiting for him. Michael's mother had her brown hair in a ponytail, and her gold-rimmed glasses were seemingly perched on the end of her nose, looking as if they could fall off at any moment. The rest of her wardrobe consisted of a red golf shirt and tan pants. His father had black hair which was styled in a pompadour, and he wore a grey plaid shirt and black pants. A large heap of pancakes were stacked on a plate at the center of the table. \"Thank you so much for making pancakes today,\" Michael added. \"I've been craving them for the last two weeks.\" \"Well, you could have made some for yourself during all that time,\" his father said, \"but we're okay with making breakfast for everyone on weekends. How was your afternoon, son?\" \"Pretty good,\" Michael replied, shrugging his shoulders before he took a pancake with a pair of tongs and dropped it on his plate. \"Just after I talked to Mom on the phone, Jason texted me and invited me to his birthday today, which will be at at 6:30 this evening.\" \"That's wonderful,\" his mother said. \"I'm so happy to know that you're spending more time with your best friend. High school can be stressful, so it's always good to go out and socialize with other people your age every once in a while. Are you all ready for it? Do you have everything you need?\" \"Yuppers!\" Michael said in an excited tone. \"I already bought him a present, and I made a card to go with it. Since today is Halloween, he also suggested that I wear a costume to the party. For the sake of time, I think I'll just dress up as a rock star again.\" \"Well, what's the problem with that?\" his father asked as he took another pancake from the heap. \"I thought it was a great costume. However, since you're going to someone else's house, I strongly suggest that you don't bring my guitar this time, because I paid almost two-thousand dollars for it, and the last thing I want is for my baby to get damaged, even if it's just a tiny scratch.\" \"So then what can I do?\" Michael asked, and his father immediately stood up from the table. \"Come with me.\" He led Michael into the garage and took a large, thick sheet of cardboard from a storage rack. He used a table saw to slice the sheet in half, just enough for Michael to cut out the shape of a life-size Fender Stratocaster with a band saw. Michael painted the body of the guitar bright-red while leaving the neck as it was, and he drew the strings, frets, pickups, bridge, and volume knobs onto the guitar with a black marker. After punching tiny holes that would allow for a strap to be secured to the guitar, they went back inside to continue eating their pancakes. Michael broke the silence a minute later. \"Sorry I forgot to ask you earlier, but how was the wedding?\" \"It was amazing,\" his mother replied, clasping her hands together. \"The wedding was held in the ballroom of a fancy hotel downtown, and we all had a wonderful time. The food was excellent, and so was the music. They mostly played rock, some older metal, and a bit of country. And the best part was that there weren't any people who were totally drunk.\" \"I'm glad to hear you had a good time,\" Michael said, \"but I want to know, what else are we going to do today between now and the party?\" \"Well, we're going to do some shopping and other errands,\" Michael's father said as he began collecting everyone's plates from the table, \"but you don't have to come if you don't want to. Take all the time you need to get ready for tonight.\" Michael nodded, and he finished eating a few moments later. He helped his father load the dishes into the dishwasher, and he put the leftover pancakes into a plastic container, which went into the fridge. \"We're leaving now,\" his mother called just as he began to walk down the basement stairs. Michael paused mid-step before walking back up the stairs to the foyer. \"Bye, son,\" his father said as he opened the front door, and a stream of cool air flowed into the house. \"Have a good time at the party. I'm just letting you know that the temperature is a tad low today, so you might want to prepare for that when the time comes for you to leave. I can drop you off at Jason's place for 6:30 if you'd like.\" \"Thank you for the offer, Dad, but I can drive there myself,\" Michael said, giving his father a bear hug. He then hugged his mother, and the adults left the house, closing the door behind them. Michael waved at them through the window as they got into the car and drove away. \"Well, I guess it's time to prepare my costume,\" Michael muttered to himself, heading back downstairs to the utility room to search for the storage bin with the Halloween costumes. By the time he was done, he was dressed in an Iron Maiden T-shirt, and he wore a wig with long, curly black hair. He also wore black bracelets with Iron Maiden's logo on them. He ran back upstairs to grab his newly-made cardboard guitar, and after securing a fabric strap to it, he dashed into the nearest bathroom and looked at himself in the mirror. \"Whether I wore it before or not, this still looks pretty goddamn awesome. Up the irons.\" Michael drove up to the Hill residence at exactly 6:30. It was a large, two-story house with a four-car garage, and the front yard was elaborately decorated with Jack-o-lanterns, gravestones, and spiderwebs. The sun was just starting to set, and it cast an orange glow over the surrounding area. He parked his car on the driveway, and with Jason's birthday present tucked under his arm, he strolled towards the house. He could barely make out the silhouettes of people from behind the front door's frosted glass window, and after he rang the doorbell, one of the silhouettes suddenly ran towards the door. With a click, the door opened, and Jason was there to greet Michael. He was dressed up as Batman. \"Hey buddy, I'm so happy to see you!\" Jason said, shaking Michael's hand. \"And while I do see that you're wearing the same costume as last year, it still looks totally rad. Come in, come in!\" \"Thank you!\" Michael replied as he entered the house, and Jason closed the door behind him. \"Oh, and happy birthday! Since you're sixteen, you can now legally drive!\" \"I know!\" Jason shouted enthusiastically, giving Michael a fist bump. \"I finally get to drive my dad's Corvette! I'm so excited!\" He looked at the box that his guest was holding beneath his arm. \"Ah, and I see you brought a present. You may go downstairs to the basement and drop it off with the other presents in the rec room. Two of my friends are down there as well, if you want to meet them.\" \"Will do, Jason!\" Michael responded, taking off his shoes before walking across the foyer. Just beyond it, there was a U-shaped staircase that provided access to the second floor. Directly underneath it, there was another U-shaped staircase that led to the basement, which Michael began to descend. As soon as he reached the lower level, he spotted two teenagers sitting on a leather couch in the rec room, in front of an enormous TV. One was a girl with long, brown hair, and she wore a set of black robes, complete with a red-and-gold striped necktie. She held a long, wooden wand in her hand. The other was a boy with messy, dark-brown hair, and he also wore a set of robes with an identical necktie. On his face, he had a black pair of glasses with perfectly round lenses, and a little red lightning bolt was painted just above his right eye. He also held a wand in his hand. They were watching a movie and sharing a large bowl that contained a variety of potato chips. \"Hello!\" the girl exclaimed as she saw Michael. \"You must be Jason's friend, Michael. Am I correct?\" \"I most certainly am,\" Michael replied as he placed the box containing Jason's present on the floor, along with eleven others. \"I'm so happy to be here. What's your name?\" \"My name is Tessa,\" the girl replied, \"and I'm dressed up as Hermione Granger.\" She gestured towards the boy with her hand. \"And this is Cody. I'm sure you can figure out who he's supposed to be.\" \"Of course I know,\" Michael said. \"He's dressed up as Harry Potter.\" Cody smiled and gave him a thumbs-up in response. \"You may sit down if you wish to do so,\" Cody said as he pointed to an empty spot on the couch. \"Thank you,\" Michael said, and he took off his cardboard guitar and leaned it up against a nearby chair. He sat down on the couch and helped himself to some chips. \"So, how do you guys know Jason?\" Michael inquired. \"We're with him in the school's wood shop,\" Tessa answered. \"Cody and I made our wands by ourselves. If you aren't enrolled in woodworking, you should take it next year, because it's a lot of fun. Of course, you are working with power tools that could potentially be dangerous, but if you follow the safety guidelines, you'll do fine.\" \"That does sound interesting,\" Michael said, \"but I'm taking metalworking this year. You get to learn how to weld, use plasma cutters, and you can create some really interesting projects. I'm not sure what I want to do for my first project yet, but the idea will come to me eventually.\" Suddenly, the sound of footsteps caught their attention, and Jason entered the room, taking his seat on the couch beside Michael. \"The birthday boy is back!\" Cody exclaimed before throwing a potato chip directly at Jason's head. In the nick of time, Jason caught the chip in his mouth and ate it. \"I've only been gone for just over five minutes,\" Jason said, scowling. \"Did I miss anything?\" \"Not really,\" Cody responded. \"We were just breaking the ice with your best friend.\" Jason put his hands on his hips. \"Well, shall we at least do something else? I mean, Michael's here now, so I think we should partake in an activity that is a little more engaging than watching a movie, like playing some games on the Wii. Are you good with that?\" \"I am,\" Michael said with a smile. Tessa and Cody gave Jason a thumbs-up, and the teenagers played Wii Sports for about an hour, competing to aim for the Pro ranking in both bowling and golf. In the end, Jason was the only one who got anywhere close to reaching the desired score. \"Of course it's the birthday boy who won,\" Cody said as he removed his Wii Remote from his wrist. \"Good job, Jason, as well as Michael and Tessa.\" \"Thanks, Cody,\" Jason replied as he put his own Wii Remote away, and Michael and Tessa did the same. \"So, shall we prepare to have dinner? I'll be ordering pizza, so what would you guys like to have? I'll show you the choices right here.\" Jason opened an application on his iPad Pro and a menu popped up with a list of different types of pizza, ranging from the typical mozzarella cheese and pepperoni toppings, to one topped with rhubarb, basil, and wild mushrooms. \"Pick a pizza from the list. Any pizza you want.\" \"Pepperoni, please,\" Michael told Jason, who tapped the pepperoni pizza option to select it. \"Hawaiian,\" Tessa requested. \"Deluxe, too,\" Cody added. Jason was the last one to pick a pizza, and he selected a cheeseburger pizza. After filling in the payment info, he tapped \"Send\". \"There,\" Jason said, putting the iPad down. \"The pizza-delivery guy should be here within a half-hour.\" A sudden knock startled everyone, and a woman with short, silver hair and green eyes walked down the stairs towards them. She was wearing a fancy red dress that was trimmed with lace. \"Jason, would you like us to do anything for dinner?\" she asked. \"No, Mom, I've got it all taken care of,\" Jason answered. \"I just ordered pizza less than a minute ago. We're ordering four boxes, so would you like us to come upstairs to have some with you guys, or should we just eat down here while you guys have something else?\" \"Whatever you choose to do, sweetie,\" she said warmly. \"It's your birthday, so you can do whatever you want.\" She hastily walked back upstairs and out of sight. \"I actually would like to have dinner with the adults as well, so that we can all eat together!\" Jason shouted, hoping that she would be able to hear him. Motioning to his guests, he said, \"Come on,\" and he led them upstairs to an elegant dining room. The room's centerpiece was a long, wooden table with twelve high-backed chairs around it. Despite the fact that the chairs were unoccupied, the table was already set, complete with plates, drinking glasses, an assortment of forks and knives, and napkins in each person's spot. Jason's father, a tall man with short, brown hair and green eyes, was standing by the table as he waited for them to enter. He wore a plain black T-shirt and blue jeans. \"Hello, Michael,\" he said with a warm smile. \"I am so glad you came on this special day. We have homemade appetizers on the kitchen counter, so you guys won't have to go hungry while waiting for the pizza guy to arrive. My wife will gladly bring them out for you.\" He left the room via an open doorway which led to the kitchen. \"We'd appreciate that, please,\" Jason said loudly, and within seconds, his mother entered the room with a large tray of freshly-basked croissants, spring rolls, battered shrimp, and deep-fried pickles. She set the tray down in the center of the table, and the four teenagers took their seats. Out of those four seats, Jason took the leftmost one, Michael sat to his right, and Tessa sat to Michael's right. Lastly, Cody chose the rightmost seat. \"Dig in, everyone,\" Jason's mother said before she left the room. Within seconds, the teens began to help themselves to their share of appetizers. \"Wow, I've never had these before,\" Tessa said as she bit into a deep-fried pickle. \"They're delicious!\" \"My mom got the idea from a restaurant we visited a long time ago,\" Jason said proudly. \"She graduated from college with a culinary arts diploma, so this is her specialty. She can cook up nearly anything you could want, and then some.\" \"That's amazing,\" Cody said just before he had a piece of shrimp, and he rubbed his belly afterward. \"You've got one hell of a great mother. I'd do anything to have one like yours.\" \"What makes you say that?\" Michael inquired, and Cody looked past Tessa to make eye contact with him. \"Well, my parents divorced a long time ago,\" Cody said, \"and my mother just hasn't been the same person since then. She leaves me alone a lot of the time, and when we are in each other's presence, she tries to make any conversations between us as short as possible. Isolation is not a good way to live, especially when your mother almost wants to abandon you.\" \"Don't you see your father every once in a while?\" Jason asked Cody, and he nodded ever so slightly. \"I do, but very rarely,\" Cody replied. \"I'm talking once every two years, on average. He's the polar opposite of my mother. He has a fun and outgoing personality, and he likes to take me to concerts and amusement parks. Unfortunately, he lives too far away from where I attend school, so that's why I'm living with my mother.\" \"I see,\" Michael said quietly. \"Well, I really hope that things will get better for you in the near future. Just tough it out, that's all I can say.\" \"Thank you so much for your kind words, Michael,\" Cody replied, and he took a croissant from the platter before dunking it into a bowl of spinach dip. \"I'll remember that.\" Suddenly, the doorbell rang, and Jason quickly sprang up from his chair. \"I think the pizza's here!\" he said excitedly, and he ran to the door before opening it. Sure enough, a white van with the words \"CLAY OVEN PIZZERIA\" on its side was parked on the driveway, and a young man stood on the doorstep. He wore a red baseball cap that had the company's logo embroidered on it, along with a matching red collared shirt that also featured the logo on the left side, and black pants which were held up by a belt. \"Good evening,\" the man greeted with a friendly smile. He was holding four pizza boxes in his hands, and they were neatly stacked on top of one another. \"I believe you ordered pepperoni, Hawaiian, deluxe, and cheeseburger. Am I correct?\" \"That's correct, sir. I'm glad you came,\" Jason said as the man handed the boxes to him. He used his pinky finger to hold onto the receipt. \"Thank you so much!\" \"You're welcome,\" the man replied, and he began to walk back towards his van. \"Have a great day!\" \"You too!\" Jason said loudly, and he watched the van drive away before closing the door with his elbow. He carried the pizza boxes into the dining room, and the delicious scent seemed to pervade the entire area. \"The pizza's here, everyone!\" he announced as he placed the boxes on a nearby shelf, lining them up in a row before opening each one. The adults walked into the room, and everyone helped themselves to their share of pizza. After about an hour of conversation between everyone at the table, Jason's mother stood up from her chair, and she collected everyone's empty plates before taking them to the kitchen. \"Now, Jason,\" his father spoke, \"I have a question for you. Would you like to have cake first, or do you want to open presents instead?\" \"Well, we normally have cake first,\" Jason said, \"so I think I'd like to change things up a little. I'll be opening the presents downstairs, just so that everyone knows.\" He led everybody downstairs to the rec room, where a dozen presents were neatly arranged in a pile. \"Which one would you like to open first, honey?\" Jason's mother asked her son, who pointed to a large box wrapped in bright-orange paper. \"I'll choose the one you gave me, Mom,\" Jason said, taking the present before sitting on the floor. He began to tear the wrapping paper apart with his hands. \"Yes, I've been wanting this for ages!\" he exclaimed in delight as he looked at his unwrapped present. It was a white box containing a MacBook Pro. \"Thank you so much, Mom!\" He hugged his mother before setting the box aside. Next, he opened a present from his father, and it was a Bluetooth stereo system. \"Thank you, Dad,\" Jason said, giving him a fist bump. \"My pleasure, son. Rock on.\" After unwrapping more presents from his relatives, which included a new set of bedsheets, a Slayer T-shirt, and a PlayStation Vita, there were only three more left. They were from Michael, Tessa, and Cody. \"And now it's down to just my friends,\" Jason proudly announced as he grabbed a large, cylindrical object. \"This one is from Cody.\" \"Go on, open it,\" Cody urged. Jason tore the wrapping paper to shreds, revealing an enormous container of popcorn. There were five different flavors: plain, cheddar, salt & vinegar, barbecue, and caramel. \"Thank you so much, pal,\" Jason said, giving Cody a high-five. \"Anytime,\" Cody replied. \"We could all share some of it tonight if you wish!\" \"That would be great!\" Jason told Cody. \"However, I still have two more presents here. Tessa, I'll open yours next.\" He reached for a small box wrapped in red paper, and inside it was a necklace with a perfect replica of a Golden Snitch. \"Well, I guess being a Seeker is out of the question now,\" Jason joked as he put it around his neck and fastened the clasp. \"Why bother playing Quidditch when I can have the Snitch with me at all times? Thank you, Tessa.\" He gave her a hug before finally turning to look at his best friend. \"Saving mine for last, hm?\" Michael asked as he gingerly handed the final present over to Jason. He looked at the wrapping paper that Michael chose. \"Nice wrapping paper, buddy,\" Jason said just before he began to tear it to ribbons, like he did with everyone else's. \"Oh, look everyone, I got a shoebox! That's the best present ever! Thank you so much, Michael.\" \"Very funny,\" Tessa said with just a hint of sarcasm. \"There must be something inside it.\" Jason glared at her. \"I was joking! Do you seriously think my best friend would just give me an empty shoebox for my birthday? I think not!\" The anticipation was growing within Michael as Jason lifted the lid off the shoebox, revealing the wooden box that was safely stored inside. As Jason placed it onto a nearby table, everyone's expression turned to that of either wonder or amazement. \"Jumanji,\" Jason said aloud as he examined the elaborate design on the box's lid. \"This must have been really expensive. Wonderful craftsmanship here. What exactly is it, buddy?\" \"Some sort of board game,\" Michael told him. \"Okay everyone,\" Jason suddenly spoke up, \"forget about setting up my MacBook or playing multiplayer games on the Wii. No offense, but I really want to see what this game is all about. I normally don't care for board games, but my best friend bought this for me, and I'm sure he paid a lot of money for it, so I'm going to play it with him and my other friends. Uhh, speaking of which, how do we play?\" \"I'm sure there's instructions inside,\" Cody said, watching as Jason unfolded each lid, revealing the playing board for all to see. The very sight of it drew oohs and aahs from everyone except for Michael. Jason examined the exquisite craftsmanship and artistry that must have went into designing the game's playing surface, and he saw his own face staring back at him in the black crystal orb. Jason then noticed the text on one of the lids, and he read it aloud: \"Jumanji: a game for those who seek to find a way to leave their world behind. You roll the dice to move your token, Doubles gets another turn, and the first player to reach the end wins.\" He then turned the game around to read the text on the opposite lid: \"Adventurers beware: Do not begin unless you intend to finish. The exciting consequences of the game will vanish only when a player has reached Jumanji and called out its name. Sounds rather foreboding, but no less so than any of my video games. I actually think we'll have a lot of fun with this.\" Jason closed the box and held it under his arm as he stood back up. \"Where are you going?\" Michael asked. \"To play the game with you guys, of course,\" Jason answered as he opened a nearby door that led into a guest bedroom. \"Come on, follow me!\" \"You're sure you don't want to play it out here with us, Jason?\" his father asked him before they entered the bedroom. \"I'm kind of curious to see how it works.\" \"Thanks, but no thanks,\" Jason told him. \"We're only two years away from becoming full-grown adults. We'll play in solitude so that you guys can have your fun.\" His father sighed. \"All right, then. Enjoy your game.\" The teens stood still and watched as he led the adults back upstairs. \"He shouldn't have to worry,\" Jason reassured his friends as they walked inside the guest bedroom, which featured a king-size bed and a wooden table with four chairs around it. The table was positioned right beside a large window that provided everyone with a great view of the backyard. Jason quietly closed the door once everyone was inside. \"We'll just play a round or two, have cake, and then play some more until we finish.\" \"Is the cake homemade, too?\" Cody asked. \"Of course it is,\" Jason replied as he set the game onto the table, opening the lids. \"I actually made it along with my mother, and I'm very proud with how it turned out.\" As he spoke, he opened a compartment on the right flap, and he dug out four tokens. Like the game board itself, the tokens were carved in great detail, and they came in the shape of a monkey, a rhino, a crocodile, and an elephant. \"Well, these are some pretty nice-looking tokens,\" Jason commented. \"I'll pass them around now.\" Michael received the monkey token, Tessa received the crocodile, and Cody received the elephant. Jason kept the rhino token for himself. Suddenly, the tokens flew out of their hands, and they each skidded towards a corner of the board. Everyone's jaws dropped in amazement as the tokens stood upright, all by themselves. \"Is this board magnetized or something?\" Cody wondered as Jason reached across the board to open the compartment on the left flap, pulling out a pair of aged dice. \"Michael, you get the first roll,\" Jason said to him as he placed the dice in his hand. Michael shook the dice for a couple of seconds before dropping them onto the board, and they landed on a one and a two. \"Three,\" Michael called out. He was about to grab his token, but he paused when it silently slid three spaces, all on its own. \"Okay, whose turn is it now?\" he asked as he prepared to hand the dice to the next player. \"Wait,\" Jason said, pointing to the crystal orb in the center of the board. It was beginning to fill up with green mist. \"Look here, everyone! The crystal is doing something.\" Everyone leaned in to take a closer look, and they watched in awe as yellow smoke began to swirl around, and it formed words that spelt out a riddle. \"Read it, Mike.\" Michael read the text aloud... \"Stripes of yellow and black they bring, Best beware their fearsome sting.\" Author's note: I hope you enjoyed this chapter! Judging by the riddle, what do you think will come out of the game? Stay tuned to find out! :D[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 - The First Few Turns Author's note: Hey everyone! I'm back with the third chapter of the story, and now the action shall begin! First, as always, I'll respond to your reviews. JOHNHAMMOND1993, Van Pelt won't appear in this chapter, but he will in the next one! The idea of Van Pelt winning a costume contest is a great idea, and I'll make sure to include it later! Guest, sorry if I made you hungry! I was just doing what I can to develop the story and make it more realistic and believable. ;) dragonserpent18, are you scared of wasps? If so, don't worry. I used to be terrified of them ever since I was stung by one at the age of seven. It stung me right on my ear, and it hurt like mad. Now, however, that phobia is pretty much gone, and I have since developed a healthy level of respect for them. What's weird is other venomous creatures such as spiders, centipedes, and ants have never scared me a single bit. My dad is terrified (and I mean TERRIFIED) of spiders, so he always puts me in charge whenever he wants a spider to be gone from the house! Guest, I'm glad you caught that! It was my intention for Jason to make that ironic statement. Now, on with the story! As soon as Michael finished reciting the game's first riddle, a swarm of vicious wasps suddenly flew out of the ceiling vent. Everyone ducked for cover as the insects flew all around in each and every direction, until Cody suddenly stood up with his wand pointed outward. \"Reducto!\" he cried, but nothing happened. Instead, he began to annoy the little creatures, and one of them stung him on his left ear, causing him to yelp in pain. \"Cody, this game has nothing to do with Harry Potter!\" Michael told him as a few began crawling on his face. \"Snap out of it, stay still, and they won't sting you!\" \"I'm calm,\" Cody said quickly, and he dropped his wand onto the floor. \"I'm cal—YEOW!\" Another wasp suddenly stung him on the forehead, causing the area to become just as red as his lightning-bolt scar. \"Clearly, you're not calm!\" Tessa shouted as she walked up to the window. \"Look at Michael and Jason! Use them as an example!\" Cody looked at the other two boys, who slowly and calmly stood up. The wasps paid little attention to either of them, and they continued to attack Cody instead. \"HEEEEELP MEEEE!\" Cody screamed as he received a sting on his right cheek. \"Too bad Alohomora doesn't work on these things,\" Tessa grumbled as she began to fiddle with the window's latch. After a few seconds, she finally unlocked the window and the wasps quickly flew out of the room. \"Quick, close it before they decide to come back!\" Jason told her, and she slammed the window shut. He then walked up to Cody, whose face was covered with little red spots where the wasps had stung him. \"Oh, dear, this looks pretty bad. I'll be right back.\" He ran into the bathroom to grab some supplies. Seconds later, Jason returned with a roll of paper towel and a cup of vinegar. He ripped off a large piece of paper towel, dunked it into the vinegar, and began to dab the spots where Cody was stung. Instantly, Cody let out a sigh of relief. \"Feeling better, Cody?\" Jason asked, and Cody nodded in response. \"Why are you using vinegar to treat him?\" Tessa inquired. \"Don't you remember what you learned in science?\" Jason asked her as he continued to dab Cody's face with the vinegar-soaked paper towel. \"Wasp venom is a base, and vinegar is an acid, so it neutralizes the venom. I have to do this quickly before the venom has time to sink in.\" \"I'm not sure if I remember that,\" she responded as Jason quickly dabbed the last spot. \"I guess I was too busy with—\" \"Don't make excuses,\" Cody said. \"Okay, I feel much better now. Whose turn is it?\" \"I believe it's my turn now,\" Jason replied, and they all sat down at the table. He took the dice and rolled a four and a one. Jason's rhino token moved five spaces, and another riddle appeared from inside the crystal orb. \"This will not be an easy mission, Monkeys slow the expedition.\" Michael heard the sound of glass shattering from upstairs, followed by panicked screams, along with the unmistakable shrieking of monkeys. \"What the hell is going on?\" Cody asked. \"Shit!\" Jason shouted. \"It sounds like the monkeys are invading the kitchen! Come on!\" He bolted across the rec room, and the other three teens followed him closely from behind. They scrambled up the stairs, but their forward progress was suddenly halted as all of the adults stampeded down the hallway towards the front door, and a dozen brown-furred monkeys were hot on their heels. Jason's father frantically opened the door, and he was screaming like a schoolgirl as the monkeys chased the terrified adults out of the house and down the street. \"Well, that was a close call,\" Cody said, sighing in relief once he saw that the coast was clear. He ran towards the front door, which was still wide open, and he closed it before returning to the group. \"I guess that means we're the only people here now.\" \"I don't know,\" Jason said nervously. \"I can still hear sounds coming from the kitchen. Let's go.\" Jason led them down the hallway towards the back of the house, where the kitchen was. When Jason threw open the door, he could not believe his eyes. The entire kitchen was overran by twelve more monkeys that apparently chose to remain in the house. Knives, forks, spoons, bowls, and plates were being tossed around like toys. One of the monkeys was stealing food from the fridge, another one was taking a bath in the sink, and yet another one saw absolutely no harm in raiding the china cabinet, sending dozens of fragile mugs and plates crashing down onto the floor. \"I can't believe this is happening,\" Jason said quietly as he watched the scene unfold before him. Suddenly, he noticed that the large, glass tray containing his birthday cake was still on the counter, and four of the mischievous primates were heading straight for it. \"Oh, no you don't!\" he screamed as he bravely ran towards the counter with his arms outstretched, but before he could get to it, the monkeys snickered at him, and they pushed the tray right off the counter, sending shards of glass and pieces of birthday cake all over the floor. Jason ran back towards his friends, who were staring in shock at what had just happened. \"Look out, everyone!\" Michael suddenly yelled as he watched a monkey open a drawer, which contained four razor-sharp knives. The monkey looked directly at him with a sinister grin as it grabbed the knives by their handles. \"They found the really sharp knives! RUN!\" Jason slammed the door shut just as the monkey hurled the knives across the kitchen, and their blades pierced right through the door, sticking out of it like deadly spikes. \"Well, we barely escaped serious injury there,\" Michael said, sighing in relief once he saw that everyone was okay. \"Yeah, but my birthday cake has been destroyed,\" Jason lamented. \"The birthday cake should be the least of your worries now,\" Cody said arrogantly as they ran back downstairs to continue playing the game. \"Who knows what could come out next? It could be literally anything as far as I'm concerned.\" \"Wait,\" Tessa said, pointing to the instructions again once they sat back down. \"It says that once we finish the game, the consequences will vanish. We just have to keep playing, and roll with the punches. Plus, it's my turn now.\" Tessa grabbed the dice in her hand, and after she rolled, they landed on three and two. Her crocodile token moved five spaces, and the orb displayed yet another cryptic sentence. \"In the jungle you must wait, Until the dice read five or eight.\" \"What could that mean?\" Jason wondered. \"Well, at least we now know what to do if something bad happens; roll either a five or an eight.\" Cody suddenly let out a blood-curdling scream. \"Tessa! TESSA! YOUR HANDS!\" Everyone watched in horror as Tessa's hands began to vaporize in front of her. A few seconds later, she screamed as her arms began to stretch out towards the center of the board, and her body followed, turning the terrified brunette into a thin ribbon. Eventually, her body began to disintegrate as if it were made of sand, and she began to swirl around and around as a vortex sucked her towards the crystal orb. Cody reached his arms into the vortex in an attempt to free Tessa from her impending fate, but it was all to no avail. Finally, she was gone, having completely vanished inside the game. \"No, Tessa!\" Cody shouted. \"We must bring her back as soon as possible, because we don't know what else could be inside that game!\" \"It's your turn, Cody!\" Michael urged. \"You can bring Tessa back if you roll a five or an eight!\" \"I can't believe it,\" Cody whispered, still in shock about what happened to his friend. \"She's gone. Tessa's gone!\" \"Please,\" Jason calmly told him, \"just roll. It's for her sake.\" Cody hesitantly picked up the dice, and he shook them in his hand for much longer than necessary before finally rolling a one and a two. \"I'm sorry, Tessa,\" he mumbled, sighing as his elephant token began to move three spaces, and everyone leaned towards the crystal orb as he read the next riddle... \"They grow much faster than bamboo, Take care or they'll come after you.\" \"That should be an easy one to guess,\" Michael retorted as large cracks suddenly began to appear in the walls. Hundreds of green vines began to grow from within the cracks, and they slithered into the room, growing larger and larger at an astonishing rate. Leaves sprouted from the largest vines while others began to creep along the floor, and Michael, Jason, and Cody had to lift their feet off the ground as the vines continued to grow, slithering under and around the table. Within seconds, the three teenagers were surrounded by vines, and the room began to look like the inside of a jungle. The boys watched as a purple flower began to bloom from one of the vines, and it shot purple barbs that missed Cody's head by less than an inch. They flew past him and embedded themselves into the wall. \"What the hell are those things?\" Cody asked, staring at the barbed projectiles. He pulled one out of the wall, and a thick, clear liquid was oozing from it. He dropped it before the liquid had a chance to come into contact with his skin. \"Guys, I think these barbs are poisonous. If you see a purple flower aiming itself at you, run immediately!\" \"Do you have an axe, Jason?\" Michael asked, even though he was certain the answer would be no. Sure enough, Jason shook his head in response. \"Well, we can't stay here forever,\" Cody told them. \"This place is starting to become very dangerous. We should really get out of here.\" He put the dice back into their compartment and shut the lids, and he began to lead the others out of the room, with the game tucked under his arm. Michael was at the back of the group, and just as Cody began to open the door, Michael let out a terrified scream. Jason heard a dull thud from behind, and he whipped his head around. \"No! Michael!\" Jason yelled once he saw what happened to his best friend. A vine had tightly coiled itself around Michael's left ankle, and he was screaming and writhing as it began to drag him across the floor. \"Just hang tight, buddy!\" Jason said as he ran towards Michael, grabbed onto his arms, and pulled as hard as he could. Even when using all of his strength, the vine was still pulling Michael backwards. \"Cody! Help us, please!\" Cody put the game onto a nearby dresser and ran over to Michael. He grabbed onto Michael's arms along with Jason, pulling on them with all of his might. The powerful vine was still winning in this terrifying game of tug-of-war, and the situation became much worse as an enormous pod broke through the wall. It had four, bright-yellow petals that were reminiscent of insect mandibles, and the vine kept pulling Michael towards its thorn-covered mouth. Michael screamed in terror as the carnivorous plant spread its jaws wide open and roared loudly. \"I'll be right back!\" Jason said, letting go of Michael. \"Keep holding his arms, Cody!\" \"Where the hell are you going?\" Cody growled. \"This plant is about to make a meal out of your best friend!\" \"I've got a plan, don't worry!\" Jason ran into the closet, rummaged through some plastic containers, and pulled out a katana. He unsheathed it and ran back towards Michael, whose ankle was now less than a foot away from the pod's deadly jaws. \"Hiyah!\" he yelled as he raised the katana high above his head before swinging its razor-sharp blade towards the floor, aiming directly between Michael's foot and the pod's mouth. With a loud squelch, the katana sliced cleanly through the vine, releasing Michael from its grasp. The pod made a whimpering sound and retreated back into the wall, which now had a gaping hole left from when the plant first broke through. \"Are you okay?\" Jason asked Michael as he unraveled the vine from around his ankle. Michael responded by whimpering like a scared puppy. \"Hey, buddy, it's all right, okay? You're safe now.\" Jason gave Michael a hug, and he helped him to stand upright. \"Let's go back upstairs. We're going to finish this game sooner than you think, trust me.\" Author's note: I apologize that this chapter was much shorter than the previous two, but I hope you enjoyed it nonetheless! Please feel free to review, and, as always, stay tuned for more! :)[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 - The Hunter Author's note: Hi everyone, I'm back with the fourth chapter. To be truthful, this is the one I've been looking forward to writing the most, and you'll find out why as you read it. Anyway, on to your reviews: JOHNHAMMOND1993, you'll get the answer to both of your questions soon! Sonny April, thanks for providing your feedback! I have a strange habit of talking to myself for some reason (don't ask me why), so that could be the reason why Michael was doing that in my story. I know that I can sometimes go into too much detail while writing, and to be honest, it's a problem that I've been struggling with since I was a kid. I am trying my very best to write more concisely, but sometimes it's a tad difficult for me to do so. I hope you understand. On another note, I'm glad you enjoyed the pawn shop scene. With that aside, on with the story! \"This sure is turning out to be one hell of a birthday,\" Jason muttered as he led Michael and Cody across the vine-filled rec room towards the stairs. They closely followed Jason from behind, and they constantly watched their steps so that they wouldn't fall victim to any more carnivorous pods. A few more purple flowers began to bloom, and the group warily stepped past them, keeping a close eye on the flowers' movements. \"I'm sorry that I dragged you guys into this,\" Michael apologized. \"I heard the game's drumbeats and my curiosity took over. I didn't know that there would be so many dangerous jungle creatures hidden inside.\" \"C'mon, Mike, cheer up!\" Jason told him. \"Yes, this definitely wasn't what I was expecting. I know that my family is in grave danger, and I'm well aware that the basement is now in complete shambles, but the consequences will all go away once the game is over. Just act like the young man you are, okay?\" Michael sighed. \"Okay, if you say so. I'm getting nervous, though, because it's my turn now.\" \"Just think of it as another adventure, another surprise, and another discovery,\" Jason said with a smile as they walked back up the stairs, which were free of vines, much to everyone's relief. \"You like it when you run into new enemies in your video games, right? It's the same thing, but in real life.\" The trio arrived on the main floor once again, and Jason led them down the hallway towards a pair of sliding, frosted glass doors. \"Let's continue playing the game in the study,\" he said as he slid one of the doors to the side. Inside the study, there were two bookshelves with hundreds of books, a computer desk that was home to an elaborate gaming rig, a coffee table with four leather armchairs positioned around it, and a pair of double doors that led outside to the deck. Jason placed the game onto the coffee table, and everyone made themselves comfortable as they sat down. \"Buddy,\" Jason said as he handed the dice to Michael, \"it's your turn. You can do this.\" Michael took a deep breath, shook the dice in his hand, and rolled a four and a two. His token slid six spaces along the board, and another riddle began to form within the crystal orb. His voice trembled as he read it out loud. \"A hunter from the darkest wild, Makes you feel just like a child.\" Michael, Jason, and Cody looked at each other with nervous expressions on their faces, and then... BOOM! A deafening gunshot broke the silence, and a tall man opened the door that led into the study from outside. He wore a black shirt with a red necktie, along with khakis, leather boots, a pith helmet, and a black cape. His long, blond hair stuck out from underneath the pith helmet, and it matched his thick mustache that stretched across his upper lip. He was holding an elephant gun from the early 1900's in his hands, and he pointed it straight at Michael, who quickly bolted out of the room. \"Nobody runs from Van Pelt and lives, you coward!\" the man shouted as he began to chase Michael down the hallway. \"Come back here and face me like a man!\" Michael continued to run towards the front door, fueled by adrenaline and sheer terror as Van Pelt cocked his rifle and fired another bullet in his direction. With nowhere else to go, he threw open the door and ran outside. \"Run all you want, Sonny-Jim!\" Van Pelt yelled as he shot another round through the open doorway. \"I'm coming for you, ready or not!\" Outside, Michael continued to sprint down the street with Van Pelt in hot pursuit. The big-game hunter relentlessly fired his gun at Michael, barely missing him each time before reloading mid-step. Suddenly, Van Pelt heard the sound of a roaring engine, and he was violently knocked down towards the pavement as something hit him from behind. His gun clattered to the ground. Michael turned around to see who had rendered his enemy unconscious, and he smiled as Jason grinned at him through the windshield of his father's Corvette. He opened the passenger door for Michael, who quickly climbed inside and buckled up. \"Whew, that could have been just a tad worse,\" Jason said as he shifted the car into reverse and floored the accelerator. Van Pelt was lying face-down in the middle of the road, completely unable to move a muscle. \"Are you okay?\" \"I'm fine,\" Michael said while trying to catch his breath. \"Thank you for rescuing me from Dan Belt, or whatever his name was.\" \"Hey, anytime,\" Jason said, patting his best friend on the shoulder. \"I can assure you that he's unconscious, at least for now.\" \"For now, yeah,\" Michael replied gloomily. \"I'm sure he'll come back sooner or later to finish me off for good, though.\" \"Please, Mike, stop being such a pessimist!\" Jason exclaimed as they returned to his family's residence. He quickly backed the car into the driveway and turned off the engine. \"Keep your spirits up, because that's how we will win. Wish me luck on my next roll, will you?\" Michael nodded, and they walked back inside to continue the game. Author's note: I hope you enjoyed reading this chapter! I know that it was very short, but the next one will be longer. What do you think Jason's next roll will summon? Stay tuned to find out! :)[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 - A Timely Reunion Author's note: Hi everyone, I'm back with the fifth chapter of my Jumanji fic! Sorry about the long wait. I was very busy over the past week with work and other obligations, and when I did have the time to write, I had to rewrite this chapter twice as I was not satisfied with how it initially turned out. Now, it's response time! JOHNHAMMOND1993, while Van Pelt has been knocked out, he's probably immortal as far as I'm concerned. In the movie, a whole shelf full of paint cans fell on top of him in the department store. That would have seriously injured, if not killed, a normal human being. Sonny April, you don't need to apologize for the criticism. I understand that you're trying to help me become a better writer, and I applaud you for that. As I said, I've been trying to refine my skills for quite a long time, and it's just a sign that I'm not quite there yet. Therefore, your constructive criticism is much appreciated. And in regards to your review of the previous chapter, do you seriously think I'll only reuse the hazards from the movie? That would be boring now, wouldn't it? ;) Now, on with the story! \"Did I miss anything while you were gone?\" Cody asked as Michael and Jason met up with him in the study. He had already sat back down in his chair, observing where everyone's tokens were positioned on the board. \"That Van Pelt guy sure looked menacing.\" \"He seems to be after me,\" Michael said, \"and only me. I think it's because I'm the one who rolled the dice, so he automatically goes after whoever summons him first. Speaking of which, Jason, it's your turn now.\" Michael and Jason both sat down at the table, and Jason clutched the dice in his fist. Please roll a five or eight , he thought. He finally decided to roll, and the dice landed on a four and a one. \"Thank you,\" he said aloud as his token moved five spaces. \"Hopefully this means that our missing friend will return, because we'll need her in order to make any further progress.\" A few seconds later, the crystal orb displayed yet another riddle. \"His fangs are sharp, he likes your taste; Your party better move poste haste.\" Just then, a low, rumbling growl was heard from behind, and the three boys slowly turned around to witness their latest threat. Michael barely managed to suppress a gasp as he saw an enormous lion standing right in front of him. The lion's nose was twitching, almost as if he could smell the fear within Michael. \"Whatever you do, guys,\" Cody whispered, \"don't make any sudden moves. Let's just back away very slowly.\" Suddenly, a female voice rang throughout the house, causing Jason to whip his head around. The lion roared loudly and began to charge at everyone. \"RUN!\" Jason screamed, and they bolted out of the study. The lion chased them all around the house, leaping across tables and over couches in a single bound. The trio ran towards the kitchen, and the big cat stopped in his tracks as Tessa dashed in front of him, waving her arms while shouting at the lion as loud as she could. She held a small, rusted knife in her right hand. Her robes were tattered, and her hair was a mess, but she appeared fine otherwise. \"Hey, Tessa's back!\" Jason whispered to Cody. \"It was all thanks to me.\" \"She's backing up towards the kitchen!\" Cody hissed in Jason's ear. \"Open the door!\" Jason got down on all fours to avoid distracting the lion from Tessa, and he silently turned the handle before pushing the door open. Tessa continued to yell and point the knife at the lion as she backed up, making herself look as big and menacing as possible. As soon as she reached the open doorway to the kitchen, she plunged the knife into the floor. The lion pounced, and with a ground-shaking roar, he leapt forward into the air. Just before he could grab Tessa by the throat with his powerful jaws, she crouched down to the ground. The lion leapt right over her and into the kitchen, which was now devoid of monkeys, and Tessa slammed the door shut, pushing on it to make sure it was closed tight. \"Whew, that was close,\" Tessa said, breathing a sigh of relief. She yanked the knife out of the floor, which now had a deep slit cut into it. \"You're back!\" Cody rejoiced, running up to her. \"Wait, what happened to you? You look like you had a rough time when you were gone.\" \"I was trapped inside a treacherous jungle until someone rolled a five or eight,\" Tessa explained while fixing her hair. \"There are so many dangerous beasts in there that it's a miracle I never suffered any injuries.\" \"I did it,\" Jason told her. \"I rolled a five, and that freed you from the jungle.\" \"Thank you, Jason,\" Tessa said with a friendly smile. \"Did you run into Van Pelt?\" Michael asked her. She cocked her head to one side in confusion. \"Who's Van Pelt?\" Tessa wondered. \"He's a big-game hunter with an elephant gun,\" Jason answered, \"and Michael's roll brought him into our world. He's really dangerous, but it seems he's after Michael, and only him.\" \"Well, thanks for the info,\" Tessa replied. \"I'll make sure to keep an eye out for him, along with you guys.\" \"Thank you, Tessa,\" Michael said as the group walked back towards the study. \"By the way, it's your turn.\" When everyone sat down, Tessa grabbed the dice in her hand, and after she rolled, they both landed on one. \"Ooh! You rolled doubles!\" Jason told her. \"That means you'll get another turn, but I think you must wait until after you've dealt with the next calamity.\" Tessa's token moved two spaces, and everyone leaned in to read the next hint. \"They march and eat, and march and eat, If I were you, I'd watch my feet.\" \"This can't be good,\" Cody muttered. \"I'd watch my feet...\" Jason said, putting a finger to his lips. \"Sounds like—OW!\" He jumped out of his seat as something bit him, and he looked down to see a large, black arthropod crawling up his leg. \"It's an ant, and it's freaking huge!\" \"Look out!\" Michael warned as an army that consisted of hundreds of ants began to march into the room. They were at least an inch in length, and their large heads bore a menacing pair of pincers. They also had a stinger on the opposite end of their segmented bodies. With nowhere else to go, Jason grabbed the game, and the four teens climbed onto the table as the ants began to surround it. \"Everyone, on the count of three, we'll jump,\" Jason told the others. \"That seems kind of reckless,\" Tessa spoke. \"If we jump, we could hurt ourselves on the floor if we land the wrong way.\" \"It's the only way to bypass the ants, though, so we're doing it,\" Jason told her. \"On the count of three, we'll jump, one at a time. One...two... three! \" Jason leapt off the table like a kangaroo, and he managed to safely clear the horde of ants. Michael and Tessa took their leaps of faith, and Cody, being the last to jump, barely avoided an ant who had its stinger pointed upwards. Jason closed the door once everyone made it out of the study. He pushed a heavy chest against it to block the ants from escaping underneath the door. Without saying another word, Jason quickly led the others up the stairs to the second floor. There was a large, open area at the top of the stairs, and he placed the game onto the floor before dashing into a nearby closet. He pulled out four beanbag chairs, and they sat around the board once again. \"Is everyone okay?\" Cody asked them as they examined their bodies for any wounds. \"Other than that one bite on my leg, I'm fine,\" Jason replied. Michael and Tessa both nodded to confirm that they did not receive any bites or stings. \"It must have been the ant's way of wishing me a happy birthday.\" Everyone chuckled at his subtle joke. \"On a more serious note, it could have been a lot worse. I'm just glad no one else was hurt.\" \"Hey Cody, you're up,\" Tessa said, pointing at the dice. \"No!\" Cody exclaimed, pushing her hand away. \"You rolled doubles. You get another turn.\" Tessa grabbed the dice again, and she rolled a two and a one. Her token moved three more spaces, and another riddle appeared within the crystal orb. \"Their boisterous laughing does provoke, In this adventure, they tell no joke.\" An eerie chorus of laughter suddenly rang throughout the house, and the four teens frantically looked around, trying to figure out where the sound was coming from. The laughter was also accompanied by deep growls and high-pitched yelps. \"Stay here, everyone,\" Jason commanded. \"I'm going to check this out myself.\" \"No, Jason!\" Michael yelled, dashing in front of the stairs in an attempt to stop Jason, but he simply ducked under Michael's outstretched arms and crept downstairs, one step at a time. Michael, Tessa, and Cody nervously watched him as three creatures came into view from below. They looked somewhat like dogs, except for their large, rounded ears. Their fur was golden with dozens of black spots. \"Oh, no,\" Cody said quietly, just loud enough for Jason to hear him from below. \"They're spotted hyenas!\" Fear coursed through Jason's body as he sprinted towards the kitchen. The hyenas began to chase after him, with their jaws snapping viciously. Suddenly, a trio of loud gunshots rang throughout the house, and all three hyenas fell to the ground, dead. Michael, Tessa, and Cody ran downstairs to see what the commotion was all about, and Tessa screamed as she saw the three dead hyenas at the end of the hallway, lying in a pool of blood. Jason was standing just in front of the kitchen door, shaking in fear as he gazed at the other end of the hallway, where the front door was. Michael peeked around the wall to see who had indirectly saved his best friend's life, only to hear the sound of a gun being reloaded. \"Ah, now I've got you right where I want you,\" Van Pelt said in a sinister tone, aiming his rifle as he slowly walked towards Michael.

I really like it, but I was not happy with the ending, and therefor wrote a story focusing on Alex and his life after he returns to his old life. How his connection to Bethany changes everything. A New beginning part 1 Seconds after I had grabbed Nigel's hand everything, and nothing changed. I was home for the first time in twenty years. A quick look on my calendar and the mirror confirmed my suspicion, not a day had gone by here. I was still a high school student when I returned. Before meeting the others inside the game I had originally thought I had just been inside the game for a few months. They told me something else, I had been missing for twenty years. Time had gone by surprisingly fast. Luckily I did not feel like a forty year old man when I returned. As I had stood in front of my mirror, trying to categorize myself with my own face again a though had suddenly entered my mind. I was no longer alone in the jungle. Without changing out of my sleepwear I ran in the direction of the living room. Before seeing them I could hear my parents voices, discussing something as boring as the weather. Thinking back I might have surprised them both when I began hugging and kissing them as tears ran down my cheeks. After what might have been forever they calmed me down, demanding to know what was wrong. I knew they might have a hard time understanding what I had gone through, after all it was a little hard to believe. Who would ever think to imagine that the game my father had found on the beach could transform itself into a video game and sucked me into it. That I lived in the jungle alone, hunted by dangerous men and beasts. That I waited twenty years until a group of four new players were sucked into the game. And how we all finished the quests together in order to return to our world again. My parents would have make me see a shrink. Instead I told them a small white lie. I told them I had a nightmare. In a way it was not a lie, it was a nightmare, just that I lived it instead or dreaming it. When we had all calmed down I still felt shaken up but asked them if I could stay home for the day. Already knowing for certain I could not go back to class acting as my normal self without making my friends suspicious. My mom protested at first, arguing that I had probably just stayed up all night playing video games and that was not a legit reason not to go to school. Not completely sane yet, just hearing the word video game made me afraid. It is almost embarrassing to think back at my reaction, but at that time I could not contain myself. I loudly began arguing with my mom, when that did not work my tears came back and I begged her to let me stay home. My father, who had silently stood on the sidelined during the argument stepped in, and told the both of us I could stay home. Mom tried to protest again, but my precious father just told her to look at me. To this day I do not know what she saw, but her eyes softened and she said I could go back up to my room. The second I walked through the doorway to my bedroom the first thing my eyes fell on was that dreaded game. My first reaction was to smash it, to break the game in order for it to never suck myself or anyone else into the game ever again. I even had it in my hands, high over my head, ready to smash it on the floor when a new thought had entered my mind. If I broke it, twenty years from now no one would start playing jumanji. Spencer, Fridge, Martha and Bethany would never play and therefore I would never have met them. Without the game intact I could never be free from it. I might even disappear. During our time together inside of jumanji, the four of them had informed me they were all in detention together when they found and started the game. With this knowledge I stuffed the machine, still containing the game into my backpack. Knowing the next time I was in school I would leave it somewhere they would find it twenty years in the future. Despite the fact that I had probably only spent one day and night together with them I felt a strong bond connecting the four of us. And in this world they were not even born yet. As I spent the day home from school I used all my time to write down everything I could remember from the game and the four friends I had met there. Every small detail which could help me identify them if I ever found them in real life. How Spencer was a small kid, and Fridge was huge and had been a member of the school's American football team. Martha had originally been a smart but shy girl who could not flirt with boys. And then there was Bethany. A girl trapped in a middle aged overweight man. She was the one I focused the most on. Her connection to her phone, and how she obviously was a beautiful girl who was popular with the boys. It might be because I was dying, but when she was giving me cps, I did not see Professor Shelly Oberon, instead my eyes was focused on a young beautiful blond girl. From that point I was almost certain I had seen the real girl behind the character. My erotic thoughts during the night slowly but surely changed its focus from celebrities and others around me, and began focusing on that blond girl instead. I had not even seen her properly, but she was the star and reasons for most of my orgasms in the following years. oOoOo Years went by, and slowly I managed to push most of the sad memories of loneliness away. Nonetheless they were never forgotten. Spencer, Fridge, Martha and especially Bethany all had a special part in my heart. My personality had changed a little by the experience. I was still a big fan of heavy metal, but I always had a fear of games. In the past I had loved them, and spent hours upon hours playing them daily. Now I almost got sick just thinking of playing something, especially electronic games. More than once my parents tried to make me seek professional help but I refused. I knew the reasons for my fears, and it was not something anyone could help me cure. Some of my former friends left me since the only real connection we had was based on video games, but most of them still stayed by my side. After a while they even stopped asking me what had triggered my fear, they accepted that it as a strange part of me. oOoOo One beautiful day I got the shock of my life. I was out walking on the street and two young boys around four of five ran by me. In front was a chubby black kid, and running after him was a small skinny white boy. The one in the back yelled toward his friend \"Wait for me Fridge! \" A few meters in the lead the other child stopped up and turned, facing his friend. When the other child replied with a \"you are so slow, Spencer\" before he turned around again and kept on running away, my heart stopped for a moment. Despite the fact I knew what I had experienced inside jumanji was real, this was the first time I had real evidence. The two children right next to me was part of that chapter of my life. They were real. During one of our conversations inside the game I knew the four of them would live close to where I had grown up, but it felt so wrong. What if I ever saw Bethany? She would be the same age as those two boys. The girl of my dreams was a small child. Just the thought made me sick. I was in my twenties lusting for a child. Well, I was lusting for the young woman she was going to become in around fifteen years. Nonetheless I had to change something. That evening I applied for collage in a different state and was accepted not long after. My parents was shocked by my decision considering I had never in the past expressed a wish to go to college. Despite my decision of not telling them, the both of them supported my decision with smiles on their faces. oOoOo My first year in college was a great opportunity for me to flirt with other girls, trying to forget Bethany. It did not work. When I flirted I imagined that it was her behind that faceless blond woman. A few times I talked with brunettes, but that felt just wrong. If I ever got as far as to kiss them it felt like I was cheating. Whatever I did I could not change the perspective. I could not make myself forget a child which was twenty years younger than me, even when there was more than a few girls interested in me. In the end I gave up. I reluctantly realized I would probably die a virgin, and in a way I was okay with that. Bethany was to young for me, and no other woman would ever be the one for me except her. To think just one day together with her had shifted my life so much. Despite everything I was glad I had met her. oOoOo More years went by and I became fascinated with the development of the mobile phone. As it evolved from just being a handheld phone, to something you could also send messages with and even contained a camera I began to understand some part of Bethany's addiction. Nonetheless the development did not stop there, internet for everyone to use on that small screen came with smartphones. Facebook, twitter and Instagram became big parts of people's everyday life, for some it was almost like it took over the lives of many. Seeing everyone around me, with their head down focusing on the small computer in their hands I began imagining how it must be for Bethany to grow up with a phone in her hands. Her small fingers holding it and playing around with it, probably sharing a big part of herself online for everyone to see. Just the thought frustrated me. In my more low points of my life I felt a strong need to log on to my own Facebook page in order to search for Bethany, Martha, and Spencer. I was even desperate enough to want to look up Fridge. Just a short look. Nonetheless I knew if I ever began searching I would never stop. oOoOo My mom got sick and died when I was around thirty five. Cancer. For a moment I hated everything. Then I remembered jumanji, and the fact I had been given a second opportunity together with both my parents. It helped a little. Fifteen years was after all more than I imagined ever been given the opportunity to experience when I was lost inside the jungle. My dad took it hard as well, but time went by and we often began having deep conversations over beer in front of the fireplace when I visited. In one of those late nights the both of us had had more to drink then we normally did and our subject shifted from the good old days and onto questions my father had about me. He told he he and my mother even had a bet about me. He would win if I was straight and my mother would win if I was gay. They had never seen me with anyone, and he argued that I was a social man, with a good job and personality, so the both of them could not understand how I had never had a significant other. For a moment I did not say anything except to look down on the label of the beer in my hand. After a few deep breaths I looked up and told him he won the bet. Hearing this he did not express joy or anything else, just looked at me straight in the eyes and asked me \"Then, why?\" It might be because we were both drunk, and the fact that I had kept the secret for fifteen years, but I asked him if he remembered that day I had argued with him and mom about not going to school, and how I suddenly began afraid of games. He told me he remembered. After he agreed to not intervene with my story I told him everything. Being sucked into the game, and how I lived alone in the jungle for twenty years. How glad I was when I met Spencer, Fridge, Bethany and Martha. I told him all the funny things, like we all looked like characters who had strengths which did not identify with who we really were. How I even knew how to fly a helicopter. When I had started talking it was like a dam had broken and the words came flowing out. When I told him meeting the two children on the street, and how they were my main reason for going to college my father gave a small laugh, but he did not interrupt me. I told him how Bethany has given me one of her lives in order for me to live. How I still felt connected to her. How it felt like I was cheating on her if I ever thought about another girl in a sexual way. She was twenty years younger than me, just a child, who did not know me and I loved her without having ever seen her in real life. At this point I was sobbing like a child. Dad put his drink down on the table and took me into his arms. Holding me for what might have been hours before my tears had wrung me dry. When I had collected myself enough to find my words again I asked him if he believed me. Even I had troubles believing my story most of the time, so I was not expecting him to understand what I had gone through. Instead my father shocked me when he told me he believed every word that came out of my mouth. His belief shocked me into my core. It was now his time to talk. How my assessment of what would happen if I had come clean that morning I came back was probably right. He, and probably my mother, would just tell me it was a nightmare. Then they would had found me a good shrink. The fact that he knew three of the children I was telling him about strengthen his belief that I was telling the truth. Dad confessed that he and my mother had discussed my behavior more than a few times over the years. They had considered everything from child molestation to abuse from classmates. Hearing the story I was giving him was both a relief to him and it saddens him since I had felt the need to carry the burden of my experience inside for all these years. The both of us was crying at this point as we held each other. oOoOo An:So there you have it, the first chapter. Hope you like my idea.[Chapter 2] an: finally done fixing this chapter. Jumanji- A new beginning part 2 A few more years went by and finally the right year came. I had opted to move back home to stay with my dad, no longer to afraid to meet the four teens who had changed my life. It did not lie well with me that dad was living alone in that big house in his old age, and since I had no family of my own except him I would not take up too much space. Dad welcomed me with a happy smile. Despite the fact I might never meet my former friends again I knew this year was something to celebrate anyway. What was happening with Spencer, Martha, Fridge and Bethany was the reason I was here today. It the teens had not found the game, I would never have returned. Never been given the opportunity to celebrate Christmas together with my father. I had a discussion with dad and the two of us decided to celebrate this years Christmas with extra decorations and present the house as a small castle. Even if I at this point was almost forty years I wanted to meet my former friends again. Nonetheless I did not dare to contact them first, if ever. oOoOo After work one day in December I went to buy a Christmas tree. With some help from the seller we managed to tie it to the top of my car. As I drove home my stomach was filled with butterflies for no reason. It was almost as if my body knew something I could not yet see. I stopped in front of my house, and dad came out to help me with the tree. When I turned around to talk to him I noticed something, or someone to be exact, standing a little further down the street. My heart stopped for a moment as I studied the four teens standing there, looking at me with the same question in their eyes. I know I told my father something, but I can not remember what. My feet was already dragging me in the direction of the four figures. As I was right in front of them I stopped for a moment to study them. One by one I address them with the correct names. I might not have seen them as they were presented to myself right now before, but even after twenty years I instantly knew who was who. And then there was Bethany. She was even more beautiful than I have ever imagined in my most desperate moments. Her eyes was sparkling, and her long blond hair framed her perfect face beautifully. It felt so right to have her close, to be lost in her eyes. In the end I had to shake my head a little, informing myself that I was twenty years her senior and it was not right for me to lust for a girl who was hardly legal. The age of consent in this state was sixteen, and I knew Bethany was older than that, but still it was morally wrong to look at her the way I was right now. Ordering myself to shift my focus I invited the four of them into my home. All of them agreed and walked behind me in the direction of the front door. There my father was standing, having seen everything which had just happened. He gave me a searching look and asked me if everything was okay. I returned with a big smile telling him everything was perfect. Then I introduced the four teens behind me. He obviously knew a few of them before since they said hello with a familiar clang to their voices, even Bethany. The only one he did not know was Martha. I gave him a small glare then, he knew about Bethany, and he had even seen her before me in real life. Dad just gave me a small pat on the shoulder, signaling that we would talk about it later. Seeing all of them inside my house, helping to decorate the Christmas tree together with myself and my father warmed my heart in a way it has not done since I was a child. If only mother would had been her to, then everything would had been perfect. When it became late the teens had to go home for the day, but they all promised to visit sometime in the future and we exchanged phone numbers. Before they walked out the door I had to ask them if they did not find it strange that I was now a old man. For a moment they were all quiet then Spencer took the lead \"Do you not find it strange that I am so young? After all in the game I was character older than what you are now. Fridge is tall in real life, Bethany is a cute girl and Martha is makeup free. We are all different that what the game portrayed us to be, including you.\" Bethany came forward and put her hand over my heart and said \"It is who you are inside that is most important to us, and I for one can feel the connection to you in this body as well as the one inside jumanji\" . She could probably feel my heart beating faster and faster but she did not remove her hand until I shockingly agreed with their statements. I could feel the connection as well. I have felt it for twenty years, I wanted to tell her. Unfortunately this was not something you told a girl so much younger than yourself. Soon after they all said goodbye and left. oOoOo Dad was waiting for me when I went to the living room again. \"Are you okay\" was the first thing he asked me. For a moment I did not know what to say. Everything was almost to much. She had been to much. Despite everything and our age different I did not feel like the group of teens was to young for me, I had fun commiserating with them. When they talked about jumanji, for them it had only been one day or so, but for me it had been twenty years. Nonetheless I could remember everything like it was yesterday for me as well. Even my lips tingle a little when I remembered Bethany's lips to mine. At that time she might have been a middle aged man, but I knew the pressure I had felt against my lips had been from that blond girl, not the middle aged man. Instead of answering my father, I focused on the fact that he had know three of them before. Dad replied that he did not exactly know them. In the past he had only known of them, but after I confessed my story to him he had began to say hello and such when he met them. After all, the boys at least went by our house almost daily. Bethany was mostly focused on her phone when she passed once in a while, but he had managed to have a small conversation here and there with her as well. When dad told me about meeting her I tried to dig for information. In the end he only replies with that he hoped she would grow up a little in the years considering how superficial she portrayed herself to be. I could not do anything except to laugh at his description. He was probably right, originally she would not be the type of girl which would interest me. But inside jumanji I had felt a connection to her the moment I had focused on the woman behind the character. She was special. A superficial teenager would not sacrifice one of her own lives in order to save someone she had met just a day before. In the end I told dad I felt the need to lay down. It might not be that late in evening but I was exhausted by today's events. Father could probably see the exhaustion on my face and let me go with a small good night and that the was proud of me. I felt grateful I had such an understanding dad and told him such before I walked up the stairs to my bedroom. oOoOo As I sat on my bed my thoughts was going over everything which had just happened. I had finally met them in real life, finally seen her. My heart was beating strong just thinking about her. She was everything I had imagined and more. I just wish she had been older. Right now she was way to young for me. As I sat there a thought suddenly struck me. She was probably a lot more experienced with the opposite sex than me. After all, inside the game she was the one trying to make Martha flirt with those guys. Comments from both her and the boys expressed a certainty on how she was popular with boys, and that she was an expert on flirting. Imagining her with someone else made a burning fire of jealousy fill my whole being. I had waited twenty years to just see her, and during those years others were given the opportunity to make her smile, laugh and to touch her intimately. My thoughts was broken when my mobile phone started beeping. As I touched the screen it light up with information from Facebook. Quickly I open the page and I could see friends request from all four of them. Without even thinking of it I added all four of them with a few touches. One by one I began searching their page for information, they had after all given me a silent permission when they had sent me the requests. Spencer's page was filled with information about different games and other geek stuff, Fridge's profile picture was of himself proudly showing his name on the back of his football shirt, and Martha's page was filled with complicated science information I had trouble understanding except for one thing, she hated sport. I had saved the best for last and looked on Bethany's page. It was filled with photos of herself, and often her girlfriends. A few times there was a guy standing next to her as well. Holding her waist, kissing her cheeks and such. My anger burned when I read a few of the comments under her pictures. Most of them was innocent, but a few comments from other guys pissed me off. Comments like \"i'd tap dat\" and guys references her to their baby or such made me almost hurl my phone in the wall. On her Facebook page she had a link to her Instagram page. I wish I never had pushed on that link. Suddenly I had access to a lot more pictures. This time they were a lot more sexual. The last picture she posted was of herself almost sleeping. She was not correctly dressed, and she was showing too much of her underwear. Did she not know there was a lot of perverted people out there who would love to watch pictures like this of beautiful young girls...like me. I was almost hard just seeing the pictures. Quickly after I had to put the phone away. It was not good for my health to see things like those seemingly innocent, but yet erotic pictures of Bethany. After turning of the light in my bedroom and making myself comfortable in in the bed, I soon fell asleep. I do wish I could have said my dreams that night was not filled with all the things me and Bethany could do together in my bed, but unfortunately I woke up the next morning with her name on my lip oOoOo an: Finally after waiting for twenty years they finally met. Hope the readers are still finding this ff interesting, and I promise the next update will be in around a weeks time.[Chapter 3] Jumanji - A new beginning part 3 Days went by and I got almost daily updates from Spencer. He told me he and Martha was finally a couple, and that Fridge was yet again the best friend he had during childhood. Fridge was working hard on one of the classes he had failed, but since he had both Spencer and Martha to help him I was going great. Bethany was not that into schoolwork herself, but she was cheering him from the sidelines. Every few days I would get text from Fridge and Martha as well. Everyone except the one I longed for. But, the texts from Spencer was filled with information about all of them. Spencer wrote to me how the people around them was all surprised by their changed personalities. Mostly those around Bethany. Nowadays she was not carrying her phone around as if she would die without it. She respected the teachers, well mostly, and was trying to convince her best friend to go camping with her. The four of them would hang around each other during free time at school. Some of their original friends had some problems with that, but none of them cared. In reply I told Spencer about my life these last few (twenty) years. Not all of it of course, who was I to tell a teen younger than me that unlike him I had never had a girlfriend. And of course I never told him why. I nagged about my job, and the responsibility of being a grown up. One evening, in one of the few phone calls between myself and Spencer he told me about how they all remembered my father and my house. Unlike everyone else the four of them remembers how I had been missing for twenty years and how my father had changed into a strange, sad, old man. How the house I was living in had been described as a haunted house. I am a man enough to admit I began crying when I imagined my father left alone in this big house, not knowing what had happened to me. The next time me and dad had a father and son evening in front of the fireplace with our beer in hand I told him about my conversation with Spencer. We both began crying while hugging each other, imagining how depressing that life must have been. Before going to bed that evening I told dad that I loved him. He replied with a \" I love you too, son\" . That night my dreams was not filled with Bethany, og nightmares from my time alone in jumanji. It was filled with the sad life my father had experiences in another reality. The next morning I had troubles opening my eyes because of all the tears I had cried during my sleep. oOoOo Everything changed yet again with one small text. As I sat at work in front of my computer my phone made a small sound, signaling a new message. When I opened the message my heart stopped. \" I miss you\" . Three small words, sent from Bethany. I had no idea what to reply, and therefore let the phone lie on my desk for hours as I tried to finnish today's tasks. When my workday was over I had hardly done anything except to think of those three small words. Honestly I wanted to call her in order to confess how I had missed her for over twenty years. But I could not make myself do so. It was not right. The message followed me during the whole day. Out shopping at a supermarket. While trying to decide which milk to buy, a small whisper in my head, I miss you , distracted me. Sharing dinner with my aging father, the words kept on distracting me as he talked. In the end dad stopped talking, having realized I was not listening. After the meal I helped him clean up. I might have told him good night as I went up. As I stood in front of the bathroom mirror looking at my aged face I could not comprehend how someone could miss this, miss me. There was nothing special about me. Lying in bed that night the words cept on flowing back and forth. I miss you, I miss you, I miss you. No getting a wink of sleep I gave up when the clock bicked four. Sitting up in my bed against the headboard I grabbed my mobile from the nightstand. No longer having the energy to resist what I wanted, I typed in a few words and pushed the send button. \" I miss you too\" . I waited a few minutes for a reply, but when nothing came I concluded she was probably asleep. At least I felt a inner calm having managed to send off an reply and therefor fell asleep. oOoOo The next day I woke up with my phone still clutched in my hand. No new message. On one hand I was disappointed, on the other I was kind of relieved. She was still a teenager and therefore nothing good would come out of it. Days came and went. No new message from Bethany. Like a weak man I searched online for updates on her Facebook profile and her Instagram page the next weekend. I just needed to feel close to her in one way or the other. Since that time when she and the other three teens had helped me and my father decorate our Christmas tree I had visited her pages more than I felt comfortable to admit. When I logged on and found her profile this time I was met by a shock. Most of her pictures was gone. All of the sexy ones had been removed and instead there was pictures of a smiling girl surrounded by friends, or pictures from nature trips she had taken these last few months. Like me, the experience from jumanji had probably changed her view on life as well. Considering how jealous and excited I had been by those pictures I was glad they were gone. Nonetheless I missed them. They were a way for me to see her when I could not do so in real life. A way to still my hunger. Without thinking about it I sent her a text message asking her why she had deleted her photos. Before I could put down my phone again it beeped, signalizing a new text. It was a reply from her. She wrote \" I do not feel like they represent who I want to be any longer.\" Not even giving me an opportunity to reply she sent another text \" Why? Do you miss them?\" How do I answer something like that without sounding like the perverted man I was? Of course I missed them, but seeing her in so little cloates was not something she should advertise online where everyone could see them. Selfishly I felt like they should be for my eyes only. Acting more my age than I felt right now I relied with a \" I think you made the right choice, somethings should be left in private.\" Her next text made my blood flow south \" Do you want the private pictures?\" Hell yeah, I wanted to send back. Instead I had to act as the grown up out of the two of us and wrote back, informing her that it would not be right for her to send those pictures to a man twenty years older than her. Her next reply almost broke me \" What if I want you to see them?\" Oh, how I wanted to see them. With sweat running down my face, and shaking fingers I typed, and retyped a message again and again. In the end I just wrote back \" It is not right.\" With those words I did not lie to her, I just told the truth. Luckily, for my health, she didn't text back. oOoOo An: little short, but I thought it was a good place to stop for now.[Chapter 4] Here is the next to last chapter, a little sad, but I think its something which needed to be written. Jumanji- A new beginning part 4 Months later, one late Saturday she began texting me again. This time she was obvious at a party, and probably had more than her fair share of alcohol. It started almost innocently \" Why are you not here?\" and \" Wish you were her\" in the end I decided not to answer her, arguing with myself I was doing the right thing. Despite my lack of replies as the hours went from evening and over to night time the text kept on coming. \" Boys my age are so stoooopid\", \"Why do you not want me, I want you\" and the one who almost broke me \" I miss you\". I started walking back and forward in my room, loudly talking to myself in order to try to convince myself I was doing the right thing in not answering her. After midnight her text escalated in a way I did not like at all. \" His hand doesn't feeel good as yours\" and \" who d guys no tak a no for no\" . I was beginning to rip out my hair in frustration. Instead of texting her I sent a text to both Spencer and Fridge, asking them if they were around Bethany. Hoping they could stop whatever was happening with Bethany. Shortly after they both replied that they were home alone. Fridge knew of the party and said he could send me the address if I wanted it. When I got the next message from Bethany I broke \" Save mee...\" . I grabbed the keys to my car and called Fridge, telling him to give me the address. He did not question the desperation in my voice and told me where the party was as I started my car. Luckily the address was not far from where I lived and in less than a two minutes later I parked outside a building where the music was louder than what should be legal. Walking inside I felt older than I was. All around me barely legal boys and girls was drinking and partying harder than all my years combined in college. Desperately I looked around for the familiar blond hair. Pushing my way through the masses as I searched around I saw something which made my eyes turn red. On a couch in the left corner of the room was two figures. One big guy touching the breast of a girl who lying on the couch as she was hardly responding. The bastard was touching my girl. With a strength I hardly knew I had I dragged the guy off the girl. Throwing him away without a care in the world. The guy came back and protested, but I just gave him a glare and he backed off. Bethany lied partly on the couch and partly lying down the side as a ragged doll. Not showing any reaction as I had removed the guy. I went down on my knees in front of her and looked straight at her, shaking her a little as I asked her if she was fine. Her glassy eyes found mine after a while. With a drunk smile on her face she finally said \" Heyyy, youuu…you came\" . I almost wanted to cry. I pushed her part of her hair away from her face as I asked her if she wanted to go home. She kept on looking at me, and gave me a small nod. I grabbed the phone which was lying in the floor next to her hand and put it in my back pocket. Quickly I concluded she was way too drunk to walk herself, and therefore I put one hand under her knees and the other under her shoulder. Pushing some strength in my knees I lifted her up from the couch and carried her out of the party. Around me I could hear someone cat whistle but I ignored everyone except the drunk girl in my hands. She let her head rest against my chest, and her hands touched the area where my heart was beating loudly. Honestly I almost felt like one of the heroes in romantic movies, carrying the female character out from a dangerous situation. My car was parked right outside the house and I managed to open the car door without dropping her. When I bent myself over her in order to put on her the seat-belt, one of her hands came up and held my face as she pushed her face forward. Her drunk lips touched mine for a second before her grip slackens and she feel asleep. Like a innocent schoolgirl I could no nothing except to touch my own lips in shock. This was not the way I thought my first kiss in almost a decade would happen. Least of all my first kiss with the woman I loved. In the end my back protested the position I was standing in and I backed away from her. Standing up I stretched a little as I looked around to see if anyone had noticed what had just happened. Luckily it looked like the drunk teenagers outside the house was to focused on themselves to see one small innocent kiss. Before walking into the car in the driver seat I gave myself a few deep breaths in order to calm my heart down a little. It was not until I started the car that I realized I had no idea where Bethany lived. I texted both Fridge and Spencer again for her address, but none of them replied. In the end I drove her back to my house. I know it might not have been the smartest thing to do, but I had nowhere else to leave her. Beside after having seen that boy over her I felt a strong need to comfort myself with knowing she was in a safe place. I might be a little obsessed with the girl sleeping next to me in the car, but there was no way I would ever touch her in an indecent way when she was unconscious. I just felt a strong need to have her close to me. When I parked the car outside my house I let my eyes rest on the girl beside me. How had thing ended up like this, why had she drunk so much, and why did she let that bastard touch her like that? When I had arrived she was barely conscious. Nonetheless she had texted me about someone touching her earlier and therefore she had to have been more conscious when she allowed that to happen. I let out a sad sigh. As the situation was right now, there was no way I was going to get an answer. When I got out of the car I noticed the light was on in the house. Dad was obviously still awake. As I walked around the car and opened the other car door, I heard the sound of the front door to my house opened as well. Looking over at the entrance I noticed my father standing there under the light. When he saw the unconscious girl inside my car he came closer obviously curious about the situation. I just gave him a negative shake and lifted the girl out and into my hands. Recognizing her face he obviously wanted to ask questions, but I stopped him when I whispered one word, \" later,\" as I walked past him. Since he had left the front door open it was easy for me to walk inside. Considering the guestrooms in our house had not been used in years I did not wish to leave her there. Instead I walked up the stairs and into my own bedroom. Laying her gently down on my own bed. As I put the duvet over her I gave a sad smile while looking at her face. She was wearing to much makeup, but she was still beautiful. Her lipstick was smeared as if someone had kissed her roughly. When I noticed it I almost felt like crying. Not wishing to see that detail any longer I licked my thumb and used it to rub of her lipstick. Removing any trace of someone stranger kissing her. Trying to remove the hint of the other boy. Her lips was nicer natural anyway. Seeing her in my bed my heart broke a little. Like the kiss, this was not the way I dreamt of her in my bed for the first time. In my dreams she would be awake, welcoming me with her thin arms stretched in my direction. I kissed her forehead gently. Leaving her phone on the nightstand and left the room. My father stood alone in the hallway waiting for me. I walked past him without saying anything. My head and heart was hurting right now and I needed a few seconds to myself. Without thinking about it my feet carried me to the kitchen where I grabbed a beer from the fridge. Drinking almost the whole bottle in one go. I grabbed another one and walked into the living room and sat down on the couch. My head was trying to collect itself after what I had seen and done in the last half hour. After a few minutes I felt the couch move a little as my father sat down next to me. Like past episodes on this couch I opened my heart to my father. Telling him about some of the text without going into detail. How Bethany had asked me to save her. I told him I had no idea where she lived and therefore could not take her home, and instead took her here. Almost shyly I even admitted how I wanted her close considering the state she was in. Dad listen to my story and told me I had done the right thing. He stood up and found me a pillow and a blanket since it was obvious I would be sleeping on the couch tonight. I went to the kitchen and filled up a glass with water and with two pills of aspirin I carried them up to my bedroom. I left everything on my nightstand next to her phone. Quickly exited before I gave in and gave her another kiss like I desperate wanted to do. As I am lying on the lumpy couch all my thoughts was centered on the girl upstairs. Considering she might be a little afraid waking up in strange bed I sent her mobile a message before turning of the lights for the night. \" Do not worry, nothing happened. You are at my house. Love Alex\" oOoOo an: Just one chapter left, and then this story is completed.[Chapter 5] An; the last chapter! Jumanji- A new beginning part 5 The next morning, after hardly any sleep, I made myself a cup of coffee. As I drunk it I stood over the sink looking into the back garden. I noticed dads car no longer in the driveway, and since it was Sunday he might be out visiting a friend. While standing there looking out at nothing interesting, a thought suddenly popped into my head. Yesterday I had put the word love in the text message I sent to Bethany. It was no lie, but it was wrong of me and I hope she would not realize what I wrote when she finally woke up and read the message. A few hours and three coffee cups later, I heard gentle footsteps walking down the stairs. From my place on the couch I just turned my head away from the tv and in the direction of the new sound. Dressed in one of my big band t-shirts and little else Bethany entered the living room. It was obvious she had tried to remove parts of her smug eye makeup from the night before with moderate success. Nonetheless seeing her like that was enough for my imagination to run wild. After gaping at her for a while she shyly asked me if she could get a cup of coffee as well. Without saying anything I stood up and made her a cup before handing it over to her as she waited on the couch. Not knowing how to handle the situation I quietly sat down on the other half of the couch. Finally finding my voice I asked her if she needed to contact her parents since she did not go home yesterday. She held both of her hand on the cup and would not look at me as she informed me they did not expect her to come home. They thought she was spending the night at her girlfriends house. Hearing she had planned yesterday to stay out all night made something click inside. In rage I stood up, and let one of my hands drag through my hair. No longer containing my frustration and worry from what had happened last night, I began yelling at her. All the things wrong with what had happened yesterday. Why she had gone to that party in the first place, why she had drunk so much, why she had texted me, and why the hell did she let that boy touch her. When I was done with my lecture she calmly put her almost empty coffee cup on the table in front of her and said \" Why should you care? It is normal for a young person, such as myself, to drink and to party. It is normal for girls my age to appreciate attention from the opposite sex. It it also, unfortunate, normal to drunk text the guys they think about.\" With her last words she looked me straight in the eyes, arguing me to question her logic. Her words left me speechless. I knew I had no hold on the young woman sitting on my couch, but in my heart there would be no one else but her. It hurt me that she let herself go like she had last night. With a low sadness to my voice I could not hold back one last question \" Does it not feel wrong for you?\" Was I the only one would would forever live without the touch of the opposite sex. More angry than I have ever seen her she pushed herself up from the couch. \" Of course it is bloody uncomfortable. You are the only one I want, but you do not want to have anything to do with me. You text Spencer as if he is your best friend. Even Martha and Fridge gets weekly tekst from you. By me? Me you ignore! It you ever reply to one of my teksts it takes hours, it not days before I get something small in return. You reject me at every possible opportunity I try to connect with you. So I drink a little to forget, and try to have a good time. But because of a connection to you, every touch from another man is uncomfortable. It is frustrating. I thought maybe if I drink enough maybe I might enjoy being touched. Guess what, it didn't work!\" By the end of her speech she was crying. Tears was running down her cheeks and I thought I have never seen anything so beautiful. Before I had realized what I had done my hands was around her petite waist. I was crying into her hair, begging her for forgiveness. After what might have been hours my hands loosen up and let her go as I took a step backwards. Gathering my courage I told her with a shaking voice that \" I didn't mean to make you feel that way. It is just that I have had twenty years with this connection. It is already a part of me and it has become natural for me not to touch other women since I came back from jumanji.\" Her eyes widen with realization. She might have felt rejected and alone for a few months, but I had waited for her a lot longer. \" But. But, why do you not want me?\" she asked with an uncertain sound to her voice. A little frustrated I dragged my hands through my hair a few times before I looked at her small figure again. \" It is not that I do not want you. I really do. I yearn for you in a way I did not think was human possible. But you are just a child, I am twenty years your senior. It is just not right.\" Stubbornly Bethany argued that she was no longer a child. She was even over the age of consent. Telling me that twenty years age difference was nothing. The connection between the two of us made it impossible for her to enjoy the touch of others anyway so I needed to get of my high horse and start touching her. Weakly I gave in and reduces the distance between us and grabbed her face with both my hands and let my lips crush against hers. I kissed her like I have never kissed anyone before. Letting the scent and taste of her indulge me as I kissed her as if I would die without her lips. She quickly reacted and returned the kiss with the same intensity. I felt her hands grabbing hold of my shirt and for a moment it felt like I had died and entered a heaven I normally did not believe in. In the end the kiss slowed down when the need for air was to much. Despite the fact we were both breathing hard we did not let each other go. No longer managing to told it back any longer I gently whispered against her lips that I loved her. She let her hands fall from my chest and instead circled them around my waist. Hugging me closer. Her response \" I love you too\" almost made my heart burst in happiness. Selfishly I held on to her for as long as I could before my mind began to think realistically again. With one last inhale of her scent I let her go and took a step back. Her questioning eyes searched mine for a reason as to why broke our hug. A little scared I did not dare to look in her eyes as I yet again proclaimed that a relationship between the two of us was impossible. Our age difference was to big for society to accept us. The silence in the room was depressing. Only broken by our loud breathing. My mind was transfixed on the kiss which had just taken place, but some part of my brain knew I had done the right thing when I ended the connection. Since it was probably the only real kiss I would ever share with the girl next to me I wanted to savor the feeling for as long as I could. In the end Bethany's voice interrupted my thoughts. \" Do you know the age difference between my parents are twenty three years? Even more important, dad used to be moms high school teacher? They are still happily married and have been for over twenty five years, and they do not share the connection I made when I gave you one of my lives.\" Her questions and statement surprised me. I had no idea. The last of my resistance broke and I could not do anything except to take her in my arms again. After a while we sat down together on the couch. Bethany was leaning against my chest and my hand over her shoulder, holding her close. It felt like I was dreaming. As we sat there we tried to discuss our future realistically. Despite the fact no one of us really felt like it, the both of us knew we should probably try to keep everything a secret until she had graduated in a few months. For now we should try to stick to texting instead of real meetings in order to hinder temptations. When we finally managed to let each other go I had managed to find some of my mother's former clothes for Bethany to wear. I loved my father too much to give him a heart attack. Not long after my dad returned home. Like I had in the past I told him everything, without too much details of course. This time with Bethany by my side. oOoOo Months flew by even slower that they did when I had been inside jumanji alone. After just a few days I had to order Bethany to stop sending pictures. It was not good for my heart. Her reply \" I like it when you are strict to me\" did not help at all. In the end I learned that the best for the both of us was for me to ignore those texts. Finally the day for her graduation came and as she accepted her diploma I clapped loudly with a proud smile. When she walked down from the stage she did not go to her parents like I thought she would. Instead she came right at me, grabbing a hold behind my head and dragged me down to an amazing kiss. At first I tried to protest, but then I thought what the heck, and dragged her even closer. Kissed her back with everything I had. When we stopped I heard a familiar voice loudly proclaiming \" I knew it, Spencer you owe me 50 bucks!\" As I turned in the direction if the voices a \" Aw man, could you not wait until after the ceremony Bethany?\" came from Spencer. Spencer, with his hand around Martha's waist and Fridge was all standing close to us. Everyone of them with bright smiles on their faces. Next to the group was the two persons I had been dreading for a while. Bethany's parents. Which had just seen their young daughter make out with an old man. Kill me now. Bethany, beautiful but ignorant Bethany, did not notice my tension and dragged me toward her parents. Eager to introduce us. Despite the fact that I wanted to run away I knew I had to man up and face the couple. I gave them a small smile when she introduced us, and shook their hands. \" So you are the man that changed my daughter\" Her mother asked me. To be completely honest I had no idea what she meant. Her mother noticed my confusion and said \" She stopped partying, and has these last few months become more grateful. To be perfectly honest, we know our daughter is spoiled, but lately she has grown mentally more than a few milestones. Her hand is no longer stuck to her phone and we can even have conversations with her face to face again.\" As her mom kept on talking Bethany began blushing. She was so cute! Not knowing exactly how to respond I carefully said that I could not take the credit for Bethany's change. She had made the shift herself personally after all, with some help from jumanji. But of course I could not tell them the last part. As I was talking to Bethany's mother her father had stood on the sideline with a slightly judgmental look. In the end I made myself focus on him as he opened his mouth. Then came a question I dreaded \" How old are you exactly?\" Not missing a beat I quickly replied with a \" Younger then you were when you started dating your wife\". For a moment I thought it might have been the wrong thing to say, but after a short pause he began laughing. With a sly smile on his face he tried to put on a strict demeanor and asked another dreadful question \" And what is your plan for the future with my daughter?\" Yet again I told him the truth \" Considering today is our first official day dating I was thinking marriage in around a years time.\" As both her parents laughed I felt Bethany's questioning eyes from my side. I gave her a bright smile and a nod. What I was given in return was a smile brighter than the sun. Since we were standing right in front of her parents I managed to hold back from kissing her. Instead I gave her hand a small squeeze. This might have been the first time I have ever mention the word marriage in front of Bethany, but I knew from the first real kiss that I wanted to marry her. Heck the next day I began searching for a unique ring. A week later I found the perfect ring, and since it had been lying in my nightstand drawer. Just hope she likes my idea with the emerald. After the ceremony was completed I accepted a dinner invitation from Bethany's parents. Everything went surprisingly well considering our age difference, and the conversations had a nice flow to it. oOoOo Two year to the day after Bethany had returned from jumanji we were married. oOoOo the end. an: I hope you have liked this story, and maybe it makes you finger itch to write stories yourself. Give me something to read. please. I need more ff to read. There is way to few ff related to this couple, and they deserve so much more.

He can see his victims future and past sins. But looking at her. He couldn't see hers. She had none. She was an innocent. D* mn. But he did see her all grown up. And he sure did like what he saw. He finally got onto the deck. The girl looked sad and bored. He walked up to her. \"Hi there.\" He greeted. She stopped playing with her long red and brown hair. And looked up at him. Her big brown eyes looked him up and down. \"Hi.\" She said. He noticed she had a Australian accent. \"What are you doing here all alone kid?\" He asked, looking around to see if her parents where around. Watching over her. But he didn't find them. \"I'm watching for people my age.\" She said, hopeful. \"How old are ya?\" Jack asked. \"Twelve.\" She replied. He nodded. \"Where's your parents?\" Maybe in their room? \"Don't know them. My grandpa is the new captain of the ship.\" She said. \"I'm sorry about your parents. I'm Jack. Jack Ferriman.\" He introduced. \"Katherine Harwood. But my pappy calls me 'Katie'.\" Jack smiled at her. \"Well. I'll see you around Miss Katie.\" He said, charmingly. She nodded, then started playing with her hair again and returned to look for a friend in the crowd. Jack walked away. Two days have past and during those two days, Jack watched Katie. Bringing her food. Giving we things, gifts. Katie didn't like it very much. She always noticed that he had this strange glint in his eyes when he noticed her. Or looked at her. A worker on the ship would play games with her since their wasn't any kids. She was now on the top deck. Bored out of her mind. She watched people dance. Francesca, the singer Katie gave roses to before tonight's show, saw her and waved. Katie waved back. Francesca wanted everyone to dance. Katie 's friend turned the toy that she was playing with. 'I'm bored'. Was shone on it. She looked up at him. He chuckled, and had to get back to work. A gloved hand appeared in front of her. She looked up and saw her grandpa. He smiled at her. \"Would you like to dance My Lady?\" He asked. She smirked, and nodded. He lead her to the dance floor. She was filled with happiness. He raised her her whole life and when he was working he didn't have time to be with her. So she loved these moments. To bad it was ruined. Jack heard a blood curling scream. His evil heart twisted painfully at the sound of it. He knew who's scream it was. His Katie. When things somewhat 'calmed down'. He went in search for her. His dark heart dropped when he DID find her. Hung and left alone. He growled at the sight. He vowed then and there that he will find someone and put his beloved Katie's spirit in them, so they can give birth to her. And then she'll be his forever[Chapter 3] Katie was in the rusted ships ballroom. Twirling around. A small smile graced the innocent ghost girl's lips. Her eyes were closed. She was finally able to relax right now. Jack was gone. Recruiting more 'sinners'. Katie enjoyed these rare moments of freedom from Jack. Even though she's a spirit now, he still scared her. He's still able to touch her. And he likes to remind her of that. He pins her to walls and puts marks on her ghost neck. He really seems to like that. Katie froze when the scent of peppermints wofted her senses. She turned and saw Jack leaning against the doorway. Smirking. She gulped, and took a step back. He saw this and disappeared. Only to reappear behind her. He wrapped his arms around her waist. And held her close. \"Why'd you stop?\" He asked. \"Let go.\" She whispered. He chuckled. \"You know. You'd be about eighteen years old right now. We'd be married by now. If only that idiot hadn't killed you.\" He said. Ignoring her request. Sadness filled the ghost girl. \"But don't worry my love!\" He exclaimed, happily. He spun her around and had her look up at him. He now had a huge smile on his face. \"I've finally found the perfect person to put your spirit into.\" He said, happily. Katie struggled in his grip. But she wasn't strong enough. \"Soon. You'll be reborn, and once you come of age. We'll finally be together forever. The boss has agreed.\" He said. Seeming to not notice the ghost girl's struggles. \"The group will be here soon. And soon My quota will be filled.\" He rubbed her arms. \"I better go meet with the group.\" Jack said. Then he kissed her cold dead skin. \"Just you wait darling.\" He whispered. She gulped a and backed away as soon as she could. He disappeared. Katie sat in the spot she stood. \"Oh I feel so horrible for those people.\" She sighed. Then disappeared as well.[Chapter 4] \"Epps! You can't get rid of me!\" Jack taunted. Maurleen growled, and Katie was now behind her. Epps swore to protect this spirit who helped her survive. \"Katie.\" Jack called in a taunting singing voice. \"Leave her alone you sick pervert!\" Epps shouted. Jack's chuckle surrounded the two. Katie whimpered and hugged Epps more. \"You care for the young ghost girl. I'll male you a deal. You allow me to put her spirit in you, and you'll give birth to her. No one is able to leave this ship. You'll get maybe a yard. But past that. You'll die instantly. So? What do you say Epps? The girl. For life.\" His voice paused. \"In fact. I'll even give you back your a bonus.\" Jack said. Epps heard Katie squeal. And the coldness of her disappeared. Then Jack finally appeared in front of her. Katie in his grasp. Epps grip on the shot gun fultured a bit. But she got it back Katie shook her head 'No'. \"Don't do it Maurleen. Don't trust him!\" Katie shouted. She ripped her necklace off and threw it at her new freind. Epps caught it. \"That should keep you alive. Hurry go!\" Katie said, before Jack's hand covered her mouth. \"Shut up!\" He growled at his ghostly obbsesion. He then looked back up at Epps. \"So Epps? Do we have an agreement?\" Jack asked. Katie shook her head 'No' again. \"Alright. I'll do it. But first answer me this. Why want her to be reborn again so badly?\" She asked. He chuckled and looked at the ghost girl. Epps saw something flash in his eyes, but it disappeared before she could put a name on what it was she saw. \"You'll have to find out... won't you.\" He said mischievously. \"Fine. But hold your end of your bargain first.\" Maurleen demanded. Jack nodded. And his eyes flew a bit. \"Epps?\" She saw her team. \"Happy?\" Jack mocked. Epps nodded. Katie shook her head sadly, before she was forced to evaporate into a glowing ghost ball. The ball was in Jack's hands. \"Drop your weapon.\" He ordered. She lowered her gun. He walked up to her. Then he chanted something and then shoved the orb into her stumic. She gasped feeling a numbing feeling in her. She then felt something stir in her womb. And she knew she truly pregnant. \"Goodbye... For now Epps.\" Jack said, and then it went dark for her and her freinds. ","Summary":" She will be mine. But cause of her death.

I loved the two films so much I really couldn't help writing, so I've created a series of 200 word drabbles that will hopefully be in chronological order. I want to thank Tatty Ted for encouraging me to write something for this fandom, so I'm going to dedicate this to her :) Please take the time to review if you would be so kind, and let me know what you think? Enjoy :) x Title taken from Scar by Simple Minds. Chapter 1 TRAVELLING THROUGH - Ivan sees Victoria for the first time - His tired eyes fell on her as soon as she entered the conflict zone; her hair as wild as her gaze as she fired at the enemy lines. Her lips were pulled into a queer smile as her fingers lightly pressed the trigger of the gun in her arms. She aimed with ease and killed with a grace he had never known, fleeing across the street to the aid of a fellow Englishman with the few bandages that she possessed. He watched as she worked quickly; her fingers weaving the intricate art of healing. A bullet caught her arm, but she did not waver. In that moment he knew she had stolen his heart. Ivan, the Russian force of indestructible determination, stood transfixed with awe and admiration for a lone English agent. He waited; his own gun positioned and ready to fire. She had been his target all along. But now, now that he had seen her; he could not bring himself to do it. She was like him; fierce, loyal, brave... but a killer nonetheless. They may only be passing through, but in his heart Ivan prayed that this would not be the last he saw of Victoria Winslow.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I do not own RED or any of its amazing characters. A/N: Thank you so much to Jennaya and adam-roslinlove for reviewing the first chapter! It means an awful lot.

Chapter 2 MOVING IN SLOW MOTION - Ivan officially meets Victoria - He watches her from across the table, fearful of making eye-contact. Their agencies have been flung together for the first time in years, desperate in an attempt to stop the common enemy. He can't believe she's here, within arm's reach. And she doesn't even know who he is. \"Ivan Simanov.\" He looks up at his name. \"Meet Victoria Winslow.\" Everything seems to move in slow motion as he meets her icy-blue gaze. She holds out her hand and introduces herself, \"Nice to meet you, Ivan.\" Her voice is soft and smooth, perfectly British. She's everything he thought she would be; her eyes neither cold nor calculating as they meet his own. Ivan grins, knowing in an instant that they were made for each other. Taking her hand in his, he shakes it firmly. \"Likewise.\" Victoria smiles back, but it doesn't quite reach her eyes. She watches him closely, staring into his very soul, as if trying to discern his character. He smirks shrewdly, finding he has discerned hers. She's like a bunny: a small, petite woman who looks so vulnerable, and yet, on the inside, there is a fierce and brave soul. His smile widens. That's what he'll call her.[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: I do not own RED. Unfortunately. A/N: Apologies for not updating sooner - I've been a little busy.

Chapter 3 SHADOWS - Victoria gets to know Ivan a little more - She spots the well hidden form of a man standing behind her immediately, his shadow standing just out of the shadowy alley. She can't hide her curiosity and quickly turns to face him; her gun half down by her side. \"Hello Victoria.\" His voice is unmistakable; he shouldn't even be here. She quirks an eyebrow as he comes closer, clad in winter gear, smiling. Victoria shakes her head, knowing she should focus on her mission. \"What are you doing here?\" Ivan shrugs his shoulders nonchalantly. \"I'm on an assignment.\" \"Really? Looks like you're quite busy,\" Victoria says almost amusedly as she regains her concentration. His eyes have that mischievous look again, glistening in the white winter snow as he smirks at her. His laugh is low and gentle. She doesn't realise how close they are until he speaks again. \"I've missed you.\" Victoria raises her gun slowly; her attention is elsewhere. She frowns, now aware that their position could be quite easily compromised. Ivan notices her unease, and nudges her arm. \"Don't worry, I took care of them.\" She stares at him for a moment, uncertain. \"All of them?\" \"Yes.\" Victoria smiles; she likes him just that little bit more.[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: I don't own RED or anything associated with it.

Chapter 4 MOMENTS BURN - Ivan rescues Victoria from a perilous situation - It had all gone wrong. One mislaid trust, one disadvantage. Victoria shakes her head, unable to comprehend how she managed to end up in this ridiculous situation. Her wrists burn from the cuffs; her cheek from the constant backhands of her tormentor. \"My patience is growing thin,\" he says. American. She smiles. \"Mine isn't.\" \"Tell me, or I'll kill you.\" \"That's not going to help.\" Were all these agents so stupid? The hand pressing on her throat is beginning to hurt. \"I'll never tell you.\" \"Then you die.\" There's a bullet in her thigh before she realises; the pain doesn't recede. He's about to put another in her chest when he falls to the ground. Dead. A figure approaches and hastily frees her from the restraints. He whispers. \"Did you miss me, Bunny?\" That dreaded nickname. \"Ivan, what are you doing here?\" He shrugs, and grins. \"Rescuing most beautiful woman in world?\" He drapes his coat around her, quickly putting pressure on the wound, and carries her out into broad daylight. Victoria relaxes against him, but she scowls nonetheless. \"You're going to get us killed one of these days,\" she says. \"Maybe\" Ivan replies, kissing her gently on the forehead.[Chapter 5] Disclaimer: I don't own RED or any of its characters.

Chapter 5 PEOPLE IN LOVE - Ivan confesses his feelings for Victoria - Ты мне нравишься – I like you я тебя люблю всем сердцем и всей душой – I love you with all my heart and soul моя любовь – My love He knows she waited for him, standing outside the café with her raincoat wrapped tightly around her. She's still as beautiful as he remembered, and he wonders what he's ever done to deserve such a woman. Victoria stares at him as he walks closer, her senses on edge. He doesn't want to ever leave her again. \" Did you miss me?\" he asks light-heartedly, although he can see the lines of worry and hurt across her face. Victoria swallows her answer, afraid she might let out all of her emotions at once. With a soft touch, Ivan pulls her towards him and presses a gentle kiss to her lips. She stops breathing. Is this really happening? \" What was that for?\" Ivan chuckles and kisses her again. \" Ты мне нравишься.\" With a frown Victoria pulls away. \"Like is hardly a strong word, Ivan.\" \" What did you want me to say?\" he asks, stepping forwards and lifting her chin so he can look her in the eye. \" The truth.\" Smoothing her hair, Ivan brings her closer to him, his eyes staring straight into her soul. \"Victoria, я тебя люблю всем сердцем и всей душой.\" She smiles and kisses him. \"That's better, моя любовь.\"[Chapter 6] Disclaimer: I don't own RED or any of its characters.

Chapter 6 CANDLES TO THE FLAME - Victoria thinks they should end their relationship - \"Ivan-\" She hates breaking the silence first. He meets her hesitant gaze, his arms still wrapped tightly around her waist, waiting expectantly. \"We can't keep doing this.\" The disappointment in his eyes is heart-breaking and she looks away, unable to take the pain. It's hard enough as it is. \"What we're doing is dangerous. If anyone ever finds out then we're dead. In fact more than dead. And if MI6 finds out-\" He cuts her off, a finger pressed to her lips. \"\"Zaychik moy, you worry too much.\" She shakes her head. \"Ivan-\" \"моя любовь, if you want stop seeing me then I will go\" he replies, rising from the sofa and heading for the door. She can't take it anymore. In one swift movement, Victoria reaches out and grasps his hand tightly, stopping him from going any further. \"No, don't…\" He pulls her towards him, the sadness in his voice evident. \"Do you not love me?\" Victoria moves closer to him, listening to the beats of his heart. \"More than anything else in the world.\" Taking her hand, Ivan gently kisses her palm and carefully places it over her heart. \"I always be in here. No matter what happens.\"[Chapter 7] Disclaimer: I do not own RED or any of its amazing characters. A/N: Hello everyone. Hope you are all well?

Chapter 7 IN SUMMERTIME - Victoria and Ivan meet in Paris - In summertime she smiles when he takes her out for coffees and helps her forget the emotionless world revolving around them, spiraling motionlessly and living for the moments that they have together. In summertime he kisses her cheek and strokes her hair, laughing when she rubs his stubble lovingly as they walk endlessly through the star-lit parks. In summertime she laughs at his jokes and loves it when he holds her close, whispering gently that he'll always wait for her no matter what happens. In summertime she loves him, and doesn't have to fear for their lives, knowing that together they can overcome the world and stand for something good. In summertime he forgets about war and conflicts, and loses himself in her soft smile, unwilling to imagine a life without her, and wondering if he would ever be able to let her go. In summertime she takes photographs, freezing them in a time when they were only themselves and didn't have to hide behind false facades and lies. In summertime their hearts collide, and he tenderly takes her hand and kisses her beneath the light of the lampposts, her arms wrapped tightly around his shoulders, reluctant to let go.[Chapter 8] DISCLAIMER: I do not own any of the characters or the plot.

Enjoy :) x Title taken from Scar by Simple Minds Chapter 8 I SEE FIRE - Victoria is assigned to kill Ivan - She couldn't believe the words she was hearing; the sheer emotions that stormed beneath the surface of her calm and professional exterior were almost too much for her to bear. It was never supposed to end like this. They were never supposed to find out. Of course, they had tried to be careful, never letting themselves be seen in public together when they weren't on a mission, and even then they had been cautious. Red filled her vision; a swirling black sea opened in the pit of her stomach and threatened to swallow her whole. Ivan could handle himself, but there was no backing out of this. If she didn't take on this operation then the consequences for her would be unimaginable. But was death worse than killing the love of her life? Ivan was everything to her. There was no other man like him, and she knew that there would be a large hole in her heart if anything ever happened to him that would never be filled again. And now she had been ordered to kill him. \"Do I make myself clear?\" \"Yes, Sir\" Victoria answered, wanting nothing more than to shoot a bullet through her superior's head.[Chapter 9] DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CHARACTERS OR THE PLOT.

It's their last evening together, and she wants more than anything for it to end as soon as possible, and at the same time last forever. \"Victoria\" he greets with an extended hand, the boyish grin of the agent she had met so many years ago replaced by a gentleman's smile. Before she can say anything else he's kissing her passionately; and it only makes her want to cry more. \"I've missed you\" she whispers truthfully and he chuckles. \"You are as beautiful as ever. Come.\" Victoria grips his arm desperately. She has to tell him. \"Ivan-\" \"Don't worry\" he whispers knowingly, and tucks a loose curl behind her ear. \"No one will see us.\" She can't do this. She really, really can't. \"Ivan, please?\" \"Zayckik moy, you have nothing to fear tonight\" he says, still smiling and leads her by the hand. Victoria knows her heart has stopped beating in her chest, for after tonight she is not sure whether she will have one, and if there is… there will only be blackened, broken shards.

The offices of the Russian Ambassador in Washington. D.C. could never truly be considered quiet but the scene it currently presented was the furthest thing from it. At shortly after 7 pm, Moscow time, two men (originally thought to have been spies) had been captured trying to break into a secure records room in the Kremlin. Both men had been quickly and easily identified as Americans and the C.I.A. had just as quickly disavowed all knowledge of the two men and their alleged activities. That had not been an unexpected reaction on the agency's part in any case as something about the captured men's actions seemed strikingly unprofessional. It had raised the alarm bells for Russian Ambassador, Ivan Simanov, to the point where he was inclined to believe the C.I.A. His office was a flurry of activity during what would have usually been their lunch hour. People were running in and out, delivering and retrieving reports, and carrying on rapid conversations in their native tongue in nearly every corner of the ambassador's normally spacious and grand office. The ambassador himself stepped back from his cluttered desk, having just replaced the phone's receiver in the cradle, and took in the organized chaos that surrounded him. As busy as the office appeared at that moment Ivan's previous experience in such matters told him the situation, as it was currently understood, would cool off come evening which would thankfully allow him to keep his dinner engagement with his fiancé, Victoria Winslow. As if she knew he was thinking of her Ivan felt his cell phone ring in his pants pocket. He pulled it out and a smile slid across his face as he saw her name light up the screen. Taking a furtive glance about the room Ivan ascertained that he would not be missed for a moment and he slipped through the sliding glass door onto his private balcony. The noise of the street was a welcome change from the buzz of the animated conversation that was currently taking place in his office. He took a cleansing breath and answered her call, the very thought of her immediately relaxing him. \"Zaychik moy.\" He exhaled. \"Oh Ivan!\" She seemed surprised that he had answered. \"I had heard the news and thought you would have been far too busy to answer your phone.\" \"I am never too busy for you.\" Victoria laughed. He could tell from the sound of her voice she had the phone cradled between her shoulder and cheek which meant she was in the kitchen either baking or cooking, either of which he would benefit from that evening. \"Well I had thought to leave you a message excusing you from our engagement this evening.\" \"Not necessary, my love.\" Ivan replied as he leaned on the balcony's concrete railing and looked out at the traffic below. \"I do not think this will require me to work outside of regular business hours.\" \"That is good news.\" Ivan could hear the smile in her voice and wished the day had already finished so he could hold her in his arms. His mind began to wander, as men's minds tend to do, but was brought back to the present by Victoria's voice. \"Whatever it is you're dreaming about will be waiting impatiently for you upon your arrival.\" \"Dorogaya moya, you know me better than I know myself.\" Ivan's deep voice rumbled with laughter. A tap on the glass door behind him drew Ivan's attention back to the task at hand. \"Ah, lyubov moya, I must go. I will see you, all of you, this evening.\" \"You're incorrigible!\" Victoria sighed. \"Take care of yourself, Mr. Ambassador. I don't want to have to come looking for you.\" Ivan smirked. \"Don't tempt me.\" They said their goodbyes and Ivan opened the door, the chatter had not diminished in his absence, and one of his aids passed him a memo the moment he crossed the threshold. \"Director Cooper will be able to meet with you at one-thirty.\" The young man said. \"That should work.\" Ivan said as he went to his desk and called his secretary. \"Yes, Yana, please bring me an updated schedule for today. I will be meeting with Director Cooper at one-thirty for about an hour before I meet with Leonid at three.\" \"Yes Ambassador.\" The woman replied. Yana, an attractive woman in her early thirties, hurriedly made the addition to the Ambassador's schedule and printed off a fresh copy before gathering the large stack of other requested items and headed towards his office with haste. As she sped down the hallway her phone buzzed in her hand and she stole a quick glance down to see who was calling. As a result she did not see the man with whom she collided and the papers, once stacked high in her arms, went flying in all directions. Yana looked up from the mess to see a handsome bike messenger with an extremely apologetic countenance. \"Oh, I am so sorry! Let me help you.\" He said as they both knelt down to retrieve the loose papers that lay scattered across the floor. \"It was my fault.\" Yana said, tucking a loose strand of her strawberry blond hair behind her ear. \"I was looking at my phone to see who was calling.\" She paused as she did so again. Her phone had ceased ringing and she saw with frustration that the caller I.D. had been blocked. \"Of course it was a wrong number. Typical.\" The man laughed as he gather some papers, he held up his phone to show her. \"I'm guilty too.\" He kept the phone in his hand as he neatly stacked the pile of paper together and handed them to Yana. \"I am sorry.\" \"Me too.\" Yana replied. \"And thank you.\" She called over her shoulder as she redoubled her pace and sped down the hall. As he watched her disappear the man's face fell into a more serious repose. \"No,\" he said in a voice low enough that no one else would hear him. \"Thank you.\" Yana swiftly and silently slipped through the crowded room to where Ivan was working at his desk, signing orders and directing various aids and other embassy officials. \"Here is your schedule, sir.\" She said as he finished with the last of the people who had been swarming about his desk. \"Wonderful, thank you Yana.\" Ivan smiled. \"Can you please have a bouquet of flowers sent to-\" \"Oh yes, sir\" Yana interrupted, gently nodding towards the aid who had quietly approached. Ivan looked over and waved the man off. \"Give us a moment, Pietro.\" The man nodded and turned away. \"Thank you, Yana. This is a bit of a mad house today.\" \"So you will still be able to make your evening meeting?\" the woman asked with a raised eyebrow. Ivan flashed a crooked grin, his eyes twinkling. \"Yes. I do not think this will require late hours. It does not appear to present a threat to our relations with the Americans or our national security. Some ill prepared fools with too much time and money on their hands trying to usher back the cold war.\" Ivan rolled his eyes. \"Well, I am sure you're 'friend' will be pleased.\" Yana winked before leaving to deliver the remaining pile of papers to various people about the room. Yana was one of two people at the embassy who knew of Ivan's relationship with Victoria. The other was Mikhail, his driver. He trusted both implicitly. Ivan sighed as he saw Pietro shuffling nervously back towards him and beckoned him over with one hand while massaging the bridge of his nose with the other. Several blocks away the bike messenger who had run into Yana was turning out of a back alley and into the open door of an old car garage. The bay door closed slowly behind him as he leant his bike against the oil stained wall, carelessly tossed his helmet aside and ran a hand through his shoulder length brown hair. He set off in a jog down the short hall that led off of the back of the garage bay, bike shoes clicking on the concrete as he did, stopping only once he'd reached the open office door at the far end. The room had no windows and housed three desks laden with computer monitors and various other electronics. It was around one of said monitors that several men were currently congregated. \"Did you get the video?\" The bike messenger asked as he approached the group. \"Yah. Great work Alan.\" The man sitting in front of the monitor congratulated. Alan peered past the other men's heads and saw the video he had sent from the embassy on the screen. It was frozen on a shot of Ambassador Simanov's schedule for the day. \"This is perfect, Rick.\" A man with a shaved head and bearded face praised. Rick, a man with wide shoulders, a broad nose and dark, closely shorn hair nodded. \"Everything has fallen into place perfectly.\" Rick agreed. He swiveled in his chair to face the other four men. \"We don't have a lot of time but we're ready. Steve and I have patched into the city's CCTV feed so we will be able to time this precisely. And it will have to be precise, we have next to no margin of error on this.\" He directed their attention to the monitors on the adjacent desk that were currently showing the feeds from the city's traffic cameras. \"Alan will be here, at the base, Steve on the sidewalk here,\" he pointed near a bus stop on one of the monitors \"Russell, in the truck here, and Jay and I will be waiting here with the bus.\" He clapped his hands together. \"Alright boys, go make all the final preparations. We've only got couple hours and one shot at this.\"[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I do not claim ownership of any of the characters from the R.E.D. or its sequel. By the time one o'clock had rolled around Ivan had banished everyone from his office and was now basking in the silence as he tried to quickly eat his lunch and finish preparing some notes for his meeting with Director Cooper at Langley. The phone on his desk buzzed and Ivan hit the speaker button. \"Ya?\" \"Mikhail has the car out front for you whenever you are ready.\" Yana informed him. It was her polite way of making sure he would not be late. \"Thank you, Yana. Please tell him I will be down in five minutes.\" \"Very good, sir.\" Ivan popped the last grape into his mouth before wiping his moustache with a napkin and dusted a few stray crumbs from his shirt front and tie. He stood and pulled on his dark grey suit jacket, tucked a portfolio and a few papers in his briefcase and left his office. As he passed Yana's desk down the hall he inquired as to whether she had arranged for the flowers to be sent and, upon confirmation, rapped the desk with his knuckles and winked. \"Thank you, my dear.\" \"My pleasure, Ambassador.\" Minutes later Ivan stepped out of the elevator and passed through the lobby doors as he made his way to where Mikhail was waiting next to the car in a tidy black suit. \"Good afternoon, Mikhail.\" He greeted. \"Good afternoon, sir. Traffic is moving well. We should be there just in time.\" Mikhail informed as he held the door for Ivan. \"Bah, I never worry about that with you.\" Ivan replied. \"Besides, this is really just an informal meeting. A few minutes here or there will not matter.\" Twenty minutes later, true to his word, Mikhail had the Ambassador sitting in the office of Director Cooper. The two men, having exchanged brief pleasantries, got straight down to business. Ivan passed a dossier across the desk to Cooper. \"This is all the information we have obtained from the two men.\" Cooper nodded as he looked up the names on his computer. \"Okay, only one has ever been flagged in our system. Gregory Hanes from Oregon. Tech specialist on our watch list for minor hacking activities but no crimes of any serious nature. The other, Charles Burke, is from the same small town and looks to be a partner in Hanes small tech business.\" Ivan nodded. \"Strange they would attempt to break into records room at Kremlin. Did any of their hacking activity seem targeted towards Russia or its interests?\" Cooper tapped away at his keyboard momentarily before shaking his head. \"Not that I can tell but I will send a couple of agents to check their computers and see what turns up. It could take some time to find any information as it will be undoubtedly encrypted and they do seem mildly proficient with computers. Neither of these men have any formal military training or obvious interests or affiliations that would even begin to explain their actions.\" Ivan leaned back in his chair and rested his chin on his hand. \"At the moment it would appear that they acted alone. They have not given up any useful information to our interviewers. Will your people be pushing for their immediate return?\" Cooper leaned back as well, unconsciously mirroring the Ambassador's body language. \"I don't think so. Seems a crime was committed and your people should deal with it as they see fit.\" He looked at the folder in front of him once more. \"Though from a pure curiosity standpoint we would be willing to work with you to determine just what these men thought they were doing and why on earth they thought they could get away with it.\" \"Looks as though we are on same page then, Director Cooper.\" Ivan stood as Cooper gathered the papers together and passed them back over. Cooper quickly printed off the information he had on the two men and dropped it into the folder the Russian held open for him. \"You have my number?\" Ivan asked. \"I do. Your lovely fiancé gave it to me the last time we ran into one another. Congratulations by the way.\" Cooper said, extending his hand to the other man. \"I understand it's been a long time coming.\" Ivan shook Cooper's hand and grinned. \"Too long.\" \"Stay in touch.\" Cooper called as Ivan exited his office. Mikhail had the car waiting when Ivan emerged from the building, door open. \"Heading back to the embassy?\" \"Yes. I have a few things to wrap up, a quick meeting with Leonid and then we can head to the Eagle's Nest.\" Ivan answered as he slid into the back seat. Rick and Jay leaned against the back bumper of their vehicle, nonchalantly eating jumbo hotdogs from a nearby food cart. They looked, to all the world, like two EMT's on their lunch break as they stared out, seemingly bored, at the intersection in front of them. From where he stood Rick could see Steve, standing at the bus stop kitty-corner to them reading a newspaper, and Russell who was coming out of a coffee shop across the street with his purchases; a large cookie and a water bottle. The items were tossed carelessly onto the seat as he climbed back into the driver's side of his pickup. \"Hey,\" Alan's voice crackled in the earbuds they all wore. Rick saw Steve and Jay reach for their ears simultaneously and knocked Jay's hand away as he did the same. \"Two minute warning.\" Alan continued. \"Be ready, the lights will work as planned.\" \"This is it.\" Rick spoke, the excitement in his voice easily picked up by the mic hidden in his collar. \"Stay calm. We've got this.\" He watched as Russell's hands clenched and unclenched around the steering wheel of his pickup. \"We've got this.\" Ivan was going through the information Cooper had given him, trying to make sense of the seemingly senseless. 'This may be one of those instances chalked purely up to idiocy and nothing more.' Ivan thought to himself. There was no prior behaviour and no real motivations or goals that were immediately apparent. Once again the Russian cursed the internet. Firstly for its propensity to facilitate the exchange of ideas amongst fools the world over and secondly for the emboldening said fools to act on their imprudent impulses. With a sigh Ivan removed his reading glasses and pinched the bridge of his nose before stuffing the papers, with notes now scrawled across the borders, back into his briefcase. As he straightened up in his seat a loud nose caught his attention. He looked out the window to his right just in time to see the grill of a truck a split second before it violently collided with his car. The force the impact threw Ivan up against the now crushed in side of the vehicle as the window exploded inward. The pain was sharp and instantaneous. The air was forced from his lungs one moment and the next he found himself tumbling up and over as the car flipped completely before landing on its roof. Metal screeched as it slid across the rough pavement. When the car finally stopped moving Ivan lay face down on the roof. The violence and noise of the crash was replaced by a loud ringing that filled his ears and a pain that lanced through his skull and torso. He tried to move but found his dazed mind incapable of commanding his battered frame. His eyes continually slid closed even as he fought to keep them open. He could feel blood running down his face and gently pooling around the shattered glass beneath his cheek. He groaned as he made another attempt at any sort of movement but failed once again. Ivan felt, more than heard, the door of the car wrenched open as two hazy figures stepped into the wreak that was once his pristine GAZ-M14 'Chaika' limousine. He registered voices but could not distinguish the words for the ringing and pain in his head. He felt hands slip beneath his shoulders and a wave of dizziness wash over him as he was rolled onto a backboard. Ivan tried to speak as a man's blurry face appeared above his own but the man shook his head as if to say he did not understand. Ivan belatedly realized he was speaking in Russian, his injured mind unable to translate his words into English, so he gave up. The man's face disappeared from his field of vision and he could feel straps tightening about his chest, waist and legs. He tried to move away as a strap tightened on his injured side when a man's face reappeared and placed a mask over Ivan's nose and mouth. The sweet plastic-like smell of the gas being pumped through the mask filled Ivan's nostrils and his head swam in response. If his thought process had been laboured before it now became more and more impossible with each passing breath. He felt someone take hold of his hand and the telltale prick of a needle being inserted for an I.V. It was followed by the pressure of a needle being inserted into the I.V. port and a rush of 'burning' liquid was injected before he blacked out. Jay removed the needle from the I.V. port he had placed in the Russian's left hand. \"He's out.\" Rick nodded and waited as Jay strapped the neck brace and head restraints into place. Once he had finished they slid/carried the backboard out of the car and placed it onto a waiting stretcher. A small crowd had gathered and sirens in the distance alerted them to the arrival of the real emergency services. \"You've got company coming.\" Alan informed them over their earbuds. Russell stood by the back of the ambulance nursing a wounded arm while Steve and another passerby helped the limo driver to sit on a nearby curb as he was clearly dazed. Rick could hear the conversation of those around the scene. \"The lights went green in all directions.\" \"It's a terrible accident but no one's at fault.\" \"Somebody's going to get a huge payday from the city though.\" Jay overheard the last comment as well and smirked at Rick as they loaded the stretcher and Russell into the back of the ambulance. As Rick shut the doors a woman call out to him. \"What about the other driver?\" \"No room. I have to get this man to the hospital. Another bus is on the way.\" He explained as he climbed into the driver's seat and took off, the sirens silent but lights flashing as they cut through the increased traffic caused by the accident with ease. Steve had stayed behind with Mikhail until a large enough crowd had gathered that he could slip away with anonymity. He was a block away when the first of the actually emergency responders drove past. Checking to ensure no one was looking, he turned down an alley and pulled a motorcycle out from behind some trash cans, climbed on and kicked it to life. He pulled out the opposite end of the alley and merged seamlessly into the now congested traffic, heading to the rendezvous point.[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: I do not claim ownership of any of the characters from the R.E.D. or its sequel. In the ambulance the mood was celebratory. \"Well done boys!\" Rick exclaimed. \"You're not actually hurt are you, Russ?\" He asked looking back over his shoulder to where the other men rode in the back with the unconscious Ambassador. \"Nah.\" He answered easily. \"I didn't realize it would flip the car though.\" \"Made our job easier actually.\" Jay added as he checked on their 'patient'. \"He is a bit more banged up than we expected, must not have been wearing his seatbelt.\" \"Anything we should be concerned about?\" Rick asked. \"We'll have to keep an eye on his head but nothing some pain killers and stitches won't fix.\" Jay answered as he pulled apart a tear in Ivan's shirt to get a better view of the gash adorning his ribcage. He grabbed some gauze pads and pressed them against the cut to slow the bleeding. Stitches would need to wait for the time being. \"I couldn't tell because of the tinted windows but I just hammered the door he was sitting next to. I swear I could see his head touch my grill as the glass shattered.\" Russell told the others. \"That's why I hit my brakes so hard which then made it flip.\" \"You're all clear. No tail.\" Alan informed the rest of his team from where he sat observing their escape on the CCTV feed. \"Perfect.\" Rick acknowledged as he made the final turn before turning into the garage just as Steve pulled in having arrived from the opposite direction. He had made great time thanks to the ability of the motorcycle to weave in and out of the near gridlock traffic around the scene. Even as the large bay door creaked closed the men had already jumped out of the bus and begun peeling all of the decals and removing the lights and reflectors that identified the bus as an ambulance. The plates were then switched out and new decals and lights applied to convert the formerly white ambulance into a non-descript hydro truck. Once the transformation was complete all five men climbed into the truck. \"He's a looking a little worse for wear.\" Alan remarked as he sat on the bench in the back of the truck, the only part of the vehicle that still resembled an ambulance. \"He'll be fine.\" Jay replied unconcernedly, taking a moment to throw the Ambassador's cell phone under the wheels as the truck backed out of the garage, one last time, and began its drive out of D.C. When the police finally arrived at the crash scene Mikhail had recovered sufficiently enough to be extremely concerned for his boss. The officer that had arrived first to the scene noticed the embassy plates and the shaken chauffeur. \"Were you driving, sir?\" the officer asked Mikhail. Mikhail nodded, coming to stand nearer the officer and the upside down limo. \"Are you okay? Have you been checked out?\" \"I am fine, but he was in the back an-\" \"Someone else was in there?\" The officer interrupted, gesturing to the damaged rear of the vehicle. \"Did an ambulance already leave here?\" He asked the fire crew that was busy cleaning up the leaking gas and oil from the damaged vehicles. \"No. We were first on scene.\" One of the firemen responded. \"Where's the other driver?\" \"He was taken with the other gentleman in the ambulance.\" A woman from the crowd informed the officer. \"They had been at that hotdog stand having lunch when the accident happened.\" \"Yah.\" A man added. \"All the lights went green at once, the truck hit the limo and just flew into the air.\" The officer left Mikhail standing by the car and ran over to the EMTs. \"These people are saying there was another ambulance here that took the injured passenger and truck driver away.\" \"Not possible. This is our sector.\" The EMT retorted. \"Is that an embassy car?\" The officer realized he didn't know who was actually in the car and called over to Mikhail. \"Who were you driving?\" \"Ivan Simanov. The Russian Ambassador.\" At those words the officer felt his stomach drop. \"Oh shit.\" Victoria hummed to herself as she pulled a cake from the oven and set it to cool on a nearby rack. The delicious smell of warm vanilla mingled with the savory scent of the chicken, asparagus and potatoes she had prepared for dinner. She checked the clock and saw that it was nearing six o'clock. She grabbed her phone, dialing Ivan's number with one hand, she turned on the small kitchen television to catch the beginning of the nightly news with the other. The phone rang once before going to his voicemail. Playing with the beautiful bouquet Ivan had sent her she waited for the beep before beginning to speak. \"Hello darling, I was just calling because it's very nearly six and I haven't heard from you. Thought you'd be here by now.\" She turned from the flowers and looked up at the TV as the news began. \"Hope you haven't got caught up in any …\" The words dies on her lips as the night's top story caught her attention. The headline scrolled across the screen: 'Russian Embassy Official Injured in Car Crash'. Victoria instantly recognized Ivan's formerly immaculate car, even upside down, and let the phone drop from her hand to the counter. \"…the official and the driver of the truck were taken to hospital. No information on their condition is available to us at this time. Witnesses say a malfunction caused all of the intersections lights to turn green at the time of the accident. Authorities are investigating the cause of the glitch. The driver of the embassy car was treated for whiplash at the scene and released.\" The newscaster continued seamlessly on to the next story but all of Victoria's attention was still firmly focused on the last. A brief moment passed as she processed the shocking information then Victoria picked up her phone and called the one person who would be able to fill her in. \"Hello? Yana?\" Victoria was surprised by how shaky her own voice sounded. \"Oh Victoria!\" Yana's voice was a low whisper. Victoria could hear a cacophony of voices that quickly faded and then vanished with the soft click of a door being closed. \"I wanted to call but I haven't been able to get away.\" \"How is Ivan?\" There was silence on the other end of the line. \"Yana?\" Victoria's heart began to race. \"They don't know where he is.\" \"What? What do you mean?\" Victoria asked incredulously, gripping the counter so tightly that her finely polished nails threatened to chip. \"There was an ambulance on the scene. He was taken away in it but it was not an actually ambulance. They have checked all the hospitals but have been unable to find him.\" Victoria's mind was reeling and she found herself leaning heavily on the granite countertop. \"Victoria? Victoria, I am so sorry.\" Yana sounded close to tears. Victoria shook her head. Yana was a sweet young girl whom Ivan had come to think of as a daughter over the years. \"Thank you, Yana. Please keep me informed as you can.\" Victoria said and then hung up abruptly. She wiped a lone tear from her eye and took a deep, steadying breath. \"Now is the time for action, not tears.\" She told herself. Picking her phone back up Victoria dialed a number from memory and prayed it would be answered. \"Hello?\" A man spoke as the call was connected. \"Frank, its Victoria.\" \"What's wrong?\" Frank asked having picked up on the edge in her voice. \"Ivan's been taken.\" \"What happened?\" Frank didn't waste time on meaningless platitudes. Victoria quickly laid out all she knew as Frank listened without interruption. \"We should contact Cooper.\" Frank said once she had finished. \"He'll be able to fill us in on what's going on.\" \"Will you contact Marvin? I fear we may need his expertise.\" \"Of course. Call me back once you've spoken to Cooper. Do you have his number?\" \"Yes. He gave it to me after that Dunning affair.\" She replied. \"Thank you, Frank.\" \"Anything you need Vicky, I'm here.\" \"Who was that?\" Frank turned to face Sarah, his face serious. \"Victoria. It looks like Ivan may have been kidnapped.\" \"Are we going to help?\" Sarah asked, concern etched on her features. \"Ya. I'm gonna call Marvin. Victoria's calling Cooper to see what he knows.\" Frank answered as he walked over to his laptop and called Marvin using a secure, VPN protected server. Marvin answered, his voice scrambled. \"How soon can you be at the Eagle's Nest? We have a friend that needs help.\" \"Half-an-hour.\" The scrambled voice replied. \"See you there.\" Frank hung up and walked back to the bedroom to pack his bag only to find Sarah had already begun. He leaned on the doorframe to their bedroom. \"Thanks, Babe.\" \"Time is of the essence I assume.\" \"You got it.\" He smiled as he readied several weapons and waited for Victoria's call. At the Eagle's Nest Victoria was calling William Cooper. \"Cooper.\" \"Director Cooper, this is Victoria Winslow. I believe you know why I am calling.\" \"Ms. Winslow. I am sorry I haven't called, I've been extremely busy.\" Cooper apologized. \"Do you have any idea where he is? If he is okay?\" Victoria was losing the cool detachment she had cultivated over her lifetime. \"From the CCTV footage it looks as though this was all planned. He was targeted, incapacitated and taken quickly from the scene in broad daylight.\" \"Was he hurt badly?\" \"Witnesses and footage had him unconscious on a stretcher but that doesn't mean much of anything. We are trying to track the ambulance but have lost it at a series of blacked out cameras.\" \"Did they check the location where the vehicle was lost? Is there a building where they are hiding out or have changed vehicles?\" Victoria asked, her mind grasping for answers and possibilities. \"We have a ground team heading there now. There is a building that may be of interest.\" \"I contacted Frank, and he Marvin. We would like to be read in.\" \"Can I send a helicopter for you? It will be a thirty minute trip instead of an hour and a half one.\" Cooper offered. \"Yes, thank you. I will be ready in thirty.\" \"See you soon, and I will keep you abreast of any new developments.\" He promised solemnly.[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: I do not claim ownership of any of the characters from the R.E.D. or its sequel. Four hours had passed since they had executed their plan and Rick, Alan, Russell, Jay and Steve, along with their hostage, were far from D.C. They had arrived at their safe house and were in the process of stowing away the hydro truck and transferring the Ambassador to the cabin. They had driven west to a secluded spot near a national park. Few neighbours, a hilltop forested position, a large well lit yard that spread out for at least twenty yards in all directions, separate garage for the truck and a large wood cabin with thick walls, large windows offering unobstructed views of their surroundings. Ivan had been keep sedated for the duration of the trip but the gas mask had been long since removed. The last part of the journey had been on an unforgivably bumpy dirt road but he had blessedly felt none of it. They wheeled the stretcher from the garage to the house and then into one of the two small bedrooms. Jay and Steve then lifted Ivan, still strapped to the orange backboard, and placed him onto a bed. \"Do you want to clean and stitch him up now?\" Rick asked Jay as he and Steve folded up the stretcher and stored it away under the bed. \"I think that would be best. Are you going to contact the embassy soon?\" \"No. That can wait til the morning. I don't want to give them a search radius based on the timing of the call.\" Rick answered. \"Smart boss.\" Jay said as he opened a well-stocked, multi-tiered medical kit. \"Will you need help with this or are you good?\" Rick asked as he turned to leave the room. \"Nah, I'm good.\" Jay waved off the offer of help as he began removing the head restraints, leaving only the neck brace, so he could clean the blood from the wounds on Ivan's face. Over the course of the next forty-five minutes Jay stitched closed a cut above Ivan's right eyebrow and one on his cheek bone before moving onto the large gash that ran across his ribs. When he was finished with the stitches Jay ran his hands over the incapacitated man to assure himself that the man had no broken bones or other serious injuries. Besides some mild swelling, and not so mild bruising, everything seemed in order. Jay then checked Ivan's pulse and pupil response and, finding both within reasonable parameters considering the circumstances, Jay packed up his equipment, shut off the lights and closed the door as he exited the room intent on heading to the kitchen to find something to eat. At the same time as Jay was searching for his dinner Victoria, Frank, Sarah and Marvin were disembarking from the helicopter Cooper had sent to retrieve them from the Eagle's Nest. \"See? I told you it would be fine, Marvin.\" Frank said as he helped Sarah from the chopper. Marvin grumbled in response as he climbed, somewhat stiff legged from the machine. Victoria quickly crossed to where C.I.A. Director Cooper was waiting for them with an SUV. Frank and Marvin loaded their gear into the back of the black Yukon as the ladies climbed into the vehicle. Victoria took the passenger seat next to Cooper and Sarah took the centre back seat, soon to be sandwiched between Frank and Marvin. \"My team has found the staging area. I'll take you over there right now. It was located just within the area of the blacked out cameras.\" Cooper said as he made good use of his SUV's in-grill emergency lights to part the traffic and get the group to the scene as quickly as possible. \"So they have some skill but limited foresight.\" Marvin observed. \"That could play in our favour …\" He waited a beat before continuing. \"Or not.\" Marvin was never one to be overly positive. \"It does mean they may have overlooked something else that could lead us to Ivan.\" Sarah added hopefully. Frank smiled at her and rubbed her arm affectionately. The woman's eternal optimism when it came to their line of work was endearing and hopefully not misplaced. As the SUV rounded a corner, the location they were headed to became readily apparent. An old garage came into view, slightly run down, and perfectly unremarkable aside from the fact it was presently surrounded by black SUVs and hustling C.I.A. personnel. A man standing near the perimeter of the scene pulled back the yellow tape and allowed Cooper to drive right up to the building. Cooper put the vehicle in park and switched off the engine. \"I am not going in there with all those people.\" Marvin, having put the emphasis on the word 'those', fiddled nervously with the handgun in his lap. \"For heaven's sake, Marvin, put that away.\" Victoria sighed in exasperation, even as Frank was reaching to remove it from the man's grasp. \"Give me five minutes and I'll give you a private viewing.\" Cooper told the man as he opened the door and immediately took charge of the scene. The SUV's remaining occupants watched with mild interest as Cooper cleared the scene and sent his staff on an enforced thirty minute break. After a few minutes the last person had left the building, leaving only those guarding the perimeter of the scene. The director then waved at the SUV, inviting the four to join him in the garage. As they entered the open garage bay door it became evident that the men they were after were no longer using an ambulance as cover. Strewn carelessly across the formerly polished cement floor were various ambulance decals and a light bar. \"So they kept the same vehicle but changed the cover.\" Marvin surmised easily. \"I already have people scanning the CCTV footage looking for any trucks that fit that basic description. We should have a direction of travel soon.\" Cooper informed as he pushed the light bar with his foot. \"Any contact from the kidnappers yet?\" Frank asked as he crouched down to search for a clue as to what new cover the men may currently be using. \"No. Nothing. I had met with the Ambassador right before the accident to discuss the capture of two Americans caught trying to break into a secure records room at the Kremlin. Neither of us had any possible motives or criminal affiliations but now, with what has happened, I am having a difficult time believing it's a coincidence.\" Cooper said. Victoria was silent as she processed the new information and attempted to, somehow, piece it all together. Ivan had told her on the phone that he had not been concerned about the matter, and clearly this was the matter he meant. \"Could we trace his cell phone?\" Sarah asked Cooper as she let her gaze sweep over the space, unsure of what to be looking for. Cooper crossed over to a table in the corner in lieu of answering. He picked up a clear evidence bag with the remains of a crushed phone rattling inside. \"Oh.\" Sarah sighed. \"Guess not.\" \"I've got something.\" Frank, Cooper, Sarah and Victoria's heads all snapped round to look in the direction Marvin's voice had come from. They headed down a narrow hallway until they arrived at a room, lit brightly by the glow of nearly a dozen computer monitors. Marvin waved them over to the monitor he was sitting in front of impatiently. \"Take a look at this.\" He played the video he had found for them. The group watched in silence for a moment before Sarah blurted out. \"What exactly are we looking at? Someone shuffling papers? Is that Russian?\" Marvin paused the video with a click of the mouse and zoomed in on the image. \"That's his schedule!\" Victoria exclaimed. \"That's how they knew when to plan the accident.\" Frank stated. Victoria turned and walked out of the room as Frank, Marvin and Cooper searched through the various computers and found footage from various cameras and played them on the various monitors as Sarah watched. Once alone in the hall she pulled out her cell phone and punched in a number. Her call was answered on the second ring. \"Yana? It's Victoria. I need you to tell me if at any point someone other than you or Ivan had access to his schedule?\" \"They were wearing fingerless gloves, like a bike messenger.\" Sarah said, appearing in the doorway and locking eyes with Victoria. Yana appeared to have heard Sarah as she let out a sudden noise of realization. \"There was a bike messenger. We collided in the hallway and he helped me pick up my papers. He did have his phone out, he said he hadn't seen me because he'd been texting.\" \"Thank you, Yana. Has anyone contacted the embassy about Ivan?\" \"No. I will call as soon as they do.\" Yana said. \"I am so sorry.\" \"None of this is your fault, Yana. I have to go, we will speak later.\" As Victoria hung up she looked to Sarah. \"Thank you. The collision with the bike messenger may have, on such a busy day, passed unremarked had you not noticed his gloves.\" Sarah smiled meekly and looked down at the floor. \"Glad I could help.\" A printer in the corner of the room hummed to life and began printing pixelated photos of men's faces. \"Who are they?\" Victoria asked as she picked up the freshly printed pictures, still warm from the machine. \"We think these are our guys.\" Frank said, coming over to look at the pages from over Victoria's shoulder. \"The EMTs and the driver of the truck that hit Ivan's limo.\" Victoria's head snapped up at his words. \"Do you have the footage?\" Frank exchanged a look with Cooper and Marvin. \"So that's a yes.\" Victoria brushed past Frank to stand over Marvin. \"Let me see it.\" Marvin knew better than to argue and cued up the video. Victoria watched without a trace of emotion as a traffic camera showed a quiet intersection. A moment passed before Ivan's limo drove into the frame and was immediately struck with bone-jarring force by a large pickup truck. The momentum of the crash flipped the car onto its roof and it slid several meters before coming to a rest. In less than a minute an ambulance appeared and the car door was wrenched open by the EMTs. The men worked extremely quickly and had soon pulled Ivan from the wreckage. Only once Ivan appeared on the screen, obviously unconscious, did Victoria briefly betray her emotions. Her eyebrows knit together in a flash of anger and concern but in an instant it had past as she suppressed those unhelpful emotions. \"Can your people ID these men?\" Victoria asked once the ambulance had left the screen. \"The screen grabs are being run through our system as we speak.\" Cooper replied \"I'm also having them check for affiliates of the two men captured in Moscow this morning.\" \"Are those camera feeds still active, Marvin?\" Frank asked, leaning in over the back of the man's chair. \"I think so.\" \"We should go back through the cameras closest to this location at the time of the accident and shortly after. We may be able to pick out the truck and get a direction of travel faster than Cooper's team.\" Cooper rolled his eyes. \"I doubt it.\" \"Got it.\" Marvin announced. \"What?\" Cooper exclaimed in disbelief. \"Direction of travel is south-west. I've tracked them to the edge of the city. Looks like they are headed for route 66.\" \"How did you-\" \"I think you've had just enough time here, don't you?\" The strange voice that filled the room and emanated from the computers speakers, startling the group and interrupting Cooper's shocked response to Marvin's computer prowess. \"Who is that?\" Sarah asked looking around the room. \"Did your people not sweep the building?\" Victoria asked, nearly aghast. \"Its been quite entertaining watching you track down 'clues' but your time is up. We've left behind a little 'gift'.\" At that word the group exchanged knowing looks. \"You've got less than two minutes.\" Frank started guiding Sarah to the exit. \"We've got nearly all we can. Let's go.\" Victoria looked to Marvin. \"Did we miss anything?\" \"I would hate for you all to die needlessly.\" The voice mocked threateningly. \"One minute twenty seconds.\" Victoria felt a pressure on her shoulder and looked down to see Cooper's hand there, the message was clear. From the comfort of a couch Rick, Russell, Jay, Alan and Steve watched as the five raced from the building. \"This is going to be good.\" Steve said, smiling in anticipation. The other men grinned in agreement. Rick typed a series of code into the computer. The words 'Detonate: Y/N?' flashed across the screen. \"They clear?\" Alan watched on the other laptop as the last of the group, the older bowlegged man dressed in mismatched clothes, cleared the garage bay doors. He had surprised them by how quickly he'd traced their route. \"Ya.\" Rick typed out the letters 'Y-E-S' and his finger hovered over the enter key for a moment before pressing it with vigor. Victoria felt the blast from the explosion a split second before the sound of the detonation ripped through the air, deafening all those in the vicinity. Debris and dust blew past in a rush of hot air as they dove for cover behind Cooper's SUV. When she opened her eyes the world was clouded with dust and chunks of what used to be the garage rained down around them. In her hand she clenched the crumbled papers that bore the faces of the men who took her fiancé upon them. \"Well that seemed unnecessary.\" Marvin said in an overly loud voice, his ears still suffering the effects of the blast. Frank helped Sarah to her feet while Cooper did the same for Victoria, gently dusting off her shoulders as he did. \"Why would they allow us time to escape?\" Sarah asked as she ran trembling fingers through her tousled hair in an attempt to straighten it and shake the dust free. \"They're playing games with us.\" Cooper replied agitatedly. \"They were watching us the whole time.\" Frank added. \"Still could be.\" Marvin stated, gesturing towards the traffic camera and waving. \"We should regroup elsewhere.\" Victoria said firmly, leaving no room for argument. Cooper pushed a remnant of a door off the side of his SUV while Frank lifted a cinderblock off the now dented and scratched hood. \"I don't think that's going to buff out.\" Frank grinned. Cooper gave a wry smile in return. \"Good thing it's a company car.\" \"That went off better than expected.\" Steve laughed. \"Nice fireworks, Russell.\" Russell smirked and accepted the praise with ease. \"Kind of you to let the old fellow make it to cover, Rick.\" Alan observed. \"Like I've said before, I'm not interested in collateral damage.\" Rick replied. \"It's easier to slip away from a job with no body count. We stand to make enough on this one job to last a lifetime so let's not screw it up. That old guy tracked our truck before we even realized he'd done it. Too close.\" He closed the laptop. \"Excellent work on the facial alterations on the video though, Alan. Now they will be looking for three completely none existent men-\" \"Or three unlucky real men.\" Steve joked, briefly interrupting Rick and garnering a laugh from the group. Rick stood and clasp Steve's shoulder. He was about to speak when his watch began to beep. He pressed the button to silence the alarm. \"Eight o'clock.\" He crossed to the kitchen island and grabbed a bottle of whiskey, pouring our five shots into the awaiting glasses. Each man took a glass and Rick raised his in a toast. \"Here's to the success of our friends.\" \"Success!\" The men echoed solemnly before throwing back their drinks. \"If they all goes well we should know within the hour.\" Alan stated, pouring another round of drinks. \"Once we receive the information we can put the word out.\" \"And the bidding begins.\" Jay said, raising his glass with the others.[Chapter 5] Disclaimer: I do not claim ownership of any of the characters from the R.E.D. or its sequel. The first thing Ivan became aware of was the pain, not sharp and fresh, but dulled by medication. To a man who had lived the life Ivan had, the feeling was not a new one. In his vast experience on returning to the conscious world after various injuries or other predicaments common to the spy community, Ivan knew in which order he would regained his senses and abilities. First was the return of awareness, followed by immediate and unfortunate sensation of pain caused by whatever injuries had been wrought before and/or after the loss of consciousness. Hearing came next. It began as low, indistinguishable noises that slowly morphed into recognizable sounds. Speech would follow shortly thereafter. Ivan always found this strange, that speech would proceed movement and vision, save for the weak twitching motions of one's arms, legs and the tossing of one's head. He found the fact that a man could involuntarily moan in pain before being able to do a thing about the circumstances that caused it was frustrating and, to a lesser degree, laughable. Ivan lay still and waited with practiced patience for his body to progress through the stages of waking, deciding to use the time to catalogue his various aches and pains of which there were a few. The worst of the pain seemed centered around the right side of his head. A pain, though blunted by drugs, throbbed with each beat of his heart. A tightness around his eye and cheek indicated swelling and a telltale sting usually associated with a wound closed by stitches. His right shoulder, hip and knee hurt but not as badly as the burning injury at his side. He decided trying to move at the moment would not be a wise choice. As Ivan's thought process slowly regained momentum he realized he didn't remember the situation that lead to his injuries. It was his experience that the drugs and the head injury most likely held equal amounts of blame for the missing memories. Rather than tax his already aching head, Ivan focused his energy on opening his eyes which was already proving to me a monumental task. Eventually his efforts were rewarded and a blurry, out of focus room came into view. While Ivan's eyes vehemently refused to focus he was still able to make out some of the room's details. The wooden walls were bare and directly across from the foot of the bed was the space's lone window. The room's only light at the moment appeared to come from a flood lamp that was most likely used to light the perimeter of the building. Although it was quiet, Ivan could make out the faint murmur of voices coming from just beyond the door he assumed from the sounds was on his left. Having ascertained he was in no immediate danger, and effectively alone for the time being, Ivan decided to test his luck and try and sit up. His movements were halted almost before they began and he belatedly realized several things: (a) he was being held down against a ridged board by straps, (b) he was wearing what felt like a neck brace, and (c) there was some sort of restrictive splint on his left wrist. 'Not good.' Ivan thought. He appeared to be strapped to a backboard in a room that was definitely not a hospital and, from what little he could make out beyond the window, was in the middle of nowhere. 'Not good at all.' Ivan carefully tested the strength of the straps but quickly found them to be too strong to break and too tightly fastened to slip out of. An experimental clenching of his left hand revealed that the splint was not only taped securely in place but there to protect what felt distinctly like an I.V. port. Knowing he had no options and no real information available to him at that point in time, the ambassador forced himself to relax and wait. For whatever was going on he had clearly been cared for in some matter, as was evidenced by the drugs and stitches. This served to reinforce his earlier conclusion that he was not in any immediate peril so he then tried to occupy his thoughts with other matters. Seeing as it was mid-way through the month of May and the sun had set, Ivan knew it must be sometime after eight-thirty. That meant he had missed his dinner with Victoria. 'She will be looking for me.' Ivan smiled as the realization struck him. His Victoria was a force unto her own. Finding that thought equal parts relaxing and invigorating Ivan redoubled his efforts and tried to recall his last memory before waking up in this room. What had he done that day? Ivan wrestled with the darkness that seemed to be keeping his memories at bay when a finally a little snippet of a remembrance made it's through. Ivan locked onto it and held tight as though it were a lifeline. 'I had lunch at my desk.' Not an altogether unusual event but it was a start. He remembered looking at something and, closing his eyes, he concentrated as hard as he could. 'A schedule.' That was good but what was on it. It had been a very busy day, something unusual had happened and he recalled having next to no time to himself … except in the car. 'I had a meeting with Director Cooper. We were discussing …' He struggled to come up with topic of conversation. Then suddenly it all came back in a flash; the capture of the two Americans at the Kremlin, the functioning chaos of his office that morning, the brief moment of peace and respite brought by Victoria's call on the balcony, the rushed lunch, the sharing of information with Copper at Langley and finally the car crash that left him lying in a mess of broken glass on the interior roof of his car. Ivan opened his eyes and let go of the breath he had not realized he'd been holding. The dim room was a bit more focused this time around and he took some solace in that. Not long after Ivan's attention had been drawn to counting the knots that adorned the boards of the ceiling when he heard the sounds of approaching footsteps and voices. As the door swung open, a light was flipped on causing the pain in Ivan's head to spike mercilessly and forcing him to squeeze his eyes shut against it. \"Good evening, Ambassador.\" A greeted a voice light with laughter. \"Glad to see you're awake.\" Ivan forced his eyes open but had to squint in the face of the bright overhead light. He was never one to show weakness to an enemy but strapped down as he was, and finding himself completely at the mercy of the two men who now stood over him, Ivan forgave himself the involuntary watering of his eyes. The man who had spoken clearly took notice of the Russian's pained expression because he crossed back to the door and turned off the overhead light, relieving the pain in Ivan's eyes. \"Sorry about that. Thoughtless action on my part.\" The man said. He looked across to the man now positioned on Ivan's left. \"Enough light for you?\" He asked addressing the other man. \"Oh yah.\" Came the reply. The man turned his attention to Ivan once again. \"We are going to make you a little more comfortable, Ambassador.\" \"In more ways than one.\" The other man said, drawing Ian's attention back over in time to see a needle inserted into the I.V. port in his hand. The effects were instantaneous. A rush of warmth and an undeniable lethargy rolled like a wave through Ivan's veins, washing away the pain and leaving only soothed muscles and a dazed mind in its wake. His eyes slipped closed of their own accord. \"That's better, isn't it?\" the words were accompanied by a pat on the shoulder. \"Now that we have your enforced compliance we can remove all these straps.\" Ivan could hear Velcro being peeled and felt the pressure of the straps dissipate and then disappear entirely. The world tipped sideways for a moment as the board was removed and when the world righted itself he found himself sinking into a soft mattress. The neck brace was removed and, freed from the restriction, his head lolled sideways onto a pillow. A hand cupped his cheek and turned his unresisting head as probing fingers checked the stitches by his eye and cheek. \"I apologize for the injuries that were inflicted upon you as a result of your capture. You really ought to wear your seatbelt, you know.\" Despite himself Ivan allowed a grunt of laughter to escape and he forced his eyes open. \"You wreaked my car.\" Ivan replied flatly. The man laughed at that. \"True but you won't be needing it any longer.\" \"That sounds ominous.\" Ivan voice was slightly slurred. He allowed his eyes to close. He refused to ask the clichéd questions; 'Why am I here?' or 'What do you want with me?' He knew in these situations the captor would either answer those questions without provocation or refuse, even when asked, based solely on their own whims and fancies. \"We've got it, Rick.\" Ivan opened his eyes once more at the sound of the new voice and watched as 'Rick' was handed an iPad by the newcomer. \"They made it out then? Wonderful.\" The man that had given him the injection exclaimed, unmistakably pleased. \"Only one.\" The newcomer corrected. The men were silent as this news sunk in. \"He retrieved all the information.\" Rick said, eyes glued to the screen of the iPad as he scrolled through the documents. After a moment Rick closed the case on the iPad. \"We are a go for tomorrow. Mr. Simanov, you are about to make us very rich men.\" \"Ransom, is it?\" Ivan asked, fighting to stay marginally coherent. \"Not quite.\" Rick motioned for the others to leave the room. \"Don't worry. It will all become clear tomorrow. Sleep well, Ambassador.\" Rick smiled with worrying pleasure as he pulled the door closed behind him. Ivan listened as the lock clicked into place and the footsteps faded away before trying to get up. Unfortunately for Ivan the drug had done a very good job at both relieving his pain and inhibiting his fine and gross motor skills. With a sigh of frustration he gave up and resigned himself to succumbing to the sedative as well as his own body's demand for healing sleep. Victoria rested against the headboard of the queen size bed in her hotel room. Cooper had arranged for a suite of rooms and, while the rest of the team was still discussing options and tracking down leads, Victoria found herself in need of a quiet moment to collect her thoughts. It had been so long since she had felt this way that she had forgotten the emotional toll caring for someone so deeply could take. She had just about steeled herself up to return to the common area when her phone rang. She snatched it up off the duvet and answered in a blink. \"Hello?\" \"It's Yana. I have news.\" Victoria was so grateful for the young woman's commitment to her Ivan. \"Go on.\" \"The two spies who were captured at the Kremlin this morning escaped.\" Yana began. \"How is that possible?\" \"That is not all. They stole vital information about our country's nuclear missile locations and launch codes. They locked all the systems so there is no way to change the codes and re-secure the systems.\" Victoria was shocked into silence by the news. \"One of the men was killed as they fled. The second was tracked down and killed in a firefight but not before he had sent all the information to a third party.\" Yana concluded. \"Has this information been forwarded to other governments?\" Victoria asked as she began to pace around her bed. \"Not to my knowledge. This is very embarrassing for my government. They believe the incident is somehow tied to the Ambassador's kidnapping. They are putting together a retrieval team as we speak.\" Victoria took a second to digest all the information she had just been given. \"Did they specify the conditions of retrieval?\" When Yana didn't answer immediately Victoria knew it did not bode well for Ivan. \"The emphasis was put on alive if at all possible but they fear the same people who took him now have the codes and may be preparing an auction of some kind. They…\" here she paused again as her voice trembled. \"They cannot afford to let either fall into certain parties hands.\" Victoria's chest tightening in fear and anger. \"I am sorry.\" Yana cried. \"I wish there was something I could do to help.\" \"Yana, you have been indispensable. We will get Ivan back and the codes as well. Please don't hesitate to call with any new information.\" \"The minute I hear anything, you shall know.\" Yana promised. \"Thank you, dear.\" Each word heavy with heartfelt meaning. \"You are welcome and good luck.\" When Victoria passed through the doors that led from her room to the lounge the conversation ceased and each head turned to look at her. She crossed in silence to where the others sat on the couch and armchairs around the large coffee table. Marvin had been working at a laptop belonging to Director Cooper which gave him unrestricted access to the C.I.A.'s network. Through it he had been able to access the state highway cameras and was attempting, from the look of it as Victoria passed by, to track the truck they believed had taken Ivan. Victoria took a seat in the lone empty armchair and met the group's gaze. \"What's wrong?\" Sarah asked, voicing the question they were all thinking. \"Yana called.\" Victoria met Cooper's eyes. \"The two spies were that broke into the Kremlin not only escaped but managed to steal the locations and launch codes of all the Russian's nuclear weapons.\" Marvin dropped his head into his hands and began rubbing his temples while mumbling to himself something that sounded suspiciously like \"It's happening, it's finally happening. We're all gonna die.\" Ignoring Marvin's ramblings, Victoria continued. \"Both men were killed but not before they locked the Russians out of their own systems and transferred the codes to a third party whom the Russians currently suspect are the same men who took Ivan. They are, at this very moment, activating a retrieval team who have orders to recover both Ivan and the information at all costs.\" \"That doesn't sound good.\" Sarah uttered before she could stop herself. \"It most certainly is not.\" Victoria replied none the less. \"We need to find Ivan before they do. They will not be as concerned for his wellbeing as I.\" Frank took the laptop from Marvin and turned it to face Victoria. \"Marvin had tracked the truck to this point. Highway I-81 South-\" \"Farther actually.\" Marvin interrupted, seemingly finished with his mini breakdown. \"What?\" Marvin took the laptop back and pulled up two grainy images as Cooper and Victoria stood and moved behind the couch to get a better view. \"This,\" he said pointing to the first image. \"was taken from a camera feed at the post office in Marl Creek. It turned right onto the Tye River Turnpike. And this one was taken a few minutes down the road at the Vesuvius post office. Still following the turnpike.\" Marvin paused and pulled up a satellite image of a property that would ideally suit the purposes of the kidnappers. \"This is a satellite grab of where I think they are keeping him. Driving comes in from the north-west, an out building for the truck, unobscured three-hundred and sixty degree view of the property surrounding the house, nearby town for amenities and it holds the high ground.\" \"How do you know they didn't travel further down the road?\" Sarah asked, leaning in to look at the property. \"No other property fits the criteria, plus,\" Marvin pulled up a realtor's site. \"This home was purchased one week ago by an all cash buyer.\" \"I'll arrange for a helicopter.\" Cooper said pulling out his phone and crossing to a quiet corner of the room. \"Great work, Marvin. Now we have the layout and the images of the interior.\" Frank exclaimed, slapping the Marvin on the knee. Victoria walked round the couch and squeezed in between Marvin and the arm of the sofa, planting a kiss on the man's cheek. \"Thank you.\" \"You're welcome.\" He mumbled in typical Marvin fashion as a slight blush coloured his cheeks. Frank leaned over and pulled the satellite image back up. \"It will take just under an hour and a half to get there by helicopter. If we land here,\" he said pointing to a field beyond the trees at the base of the hill the cabin sat atop of \"we can go in by foot without arousing suspicion. The layout of the cabin looks fairly simple. Wood beam cabin, one floor, no basement, open living room kitchen area, two bedrooms and a bathroom in-between them. Ten windows and two doors.\" \"He's most likely in one if the smaller rooms. Less exits to defend. Victoria reasoned as she studied the page. \"Was this sold furnished?\" She suddenly asked. \"Um, yah.\" Marvin answered. \"He'll be in this room then. He was injured and this is the only room with a bed.\" Victoria said pointing the single bed shown on the screen. \"We should prepare for other eventualities.\" Marvin reminded. \"There is a chance we may run into that Russian retrieval team.\" Victoria's eyes darkened. \"The way I feel today they'd better not get in my way.\" \"Noted.\" Marvin said as he inched away from the angry woman. Cooper crossed back over to the team, slipping his cellphone back into his suit jacket pocket. \"The chopper will be on the roof in fifteen minutes. We'd better get ready.\"[Chapter 6] Disclaimer: I do not claim ownership of any of the characters from the R.E.D. or its sequel. The helicopter was one minute late, which of course sent Marvin into a paranoid spiral that ended with Frank chasing him down a stairwell attempting to convince him that all was well. By the time Frank returned to the roof with a reluctant Marvin the others had already loaded their gear and were fastening their seatbelts. \"For goodness sake, Marvin! Hurry up!\" Victoria called over the roar of the propeller blades as the two men climbed in. \"They were late, they could have used that time to take out the flight crew and replace them with assassins.\" Marvin complained once everyone had their headphones in place. \"Oh get a grip, Marvin!\" Victoria scolded. Sarah started to eye the flight crew suspiciously over her shoulder and Cooper took notice. In hopes of averting any further unpleasantness during the flight, especially since they were trapped together in a confined space for the next hour and a half, he reached forward and tapped the pilot on the shoulder. \"Hey Mike. Can you assure my friends that you and Terry are who you say you are?\" The pilot and co-pilot turned in their seats and flipped up their visors. Revealing a mustachioed man named Mike and a blonde woman with kind eyes in the co-pilot chair. \"It's true. I am who I say I am.\" The man smiled. \"Ditto.\" Waved Terry, leaving Sarah reassured and Marvin mumbled to himself yet again. \"We can all hear you, Marvin.\" Frank said, tapping the mic attached to the other man's headphones. \"Oh, sorry.\" Marvin apologized and flipped up the mic to continue with his agitated muttering. \"That's much better.\" Sarah said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. \"Let's go, Mike.\" Cooper instructed. The helicopter lifted off from the hotel's rooftop helipad and headed south-west towards the GPS coordinates that had been provided by the Director. As planned they would be landing in a field a short distance from the cabin, out of sight, and then using the cover of the trees they would advance with stealth to the tree line surrounding the cabin. \"How many men do you think we'll be dealing with?\" Sarah asked once they were underway. \"Three that we know of.\" Frank said. \"Plus the one who monitored the CCTV cameras.\" \"Since the operation depends on discreetness and secrecy they would most likely keep the operation small.\" Victoria reasoned. \"Five to eight people.\" Cooper suggested. \"Eight's a bit heavy.\" Frank countered. \"Seven.\" \"Five.\" Marvin had put his mic back in place. \"No one's chosen six so I guess I'll take it.\" Sarah smiled. Victoria laughed and squeezed the younger woman's hand. Frank took an iPad from his bag and pulled up the satellite image of the cabin and surrounding area. \"Vicky, you'll be here in the tree line to the north of the cabin. It gives a clear view of the west, north and east sides of the building as well as the room we believe they are keeping Ivan in.\" Victoria nodded. \"I have been looking a reason to use the infrared scope Ivan gave me last month. This wouldn't have been my first choice though I am certain he will be glad I am putting it to good use.\" \"Sarah, you'll be here beside the garage keeping an eye on the south side of the house. Remember that Victoria will take care of the other three sides, only shoot against this side of the house so we can avoid friendly fire.\" Frank pointed to where the garage's front corner and the back corner of the cabin lined up though twenty meters further south. It created a blind spot on the south-eastern part of the lawn for Victoria and Sarah only would be responsible for its coverage. \"Got it.\" Sarah nodded, excited as ever. \"Marvin will come up from the west, towards the front of the house. Cooper will accompany Victoria and approach from the north and I will come up from the south-east with Sarah. We will scout the perimeter, get a head count on occupants and decide on the best points of entry.\" \"Are we incapacitating or executing?\" Marvin inquired, turning a silencer round in his fingers. \"Aim to incapacitate. We will want them for questioning. Especially if they can lock the Russians out of their own computer systems.\" Cooper stated with a smirk. \"But team safety is first priority.\" Frank amended. \"Are we going to put that black makeup on?\" \"You mean face paint, honey.\" Frank corrected lovingly as he dug into the pocket of his dark grey pants and pulled out a small jar. He expertly applied the paint to Sarah's face and then to his own before passing the jar off to Victoria. Marvin and Cooper had each brought their own. Sarah appeared jealous of the multi-toned paint that Marvin was applying. \"Looking good, Marvin.\" Sarah complimented. \"We should get that kind next, Frank.\" Frank swore that if Marvin's face had not been painted they would have seen him blushing again. He stifled a laugh as he saw Victoria roll her eyes. The team was ready; dressed in blacks and greys, toques on their heads, guns in their hands, extra clips, grenades, knives and other paraphernalia stashed about their persons. \"Once we have the Ambassador, Mike will be ready to fly in if we need to make a quick exit.\" Cooper said, breaking the tense silence that had fallen on the group. \"We're ten minutes out, sir.\" Mike informed. \"Thanks.\" Cooper handed out small, black earpieces, set to a closed circuit that only included those in the helicopter. \"These new?\" Frank asked, turning the device over in his fingers as he examined it. \"Yah, smaller than ever but can still pick up our voices clearly.\" Cooper answered, pleased he'd managed to impress Moses. \"I think I liked the old ones better.\" Sarah and Victoria laughed at the crestfallen look on Cooper's face. The helicopter flew in low from the west to avoid detection and landed in an empty field located downhill from the cabin. Frank and Cooper jumped out first, offering a helping hand to the ladies and Marvin. Earbuds now in place the team ran to the treeline before splitting up and heading to their assigned positions. Victoria, Cooper and Marvin moved silently to the north, while Frank and Sarah went to the south to skirt around the edges of the cleared portion of the property to their position. It was a steady uphill hike in the dark, their progress impeded not only by the thickness of the trees and brush but the need for stealth. After ten minutes Marvin split from Victoria and Cooper to head east while they continued north. Two minutes had passed when Marvin's voice came across their earbuds. \"There are tripwires. Looks like they are attached to small charges. I only saw it because it glinted in the moonlight. They should have greased the wires.\" \"Copy that.\" Cooper replied. \"Nice catch, Marvin.\" Frank stated. Victoria and Cooper slowed their pace, not wanting to set off any explosions. They both knew the wires would most likely be set closer to the cleared edge of the property but caution was always the prudent choice in such a situation.[Chapter 7] Disclaimer: I do not claim ownership of any of the characters from the R.E.D. or its sequel. In the small room in the cabin, Ivan was fighting his way back into the waking world for the second time that day. The pain was back, as the drug had worn off, a fact that Ivan was grateful for as he knew it was the pain that had woken him. Wasting no time, he tore the tape from his hand and carefully removed the I.V. port, and repurposed a piece of the tape to stem the sudden flow of blood caused by its removal. Quietly he pushed himself up into a sitting position and cautiously leaned back against the headboard. He was dizzy and stiff but his determination won out and he was able to swing his legs over the side of the bed. Ivan braced himself for the pain and dizziness that were sure to come with his attempt at standing and putting weight on his hurt leg. He chastised himself for his hesitation. 'It's only walking.' He told himself as he steadied himself against the wall, he winched as his shoulder and elbow protested, but levered himself to his feet none the less. The world began to spin and Ivan found himself leaning more heavily against the wall, willing away the vertigo before carefully limping towards the window. With each shuffling step the old floorboards creaked and Ivan would pause, certain the noise would alert his captors and bring them down upon him, but each time no one came and he was able to continue his slow progress towards the window. Crossing the ten feet of space had felt like it had taken an eternity but he had made it without incident. He rested his head against the cool pane for a moment and waited for the worst of the wooziness to pass before gently releasing the window's rusty metal latch and beginning to ease the old wooden sash open. Unbeknownst to Ivan, as the sash slid slowly upwards there was a click as two hidden pieces of metal came into contact and an electrical current was completed. A loud crack and bright flash sent Ivan flying backwards into the footboard of the bed before tumbling to the floor. 'All the lights just dimmed.\" Marvin reported. \"We are nearing our position.\" Victoria responded, fighting off the urge to run to the treeline. \"We saw it.\" Frank answered. \"Any movement inside?\" Marvin watched through his night vision goggles. \"Two men are walking towards one of the bedrooms on the north side of the house.\" Victoria and Cooper skirted a final tripwire and took up positions within the edge of the treeline just in time to see a dark room illuminated as a door open and a light switched on. \"They're looking at something on the floor.\" Cooper observed. Rick and Jay entered the room to find the ambassador laying in a heap on the floor at the foot of the bed. \"You weren't trying to leave through the window, were you?\" Rick asked. \"Needed some air.\" Ivan replied in a shaky voice as he pushed himself up into a seated position. He was feeling worse for wear, his hands trembled slightly with the after effects of the shock he'd received. \"If you had bothered to ask we could have warned you about the faulty wiring. We have that trouble throughout the cabin.\" Ivan could hear the pleasure in the man's voice as he gave the cloaked warning. He knew, belatedly, that he should have checked the window but he had assuredly suffered a concussion and had been drugged repeatedly over the past however many hours so he forgave himself the brief lapse in judgement. \"I didn't want to be a bother.\" Rick laughed as Jay helped Ivan to his feet and pulled the Russian's arm across his shoulders. \"Let's bring him out to the living room where we can keep a better eye on him. We can introduce him to the boys and show him what he has to look forward to tomorrow.\" Jay raised an eyebrow at first but then nodded and led Ivan out to the main room. \"There's Ivan.\" Victoria exclaimed. A million thoughts raced through her mind as she took in her fiancé's battered condition. \"He was on the floor.\" Cooper told the others. \"It looks like the drop in power was caused by Ivan trying to open the window.\" The C.I.A. director surmised as he saw the men helping Ivan out of the room and the partially opened window. \"We should assume the rest are wired as well.\" \"Copy.\" Marvin answered. \"Understood.\" Came Frank's reply. \"They are taking him to the main room.\" Victoria said, her sight focused and finger itching to pull the trigger. \"I have a visual on that.\" Marvin confirmed. \"Five targets in the great room.\" Ivan was dropped unceremoniously into an armchair in the main room of the cabin. There were three other men in the room, sitting on two sofas and the additional armchair, all of whom looked fairly surprised to see him joining them. He ran a hand through his hair and attempted to smooth out his rumpled suit jacket and blood stained shirt and tie, affecting an air of nonchalance. \"The boys have already met you, Ambassador, and you don't need to know their names.\" Rick said as he sat down on the couch next to Ivan. \"I thought that since the Ambassador was bored we should let him know about the excitement that awaits him tomorrow. You know? To keep him out of trouble.\" Alan looked up from his laptop. \"Really?\" Rick nodded in the affirmative. \"Alright. In a few hours we will be hosting an auction on the Deep Web.\" Alan began. \"Those men you were meeting with Director Cooper about were with us. They allowed themselves to be captured to create an opportunity for us to take you, which in turn distracted your people enough to allow our men to escape and retrieve some pretty vital information from the Kremlin.\" Rick had taken on the superior air of a man far too confident and sure of himself in Ivan's opinion. Rick leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees, closing the distance between Ivan and himself. The self-satisfied smirk on Rick's face enraged Ivan but he refused to allow himself to be baited. \"We are now in possession of all your country's nuclear missile positions and launch codes.\" Rick crowed. That information in itself did not worry Ivan and Rick knew it. \"Oh, I forgot to mention the fact that my men then locked your people out of their own system so they cannot possible change the codes.\" Ivan's eyes narrowed at that. \"Individuals and countries around the globe will be entering competing bids for the codes in the first auction and for you in the second.\" Rick fell silent, allowing the information time to sink in. Ivan was actually suitably impressed with the plan. What he had thought in the morning to be the unexplainable actions of two fools was in fact a well-organized plan executed by seeming professionals. \"Your country is free to bid on you and the codes, of course, but we've actually had a lot more interest on your behalf from the Iranians and the Turks. We have a proper bidding war brewing.\" Ivan let his head fall against the back of the chair in astonishment at that revelation. \"Now, they weren't the only ones, just the most vocal up to this point. It seems you have stepped on some toes in the past, Ambassador. What did you do to the Turks, huh?\" Rick asked with genuine interest. \"They are chomping at the bit to get their hands on you.\" Ivan laughed and shook his head. \"What is that saying in English? 'If I told you I'd have to kill you'.\" Rick shared a small laugh. \"I guess I'm not the one you'll have to answer to.\" Frank and Sarah were in position next to the garage. He had watched as Sarah set up her rifle and tripod and helped her adjust her scope. \"Can I get an infrared one like Victoria?\" She asked in her pretty please voice. \"It's so awesome.\" \"Yes, can she?\" Marvin chimed in. Marvin was a great proponent for Sarah's induction and training in their covert profession. \"Let's see how this goes tonight first, then we'll talk.\" Frank sighed. \"Are we ready to move?\" \"I think I should stay in first position. I have eyes on all targets and these large windows will make a covert approach difficult to say the least.\" Marvin said as he lay flat on his belly and watched the front room through his rifle scope. \"Ivan seems to be alright considering.\" He added for Victoria's benefit. \"Thank you, Marvin.\" Victoria said, breathing a sigh of relief. The only view she'd had of him was him being dragged from the room. \"Let's go, Frank.\" Cooper said. \"Our best chance to clear the yard is while they are all in the front room.\" \"We clear, Marvin?\" Frank asked, double checking. \"Yeah, you should go now.\" Frank kissed Sarah. \"Be safe, babe.\" \"You too.\" She whispered as he took off in a low crouch, moving quickly and quietly across the open space between the garage and the cabin. Within twenty seconds he had crossed the distance and was now peering in the window of the side door. \"At the side door.\" Frank informed the team. \"North centre window.\" Cooper called back. \"I can take out the electricity when you boys are ready.\" Victoria said, training her rifle on the point where the above ground electrical wire entered the cabin near the rear peak of the house. \"Hold on. Something's up.\" Marvin advised. \"We've got company.\" Alan said suddenly. Ivan watched as all five men immediately produced multiple weapons from the recesses of their clothing, from beneath furniture and between couch cushions. Probably one of the reasons the men were skeptical of Rick having brought Ivan out into the area. Within seconds all the men were armed to the teeth. \"Where?\" Rick asked. \"Side door. North window.\" Alan showed them the camera feed. \"They've made you, they have cameras.\" Marvin announced. \"Vicky, take out the electricity. Cooper, move as soon as it's out.\" Frank struggled to keep his voice calm against the rising tide of anxiety. The cameras must be microscopic for them to have missed them. Victoria exhaled and squeezed the trigger. The bullet obliterated the wire right where it connected to the cabin, resulting in a loud crack and a shower of sparks before darkness blanketed the cabin and its occupants. \"Move!\" Frank said as he kicked in the door before he ran around the east side of the cabin.[Chapter 8] Disclaimer: I do not claim ownership of any of the characters from the R.E.D. or its sequel. \"Fire!\" Rick yelled as the cabin went dark and there was a crash as the side door swung inward and struck the kitchen cabinetry. The silence of the night exploded with gunfire as the four men fired in the direction of the perceived threat. Counting on the fact that all his captors were distracted, Ivan decided to play a hunch. He leaned forward, very slowly so as not to attract Rick's attention, and reached out towards the bottom of the coffee table, winching as his injured muscles cried out. His fingers came into contacted with the cool textured grip of a handgun and smiled. He pulled gently and the Velcro holding the weapon in place gave way releasing the gun into his hand. Calmly, Ivan leaned back and slipped the gun into his jacket pocket. His eyes had adjusted to the darkness by the time the men had stopped firing. The last shell casings rang out as they hit the hard wooden floorboards and rolled away. The silence that followed was deafening. Cooper and Frank crouched down against the east wall. \"Victoria, Marvin. What can you see?\" Cooper asked once the shooting had ceased. \"They are in the centre of the room, starting to spread out.\" Marvin reported. \"Vicky, can you take out some windows?\" Frank asked. \"Consider it done.\" Ivan ducked as glass rained down upon him as the pictures windows exploded inwards. \"Get down!\" Rick yelled as dove down, pulling Ivan down as he went, both men falling heavily to the ground. The sound of breaking glass and the thump of bullets striking wood as they reached the end of their trajectory was all that could be heard in the cabin. \"Marvin, do the front. Sarah the south side.\" Frank instructed as he moved to the north side of the cabin, back glued to the wall. Glass continued to shatter in a hail of bullets, creating multiple entry and exit points for Cooper, Frank and Ivan. \"They're all on the ground.\" Victoria reported. Frank eased open the window Ivan had unlocked earlier and slipped soundlessly into the dark room. He tiptoed across the worn wood floor but just as Ivan had experienced earlier the floor creaked no matter how softly he tread. Ivan tried to push himself up off the floor but was halted by a stern knee in the back. \"Stay down.\" Rick ordered as he pressed Ivan to the floorboards. For the second time that day Ivan found himself lying face first in broken glass. Cooper noiselessly made his way around the cabin, he slid past the door Frank had kicked open and to the south-western corner of the cabin where all the picture windows had been shot out. \"Laser sights on.\" Cooper said and watched as the three red dots trained themselves on the men where they lay and switched target constantly, creating the impression there were dozens of snipers as opposed to just three. Ivan could see the red dots and smiled as one drew a heart on a man's back in front of him, a not so subtle message from Victoria. When the heart disappeared he knew it was trained on the man pinning him to the ground. Ivan inched his hand towards the gun hidden in his pocket, not wanting to be unarmed when the real action began. \"Put down your weapons and release the Ambassador.\" Ivan recognized Director Cooper's commanding voice. \"Move to the empty room, we need better cover. Now!\" Rick commanded. Ivan let himself be dragged to his feet and watched as the other men started towards the back room. Ivan stumbled and forced Rick to stop, increasing the distance between themselves and the others. \"Move!\" Rick yelled as he yanked on Ivan's arm. Ivan pulled the gun from his pocket and pressed it into the Rick's ribs. \"No.\" He was pleased by the look of shock and outrage that flashed across the taller man's face. \"Switch off laser sights. Looks like Ivan has a man at gun point. Right in front of the room where he was being kept. The rest are in the south bedroom.\" Frank heard Marvin and took it as his cue to enter the main room. He saw Ivan and the man standing in close proximity to one another, both with weapons in hand but Ivan's was jabbed into the other man's side. Frank edged into the room. \"Who's your friend, Ivan?\" Frank asked, relieved to see the man was still able to take care of himself. Ivan gave a small backwards nod to acknowledge Frank's presence without taking his attention off the other man. \"Nice of you to come.\" Frank reached forward and removed the gun from the man's grip. \"Why don't we head back into this bedroom before they notice your absence?\" He suggested. He put a hand on Ivan's shoulder and helped guide him as they backed into the room, keeping the man between them and the room into which the others disappeared. \"This is Rick.\" Ivan introduced Frank to his former captor. \"He is man responsible for all of this.\" Frank patted Ivan on the back and took charge of their prisoner. He could tell the man was running on limited reserves at the moment and his observation was confirmed when Ivan stepped aside without objection. \"Tell your men to stand down or they will be shot.\" Frank ordered. Rick stared down at Frank defiantly. \"No.\" \"Frank, we have movement on the east side. Four men exiting the window, splitting up. Half coming your way and half towards Sarah and the garage.\" Victoria said urgently. \"I'll cut them off.\" Cooper responded, his voice sounded as though he was already running. It was about to get messy and Frank didn't like messy. \"Ivan, we have company coming.\" Frank had barely gotten the words out of his mouth when bullets sprayed in the window, shattering the glass and sending up a spray of splintered wood in its wake. Frank pushed Rick out the door even as Ivan dove for it himself. The three men landed in a pile of tangled limbs, crashing up against the back of the sofa. The men scrambled to separate themselves, Frank and Ivan seeking to prevent Rick from attempting an escape. \"There are weapons hidden all over.\" Ivan told Frank, spotting a rifle that had become dislodged by their collision with the sofa and knocking it from Rick's grasp. A creak from the floor alerted them to the presence of someone in the room they had just vacated. They rolled to opposite sides of the doorway just in time to avoid the barrage of bullets that nearly cut the sofa in half. Frank reached out and hauled Rick down as he tried to run. Rick kicked out and caught Frank in the shoulder, knocking him back against the wall and the gun from his grasp. Seizing the opportunity, Rick pulled a knife from his boot and leaped at Frank. Frank readied himself for the impact but it never came. An object flashed through the air in front of him and Rick cried out in pain, falling back with a knife protruding from his forearm. Frank knocked Rick senseless with a hard right cross and watched the man flop to the ground. \"Still handy with a knife I see.\" Frank said as he forced Rick onto his belly and, producing a zip tie from his pocket, secured his hands behind his back. Only then did he remove the knife, wiping it clean on the man's shirt. Ivan was still on the other side of the doorway the gunfire having not yet died down. \"Like riding bike.\" Ivan smiled. He released the magazine on his gun, checked to see that it was indeed full then slammed it back into place. He slid the barrel back and looked over at Frank. \"We need them alive, yes?\" \"Preferably.\" A bullet took out a chunk of the wall inches from his face. \"But I am starting to wonder if it's really necessary. Victoria, can you take them out? Humanely?\" Frank asked. \"They're both inside the cabin, away from the window. I have no visual.\" Came the reply. Frank made eye contact with Ivan and inclined his head towards the room. Ivan nodded back and held up three fingers, then two, and one. Ivan went low, dropping onto his shoulder and firing two shots, and Frank went high firing once. Ivan's man went down with a wound to either shoulder and Frank's fell with a high chest wound. Neither men presented a threat any longer, both unconscious but in all likelihood not in any danger of bleeding out anytime soon. \"Three targets neutralized.\" Frank informed the others. \"How are things outside?\" Now that the shooting had stopped he hadn't heard anything from Cooper, Sarah or Marvin for several minutes and in this situation that was far too long. \"Everyone is out of my sight line. I haven't heard a word from them.\" Victoria confirmed. Ivan looked expectantly at Frank, only able to hear half of the conversation. \"Sarah? Marvin? Cooper?\" Frank waited for an answer from any of the three but after a short time it became clear he would receive none. \"Victoria, I think we may have company.\" Frank edged up to one of the blown out windows and looked in Victoria's direction. \"You can't see anything?\" \"No. Nothing.\" Her voice had dropped to a whisper. Frank scanned the treeline but saw nothing, not even Victoria but that was a good thing. It was probably why she was still talking to him. \"What is going on, Frank?\" Ivan asked. The Russian had not stood back up after the fight attempting to ration his strength. \"We lost contact with Cooper, Sarah and Marvin during that fire fight. Last I heard two of these guys were heading towards Sarah and Cooper was running to cut them off. We had intel that your people were mobilizing a retrieval team. I think they may be here and either not know or care whose side we're on.\" Frank replied. Ivan dropped his head into his hand and pressed the heels of his palms into his eyes. His head hurt and he was tired. If there was a Russian retrieval team on site things were about to get extremely complicated and he doubted if they would allow him to leave with his friends let alone the Director of the C.I.A. He felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up to see Frank kneeling beside him. \"They have only gotten the people outside, aside from Victoria, but they are probably approaching as we speak.\" Frank offered Ivan his hand and helped him to his feet. \"Let's head into this back room and see if we can figure out what's going on out there.\" Ivan followed closely behind Frank, stepping over Rick's motionless form, as the two moved with practiced silence into the back bedroom. Of the two windows in the room, one was broken (Sarah's handiwork) and the other was opened wide having been used as an exit for the two men they had just shot. Ivan slipped across the room to the far window, the one that had been opened, and looked out into the yard. It was darker in the cabin than it was outside thanks to the moonlight. There was no one to be seen from where Ivan stood but there were very distinct marks in the grass that shone in the light of the moon. They showed where something, or more likely someone, had been dragged back towards what appeared to be a garage. He was about to tell Frank when he caught sight of something glinting in the trees. It was only for an instant and then it was gone. \"You see those drag marks?\" Frank asked from where he stood by the other window. \"Da.\" Ivan acknowledged. \"There is someone in the trees.\" Frank came to stand next to the ambassador and cast an eye over the woods. \"Victoria, be careful. I think they may be moving up the treeline towards you. Don't break cover unless you absolutely have to.\" \"Copy.\" She was keeping her answers short and silent in case there was someone nearby. She slowly turned her infrared scope and focused it on the treeline east of the house. She saw them instantly. The red outlines of two bodies crouched together across from the cabin. \"Frank?\" She whispered. \"There are two men there preparing for what looks like a run on the cabin.\" She moved her scope again and scanned the trees to the west. \"Two to the west as well.\" The breaking of a branch alerted Victoria of someone approaching directly to her right. \"I have company.\" She whispered. \"Victoria confirmed we have two men approaching from the east and west and unknown number from the north.\" Frank pointed, north to orientate Ivan. \"Our only possible exit is south.\" Ivan glanced out the window, first at the trees and then at the moon. \"There are clouds approaching. They wait for the cover and then come after us. We should do the same.\" Frank looked up at the sky and nodded his consent to the plan. \"We follow the drag marks, find others, connect with Victoria.\" Ivan laid out their objectives clearly. He rose unsteadily to his feet, buttoning up his suit jacket and turning up the collar in an attempt to conceal his white dress shirt. \"I may need more bullets.\" Frank smirked. \"We have thirty seconds. Meet by the door.\" He pointed to the kitchen door on the south side of the house. Ivan was able to find a second hand gun and a spare clip for each in short order. As he was walking back to the kitchen he spotted the knife that he had used on Rick, picked up and tucked into his pocket. \"Ten seconds.\" Frank told him as he arrived at the door. Victoria had remained unseen, the men stood mere meters from her. She could hear them speaking, clearly Russians, and watched as they inched closer and closer to the open. Victoria raised her eyes to the sky and watched as the large cloud slipped over the moon, plunging the world into darkness. She heard the men break cover beside her and saw the men on her scope do the same. \"They're coming.\" Frank and Ivan were already out the door when Victoria's warning came through. Ivan's movements were unmistakably hampered by his injuries but he managed to keep pace with Frank none the less. Running as fast as they were they cleared the distance to the garage in under ten seconds and were soon hidden from sight by the building. They watched from cover as flash lights turned on inside the building and waved around as the men began a thorough search of the cabin. \"Frank,\" Ivan directed the other man's attention to the grass in front of the small garage door. \"Drag marks.\" Frank cautiously stuck his head round the corner and peered into the door's window trusting Ivan to keep an eye on the activity in the cabin. \"It's too dark to see.\" He told Ivan even as he tried the door knob. It turned freely in his hand and he pushed the door marginally open, slipping inside before closing it again soundlessly. Frank pulled a small pen light from his pocket and shone it into the space, taking care to keep it low. There in the centre of the space was the truck Ivan had been transported in and leaned up next to it were five people, trussed hand and foot, with gags in their mouths. Frank switched off the light and ran over to the group. From a sheath on his belt he pulled a small knife with a tiny light that illuminated the blade and began slicing through the bonds at Sarah's wrists and ankles. \"Found them Victoria. Start heading for the chopper. We'll meet you there, shortly.\" \"Be careful.\" The woman cautioned. \"You too.\" Frank allowed Sarah to remove her own gag while he turned his attention to Marvin's bonds and then Cooper's. \"What happened?\" \"We were just about to take out our guys when the Russians came out of nowhere, they used some kind of paralytic darts.\" Cooper answered rubbing at a sore spot on his neck. \"Thankfully the effects only seem to last a few minutes. They already had Marvin. Did you get Simanov?\" \"He's waiting outside. The Russians are in the cabin. We need to go. Now.\" Frank said forcefully. He helped Sarah to her feet and gave her a quick squeeze. \"You had me worried.\" \"Sorry. Won't happen again.\" She smiled, rubbing her wrists in an attempt to regain circulation. \"That's what you said last time.\" Frank reminded her pointedly as they made their way to the door, ignoring the pleading gestures of the two men they were leaving behind. Cooper opened the door and they exited single file, skirting around the corner quickly to remain out of sight of the cabin. \"Ambassador,\" Cooper greeted Ivan with a firm handshake. \"I hear you had a bit of a rough day.\" Ivan shrugged. \"I've had worse.\" The group snuck into the forest and almost set off a trip wire the moment they entered the cover of the trees. Marvin yanked Frank back without comment and guided the group to a safer path. After several minutes of navigating the near pitch black forest in a tense silence, Sarah felt the need to voice a nagging concern. \"So what are the odds they found the helicopter?\" Sarah asked the question all the men hoped they would not have to answer. \"Then the Russians get us and we all disappear for good.\" Marvin, the eternal pessimist said. Sarah looked to Ivan for reassurance but he could offer none. \"It very depends on who put together the team. Everyone has own plans and grudges.\" The Russian explained. His limping was becoming more and more pronounced. \"They may not have even wanted to take me alive.\" He paused for a moment as a thought occurred to him. \"However, it does bode well for us that they did not kill you all outright.\" \"Well that's one good thing.\" Sarah replied. Frank caught sight of Cooper shaking his head in disbelief and laughed softly. \"It is a good thing, honey. Very good.\" Ivan wiped at the sweat that trickled down his forehead and into his eyes. He had past the point of exhaustion long ago and it was now taking all his focus to keep moving forward. They had begun descending a rather steep hill and Cooper informed them that the helicopter was now only minutes away. The trees had blurred together into one disorienting haze, forcing him to travel with his arms outstretch in order to avoid any painful run-ins with tree trunks, so he just focused on the back of the person in front of him. \"Victoria's at the chopper. Everything's good there.\" Sarah told Ivan, knowing he didn't have an earpiece. Ivan nodded to show he had heard but couldn't muster the energy to respond any more than that. He pitched forward suddenly as a root snagged his foot causing him to stumble into the person in front of him. He felt several pairs of hands lift him back to his feet as his arms were pulled across people's shoulders. \"We're almost there, Ivan.\" Someone said. \"Just hold on a little longer.\" Victoria watched from her position next to the waiting helicopter for the arrival of her friends, blades running in preparation for a quick departure. Sarah appeared first, followed by Frank and Cooper, who supported Ivan between them. Marvin brought up the rear. It took all of Victoria's self-restraint to not sprint the thirty meters that separated them and embrace her fiancé. Truth be told she did start forward but a movement farther up the hill caught her attention. \"Behind you!\" She called out the warning and watched as everyone's heads snapped round, and being unable to see the danger, began to run to the safety of the helicopter. They had made it half the distance to the helicopter before the first of the Russians emerged from the trees in pursuit of them. Marvin reached for Frank's belt and grabbed two grenades. He stopped and turned to face the oncoming men. Pulling the pins simultaneous he waited a beat and then threw them just short of their trackers. The resulting explosions sent showers of earth and smoke into the air, obscuring any shot their pursuers may have had and buying them enough time to reach the helicopter. Cooper hauled Ivan up into the chopper as the rest of the team clambered in. Mike took off, not waiting for seatbelts or other safety regulations to be met. It was well he did because one of the more ambitious Russians made a leap for the landing gear but his fingers barely brushed the metal before he fell to the ground, just shy of his goal. No shots were fired at the departing helicopter. Victoria helped Ivan settle into a seat and fastened his belt for him. She put his headphones in place, not expecting him to be taking part in any conversation, but more to protect his obviously aching head from the furious beating of the propellers. He leaned back in his seat his eyes closed. His face, covered in a sheen of sweat and blood, was adorned with cuts and bruises. His shirt front was torn and covered in blood. Victoria reached out to cup his cheek and was startled as he caught her hand in his own, pressing his lips against her palm in a tender kiss. \"I am sorry I missed our dinner engagement. I was unavoidably detained.\" His voice was strong but the words were spoken softly. Even half-conscious he was a consummate gentleman. \"I think you may have a valid excuse this time.\" Victoria said, clasping his hand between both of hers as they lowered them to her lap. \"I told you I'd come looking for you.\" \"Awww.\" The odd noise succeeded in getting Ivan to open his eyes. It had emanated from the occupant of the seat across from them. \"You two are so sweet.\" Sarah gushed, reminding them they were far from alone. \"Okay, honey.\" Frank wrapped his arm around the woman in an attempt to redirect her attention. \"I hope we will be as in love as them one day.\" Sarah told him as she grasped his shirtfront. Frank actually looked a little hurt at her words. \"What do you mean 'one day'?\" Sarah realized her mistake and began back tracking. \"Oh no, that's not what I meant. I just meant… I just…\" \"Good grief.\" Marvin groaned. \"What is this? The Love Boat?\" Director Cooper then did something so out of character that Mike nearly put the helicopter into a tailspin. He laughed. He laughed long and hard and when he was finished he was greeted by the shocked faces of his associates. Cooper shrugged it off. \"What? He's pretty funny.\"[Chapter 9] Disclaimer: I do not claim ownership of any of the characters from the R.E.D. or its sequel. Two hours and ten minutes later the helicopter was taking off in the air again having dropped off all its passengers, with the exception of Director Cooper, at the Eagle's Nest. Marvin and Frank helped Victoria get Ivan up the stairs, the day's events having fully caught up with him now that the adrenalin had run its course, before saying their goodbyes. \"Thank you, my friends.\" Ivan said from where he lay back against a plush pile of pillows on crisp white linen of Victoria's king size bed. \"I do not like to think about what would have happened had those men been allowed to follow through with their plans.\" Victoria squeezed his hand in a silent sign of comfort. \"Anytime, Ivan.\" Frank said. \"But let's not make a habit of this.\" He joked. \"I hope you feel better soon.\" Sarah said, leaning down to give the man a gentle hug and kiss. \"Thanks for a fun outing.\" Marvin said in all seriousness. Victoria had offered their friends rooms for the night but they politely declined. She watched them drive off before locking up and going to tend to Ivan. As she entered the room she saw that he had, unsurprisingly, fallen asleep in her absence. Deciding to let him rest for a few minutes before disturbing him, Victoria walked down the hall to the small seating area at the landing to make a slightly overdue phone call. \"Hello? Is that you Victoria?\" Yana answered mid-first ring despite the late hour. Victoria allowed herself a small laugh, the tension of the last few hours melting away. \"We have him. He's safe.\" \"I am so happy.\" Yana pronounced. \"The retrieval team recovered the stolen information and captured the men who took the Ambassador but when they said they didn't have him I prayed it was because you got him first.\" Victoria smiled. \"We did.\" Victoria choose to not tell Yana how much more complicated the team had made their mission. It was something Ivan would have to deal with on his return to D.C., if not sooner, and Yana would find out all about it then. \"Thank you again for all your help, dear. Ivan will be staying with me for a while so he can recuperate. I am unsure of how long yet but I will let you know when I do.\" It was wishful thinking on Victoria's part. The events of the past day would more than likely require Ivan's presence at the Embassy in merely a few hours but she did not want to think on that at the moment. \"Let him know how thankful I am to hear he is safe, please.\" Yana asked Victoria. \"And I look forward to seeing him again when he is better.\" \"He will be happy to hear that. Good night, Yana.\" \"Good night.\" Victoria snuck through her bedroom to the master bath, her footfalls absorbed by the plush carpeting, and took a few minutes to shower. All traces of the night's clandestine activities were soon washed away in a swirl of hot water, soap and steam. When she had finished she pulled on a clean white robe and towel dried her hair, not bothering to brush it. She then gathered a wash cloth, towel, a bowl of warm water and her emergency medical kit, carrying them back to the bedroom with her. She placed the collected items on the nightstand next to the still slumbering Russian and pulled a chair from the corner of the room to the bedside. Perching on the edge of the chair she folded the white wash cloth into a square, gingerly dipping a corner into the warm water, and reached out towards his face. \"Oh Ivan.\" She breathed, pausing just short of touching his face, she pulled her hand back and took a moment to study the face of the man she loved so dearly. Despite the marks so clear on his face he looked at peace and she was hesitant to disturb him. Placing the cloth back on the nightstand Victoria turned her attention to making Ivan more comfortable assuming he would be more likely to sleep through the removal of his shoes and belt than the scrubbing of dried blood from his face. She stood and pushed back the chair so she could reach his feet and waist more easily. She loosened the laces on his shoes and then gently slipped them from his feet, keeping an eye on his face to ensure the movement was not waking him. Both shoes were removed without event and she moved to place them on the floor near the bedroom door when she felt the deep cuts and scuffs that marked the dark leather. Realizing they were beyond saving she placed them in the waste bin instead. As she turned around the bin tipped under the unbalanced weight of the shoes and fell onto the cast-iron rabbit that served as her door stop. The resulting noise reverberated through the quiet room and Ivan groaned. \"I liked those shoes.\" Victoria turned and gave him a small smile. \"I am sorry, love, but they were beyond saving.\" She resumed her perch on the seat next to the bed. \"Fortunately the same cannot be said about you.\" Ivan gazed at her through half-lidded eyes. \"You bought me those shoes.\" She picked up the wash cloth and dipped an edge into the still warm water before softly dabbing his face with it. \"And I will buy you a new pair since you have obviously ruined those ones.\" Ivan lay still as she cleaned his face and neck, taking extra care around the stitches and bruising on the right side of his face. \"Have I walked my last runway?\" The comment was so outrageous Victoria laughed aloud until the cloth caught on a stitch and Ivan winched. \"Oh, I'm sorry!\" \"It's fine. My fault, I should know better than to make a sniper laugh while she's working.\" \"You are lucky. Whoever did these did a good job, the scaring should be minimal.\" She dropped the cloth into the now pink water in the bowl. \"There. All finished. Let's get those clothes off so you can sleep more comfortably.\" She stood and motioned for him sit up. Ivan did as he was told, stifling a grunt as stiff, swollen muscles protested the movement. Victoria slid the jacket from his shoulders and gasped at the amount of blood that had soaked through his shirt. \"Are you still bleeding?\" She asked, tossing the jacket aside, freeing up her hands to unbutton his shirt. She pulled the once white shirt off of him and repeated the process with his undershirt. \"Are you shot?\" \"No. I believe that happened during the accident. I must have torn stitches running.\" Ivan answered. He glanced down at the bloody mess on his side. \"May I lay back down now?\" \"Wait just one minute.\" Victoria instructed as she grabbed the bowl of water and ran to the bathroom to refresh it. \"I just want to rinse off your back, it will feel good I promise.\" Ivan sat patiently as she ran a wash cloth over the sore muscles of his back. It felt far better than he had believed possible. She lay a towel down to protect her duvet and then eased him back on the bed. \"Do you have any pain killers?\" He inquired. \"Oh stupid me, I should have given you something ages ago.\" Victoria opened her medical kit and looked at the different labels on the various bottles. \"Oh, this is a good one.\" She said tapping the bottle on the lid before hesitating. \"But I wonder if with your concussion-\" \"Give to me.\" Ivan interrupted, holding out his hand. \"Alright then.\" Victoria handed him two pills and then glass of water she'd left on the nightstand the previous evening. He swallowed them and sighed, letting his eyes close. \"Spasibo, zaychik moy. It's been a long, long day.\" He opened them again and looked into Victoria's eyes. \"This is where I had hoped it would end though.\" \"You're incorrigible.\" Victoria leaned in and kissed him lightly. \"Now lay still and let me take care of this side of yours.\" Victoria cleaned the blood from his side revealing that Ivan had indeed torn multiple stiches, in fact thirteen of the twenty-eight had been pulled free. 'Most likely when the Frank and Cooper had thrown Ivan's arms across their shoulders... or when he was diving for cover from gunfire.' She supposed. Ivan's breathing had fallen into the slow, rhythmic patterns of one in a deep sleep as she'd cleaned the wound. Victoria knew those pills would assure he'd stay that way for hours to come so she continue her ministrations unabashedly. She plucked an aerosol bottle from her med kit and sprayed a freezing agent on the wound and surrounding area. She fished out a needle and sutures and began the slow task of closing the wound. When she had finished she wiped the last bit of blood from his side and applied a large transparent film dressing to it. She closed up her medical kit and took the water and wash cloth back to the bathroom and poured the water down the sink. Victoria washed the blood from her hands and exited the bathroom, leaving the light on and closing the door almost all the way. She crossed to the end of the bed and opened the padded fabric bench that stood there to retrieve a light blanket. She draped it over her slumbering fiancé, grateful for the fact he seemed to resting peacefully, and laid a loving kiss on his forehead. The following day would be a difficult one for him. There would be debriefings with nosy little men from various departments who would demand answers about the incident in an interrogatory fashion. Loyalties would, as always, be called into question. Ivan had spent his entire life serving his country but it was never enough for them. It was one of many things Victoria hadn't missed she'd retired. Putting your life on the line for king and country only to have snivelling little desk jockeys come in with their superior attitudes and rake you over the coals for events that were beyond your control. She much preferred her life as an independent contractor with the freedom to choose her jobs and, more importantly, clients. Once again she thought about asking him to consider retirement but knew, deep down, he wasn't ready. She dreamed of a time where they could travel the world together, taking contracts here and there, making their own schedules and answering to no one but themselves. 'One day.' She wistfully ran a finger lightly over his lips before kissing them, eliciting a moan of pleasure from him even in the depths of sleep. Turning out the lights Victoria crossed to the other side of the room and, slipping off her robe, crawled under the covers. She gingerly sidled up to Ivan and laid her head down next to his. She wrapped her arms around his, took his hand in her own, interlaced their fingers and drifted off to sleep. The sun would be up within the hour. They would not be.

He'd worked in the salvage business for twenty odd years and knew the sea like the back of his hand, which isn't to say it didn't surprise him. He'd worked in salvage for twenty years and had seen some strange things. He's seen a ship's cat disappear halfway through a voyage, hundreds of miles from anything, and reappear when they get back to land. He'd heard a woman crying at night on a ship that carries only men. He'd even seen the flash of an emerald green tail playing in the ship's wake, which he always kept quiet about unless he was really paralytic. And even then he knew to keep quiet about the hair. Eventually he saved enough so he could afford to talk to a man about a boat. It was old, it was going to need a lot of work and it'd be a risk even if it was brand new. Murphy took it. All he needed was a crew. --- Next up: Greer.[Chapter 2] A/N: Once again, I own nothing, thanks to SnuffSnuff for beta-ing. --- Any way you looked at it, Greer came first. He had known Murphy years ago, before he had joined the navy. Now, on the first leave he'd had in months he's sitting in a bar in Anchorage, turning the resignation letter over in his hands. Murphy knows what's inside it, but there's a curious etiquette between seamen, and he lets Greer tell him in his own time. \"Things are getting serious with Suzie,\" Greer says. Suzie is not the one who'll come three weeks short of becoming Mrs Greer, or even the one before her. \"She wants me to move in with her. And if we're going to live together I've got to have some say in when I go to sea.\" It would be easy to see a young man wanting to spend more time with his girlfriend. Murphy knew better: the sea is Greer's bolthole. \"Do you want to move in with her?\" Greer shrugs and grins. \"It's somewhere to keep my stuff right?\" It's a few drinks into the evening and Murphy can't tell to what extent he's joking. \"Thing is,\" Greer says, running the once crisp edge of the envelope between his forefinger and thumb. He's going to have to replace it before he posts it. \"If we're going to live together; it's a big step. I need a steady job y'know?\" Murphy knows. \"Funny that,\" he says, tracing the rim of his glass with his thumb. It makes a faint, musical noise, that he wasn't expecting and isn't sure he likes. \"I need a first mate.\" They drink for most of the night, and if at the end of it Murphy spends ten minutes trying to open a front door that isn't his using his car keys, Greer is in no state to find it anything other than hilarious. --- Next up: Epps.[Chapter 3] A/N: Once again, I do not own Ghost Ship or any of the characters or situations depicted therein. Thanks to SnuffSnuff for beta-reading and to MythStar Black Dragon for the review. This was the chapter that I had clearest in my head when I started, so I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it. --- \"Okay,\" Epps says, taking the bar stool next to Murphy and slamming a newspaper onto the bar as though she has a personal grudge against both. \"You were right. You mind getting me a beer?\" She is, to clarify, talking to the bartender. Murphy doesn't know her yet. \"Well I told you sweetie,\" the bartender says. She's the type of person who calls everyone sweetie, even in a bar where the regular clientele are anything but sweet. \"Feminism stops at the shore line.\" \"I wasn't expecting equal opportunities,\" the girl says, twisting the cap off her beer moodily. Murphy sneaks a sideways glance at her and sees a mass of stubborn curls obscuring an equally stubborn expression. \"I just didn't realise there wouldn't be any .\" \"You think I expected to be working behind a bar at my age?\" the bartender snorts. \"You want to get yourself down to one of the cities.\" \"I want to get out to sea,\" the girl says, her voice softening to become almost wistful. \"So book a cruise,\" the bartender says, not unsympathetically. \"That's the only way you'll get out of this port.\" \"If it makes you feel any better,\" Murphy says. \"I'd hire you. If you were any good.\" He's vaguely aware that he's at the stage of drunkenness where he says things he means; which are usually worse and more dangerous than the things he doesn't. \"Excuse me?\" the girl asks. She has the sort of face people call striking: her cheekbones are too wide and her eyes are too sharp for her to be pretty. Murphy is sturck. \"I'd hire you,\" he repeats, taking her paper, and circling his own ad, which through bad luck has been placed in the corner, almost out of sight. \"If you were any good.\" He drains his beer, pays his tab and walks out without looking back. Then he goes to goes to find Greer and puts it out of his mind. The phone call comes the next day. --- Next up: Munder[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: Once again, I do not own Ghost Ship or any associated characters or situations. Big thanks go to SnuffSnuff for beta-reading and to MythStarBlackDragon and ScarletMoonatMidnight for reviewing. --- \"I told you,\" Greer says one night. \"Women complicate things.\" This is unfair. Someone is making things complicated but it isn't Epps. \"What kind of name is Epps?\" Munder asks Epps the first time the two meet. This is not the first time he's met Murphy. That was the interview: if Epps had been there Murphy might have foreseen the whole business and hired someone else. Now there's the contract to think of. Not to mention that Munder's good. \"It's my name,\" Epps retorts and things pretty much go downhill from there. You could say that they hit rock bottom a month later when, drunk on the success of their first commission and a considerable amount of beer, Munder makes a pass at her, but this wouldn't do justice to the furious silences and intermittent arguments that descend on the ship afterwards. \"They'll get over it,\" Murphy says, over the muffled row going on upstairs. He can't pick out the words, but it sounds like they're debating whether or not Epps kissed back. \"What if they don't?\" Greer asks gloomily, toying with his beer. Perhaps if it wasn't for the row upstairs, he'd notice that Murphy is three beers ahead of him. As it is, he doesn't. Not yet. \"They'll have to,\" Murphy shrugs. \"You put two people in an enclosed space for long enough and they'll either learn to get on or kill each other.\" \"Yes,\" Greer says, staring moodily at the ceiling. \"That's what worries me.\" --- Next up: Dodge[Chapter 5] Disclaimer:nI do not own Ghost Ship or any associated plots or characters. Thanksnto SnuffSnuff for beta-ing and to MythStarBlackDragon for reviewing.nThis chapter took a while, because I wasn't sure what to do fornDodge. I ended up doing this, and I can only hope you think it wasnworth it. --- Crewnmembers come and go. Epps and Munder stop yelling at each other.nMurphy's drinking becomes an issue. There are quiet conversations,nfollowed by blazing rows, followed by more quiet conversations. Bynthe time Dodge arrives the only indication of a problem is Eppsntaking him to one side and telling him that they are not, under anyncircumstances, to drink in front of Murphy. She'snprotective of the captain, Dodge notices. She'll bring him a coatnwhen it's cold, not complain when he steals her seat: not bignthings, but significant. \"Shenhad a hard time getting into the salvage trade,\" Greer says, whennDodge asks him what the deal is with them. They're up on thenbridge: only Greer needs to be there, but Dodge likes the quiet andnMunder goes where the conversation is. \"Murphy gave her a chance.\" \"Sonare they…y'know?\" \"Hellnno,\" Greer snorts, keeping his eyes fixed on some point in thendarkness outside. \"They're just close: that's all.\" \"Don'tneven bother,\" Munder says when Greer leaves them in charge so hencan go outside for a smoke. \"The thing about Epps is she doesn'tnlike being reminded she's a girl.\" \"Younknow that from experience?\" Dodge retorts: he hadn't realised henwas that transparent. \"Ingot farther than you ever will. Pretty boy,\" Munder snorts and thentwo of them bicker until Greer comes in and tells them both to shutnup and let him concentrate. It'snthe beginning of a beautiful friendship. --- Nextnup: Santos.[Chapter 6] A/N: Well here's the final chapter. Just to remind you, I don't own and am not profiting from any aspect of the movie Ghost Ship. Big thanks go out to my beta SnuffSnuff and everybody who reviewed. Just because this is the final chapter doesn't mean I don't need feedback, so please review. =D --- Murphy never wanted a mechanic onboard: he likes the miniature world of the Arctic Warrior to be simple and uncluttered. And nothing takes up more room than an unnecessary crew member. Then one day, when they're a million miles from anywhere, the Warrior's engines cut out, leaving her at the mercy of the currents. The radio hasn't been working properly for over a week and now it refuses to work at all. Under the strain, relationships start to fray and old arguments resurface. All the little things the crew have learned to live with start to grate and the metal walls of the Arctic Warrior seem to close in around them. Without much to do or much space to do it in, they are always under each others feet and they have plenty of time for resentment to simmer. Epps and Munder are the first to crack: Epps becomes tetchy and defensive and Munder is in no mood to walk on eggshells. Disputes everyone thought had healed turned out to have been festering instead. Epps asks Munder acidly if it was necessary to use the radio to check the football scores. Munder replies that at least he's not using it to play her sort of music. Epps demands what that has to do with anything. Munder accuses her of being frigid. Things pretty much go downhill from there. Once the argument has started it spreads like a plague. Dodge wades in to stick up for Epps and ends up under fire from both directions. Pretty soon none of them are speaking to any of the others and make up for it by attempting to corner Greer and Murphy. Greer locks himself in his cabin, turns his walkman up as high as it will go and refuses to come out. As the captain Murphy feels this is beneath him; not least because he doesn't own a walkman. What he does own, hidden behind the loose panel in the supply closet, is a bottle of scotch. When the bickering gets too much, Murphy slips inside to retrieve it. Epps is waiting for him and she is not impressed. Epps screams at Murphy. Murphy yells at Epps. Everyone retreats to separate corners of the ship and simmers. It is almost a fortnight before the Canadian coastguard picks them up and the minutes drag by painfully. It isn't until they are all back on dry land and pretty much speaking to each other again that Murphy is forced to concede that perhaps a mechanic qualifies as a necessary team member. -The End- ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I do not own Ghost Ship, or any of the associated characters or situations.

He looked up, visibly irritated, \"Ms. Dixon, you are trying to get your PHd with a thesis revolving around a video game that supposedly sucks in it's players. What do you expect me to say to that?\" \"I expect you to try and let me prove it,\" she replied, \"This is my future on the line which means all you need to do is sit back and let me fly or burn. I have evidence of people remembering living up to twenty years in this game called Jumanji but there's no evidence they went anywhere.\" The Professor sighed, pushing her paper back towards her, \"Fine, write your insane idea but don't you dare get offended when you get laughed out of the auditorium when you present this,\" he warned, though he didn't care either way. Eve nodded, \"Thank you. I promise, you won't be disappointed,\" she said as she picked up her work and left the classroom, heading to her car to go to the city that had been the main source of Jumanji activity. She drove through the night because she didn't have much time left before her deadline and living the game out herself would be the best way to prove her thesis as fact. Her last account about people being involved recorded that they found the game in an old classroom but it was also said that they destroyed it but Eve wasn't as worried about that because no one had been able to succeed in that task yet. She pulled up to the high school just as dawn broke through the night and got out of her car to walk behind the school where they'd supposedly hid the remains. She krept underneath the school and found the old game system, to her relief, it was completely intact. Eve removed Jumanji from it's current gravesite and raced back to her car in order to find somewhere to hook it up and play the game. Her research included interviews with a man named Alan Parrish who was elderly when she met him but he remembers spending over twenty years in Jumanji until he was released and played with two kids and an old friend, who'd originally started the game with him. When they completed the game's goal, he was a child again and had no evidence of the event. She tracked down the kids and their story was the same except for them, it had only lasted a day or two at the most. More recently, a young man named Alex who recalled spending twenty years inside the game, even noting living in Alan Parrish's hut, and he was too saved by four kids, the kids who thought they'd destroyed the game but it remained intact once again. Eve's goal was to go into the game and play through looking for evidence that corroborated their individual recounts of their time in the game in order to, hopefully, prove her thesis to be true. Eve pulled into a motel and got a room where she took in her essentials and the game. Once she was inside, behind a locked door, she opened the box to reveal another change. For the first group, Jumanji appeared as a board game, the second had an old game system, but now, Jumanji was in the form of a handheld DS like form. Eve wrote down these changes and took a photo of the game with her cell phone before she turned on the 'on switch' starting the game and revealing a list of characters to choose from. In previous recounts, the game always had at least one character marked as unavailable but this time, she wasn't able to choose any of them. Eve sighed in defeat as she was about to turn off the handheld game and get some sleep before trying again just as the game emitted a green glow and before she knew it, Eve was sucked into Jumanji as herself.[Chapter 2] Eve felt herself free falling until she finally crashed into the ground below where she laid still for a few moments, gathering her bearings. Once she felt herself, she stood and looked around to see she was in the jungle described to her by those she'd interviewed. She wasn't in the form of anyone but there as who she was, which made her feel a bit strange. \"Who are you?\" she heard a male voice ask causing her to look in the direction of the sound to see tall, buff man who she would not want to fight. Eve knew who he was and she extended her hand, \"Dr. Smolder Bravestone, I'm Eve Dixon. I came here to play the game and prove that it was real,\" she paused before continuing, \"Which may mean nothing to you since I came alone and you're most likely a NPC.\" Bravestone shook his head as another voice joined, \"We aren't NPC's, just eternally trapped here, even when others join and occupy our bodies,\" the man Eve knew as Mouse explained. \"Franklin 'Mouse' Finbar, it's an honor,\" Eve extended her hand once more, \"So, you all are really here all the time which means this entire game may actually be a curse. Are the others here?\" she asked, looking forward to meeting each of them. Mouse nodded just as the other three emerged from the bushes. Ruby Roundhouse was the first to speak, \"Are we really playing again?\" she asked, her tone filled with annoyance, \"You wanted to come to our world too?\" she directed her second question to Eve. Eve nodded, \"Yes, I'm writing my thesis on this place and the game and how it all ties together and there's no real way to prove it unless I've done it myself,\" she replied before looking at the younger man, sporting aviators, \"Jefferson 'Seaplane' McDonough, you're character is the one I don't know as well. It seems you are the first to be chosen each time someone plays the game and they have the least memories by the time I see them.\" Seaplane nodded, shaking her hand, \"It's been nice not to be a host for someone recently but only time will tell how long it lasts. Welcome to Jumanji,\" he added. \"When I turned on the game, it wouldn't allow me to choose any of you,\" Eve replied before Professor Sheldon Oberon stepped forward, his hand reaching for Eve's. \"Welcome,\" he said as he took her hand in his, \"It's strange to play the game with an outsider but a relief since most of the time a girl chooses my character. I still can't shake some of the mannerisms they've added to me.\" \"I'm very pleased to meet you, Professor,\" Eve replied, \"I have a special place for you in my heart,\" she confessed before looking at the group, \"So, the hippos are up first?\" Bravestone nodded as he led the group toward the pickup location where Nigel would drive up without even waiting for the hippos to attack, \"This saves time, trust me,\" he assured her as they walked. Sheldon moved to walk beside Eve, \"Bravestone doesn't have much tolerance for the game anymore. I apologize if you don't get everything you need from this trip.\" Eve shrugged, \"Whatever I learn will undoubtedly make my paper better then having no personal experience. By the way, you're just as handsome as I imagined you,\" she confessed, her cheeks blushing as she looked away, shocked that she'd been so forward with a 'fictional' character. \"That is certainly the opposite reaction I usually receive from females who enter the game, especially the ones who reside in my body,\" he replied, a small smile creeping across her face. Eve, slightly embarrassed, changed the subject, \"In both versions of the game I've been briefed on the hippos come first but in one there are motorcycle men next but in the other, the threats are animals. Do you happen to know which one I'm in?\" \"Oh you little Dear,\" Sheldon answered, a laugh in his speech, \"We don't know either, not until Nigel gives us the map. I'll be just as surprised as you are,\" he finished, offering her a smile, \"Don't be shy because of what you said, Eve. I'm a real person trapped here and I would be lucky to have a woman like you interested in me.\" Before Eve had a chance to say anything, Nigel's SUV pulled up and the group got inside to find out the course of their game.[Chapter 3] Nigel dropped the group off on a large green hill, handing Sheldon the map just before he drove away. \"Just one time, he could drive us to the jaguar statue and get this over with,\" Mouse yelled out, his tone filled with annoyance causing Eve to hide her laughter. \"Which map did we get?\" Bravestone asked as he and Ruby moved toward Sheldon, curious as to which fate they were up against. Sheldon opened the map and began analyzing it as Seaplane and Mouse moved toward him as well, Eve staying away, lost in thought. \"Do I have abilities since I'm not a character?\" Eve asked, interrupting the silence that had taken over while Sheldon looked at the paper, still not answering Bravestone's question. Ruby moved away from the men and walked over, \"Tap your left breast. If you have some, they'll pop up above you,\" she explained, \"Sorry about my attitude when you first arrived, I'm just over playing this game but it's not your fault.\" \"It's ok,\" Eve replied, \"I imagine I would be too,\" she sympathized before tapping the location and sighing in defeat as nothing happened, \"Guess I'm a wildcard.\" \"We are playing a combined version which we've never done before,\" Sheldon finally spoke. \"What does that mean?\" Seaplane asked pulling off his aviators as if that was a symbol of the gravity of their situation. Sheldon frowned before he began his explanation, \"Because we have an 'OC',\" he began unable to come up with a better word, \"We are going to play the game both ways which means we'll have to divide into two teams. One team will go through the entire jungle, facing each animal until they reach the beginning of the game again which means they've won. However, the rest will take the gem to the jaguar and face the usual obstacles in that course of the game.\" Bravestone was the first to speak, \"That's insane! How will we know when, or if, the other team wins? Do both teams have to win in order to beat the game?\" Sheldon nodded, \"We all have to complete the game we've been assigned to in order to win and each of our teams will have a flare to signal their completion,\" he expanded upon his original speech. Eve shook her head trying to hide her excitement because this could not be better for her needs before she held it together and asked, \"So, how do we divide up our two teams? I have no skills so I won't be offended if I'm anyone's last choice,\" she said, honestly. \"If one team has to go up against all the animals, then I should be on that one,\" Mouse spoke up, \"I don't care who's with me but we play that version less so I would like the map reader on my side.\" Seaplane spoke next, \"I should be on the jaguar team since a crucial piece of that mission requires me to fly the helicopter and Ruby is essential as well since she's our main distraction,\" he paused as he caught an angry glare from her, \"Because of your badass fighting skills,\" her corrected himself, in fear she'd use them on him. \"I think that settles it pretty much except for myself and Ms. Dixon, here,\" Bravestone added before looking at Eve, \"Do you have a preference over which team you're on? We are doing this for you, after all.\" Eve thought for a moment before answering, attempting to make her decision without basing it on being with Dr. Oberon. Finally, she replied, \"I'd like to go with Mouse and Sheldon, if that's alright? I have a really good account of the game you'll be on, but the other one is almost a mystery to me,\" she answered before a thought came to her, \"Bravestone, do you need to be with Mouse since he carries your weapons?\" Bravestone shook his head, \"I can do it without them and your group might need them,\" he looked at Sheldon, \"Are you ok with this team idea? You don't have a fighter,\" he added, looking at the group which included weaknesses ranging from cake to endurance. Sheldon looked over at Eve, a strange feeling washing over him as he did, before looking back at Smolder and nodding, \"I'm good. We'll signal when we complete the mission,\" he then looked at Smolder, Seaplane and Ruby, \"You all, be careful. We've never done either of these missions without five.\" \"Agreed,\" Bravestone commented, \"We'll see you at the end.\" Eve smiled at the other team before she followed Sheldon and Mouse into the woods in the opposite direction of the others, her nerves finally taking hold as she walked into the unknown.[Chapter 4] \"So, what kind of animals do you usually run into on this path?\" Eve asked, attempting to make conversation and create a bond with her team, \"Alan Parrish mentioned lions and monkeys when I interviewed him, but he's very old now and it's hard to know what's real and what's in his imagination.\" Mouse looked back at her, nodding, \"Parrish was right on both counts, but he left out rhinos and alligators, both of which pose a huge threat to us,\" he answered before thinking outloud, \"Man! Why'd we go on this mission without any muscle?\" Sheldon looked at him, shaking his head, \"We've done this a hundred times, Mouse. Have a little faith,\" he looked at Eve before continuing, \"And, if Jumanji allowed Eve to enter as herself then there must be something about her which makes her worthy. Are you scared yet, Dear?\" he asked, causing her to blush at the way he addressed her, though he was most likely just being polite. Eve nodded, not wanting to but honesty was always better, \"I don't want to be but everything I've done has been from the safety of my world behind a notebook or a computer. Now that I'm actually here, it's hard to explain the feeling I'm having, there's some excitement, but it's being driven away by my sudden worry over getting eaten by a lion,\" she admitted. Sheldon slowed down, just slightly, to walk in pace with Eve before he looked at her, \"You're in good hands and I would never let anything happen to you,\" he reassured her as Mouse made a gagging noise from ahead. \"Problem Mouse?\" \"Yeah, I got a problem!\" Mouse shouted, \"You two met less then five minutes ago and you're both begin gross and mushy like you've been in love for five years. Quit it,\" he ordered, \"I'm not here to watch you two progress into some kind of cute couple who makes out when the game is over.\" \"He's a little sensitive,\" Eve commented quietly, looking at Sheldon, \"I appreciate your words and I am hoping that my faith in you came from more then just my attraction,\" she admitted causing his cheeks to redden before they continued moving forward through the trees in silence. As they reached the depth of the forest, Mouse stopped, lifting his arms to signal Sheldon and Eve to stop too. \"What is it, Mouse?\" Sheldon asked, moving his arm out protectively in front of Eve. Mouse turned his head and mouthed the answer, wanting to make as little noise as possible, 'lions.' Eve felt her stomach sink as she watched Mouse's lips reveal what they were about to face and she quickly went over, in her mind, everything she knew about lions, in hopes to have some plan before the animals reached them. \"Don't worry, you'll be ok,\" Sheldon turned and whispered to her as three lions appeared from the brush in front of them, walking toward the team slowly. 'Don't run,' Eve thought to herself actively because every muscle in her body wanted to sprint. Ahead of her, Mouse began taking steps backward slowly, keeping his face toward the creatures, Sheldon and Eve following along, keeping calm. \"What do we do if they attack us even with these precautions?\" Sheldon whispered to Mouse, realizing how long it had been since they'd played this version of Jumanji. Eve spoke without even thinking, \"Screaming from your gut while waving your arms in the air can cause them to back away or punching them in the nose can buy us the time we'd need to get to shelter, and, look there's one for each of us,\" she was almost joking as she finished, the humor and insanity of what she'd gotten herself into sinking in. Mouse shook his head, turning just barely to address them, \"Thanks Eve, but that's kind of my job to give animal encounter advice.\" \"Did she miss anything?\" Sheldon whispered back, smiling himself at how well she was doing in their first challenge of the game. Mouse shook his head in frustration before Eve saw a small hut to their right and she used her arm, raising it just a hare to point, \"Let's start backing in that direction,\" she whispered, slightly louder than they'd been doing, \"We can hold up in there until they give up.\" Sheldon and Mouse agreed with their eyes only as the three turned their backing up to go toward the small cabin in the forest, keeping their eyes locked with the lion's to maintain their dominance for as long as possible. Miraculously, Sheldon, Mouse and Eve were able to walk backwards into the hut and lock the door without provoking the lions into an actual attack. Mouse looked at Eve, once they could all breathe once more, \"So, what's your area of study? I'm just curious since you came up with all that in the heat of the moment,\" he added, his tone threatened but also, just a little, curious. Eve shrugged her shoulders, \"I'm actually a communications major getting my PHd in healthcare management, however, before I chose to find the game and try to enter, I studied the ways to handle meeting the animals in Jumanji. I wanted to be as prepared as I could so that I wouldn't come off as a burden on my team,\" she answered, her tone firm in a way that challenged Mouse to retaliate to her explanation. Mouse nodded, \"I'm going to keep watch,\" he announced, knowing his annoyance wasn't with her, \"I'll tell you guys when they're gone and we can continue our game.\" \"Thanks Mouse,\" Sheldon replied before taking a seat on the floor of the small wooden hut and pulling out the map. Eve sat down across from him, \"I'm sorry if I'm causing trouble,\" she stated, breaking his concentration as he looked up, his eyes meeting hers, though both of theirs were obscured by glasses. \"You were very impressive back there,\" Sheldon replied giving her a smile, as he reached his hand out toward her, placing it on her need, comfortingly, \"Don't worry about Mouse. He's defensive because those facts you shared are what he offers to the team and he felt like his place was being taken, but it wasn't you. Are you alright after that encounter?\" he asked, giving her knee a small squeeze. She nodded, \"It wasn't as scary as I'd imagined ,and somehow, having you there in front of me let me feel safe and able to recall what I'd learned. Thank you,\" she added with a smile which he mirrored before looking away back to his map.[Chapter 5] Mouse appeared back in the room where Sheldon and Eve had been sitting in a comfortable silence and announced, \"The lions left so we need to get moving before they decide to double back.\" Sheldon nodded as he stood before offering his hand to Eve which she gladly took and allowed him to help her from the floor, \"Thank you,\" she said softly, holding onto his hand for a moment longer then necessary but also noting he didn't try to release her. \"Of course,\" he finally said before he let go with a brief, possibly in her mind, look of regret before they followed Mouse out of their hut and began moving in the direction they'd been going before the lions crossed their path. Sheldon was doing his best to walk next to Eve as they journeyed through the jungle, the temperature rising as midday began. Eve looked over at him, raising her eyes just slightly to meet his, \"Any chance that map of yours shows what we'll face next?\" she asked with a grin as she was finally feeling more excitement then fear once more. He looked over at her, his hat hanging crookedly off his head which Eve reached up to fix, noting his eyes close for a brief moment as her fingers grazed his face while she was pulling away. \"Um,\" he gathered himself as he tried to answer, \"In this version of the game, the geography of the land changes to make sure it never gets too predictable. That being said, we could possible encounter monkeys, rhinos or alligators next,\" he replied, looking at her, their eye contact strong until Mouse spoke. \"How come the other side of the game always goes the same way but this one has to change?\" Mouse asked, ruining what may have been a moment for Shelley and Eve. \"It doesn't make any sense, is all I'm saying.\" \"It doesn't, does it,\" Eve replied before she looked up at the trees and saw a small orange monkey looking back down at her. \"Guys,\" she said to get the men's attention as she pointed to the tops of the trees which surrounded them in the depths of the jungle. Mouse was the first to speak as they progressed forward, \"They aren't here to hurt us but they will take our things if we don't protect them. If they get the map, well, you get the idea,\" he said before adding, \"you two might wanna put your glasses somewhere harder to reach if you can see.\" Eve looked at Sheldon and saw him nodding in encouragement as he was pulling his off and putting them into a pocket to which Eve did the same. They kept walking, so far, unnoticed, each step they took more delicate then the last. Mouse moved to the front, staying alert as he guided them, one step at a time, through the monkey ceiling growing above them. \"There's a campsite at the end of this portion of the jungle where we can rest once we make it though,\" Sheldon shared as Mouse added, \"Once we are outside these trees, we're in the clear. These monkeys won't go in the open because they have no coverage from predators.\" Eve nodded at what both men shared as they continued their carefully stepped journey through the trees, barely breathing for fear of alerting the monkeys to their presence. Eve felt herself begin to smile as she saw the opening ahead and knowing they were almost in the clear of their second, well technically third even though they'd skipped the hippos, challenge in the game. Sheldon reached back, grabbing Eve's hand without even thinking, as they crossed the last batch of trees and found themselves in an open plain of grass again, similar to the one Nigel had dropped them at. Eve noticed that Sheldon hadn't released her hand as he looked over his map, with his other hand, for the location of the camping grounds. Mouse was frowning at them, though he kept his opinions to himself, this time. \"That way,\" Sheldon finally announced, pointing toward a small patch of trees about five hundred feet from where they stood, \"We can set up there for a brief rest and start a fire.\" \"Whatever you say, Casanova,\" Mouse replied as he began walking in the direction Sheldon had pointed out casing Eve to let go of Sheldon's and look at him. \"Why is he so against you and I flirting?\" she asked once Mouse was safely ahead of them. Sheldon shook his head, \"He knows that once the game ends, you'll go home and he's just looking out for me.\" Eve was intrigued, but also nervous, as she followed up with a second question, \"Have you fallen for someone who's entered the game before?\" Part of her didn't want the answer but she needed it, at the same time. Sheldon shook his head as he stopped and turned to look at her, \"No, I never have but Bravestone did once and it didn't end well,\" he paused as he remembered it vividly, \"He begged her to stay but she wanted to go back home and we had to pick up the pieces. Mouse doesn't want any of us to go through that ever again.\" \"I didn't know his objections were from such a terrible place,\" Eve replied, her heart shattering for these people, \"Maybe it would be best if we put the brakes on our own flirtation because it's not like I can take you all back with me,\" she added, looking away as she did because she wanted to experience whatever they were dancing around, as brief as it may be. Sheldon reached out, placing his fingers under her chin and pulling her to look at him once more, \"I am not afraid of pain,\" he admitted, \"I may not look as tough as Bravestone, but in this respect I am. We won't force anything, but I promise I can handle it if something happened and you left, because I'd rather experience it then protect myself,\" he confessed looking dead in her eyes, the truth to his words within his. Eve nodded, unsure of how to reply, but replied, \"I agree with your philosophy, so let's just continue as we have been and just learn to block Mouse out,\" she said the last part with a smile, in attempt to lighten the mood between them. Sheldon laughed as they began walking again to the camp, \"I've been doing that for years.\"[Chapter 6] After a short rest, Sheldon was the first to initiate that they continue on their path, \"Wake up, sleepy heads, our other team has a shorter journey and we don't want to be the reason we lose,\" he said as he began shaking Mouse and Eve's shoulders. Eve stirred first, \"Five more minutes,\" she whined because she hadn't slept in over two days while finishing up her thesis, \"I can't get up yet.\" Sheldon leaned down over her and placed his lips to her ear before whispering, \"That's too bad because you need to get up or we'll lose and you assignment will never get finished.\" Eve started to sit up, faster then Sheldon had expected, as she slammed the side of her head into his face causing him to pull back letting out a groan of pain. \"I'm so sorry,\" she said, her tone urgent as she reached up to touch his face where she'd bashed him, \"Are you ok?\" she asked. Sheldon nodded, \"I will be,\" he replied, placing his over hers on the place, \"I should have thought that plan out more thoroughly,\" he added with a small smile to reassure her that it was alright before he moved over to wake Mouse. Eve began packing up her things when she noticed that she hadn't taken any notes about her time in Jumanji yet so she quickly jotted down everything she could recall since her arrival while the men got themselves ready for the next leg of their adventure. Mouse led the way, avoiding any sweet moments Sheldon and Eve might stumble upon during their trek as Sheldon was reading the map to locate their next step. The map turned out not be necessary as they reached the side of a river. \"Do we have any way to cross?\" Eve asked, looking at the bank in both directions as far as she could see, \"Or, can we swim across?\" she added, knowing her answer was most likely a no. Sheldon shook his head, instantly, turning the map in her direction, \"This river is infested with alligators so badly, in fact, that if you were to place just your toe in that water, they would come.\" Eve nodded, \"Ok, not going to try and swim, that's for sure, but how are we going to do it? Do we need to build a raft?\" Mouse sighed, \"You have so many questions, it's like you've never played…\" he stopped himself as he realized what he was saying, \"My bad, I forgot because this is the first time a 'new' person has joined.\" \"We usually build a raft if there isn't one nearby,\" Sheldon interceded, reaching out and giving Eve's shoulder a little squeeze, \"We need as much wood and rope as we can find.\" Eve nodded as she turned to head back into the wooded area and begin collecting supplies which included the largest, thickest logs she could stumble on. Once she had as many as she could carry in her arms, she walked back to the riverbank where the other two were putting together what they'd found. She laid down what she'd found and saw that she'd carried much more then either of the men, \"Was I not supposed to get that much?\" she asked, her voice conveying her surprise. Sheldon smiled up at her while he was tying together what they had, \"No, it's just that our weaknesses don't allow us to grab as much as you did. If you weren't here, it would take us all day to build this,\" he finished looking back at his work. \"Looks like you're more useful then we thought,\" Mouse added with a large grin on his face. Sheldon shook his head, \"Correction, she's more helpful then you thought,\" he interjected, \"I always knew she had something,\" he stopped as his cheeks flushed and resumed his work. Once the raft was ready, the three boarded it and began the trip across the alligator infested river. \"So, just out of curiosity, how does this usually go down?\" Eve asked as her eye was caught by something moving in the water, closing her eyes to pretend it wasn't there. Mouse and Sheldon were using paddles to keep them on target but Mouse replied, \"It's about a fifty-fifty shot everytime, but it's a guarantee that at least one person will lose a life.\" Eve faked a smile, \"Thanks,\" she lied and noticed Sheldon looking down at her. Once he had her attention, he mouthed, 'You'll be fine.' They continued making their way through the water as more alligators appeared around them, as if they were simply waiting on one of them to fall off, and in no need to make it happen. Eve was calming down once she saw the other side of the river closing in but suddenly the raft got stuck. \"What's going on?\" she asked, her voice in full panic. Sheldon looked around, using his oar to check and found they'd gotten caught on vines, \"We're stuck,\" he replied, \"Eve, remember your plan to swim?\" \"The plan I was shut down on before I could even finish the sentence?\" she asked to which Mouse shouted in agreement. \"I'm not getting in that water!\" Mouse yelled, \"We've lost the element of surprise. These things have been waiting for us to get in the water.\" \"We'll be alright if we just swim fast,\" Sheldon replied, \"The shoreline is right there. Mouse, you can go in the middle if you want so you aren't lagging behind or the first one to alert the alligators to what we're doing.\" Mouse nodded bitterly when Eve asked, \"Do you want me to go first or last? I'm pretty fast but I don't know about you two.\" Sheldon nodded, \"You're right about that, so you should go first so that we don't slow you down while you make your escape,\" he said, logically. Eve began to shake her head, \"I don't want anything to happen to you,\" she revealed as she stood and moved closer to Sheldon, placing one of her hands on his cheek while she let the other rest on his cheek, \"I'd be devastated.\" \"Don't worry about me,\" Mouse whined but neither heard. Sheldon shook his head, placing his hand on top of hers, \"You don't have to worry about me, I promise.\" \"Just in case,\" Eve said softly before she leaned forward placing her lips gently to his, feeling his surprise at her actions but easily relaxing and giving into the kiss until Eve pulled away, \"See you on land.\" She said her words bravely before she leaped into the river and began swimming as fast as she good not allowing herself to look on either side for what might be hunting her. She couldn't look back either, afraid of what she might see. After a harrowing few minutes, Eve reached shore and pulled herself onto land, catching her breath when she finally looked to see Mouse and Sheldon right behind her. Mouse began climbing out when one of the alligators appeared right behind Sheldon. \"Sheldon, swim faster!\" Eve yelled as she pulled Mouse out but her warning came to late as the animal grabbed Sheldon between his large jaws, disappearing back underwater. \"No!\" Eve screamed out, her heart racing a mile a minute. Mouse stood and patted her shoulder, \"Your reaction is way overboard,\" he informed her, \"Like, it's really not necessary,\" he added as her face looked at him with a confused expression before she heard a sound from above. Suddenly, Sheldon Oberon came crashing to the ground just as Eve had done when she first entered the game. \"Of course,\" she said aloud as she raced to his side, helping him up from the ground, \"I was so worried,\" she revealed before wrapping her arms around his waist causing him to do the same, his head chin resting on the top of her head, feeling as though it should always be that way. When she let him go and backed away, she was much calmer, \"I forgot about the lives,\" she admitted, \"Thanks Mouse for letting me know what I fool I was being,\" she added before she started to shiver from being in wet clothes as the sun started to go down. Sheldon moved forward, pulling off his jacket, and draping it over her shoulders, \"Guess it's a good thing I'm dry thanks to that tangle with the gator, isn't it?\" he added a smile at the end, his own mind wrapped up in the kiss they'd shared before they left the safety of their raft. She smiled back, \"I guess so,\" she began, \"I'm just glad I can kiss you again at some point,\" she added with a small wink before they began their journey once again, knowing they were nearing the finish line.[Chapter 7] \"Do you hear that?\" Eve asked as they walked into a cavern looking location where they were between two large cliffs of rocks. Mouse listened and shook his head, \"You are hearing things. The game is getting to you,\" he replied before shrugging off her concerns. Sheldon, on the other hand, nodded, \"It sounds like a helicopter which could mean our other team is nearby,\" he stated, before reaching out his hand to her in hopes she'd hold it while they walked. Eve beamed as she laced her fingers into his and began their journey, keeping their ears peeled for the sound of the chopper to appear again. \"Professor Oberon?\" Eve began, grabbing his attention. \"Why did you address me so formally?\" he asked in reply, \"You haven't called me that since our very first introduction,\" he added in confusion. She smiled, shyly, before speaking, \"I like the way it sounds, to be honest, and this question seems more formal then what we've been discussing so far,\" she paused allowing him the chance to decline to answer, but he didn't. \"Would you come back with me, if you were allowed after we finished?\" she asked, feeling vulnerable as she said each word before looking away. Sheldon smiled softly as he nudged her with his elbow, \"Look at me,\" he requested in just above a whisper waiting until she did. Eve turned her head, hesitantly, until her eyes were locked in his, then he continued, \"The chances of Nigel allowing any of us to leave Jumanji are slim, at best, however, even though I barely know you, if he granted us freedom, I would absolutely go with you,\" he revealed, his lips curling into a small smile as he finished while watching Eve's face light up at his reply. Before either could continue their conversation, Mouse came running back toward them, \"We need to take cover now!\" he shouted. Behind him, they could see a pack of rhinos bounding in their direction as the helicopter they'd heard barreled down toward the animals. \"I guess it's a good thing he goes ahead to avoid our affections,\" Eve joked gaining a grin from Sheldon before they raced to the side of the cavern, slipping into a cave to wait out the stampede. \"Our team was flying above them,\" Mouse said once they all caught their breath, \"That means they're almost done with their game mission.\" Sheldon nodded, \"But, they are in the version where the gem gets dropped because the helicopter was hit which gives us a slightly larger time frame but we're almost there,\" he added, \"According to my map, our goal is just at the other end of this large abyss.\" Eve looked at Mouse and Sheldon before speaking, \"There's just a large group of angry rhinoceros in our way, so, no big deal.\" Sheldon smirked at her, \"You've been the most positive this whole time and I know you can keep that up just a little bit longer,\" he urged before moving toward her and leaning down to place a small kiss onto her forehead. \"Can you guys just now?\" Mouse yelled in frustration, \"It's bad enough I'm trapped in this tiny cave with you two! Can the rhinos hurry up and finish running across this area?\" Eve shook her head at Mouse's outburst as a thought occurred to her, \"What do you guys do when the game isn't being played? Do you sit at the beginning and wait or are you brought there once it starts?\" she asked far more questions then she'd intended but that hadn't come to her yet as a concern regarding the game. Sheldon nodded, preparing to answer her multiple inquiries, \"When we're not playing the game, the five of us hang out at Alan Parrish's hut where Seaplane makes margaritas and we stay entertained in any way we can think of. Every once in a while, the game gives us mini missions but that's all.\" Eve acknowledged his explanation, \"That's better then what I had in my mind,\" she continued, \"I had this visual of the five of you just sitting where I fell into the game, stuck, until the game was started. I could never do that but margaritas sound ok.\" Mouse cleared his throat, \"Sorry to break this up but the rhinos are gone so we need to make a break for it and clear this cavern as quickly as possible.\" \"Agreed,\" Sheldon replied as he looked at Eve, wondering about her curiosities regarding what they do when they're stuck, and offered his hand, \"Are you ready to finish this thing?\" Eve's lips curled into a smile as she took his hand, \"Take me to the finish line,\" she replied before leaning in closer and whispering, \"Maybe you can do that in a different way later on,\" she stated softly before moving out of the cave, almost pulling him with her as he was processing what she said. Mouse led them to the end of the cavern where they began the climb out, Mouse in the lead, Eve in the middle and Sheldon bringing up the rear. By some miracle, they hadn't run into any rhinos. \"Ok,\" Eve said, out of breath as she reached the top and smiled at the sight of grass again, \"Where do we go next and what's left before the end of this game?\" she asked, her heart beating so fast, she thought she could hear it through her chest. Sheldon pulled the map from his vest and looked it over for a moment before answering, \"We just have to walk through that small patch of trees and the end is on the other side.\" Mouse shook his head, \"It can't be that easy,\" he argued, his tone indignant, \"Tell me what we might face in that 'small' patch of trees and then maybe I'll believe you and go in.\" Eve couldn't suppress her laughter at Mouse's outburst that time as she sat down on the ground, in hysterics. Mouse shook his head, hands on his hips, \"Oh, this is funny to you? The challenges and the danger? You just can't stop laughing about it?\" Real professional for someone trying to get their PHd,\" he commented, his frustration coming through loud and clear. Eve shook her head as she gathered herself, \"I'm not laughing at the danger,\" she choked out, trying to stop before she spoke again. \"I'm laughing at your outbursts because they are so frequent but so funny, at the same time!\" she almost let out a roar of hysterics but she was able to contain it, not knowing what might be around to hear her. She looked at Sheldon, \"So, what are we going to face in there?\" she asked, sobering up as she saw Mouse looking at her, unamused but Sheldon was struggling to keep his composure and not join her in laughter. \"Well, it depends as always by which version we're playing,\" Sheldon began, catching a nasty glance from Mouse, \"But, most often, there is a hunter awaiting us. His name is Van Pelt and he is angry at us for interfering with his shot at the rhinos below.\" Eve nodded, completely sober, \"So, is he going to be hunting us now?\" Mouse nodded before Sheldon could say a word. \"Sounds great,\" she said with a sarcastic tone, \"Let's get this thing done,\" she said before beginning the walk to the wooded area hiding a crazed lunatic. Sheldon and Mouse followed behind, hoping for the first time since they'd broken into teams that they had Bravestone.[Chapter 8] Eve walked into the trees, hesitant, because a hunter would be at least three steps ahead of them. Sheldon was right next to her, his hand protectively on her lower back as they walked, while Mouse picked up the rear. Mouse was on the lookout for animals in case Sheldon's prediction regarding the hunter was wrong. \"How scary is this hunter? No one I've spoken to even remembers a hunter of any kind,\" Eve began, as she looked back at Sheldon for just a brief moment, her senses all on high alert. Sheldon sighed before speaking, in a low tone, \"He is the protector of the game and even though he was looking for a rhinoceros, finding you would be an even greater prize. The game is programmed to make the players forget him so that there will be at least one surprise when they play,\" he explained gaining a nod from Eve. \"That's awesome,\" she said, sarcastically again, \"I love the idea of being stuffed and hung on a wall because I don't belong in the game,\" she turned back and looked at Mouse, \"Give me a weapon from you bag,\" she instructed, \"I'm not going down without a fight.\" Mouse looked to Sheldon for approval but all he received was a shoulder shrug, \"You might as well,\" Sheldon finally said, giving Mouse the approval he sought. \"Was that so hard?\" Mouse asked, his voice shrill, \"These are Bravestone's and I can't just be handing them out without at least one other person's approval. Jeez!\" he finished as he handed Eve a katana. Her eyes grew large at the sight of it, \"This seems extreme for the circumstances but it's really cool, so I don't care,\" she admired the weapon before looking at the two men once more, \"Ok, let's do this.\" Mouse gave Sheldon another nervous glance at her excitement over the sword but that was the extent of their exchange as they followed Eve through the trees, no path to be found. After around five minutes of walking, Eve stopped in her tracks causing Mouse and Sheldon to do the same. \"What is it, Dear?\" Sheldon asked, his voice soft, just above a whisper. She turned and gave him a quick smile for the 'Dear' comment, \"I heard something to our right. How close are we to the end of this area?\" she asked, before adding, \"Handsome.\" Sheldon's cheeks reddened as he pulled out the map once more, reviewing the distance they'd already gone, \"We are within a few minutes walk to the end,\" he announced. Eve nodded, looking at Mouse, \"We can make it as long as we keep up the same soft footed pace,\" she said before adding, \"Look at me, turning into a jungle master,\" she beamed. Mouse shook his head but Sheldon couldn't help but smile at her happiness as they continued through the jungle to the end of the game, where he was not ready to go. \"Look at this bunch,\" another voice joined them moments after they'd begun walking again, \"That one doesn't look familiar. Are you sneaking people into Jumanji on top of ruining my hunt?\" the voice asked as the rest of him entered their view. He was a small man carrying a bayonet, with a hat and a handlebar mustache that could embarrass just about anyone. \"Van Pelt, I presume,\" Eve spoke in reply to his many comments, \"You don't want to stand in our way, so I'll give you a chance to leave this area before we force you to,\" she threatened. Sheldon walked closer to her, whispering in her ear, \"This is not a great plan, just wanted to make sure you were aware,\" he said before stepping back causing Eve to roll her eyes as she awaited Mouse's outburst to follow but when she turned his direction, he was frozen. Van Pelt marched forward, closing the gap between himself and the team, \"You don't need to worry yourself with empty threats to me. You simply need to surrender and I'll personally take you to the game's end and send you on your way. You don't belong, Ms,\" he added insult to injury. Mouse moved forward and spoke, \"Eve Dixon does belong. It's you who has no place here.\" \"They're both right, Van Pelt,\" Sheldon stepped forward, resting his hand on her shoulder, almost possesively, \"Leave now,\" he ordered. Van Pelt laughed at their unity in standing up to him and as he laughed, Eve moved toward him with her katana out and ready. She moved softly across the jungle floor until she was upon him where she simply sliced through the strap holding his gun, sending it to the floor. \"You're unarmed,\" Eve informed him as he looked to his shoulder to see what she'd done, \"My offer still stands, you may walk away on your own or we'll force you,\" she repeated as Mouse moved and scooped up the hunter's weapon and placed it inside his backpack. Van Pelt shook his head as he back away from her sword, \"You've not heard the last from me, I can promise you that,\" he said before turning and leaving them alone. \"Let's go,\" Mouse instructed once they were clear and the trio raced toward the end of the trees to reach the game's end. Eve reached the open greenery first followed by Mouse and Sheldon at the same time. \"What do we do now?\" she asked, out of breath from the sprint of the trees. Mouse was the first to answer as he pulled the flare from his backpack, \"We have to shoot this and if they reply then we must all shout Jumanji to end the game,\" he stated. Sheldon nodded, urging Mouse to shoot the flare which he did, sending a large green flame into the sky. While they watched the sky for their reply, Eve made her way to Sheldon's side, wrapping her arms around his waist as she laid her head against his chest, craving each moment they could have together. As they waited, a matching green signal came from across the game causing Eve to let go of Sheldon before Mouse, Eve, and Sheldon looked at eachother. Sheldon looked at Eve, raising his hand to her face, cupping her cheek, \"Are you ready?\" She nodded, \"I guess.\" \"Jumanji!\" the three shouted in unison before they were suddenly rejoined by Bravestone, Seaplane and Ruby. Mouse looked at Bravestone, \"How'd your mission go? Any complications?\" Bravestone nodded, \"Plenty but we all did it and now we can go back to our regular lives between games,\" he replied as Nigel drove up and got out of his SUV. \"Congratulations, you have save Jumanji and it thanks you. We all do,\" Nigel began, \"It's time for you to leave, Ms. Dixon. Are you ready?\" Eve looked around at the 'characters' before she spoke, \"Nigel, can they leave with me?\" she asked, her heart pounding as she awaited an answer, her eyes squarely focused on Sheldon Oberon. Nigel shook his head, \"I'm afraid not, Ms. Dixon. Now, are you ready to go?\" Eve shook her head, \"No, I'm not,\" she began, \"Can I stay and become a character in the game like the rest of them? I want to stay with Professor Oberon,\" she confessed, no longer caring about her thesis or anything else. Nigel stood in silence for a moment before he finally spoke, \"Yes, Eve Dixon, you may join the game. You will now be a choice for anyone who chooses to play and your specialty will be swordsman so you should hang on to that katana. If you'll not be leaving, then I'll go back to my other duties. Is that alright?\" Eve nodded, \"Yes, thank you Nigel.\" Nigel left and Eve looked at the group, \"Well guys, will you have me?\" she asked, hoping she'd won them over during her time there so far. Sheldon agreed by walking forward and wrapping his arms around her waist, resting his hands on her hips as he leaned down and placed his lips to hers, teasing them with his tongue as she responded and moved her hands to the buttons of his vest, gasping against his mouth. \"You can stay as long as you two get a room! Jeez!\" Mouse yelled as they group began the journey back to Parrish's hut knowing Oberon and Dixon would catch up. The End ","Summary":" A/N: The first chapter is setting up my OC so it starts slow but then it'll ramp up \"Professor, yo"},{"Movie":"Ghost Ship","Title":"The Ferryman","Author":"Lady North the Cynical","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4458743","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Author's Note: The first bit is just a bit of backstory, I don't plan for it to really do anything else. This chapter really is all backstory. Bit of niceness before we really kick things off. Reviews would be nice. It wasn't enough. Despite everything Lucifer tried in the West, and even in the East, he lost souls to his enemy daily. His triumph had been at the dawn of time, where all of humanity had fallen. But – blast and damn him – his enemy had found a way to thwart him. And so, the cunning Lucifer had devised a plan. The chink he had created in the metaphorical armour of humanity made them awfully susceptible to any number of things. Gold, good food, a beautiful woman. Such simple things. And nowhere were such faults as strong as in the West. So he had sent out the man they call The Ferryman. To force one final, damning sin, and thus salvage souls. A last ditch effort, but it seemed to work. Until now. The Ferryman allowed himself to be thwarted. Thwarted by a woman. Despite his outrage, Lucifer had to smirk. Ironic that that woman had destroyed his plans whereas Eve had unwittingly assisted them. Her life was less than it had once been. She was reduced to a small apartment. The walls were a disgusting shade of khaki, but she had plastered them in photos, so you could hardly see the wall colour. Every photo she had was on those walls. Photos of her crew. Anything to remind her of better days as she went about her daily life. She left the salvaging business. It seemed to be the most obvious course of action. She took an office job in the city, but left after three weeks. No, she was not meant to work in an office. But what, instead, could she do? All she knew was salvaging, and there was no way she could go back to that. The answer came to her one day as she attended her weekly appointment with her psychiatrist. (The hospital's idea of course. They all thought she was crazy.) She sat in a chair, saying nothing (as she usually did) and fingering the locket around her neck absently. She didn't know she was doing it, until her shrink asked to see inside. Epps nodded and opened it up. \"Is that your grandparents?\" her shrink asked. \"No,\" Epps replied, speaking for the first time in a month. \"Those are Katie's parents.\" It was an automatic reply. She had hardly involved her brain in the process. \"Who is Katie?\" Dr Hill asked. \"Just a…friend,\" Epps replied, choosing her words carefully. The little ghost girl. Her parents would never have known what had become of her. On her way home from her visit, she stopped at an electrical shop and bought the first laptop she could see. The second she got home, she ignored the growing pile of washing, the dishes in the sink, cleared a space on her kitchen table, plugged in her laptop and switched it on. A year later, she had begun to build herself a respectable name as an author. She wrote a children's series about a little girl from the sixties. Children across the globe enjoyed hearing of Katie's adventures; Katie and the Big Sea Voyage, Katie in New York City , and Epps was now working on Katie 's School Project. The stories were simple, but children do love simplicity. That is what Maureen Epps did with herself. She gave Katie Harwood back the life that was stolen from her. Stolen from her by Jack Ferriman. She could let go of that. Jack Ferriman had not only stolen Katie's life, but her own as well. The life she should have had; running the salvaging business with Murphy, spending months at sea with the monkeys she called her family. So that was why she had one room dedicated to a most peculiar hobby.[Chapter 2] A/N: Sorry it's been so long between chapters. I will try to keep updates coming more frequently from now on. (But we have all heard that before. Please don't shoot me if I take ages, I will try, promise!) Reviews would be nice, but aren't necessary. Disclaimer: Ghost Ship, its characters, and its plot were created by Mark Hanlon. I am simply a poor sod who is so desperate for story ideas that I have to sponge off someone else's. An entire room covered in corkboards. Pinned to the cork boards are photographs of ships. Every ship that has gone missing and thus spun legends is pinned to that wall. Pieces of paper accompany these photos. Passenger manifests, cargo lists, itineraries, even transcripts of radio transmissions. Some of the ship's names are highlighted. A most peculiar hobby. Particularly for a children's author. April 20th, on board The Transit Lux. The Ferryman marched through the ship, while a weedy little historian cowered in a dark corner. He knew where the wretched soul was hiding, and so he took his time, relishing in the fear radiating from the tiny man. \"Let me guess,\" said an unexpected voice from behind him. \"He led you to some great mysterious vessel that was going to make all your dreams come true, and then he killed you all off one by one?\" The tiny man wimpered. There was the sound of footsteps, then there was the sensation of warm breath on his neck. \"That is the way it works, isn't it, Ferryman?\" The Ferryman smiled evilly. \"Maureen Epps,\" he said, turning round. \"Couldn't get enough of me, eh?\" He slipped an arm round her waist. \"Oh I think the world has had quite enough of you, Jack Ferryman,\" she said coldly, grabbing his arm and twisting it into his chest. The tiny man seemed to have deemed this the perfect opportunity to escape, as The Ferryman heard his little feet pattering down a hallway. He didn't even care. The plan had changed. He massaged her hand with his, and bent his head close to hers. \"That's not very nice,\" he said in a low, seductive tone. He moved to kiss her, but in an instant she had broken her hand free of his grip and was two metres away, with a handgun loaded and aimed at his chest. \"Don't you remember? You can't kill me\" The Ferryman reminded her. \"And don't you remember,\" Epps replied calmly. \"How explosive my anger can be?\" Immediately, the Ferryman saw them. Charges placed through the hull of the Transit Lux, ready to sink the ship, and free the souls. Epps smirked. The Ferryman frowned. \"I'll find another ship,\" he said through gritted teeth. \"It doesn't matter how many thousands of souls you set free, I always trap more.\" Epps pulled a detonator from her pocket and held it up for The Ferryman to see. \"And I will always stop you,\" she replied. Then she pushed the button, ran for a nearby exit, jumped into a motorboat and sped away. The ship began to sink, and The Ferryman saw once-marked souls set free. They met atop Mount Everest. The winds were strong, and for lesser beings, it would have been freezing. The Ferryman, at least, was not cold, for he was being blasted by the fiery breath of Lucifer. \"You let her win!\" Lucifer roared. \"No my Lord, I swear I didn't,\" The Ferryman insisted, bowing low. \"Don't think I do not see what is happening,\" Lucifer continued. \"I am not blind. I can see that you are developing feelings for the woman.\" The Ferryman stayed very quiet. \"You could at least deny it,\" Lucifer observed angrily, stomping about. \"Do not forget, Ferryman,\" Lucifer said icily. \"Why you are in my service to begin with.\" The Ferryman kept his head bowed. \"Immortality, my Lord,\" he replied quietly. \"Yes,\" Lucifer hissed. \"Immortality. A gift. That I may take away as I see fit. Remember this.\" The Ferryman bowed again. \"Of course, my Lord.\" When he stood up again, he was around the corner from his next target.[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: I own nothing. Thank you. A/N: Shorter chapter, but there was no where else for it to go. Very strong Jack/Epps tones in this chapter. Ah, but you don't know what I'm going to do with them! Mwahaha! Enjoy! She was dreaming. She had to be. And yet, never had a dream been so detailed. The taste of the mint he'd just finished. The prickly feel of his end-of-day stubble beneath her fingers. The smell of the fresh sea air moving gently around them and tugging at the folds of her silk dress. The warmth of his arms round her waist, shielding her from the cold. Then the sound of a man crying 'stronger than Lucifer himself', a gunshot, and the smell of smoke. She woke suddenly with the last traces of the dream lingering in the air – he was screaming her name. Epps flicked on the light, and exhaled heavily. She walked into the kitchen and put on a pot of coffee. She frowned at the dishes in the sink, and began to wash them up. By the time she had finished that, the coffee had brewed, but she decided she didn't want any coffee. Epps sat at her kitchen table, her head resting on her hands. Why him? Why was the man in her dream Jack Ferryman? To distract herself, she turned on the television and flicked onto the news. The local news was covering the imminent maiden voyage of the Lady Avalon, an Atlantic cruise ship, a luxury liner if ever there was one. She would be sailing in two weeks, and there were still a limited number of suites available. The highlight of the cruise was apparently the medieval ball on the final night of the voyage. Epps snapped to stare at the television as all the pieces of her dream fell into place. Jack Ferryman would be on that voyage. He would try to take another ship. She would have to stop him. Hopefully that would not have to involve kissing him. Epps reached for the phone, and dialled the booking number. Opted for first class travel, and booked under her relatively well known pen name (Clare O'Wilde – her mother's maiden name) so as to be able to access most areas of the ship (some areas were for V.I.P.'s only). Then, with nothing else really to do, she sat down to finish Katie's School Project. Afterall, she may not live through this. The Ferryman, meanwhile, went from staring at the Lady Avalon to staring at the first-class ticket he held in his hand. \"Another day, another dollar,\" he muttered to himself. Though, strictly speaking, his work didn't actually start for another two weeks, when the Lady Avalon set sail. He roamed the dock, and came to a diner, with a sign boasting the best coffee in town. Well, he had to investigate that, didn't he? Twenty minutes later, he concluded that it was quite possibly the worst coffee in town, but the waitress was a stunner, so he left a generous tip.[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: Nothing belongs to me. Except for Pastor Mitch (who doesn't really count as he is kinda based on someone I know). A/N: Things may get a little complicated this chapter, but stay with me; in the end it will all be clear. I hope. Enjoy! She was here. He could feel her. He had no idea how she had known, but that no longer mattered, because she was here! The Ferryman had no idea if his heart was racing because of anger, or something else, but he chose to believe the former. But somehow, both emotions – however conflicting – agreed that the best thing to do would be to stick to the plan that formed in his mind that night on the Transit Lux. Make her fall in love with him. He walked out on deck to enjoy the fresh sea air. The American coast was still visible behind them, but was quickly growing smaller. Suddenly there was a crashing sound behind him, and he turned to find three children, sitting on a sun chair. Well, the little girl was. Very prim and proper and grown up she looked too, lounging regally on the chair, reading a book. Her companions – two boys of about the same age – were playing with action figurines; Mr Fantastic vs Gandalf the White. It was they who'd made the crashing noises. The Ferryman focused his vision on the title of the book the girl was reading. Katie and the Big Sea Voyage. The name caught his attention. Katie. The little ghost who was responsible for Epps' eventual thwarting of his salvaging mission. But The Ferryman knew there was no way the book could be about her. There was a subtitle too, which The Ferryman couldn't quite make out. He moved closer to the children so as to try and see it, but a nearby woman – clearly a mother of at least one of the three – gave him a guarded look. The Ferryman did not particularly feel like dealing with maternal instincts at that point, so he walked back inside to investigate the ship. There was, he soon discovered, a bookshop on level two, which The Ferryman wandered through absently. At least, until he came across a display. The display was for books by a woman named Clare O'Wilde. There, in the centre of the display, he saw that book. Katie and the Big Sea Voyage. He stared for a moment. The subtitle, he could now see, read The most excellent account of Miss Katie Harwood's journey to America. He couldn't believe it. This was a story about the little ghost girl! How could Clare O'Wilde possibly know about the little ghost girl? He reached for the volume and flipped it over to the back cover – and then froze. Clare O'Wilde was Maureen Epps! There it was, the black-and-white photo of Epps, half-smiling at the camera lense, and the little 'about the author' blurb. Clare lives in a one-bedroom apartment, and calls herself 'a cat-lady – without the cats!'. She can salvage ships, drive a tractor, and loves miso-ramen. \"This,\" The Ferryman thought to himself. \"Is going to be interesting.\" He was flung from his musings by a sudden uneasiness. He couldn't explain it, but suddenly the hairs on the back of his neck bristled, and he was on his guard. So he was startled when he heard a voice ask \"Can I get by here?\" The Ferryman turned. Beside him there stood a man in perhaps his mid to late twenties. He was dressed casually, with a strong metal cross around his neck and an ichthus symbol ring on his right middle finger. The Ferryman nodded, and stepped forward to make room. He kept a cautious eye on the man, who stopped not too far away in biographies. Without warning, a teenage girl came bounding up eagerly. \"Pastor Mitch! Pastor Mitch!\" she cried. 'Man of God!' The Ferryman realised. Every inch of him wanted to run away. He had heard of the power wielded by these 'Sons of Grace' (as the Enemy called them) and really had no desire to come up against them. The Ferryman wanted to run, but he had to settle for a quick exit from the store. \"You aren't considering abandoning the mission, are you?\" said a familiar voice in his head. \"You bet I am,\" Jack Ferryman answered (in his head). \"Well unconsider it!\" Lucifer demanded. \"Sons of Grace are just as susceptible to temptation as everyone else!\" \"Yeah, but everyone else doesn't have the power of all-powerful Yahweh at their disposal,\" Jack retorted. Lucifer answered a roar so strong it gave Jack a terrible headache. The Head Waiter tried to pretend as though he hadn't seen the young fellow walking up to him with a determined expression on his face. \"Are you the head waiter?\" he asked. \"Yes, sir,\" the Head Waiter replied, acting oblivious to the lad's coming request. \"What can I do for you? I am afraid dinner doesn't start for another few hours.\" \"Jack Ferryman,\" the young fellow said in reply, sticking out his hand. The Head Waiter took it, and found that he had slipped two hundred dollar bills into his hand as he did so. The Head Waiter raised his eyebrows and dropped the charade. \"She must be some woman, sir,\" the Head Waiter Observed, reaching for his dinner seating arrangements. \"What's her name?\" \"Claire O'Wilde,\" Jack replied, hoping that the old man wouldn't recognise the name, as that could lead to awkward questions. Apparently he didn't, because the Head Waiter simply crossed a name off his list and scribbled in 'Jack Ferryman'. \"It is done, sir,\" the Head Waiter announced when finished. \"Thank you,\" Jack replied. \"I shall see you at dinner then, sir!\" The Head Waiter said as Jack turned to walk away. Epps frowned at her reflection, and tugged on the hem of her skirt. She hadn't worn a cocktail dress – or any dress, for that matter – since Murphy's fourtieth birthday, when she was eighteen. But she couldn't do much about it, as the dress code for dinner demanded it. She shrugged. That would do. She arrived at dinner, and a waiter showed her to her seat. \"Claire O'Wilde,\" said the man opposite her ironically, with an amused expression on his face. \"You don't scrub up too bad,\" he observed, with an approving nod. \"You do your best work in a suit, don't you Jack?\" she replied coldly. A hurt expression flittered across Jack's face. The other people at their table had no idea what was going on, but tactfully remained silent. \"So,\" Jack began in a lighter tone, addressing everyone at the table. \"Anyone else know what they want to order?\" A/N: Sorry, I wanted to ask you all something, but it could technically be considered a spoiler, so I thought I'd better put it down here. If anyone has any ideas for how Jack should get Epps to fall for him, please let me know. If I can get your idea to fit into where this fanfic is going, I will probably use it, and you will get credit for it. I promise.[Chapter 5] A/N: Hi guys, I'm back! This chapter gets a little full on, but I think it's pretty good. Reviews appreciated. A knock on her door. Epps sighed. There was only one person it could be. She opened her door. \"What do you want?\" she asked irritably, then stopped. The man on the other side wasn't Jack Ferryman. \"Oh, I'm sorry,\" she said, surprised. \"I thought you were someone else.\" \"That's ok,\" the man replied. \"I thought you'd be someone else too.\" Just then, a woman poked her head out of a nearby room. \"Pastor Mitch,\" she said, with an air of authority. \"They're in here.\" The man nodded, excused himself, and started to leave. \"Wait,\" Epps called after him. \"You're a priest?\" Mitch turned. \"Not quite. Different denominations.\" \"Do you do confessions?\" she asked, her mind racing with possibilities. Mitch smiled. \"Again, different denominations. I'm a Baptist, so we tend to just go straight to God.\" \"Curious about the Supernatural, Epps?\" said a voice from behind her. \"Because, you know, I could always –\" \"what are you doing here, Ferryman?\" Epps demanded, whirling round. Jack smiled, but not without a slightly nervous glance at the Pastor, who was now walking away. \"Like you said,\" he replied with a smirk. \"Business.\" \"Not when I'm around,\" Epps shot back. Jack rested his hand on her shoulder, and let it slip down her arm. She shrugged him away. \"Epps, all I'm asking for is a second chance,\" he said quietly. She glared at him. \"You stole my family, you stole the life a little girl, you tricked me into trusting you. You don't deserve a second chance, Ferryman,\" she spat at him. Epps didn't see it, but Jack flinched when she said his name. Everything she had said was true. But she hadn't seen him flinch at the way his name dropped from her lips with distain, hadn't seen the way his eyes tried not to dance whenever she was around. She certainly didn't know the number of times he didn't kill her on the Antonia Graza, the fact that he could choose to come bursting through the door she'd just closed, the door from which he now turned and walked away. She was certainly unaware that Lucifer's once most honoured servant was becoming more and more human, and all because of her. Jack lay on his bed and stared at the ceiling, considering himself and his past. Francesca. He'd needed her for his scheme to work. Although there'd been a lot of sex going on between them, there wasn't any real feelings, at least not on his side. He had grinned at the sight of her hanging from the ceiling by her throat. When he had been mortal, he had made a King's daughter fall in love with him with hopes of a kingship, and he would have married her too, except that someone caught on and he was sentenced to execution. (It was there that Lucifer had stepped in.) But Epps was something else. She wasn't an accomplice, she wasn't a pawn in his ambitions of greatness, he couldn't even manipulate her into wanting to be near him. And he did so much want her to be near him. \"What are you doing, Ferryman?\" Lucifer demanded, materialising before him and taking on Jack's form. Jack gritted his teeth. \"Planning, sir,\" he replied, reluctantly rolling up to a sitting position. \"Planning what?\" Lucifer challenged. \"How to make your enemy fall for you?\" Jack's mind raced, searching quickly for a coverup. \"Yes sir,\" he replied. The Lucifer version of Jack raised an eyebrow. \"She is not a Child of Light,\" he explained. \"She can be easily corrupted. It worked for Francesca.\" Lucifer nodded. \"Good plan,\" he agreed. \"Except you forgot the fact that Francesca never stopped your plans dead in their tracks!\" He roared, lunging for Jack and wrapping his hands around his neck. \"I'm going to relieve you of this burden,\" Lucifer whispered menacingly in Jack's ear, before disappearing into thin air. \"No,\" Jack croaked to the empty room. **** A knock on his door. \"Mitch,\" said the voice on the other side. \"Open up.\" Mitch sighed. He ought never to have come on this youth trip. He'd barely had one moment to himself the whole time. He opened the door, to find Maggie Russell – one of the leaders - on the other side. \"Sorry Pastor, I know it's late,\" she said apologetically. Mitch glanced at his watch. Twelve-thirty in the morning. \"Or early,\" he replied ruefully. \"Come in.\" \"What's the problem?\" he asked, sitting down and gesturing for Maggie to do the same. \"I'm not sure,\" she replied. \"I just feel like there's an evil presence surrounding this ship. Like, I dunno, an evil spirit, or something.\" Mitch sighed and leaned forward to rub his hands across his face. \"Maggie,\" he began carefully. \"You're not thinking straight. There's no such thing as evil spirits.\" **** Epps shot up in bed. Someone was pounding on her door. \"Epps, get up!\" She groaned. It was Jack. Angrily, she threw open the door. \"What is it, Jack?\" she demanded. He was wild eyed and in a dreadful hurry. \"Quick, you have to come with me, right now!\" he said, reaching for her arm to escort her out. She moved out of the way. \"What's going on, Jack?\" she asked, her eyes cold. \"I don't have much time, he's coming, and I think he wants to kill you,\" he said, grabbing her hand and pulling her along. \"Who?\" Epps asked irritably as they hurried along. She was still in her pyjamas, with a bathrobe thrown over the top. \"Management,\" Jack replied shortly. They reached the bow of the ship. \"Jack Ferryman, I demand you tell me just what the hell is going on here!\" Epps yelled at him. Jack's face was expressionless, as he pulled a gun from somewhere about his person, and began to check the magazine. A single bullet. \"Management isn't happy, Epps,\" he said, flicking the magazine back into place and walking a few paces away. **** \"Haven't you read the bible?\" Maggie asked, standing up in shock. \"Jesus spent a third of his recorded ministry casting out demons!\" Mitch held out a hand in an attempt to calm her down. \"Maggie, that was back then,\" he said quietly. \"This is now. That whole idea, it doesn't exist anymore.\" \"Would it hurt to pray about it?\" Maggie asked, sitting back down on the couch beside him. Mitch sighed again. \"No Maggie,\" he conceded. \"It wouldn't hurt.\" And so the two of them bowed their heads and began to pray. **** Every inch of Epps' body was on guard and alert. She didn't know exactly what Jack was up to, but from the way he'd pulled out that gun, she could give a pretty good guess. \"Why should I care if 'management' is happy or not?\" She asked warily. Jack turned to face her. \"Because if management isn't happy, then I'm not happy,\" he explained, a strange look in his eyes. \"And if I'm not happy, then it's very bad for you.\" \"Why me?\" she asked. \"Because you're the bitch that made management unhappy.\" Epps took a step back, towards the railing. \"You still haven't told me what is going on, Jack,\" she observed coldly. Her heart was pounding. She knew the answer before he answered. \"Execution,\" Jack replied ominously. He flicked the gun off safety, aimed at her chest, began to squeeze the trigger…when another figure came tearing down the side of the ship. \"Epps, get away from him!\" the man cried. She turned to see who spoke – and her mouth was open in shock. How was that possible? It was Jack Ferryman sprinting to save her from, well, Jack Ferryman. The second Jack crash-tackled the first, who, in the struggle, fired his only bullet. \"Stay away from her, Lucifer,\" the second Jack growled through gritted teeth. The first – Lucifer – grinned. \"Alright,\" he sneered. Jack began to choke, as though he was suffocating. \"But if you want your immortality back, Ferryman, then I'll need another boatload.\" Then he was gone. Jack's choking subsided. Epps exhaled heavily and slid down the railings. \"Who was that?\" she asked quietly. Jack looked at her, weaker than she'd ever seen him (though, granted, she hadn't seen him that often). \"That, my dear Epps, was Management.\"[Chapter 6] ChapternSix \"Management?\"nEpps asked warily, getting back up. Jack nodded and sat up,ncautiously. \"He goes by a handlful of names,\" he explained,nextending his arms slowly, then pulling back in pain and rubbing hisnelbow. Epps took a step backwards as Jack began listing them.n\"Lucifer, Beelzebub, Satan, the Devil.\" \"How gullible do younthink I am, Jack?\" she asked. \"I suppose next you'll be sayingnthat God exists too.\" Jack didn't reply, he just stared at hernwith a blank expression. \"No fucking way Jack,\" Epps exclaimed inndisbelief. \"Think, Epps,\" Jack said quietly. \"Is it really sonhard to believe?\" Epps looked uncomfortable. \"I don't know whatnthe hell is going on here, but I do know that it's fucked up,\"nshe said, her voice not exactly strong. With that, she turned andnhurried away. \"Epps!\" he called after her. \"Fuck off, Jack,\"nshe yelled back. She wasnangry because she was starting to believe him. She hurried awaynbecause she didn't want to think that it was possible. But it madentoo much sense. It explained too much. What happened on the Graza, and what had happened just now on the Lady Avalon. Anythingnto do with religion made her nervous. Her elementary school had beennone of the more…forceful Catholic schools, with itchy uncomfortablenuniforms and callous nuns. She rubbed her neck absently, reminded ofnthose scratchy collars she'd had to wear. Epps layndown and tried to sleep, but her mind just would not stop racing.nAfter an hour or so, she gave up on all hope of falling asleep,nwalked into her ensuite bathroom and turned on the shower. She rannthe water just a step down from scalding, hoping that the steam andnthe heat would clear her mind. It did help a little. After aboutnfifteen minutes, she got out, got dressed into a t-shirt and jeans,nand put the kettle on. After five cups of tea, she made a decision.nThe last two may have been laced with a dash of whiskey, but thendecision was still made, and that was what mattered. She wentnto find the Ferryman. *** There henstood in the open doorway, dressed in nothing but some satin boxernshorts. He smiled. \"Am I dreaming?\" he asked wryly. \"Don'tnbother Ferryman, I'm not in the mood,\" she said, pushing past himnand walking into his suite. \"Are you saying that there have beenntimes when you have been?\" Jack asked, closing the door. Epps gavenhim a death glare. Jack sobered up quickly. Suddenly uncomfortable atnbeing in such a state of undress, he picked up a bathrobe that hadnbeen lying across the back of a chair and pulled it on. Then henwaited for Epps to speak. \"So,nyou're telling me that your Management is the devil, yes?\" shendemanded, crossing her arms and pacing the room a little. \"I am,\"nJack replied, patiently. \"So that makes you…what?\" she asked.n\"A demon?\" \"Not quite,\" Jack answered. \"I was to benexecuted for a lifetime of sin, when he came and offered menimmortality in exchange for my service.\" Epps nodded. \"So you'rena servant?\" she asked. \"Something like that,\" Jack answered,nsitting down. \"And God exists as well?\" she asked, still walkingnto and fro, trying to get her head around everything. Jack bristled.n\"Yes,\" he replied through clenched teeth. \"That's whynManagement started this salvaging business.\" \"Right,\" Eppsnnodded, then stood still for the first time in the conversation, hernright hand on her hip, tapping her left index finger against hernlips, thinking. \"Are you going to try to get your immortalitynback?\" she asked presently. Jack didn't know how to answer. Hencould say no, and then, perhaps, he and Epps could have something ofna future. Would that be a lie? Management had betrayed him so manyntimes, he would almost be grateful for the freedom. But immortalitynis a hard thing to pass up. \"No,\"nhe replied. \"Epps moved towards the door. Before she stepped out ofnthe door, Jack sprang up, and caught her by the elbow. \"Come to thenball with me?\" he asked. She wouldnnever quite understand why she said yes.[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 Walkingnback to her room, Epps came across Pastor Mitch stepping out of his,nbible in hand. \"Pastor Mitch,\" she said in greeting. \"You'renup early,\" she observed. \"So are you,\" he replied with a smile.nEpps pulled out her key, and fumbled with the lock. \"I never reallynslept,\" she admitted. \"Early morning bible study?\" she asked,nnodding towards his bible. \"Something like that,\" he answered. \"Inknow it sound lame, but God woke me up a little early this morningnfor his own reasons. Plus,\" he added sheepishly. \"I didn'tnreally sleep either.\" She couldn't explain it, but her heartnstarted pounding. \"Actually, it's a good thing I ran into you,\"nshe began awkwardly. The Pastor gave a quick glance towards thenheavens, as if to say to his God \"you did this, didn't you?\"n\"Would you like to come in for some tea? Or coffee,\" she amended,nremembering that he, like herself, had not gotten much sleep. Tennminutes later they were both seated opposite each other in the twonarmchairs in Epps' suite, mugs of coffee in hand, engaging in smallntalk. \"So, what did you want to know?\" Pastor Mitch askednfinally, after a short, slightly awkward silence. \"I wanted to asknyou about the supernatural,\" Epps replied. Mitch's eyes wentnwide, and he choked on his last swig of coffee. \"Ok,\" he repliednonce he had recovered. \"Well, to be honest, I don't reallynbelieve there's too much of it about.\" \"Are you kidding?\" shenasked. \"It's all through the bible.\" \"You've read it?\"nMitch asked. \"Parts of it,\" she answered. \"I went to a verynCatholic elementary school.\" Mitchnthought for a short time before he replied. \"Well, Epps - it isnEpps, isn't it? – I don't think anything supernatural is aroundnanymore.\" Epps took a deep breath. \"I think you're wrong,nPastor,\" she replied. She'd decided she could trust this man withnwhat happened on the Antonia Graza, and so she told him whatnhad happened. She then proceeded to tell him about what had happenednon this voyage. When she was done, the young pastor stayed silent forna long time. Sometimes Epps noticed his lips moving slightly,ncorrectly assuming he was praying. \"Well,nEpps,\" he said at last. \"You seem to be a logical woman, you'vencertainly got your wits about you, so I'll trust that you arentelling the truth.\" \"How decent of you,\" she replied, notnwithout a touch of sarcasm. \"I don't quite believe it is all realnyet, but I'll trust you. The question is, what happens now? Jacknsaid he wasn't going to try to regain his immortality.\" Eppsnnodded. \"I want to believe him, but it wouldn't be the first timenhe's.\" \"I can't say I blame you for that,\" Mitch agreed,nabsently picking up his bible. \"Is there anything in there thatncould help?\" Epps asked, gesturing towards the great leather boundnvolume. \"I wouldn't be surprised,\" Mitch smiled. \"I'll donsome research in my spare time. If he tries anything, I want to benready.\" PastornMitch was absent minded all day. Many small objects were knocked offntables, and more than one fellow traveller was bumped into in thenhalls. That the supernatural elements of the bible were still alivenand well was something of a new concept for him. He'd been broughtnup to believe that all that had died out after biblical times. Now henfound himself reading much of the New Testament in rather a newnlight. \"Earthnto Mitch,\" Maggie called, snapping her fingers in front of hisnface, effectively pulling him from his thoughts. He was in one of thencoffee shops, a once steaming cup of coffee now rather lukewarm.n\"What's up?\" she asked, sitting down next to him with a sizablensquare of chocolate brownie. \"You've been drifting all day.\"nMitch sighed, had a mouthful of coffee, then regretted it. Coffee wasnnever at its best lukewarm. \"I'm starting to think you werenright,\" he admitted. \"Of course I was,\" Maggie agreednenthusiastically, examining her brownie. \"What are we talkingnabout?\" She finally decided which part of brownie she would bitenfirst, and did so. \"Last night, about the supernatural,\" thenyoung pastor answered, jogging her memory. \"Oh,nthat,\" she replied nonchalantly. \"These are really good brownies,nby the way.\" Mitch dropped his jaw in surprise. \"How can you benso casual about it?\" \"Well,\" Maggie said, gathering hernthoughts. \"It's an important part of our beliefs, but we have tonremember that it's not all of what we're about. Only part.\" nMitch nodded. They moved in to talking about lighter subjects; mostlynthe strange antic of some of the teenagers they were chaperoning andnthe rising price of petrol. The voicenechoed across the coffee shop, though nobody else stopped to look.n\"Man of God,\" it called. Both Maggie and Pastor Mitch look up tonsee the figure of a man standing in the doorway. \"Yes, I'mntalking to you,\" the man spoke again. \"Come with me,\" hencommanded. Mitch stood to obey, but Maggie pulled him back. \"Let gonof him, woman,\" the man said. She obeyed, suddenly finding greatninterest in the remains of her brownie. The man walked away, andnMitch followed. Theynwalked in silence, Mitch a few paces behind him. He followed the manninto a dance studio (there were ballroom dancing classes everynevening). The man stopped somewhere near the centre of the room.nMitch kept walking towards him. \"That's far enough,\" the manncommanded, taking a step back. Mitch obeyed. \"You're JacknFerryman aren't you?\" Mitch said, crossing his arms. Jack clappednhis hands sarcastically. \"Very clever, Man of God,\" he saidndryly. Mitch bowed ever so slightly. \"What do you want of me,nFerryman?\" \"Keepnaway from Maureen Epps,\" Jack ordered. \"Excuse me?\" Mitchnexclaimed at the audacity of such a command. \"You heard me, Man ofnGod,\" came the reply. \"Keep away from her.\" \"What authorityndo you have, that you can order me around?\" Mitch asked defiantly.n\"I don't want to have to hurt you, Man of God,\" Jack said.n\"Poppycock,\" Mitch snorted. But then Jack shifted a little andnthe Pastor realised that he spoke the truth. \"Taking on Men of Godntends to work out the worse for my comrades and me,\" Jacknexplained. \"But believe me, Man of God, if I have to, I will donit.\" With that,nJack turned and marched out a door on the opposite side of the room,nleaving the Pastor alone with his thoughts. ","Summary":" Author's Note: The first bit is just a bit of backstory, I don't plan for it to really do anything "},{"Movie":"Ghost Ship","Title":"Marked: Ghost Ship 2","Author":"flamingxroses","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3327507","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Three nights without sleep is not a good thing , I thought, struggling to keep my eyes open. The next math test was a bomb- I was having enough trouble staying awake much less actually pay attention. Comprehending what the teacher was blathering on about was next to impossible. I indulged myself a little and rested my head in my arms on my desk. It probably wasn't the best idea, but at the moment I couldn't care less. All I cared about was getting home and sleeping for the next week. I glanced at my plain plastic wristwatch. Officially two hours until spring break and I- Oh, shoot . The cruise. I had completely forgotten about it. I moaned, saying goodbye to my spring break and decided that I didn't care if I was caught sleeping in class or not. My dad was already punishing me by making me come to work with him on my spring break. Salvaging ships, no less. \"The Cruise\" he called it. Whatever. Just because he was the captain, didn't mean I had to like it. I hate boats. Not to mention the fact that I am terrified of water. \"Amelia, I'm glad you enjoy my class, but you must let others have their turn.\" My head snapped up and I looked around the room groggily, horrified to see it was empty. \"Oh, um, okay,\" I mumbled as I stuffed my books into my satchel and stood up. The teacher was glaring at me, like she always does as I walked out of the room. I sighed and tucked my overlong auburn hair behind my ear, trudging to my final class through the few kids still in hall. Jeez, how long had Mrs. Mandalay let me sleep in there? Long enough to make me late, I thought scathingly and stopped a few feet from my classroom door. Oh, what the heck. I was already counted absent- I was more than ten minutes late. I could go home and catch up on my packing. I sneaked out the nearest exit and walked across the parking lot to my house. Yes, I live next door to my school. It's pathetic, I know, but I get to get up at seven-thirty every morning while everyone else I know is already on their way to school. I shut the door behind me and walked down a narrow hall to my bedroom at the end of it. What greeted me was not a pleasant sight. Piles of clothing littered the floor around a suitcase (which was not possibly large enough to fit everything I needed into it) on my bed. Not that I need to bring a lot of clothes or anything. I mean, we were only spending a whole week on that piece of- Okay, Amelia, breathe , I reminded myself, shutting my eyes. I sighed, and opened my eyes again. Okay, only the essentials then. I grabbed my portable CD player and gigantic CD case and tossed them in on the few t-shirts I had already packed. My notebooks went in next- I couldn't possibly live without them- and then my mother's picture. I held it for a minute, looking at the brooding red-haired woman in the photo. The actual photograph was black and white, but I knew by memory. I could almost smell my mother's perfume, soft vanilla and peppermint. Wiping away a tear, I put it in my bag safely cushioned by some other shirts. I threw in a couple of pairs of underwear and the only pair of jeans I had besides the ones I was wearing. Tattered as they were, they would have to do. I zipped it up and dumped it off the side of my bed, then collapsed on it, falling into a light doze. It seemed like five minutes later that I was woken up to a timid, \"Hello?\" I moaned, opening my eyes to slits. The small Hispanic woman standing awkwardly in my doorway was smiling at me shyly and glowing. Just as I had suspected. Another ghost. The only thing that had kept me awake for three nights straight. I tried my best to smile at her as I grudgingly pulled myself into a sitting position. \"Can I help you?\" \"I was told to see someone about finding my daughter.\" I sighed, pulling out the phonebook next to my bed. \"Her name?\" \"Rosa Fernandez.\" I flipped through the book and found about three Rosa Fernandez's. \"Is she married, do you know?\" The woman shook her head. \"No. No husband.\" I nodded. Well, that narrowed it down. \"Look, I'll write down her address for you. That is what you want, isn't it?\" She wrung her hands in a distressed way. \"I'm supposed to give something to her.\" I sighed. Perfect. Just what I needed the night before my un-vacation. \"Do you have it, or do I have to go get it?\" \"It is under the tree in her yard.\" She smiled apologetically. \"In a box.\" I nodded. \"All right, I'll take care of it.\" She smiled widely and kissed my hand about a million times before she disappeared. I wiped it on my jeans, muttering, \"Sick- ghost slobber,\" as I pulled on my black hoodie and put on my leather gloves. If I was going all ghost buster at- I looked at the clock- nine-o-clock at night, I was going to dress warm. My tennies were cheap payless knock-offs, but they were all I had, so I pulled them on, ripping the page with Rosa's address out of it as I walked out the door. I guess I should explain a bit. I can see ghosts. It's not the best talent in the world, I will admit. I mean, if you want to marry a guy and his parents ask you what you're good at, you can't really say, \"Oh, sending the dead on to their eternal rest,\" can you? No way. I don't know where it came from, since my twin brother didn't get it, but I can tell you, I do not like it. At all. For one, they always come at the worst times. Like, right in the middle of class or while I'm supposed to be sleeping. And not all of them are as nice as Rosa's mom- not by a long shot. And there's the fact that Jeff never stops teasing me about it. You'd think your brother would have a little compassion on you, especially since he's the only person that knows. And then there's the occasional breaking and entering. Rosa's house was a normal suburbs house in the middle of a nice neighborhood. I stared at the open front yard. There was only one tree I could see, and it was by the side of the road. Great, like I wasn't conspicuous enough already. I walked over to it. No box. Of course. So when she'd said under the tree… I pulled out the small shovel I'd brought along with me, wondering what kind of punishments almost-eighteen-year-olds got for destruction of lawns. The box was only a few feet under the surface. I pulled it out and dusted the dirt off. It was a small carousel music box, with an inscription in the bottom that I couldn't read since it was in Spanish. I turned it over, wondering what was so important about this piece that it had held Rosa's mother back from the afterlife. People stay behind for the strangest things, I've found. I carried it to her front door after putting the lawn back the best I could, rang the doorbell, and left. Okay, I ran like a kid playing ding-dong-ditch. It was embarrassing. In fact, I don't even know why I'm telling you. I started the two-mile walk home. There was no way I was going to make it home before my dad did now. Ironically, just as I thought this, his truck pulled down the road I was standing on and he glared at me with hard brown eyes. I gave him an \"oops\" smile and he sighed, jerking his head toward the seat next to him. \"Get in.\" I went around to other side and settled into the familiar, cracked, diesel-smelling vinyl seats. My dad didn't say anything as he began driving down the street. He's like that- the strong, silent type, especially around me. It drives the ladies crazy. My dad's a good-looking older man. Too bad for them, he's still in love with my mom. I looked out the window, noticing that we were headed the opposite way of my house. \"Where are we going?\" \"I have a meeting and I'm late. I don't have time to take you home.\" I stifled a groan and rested my head against the window. You try to do something nice for someone. You might be wondering why my dad didn't ask me what I was doing wandering around two miles from home. I think he stopped asking after the fiftieth time. We didn't talk on the way to wherever we were going. I played with the radio, but there was nothing on, so I turned it off and hummed quietly to myself as I tried to figure out where we were going. There aren't a lot of places that are suitable for a meeting where I live. I vainly hoped it was Starbucks, but wasn't surprised when we pulled up in front of a ramshackle shed that was once used for storing huge boats, but was now a restaurant. I knew the place well. And I hated it. Suitable punishment, I decided, getting out of the car to follow my dad inside. It was crowded with seaman this time of night, all loud and sweaty and I think I was possibly the only girl in their besides the waitresses. It smelled like fish and men. Definitely suitable punishment, I thought, looking around. My father stopped at the bar and asked for the guy he was supposed to meet. The bartender pointed toward a table and my father nodded, heading toward where we were going. I followed, dreading an hour or two of drunken talk and man jokes. My feet were definitely dragging… until we got to the table, that is. Jack Ferriman was around twenty-five years old, with the most gorgeous blue eyes I had ever seen and wicked-looking eyebrows. His hair was dark brown, brushed forward over his forehead, and even in the plain navy windbreaker and green shirt he wore, he still seemed above the other boisterous men here. He gave my dad a smile as he walked up, but it disappeared when he saw me. \"Who's this?\" he asked in a very nice tenor voice. \"My daughter,\" my dad said by way of introduction and sat down. I hesitated, not wanting to intrude; I was obviously not welcome here. I had no choice, however, if the look on my father's fact had anything to do with it. I sat down across from Jack, the only open seat that wasn't beside him. And the night pretty much went downhill from there. Jack and my father were talking about the plans for the new ship that had just been built. The one my father was the new captain of. The one he was dragging me onto for a week. Apparently, it was a big deal, lots of space and a rec room and a restaraunt, etc... So what? The boat was still on the water. Water equals an uninterested me. So I sighed and played with the ice in my glass of sweet tea, not paying any attention, and being completely and totally bored . Until he took out the black and white photos and my stomach turned over. There was nothing extraordinary about them, really, they were just aerial views of a really big shadow on the ocean, but I knew that shadow. I'm not sure what my face looked like, but it must have been pretty bad, because Jack looked at me and said, \"Are you okay?\" \"Can I see those?\" I whispered, and grabbed the pictures without waiting for an answer. I stared at it hard, trying to make out any words or shapes that would tell me I was wrong, and I was hoping against hope that I was. But as I studied the photos, I couldn't deny it. This was the boat- the boat I was going to die on.[Chapter 2] \"I refuse to get outnof this car.\" My brother sighed,nbanging his head against the driver's side window. \"Ames, look,nits not big deal. The boat is full of rafts and like, life jacketsnand stuff.\" \"I don't care,\"nI told him petulantly and began to pout. Really mature, yeah, I know,nbut what was I supposed to do? Willingly walk to my death? And don'tneven begin to ask me how I knew I was going to die. It just goes withnthe ghost thing. Touch a person with a week to live, and I suddenlynknow how exactly they're going to die- touch a ghost and I know whynthey're already dead. Its one of the perks of this ghost-seeingnbusiness. That was a joke. \"You're not goingnto die on the boat!\" he said, stepping back from the window andnlooked like he was going to smash it and pull me out by the hood onnmy jacket. I glared at him. \"Holy crap, couldnyou be any louder? And yes, I am, I saw it!\" My voice wasnstarting to get annoyingly high and screechy. \"I'm going to die .nIn a bathtub!\" \"Then skip thenshower!\" he yelled. \"What's the deal,nguys?\" my dad asked stonily, walking over the car. Oh great. The end ofnrebellion was near. \"Ames won't comenout of the car,\" my brother said, his tone suggesting that I wasncompletely hopeless. I was beginning to agree with him. \"Amelia, get out ofnthe car.\" \"But dad-\" He turned and walkednaway without looking back. Well, that took care of that. If he camenback again, it would be with a crowbar. I flipped the lock up andnopened the door sulkily. As soon as it was open enough for him to fitnhis hand through, my twin grabbed me by the sleeve, yanked me out,nand slammed the door shut. \"Hey!\" I pullednback, fixing my skewed jacket. \"Don't touch me.\" \"Look,\" he sighednfor about the millionth time that day, \"I know you're under a lotnof stress. I mean, talking to the dead- I can imagine it's not anpicnic.\" I snorted in responsento this, but he just kept talking like he hadn't heard me. \"But you're notngoing to die while I'm here. I promise.\" He gave me hisncharacteristic crooked grin and playfully punched my arm. \"Now getnon that boat before I have to carry you up there myself.\" I moaned, staring atnthe huge piece of metal that was supposed to float me to an island innthe Caribbean. Yeah, right. That thing, float. I put one footnforward, and then pulled it back. \"I can't do this, Jeff.\" \"Ames-\" \"No, really,\" Inpleaded, \"I really don't think I can. I'll puke or something!\" He rolled his eyes.n\"Puke on my jacket and I'll kill you.\" My eyebrows pulledntogether. \"Your jacket? Why would I- hey! Put me down!\" Inpounded his back indignantly at being thrown over his shoulder. \"Whatnam I, rice? Put me down! Jeff, are you listening to me? Jeff? Whoa…\" I felt the second ournfeet left stable ground- well, his feet, technically. The rocking ofnthe plank-looking thingy was all it took. It's amazing how manyntimes you can throw up on a breakfast of a bagel and cream cheese. \"Oh, sick!\" mynbrother yelled, dropping my gracelessly on the deck. \"I told you,nnot on the coat!\" \"Like I had anchoice,\" I muttered, my hand against my stomach like I could holdnin whatever was left. \"Oh, great, it got in my hair. What am Insupposed to do now?\" \"Hit the shower,\"nhe said in disgust, holding his jacket away from him with twonfingers. \"Oh, please,\" he added, seeing the look on my face.n\"You've got to be kidding me. Use the sink or something!\" \"I am not washing puke out of my hair in a sink.\" I gave him a stubborn looknas I stood up slowly. People were already milling about the deck, butna large number of them were doing less milling and more staring. \"It's up to.\" Henslung his duffel bag over his shoulder and walked passed me, throwingnback, \"You either take a bath or spend the week covered in vomit.\" Well, since he put it that way… It was quite possiblynthe fastest shower I have ever taken, despite the fact thatnwe'd set out and I was perpetually nauseous. My room was on thenground floor, one of the smaller ones- no special treatment for thencaptain's kids- with only a small bed bolted to the floor and anbedside dressed with a lamp- also bolted down. But it had its ownnbathroom, and I was alone, so I couldn't complain. Except for thenfact that it was, you know, on the water . I hadn't seen thenrest of the ship yet. Actually, I was sure I wouldn't the entirenweek. The thing was huge , like Titanic huge (not a happynthought, considering what happened to that one) and had morenrooms than my entire school- which is a lot. One place I knew wouldn't be seeing was the kitchen- or dining room. As much as Inloved food, I hated throwing up even more. It's not like theynserved anything decent anyway; it was a bunch of caviar andndisgusting rich-people food like that. I'd rather have a can ofnSpaghetti-o's any day. By the time I gatherednmy courage to leave the room and go out on deck, it was well pastnmidnight and there were only a few out, mostly people who werenworking. The moon was huge and full, illuminating the freshly cleanednwooden planks of the deck, and the water- well, I guess it wasnpretty, all black and sparkly, if you like water. Which I don't, asnI'm sure I've mentioned before. I stayed as close to the wall asnpossible as I walked toward the stern of the ship where there was-nhallelujah!- absolutely no people. I pulled one of thendeck chairs away from the railing and fell into it. The rockingndidn't seem quite so bad here in the open air, away from everyonenelse. Wait- maybe notncompletely away. What was that light almost hidden by the wall? Wasnthat… a person? \"No,\" I moaned,npulling myself up onto the seat, vainly hoping whoever it wasnwouldn't see me. Come on! I was supposed to be on vacation!nGranted, the worst vacation ever, but… no! Ghosts were not on mynschedule! I stood up, ready tonretreat to the other side of the ship when a pleasantly familiarnvoice said, \"No, please, don't move because of me.\" I'd onlynheard those lovely tomes once before, but I'd recognize themnanywhere. \"Mr. Ferriman?\" Inasked dubiously, craning to see around the corner. \"Why are you-\"nI bit my tongue on the word glowing . Jeez, what kind of freaknwould he think I am? What kind of freak did he already think Inwas, since I'd run out of his and my dad's meeting at the sightnof a boat? \"Hmmm?\" he asked,ncoming out to stand with his back against the railing, his armsnfolded casually over his chest. The moonlight made his blue-greenneyes gleam like a feral animal. I cleared my throat,ntrying to quell my desperate desire to ask him how old he was andnwould he ever consider dating a two-days-away-from-being-eighteennyear old? \"Why are you out herenin the middle of the night? Everyone else is asleep.\" \"I could ask you thensame thing.\" His tone was still light, almost indifferent, andnsuddenly I had an uneasy feeling. \"I didn't see you all day.\" \"Oh, well,\" I madena helpless gesture with my hands. \"I was, around. In my room.\"nWhat the devil had made me say that? \"Not a morningnperson?\" he guessed with a grin. \"No, it's notnthat, it's…\" I stopped. What was wrong with me? I was suddenlynspilling my guts to a person I didn't know. Even if he wasnundeniably gorgeous, I didn't even tell my dad where I'dnbeen all day, much less my fear of water. \"Nothing. I uh, Inshould go see my dad.\" \"Oh, no.\" Henstraightened up and gave me an apologetic smile- for what, I wasn'tnsure. And he was still glowing. What was wrong with my ghost-meter?nIt was on the fritz or something, because he wasn't just glowing,nhis glow was red and I was pretty sure that since both mynfather and my brother had seen him, he was in the land of the living.n\"Stay for awhile. Everyone else has been asleep for hours. Comenhere.\" He nodded his head toward the railing. I stared at it. \"Um… I don'tnknow.\" I wrung my hands nervously and he raised an eyebrow. \"Come on, I won'tnlet you fall in.\" He held out his hand and his look was verynreassuring. Too reassuring. I'd taken two steps forward withoutneven realizing it. Unfortunately, two steps was far enough for him tongrab my hand and pull me forward. Mortifyingly, I screeched andngrabbed onto him. \"Oh gosh, oh gosh,noh gosh.\" I squeezed my eyes shut. \"Mr. Ferriman, really, I don'tnlike-\" \"It's Jack,\" hensaid softly. I blinked up at himnand said intelligently, \"Huh?\" \"Well, I feel kindanfunny having a girl old enough to date me calling me mister anything.nHow old did you say you were?\" \"Eighteen,\" Inlied, and then looked away. Not a good idea. I'd forgotten-nmiraculously- that I was standing right above the ocean, separatednonly by a flimsy rail. Stupidly, I'd had a glass of water earliernand it was suddenly threatening to come up. \"You okay?\" Jacknsounded concerned, but he sounded far away, and when he put his woolnpea coat around me, it felt really rough against my skin. \"Unh…\" I moaned.n\"I think I should-\" And then I threw upnall over his shoes. Unfortunately, thenground did not open up and swallow me whole. Probably because we werenon a freaking boat .[Chapter 3] I have to say, evennthough it was kind of rude of me to throw up on his shoes, he wasn'tnvery gracious about it. I mean, it wasn't like I meant tonthrow up on him or anything. \"God!\" he yelled,npractically throwing me away form him. He was holding his arms outnfrom himself as if he couldn't stand to be in his own skin as henlooked at me, fuming. \"Do you have any idea how expensiventhese were?\" \"Well, jeez,\" Inyelled back, standing up. \"You might want to check and see if thenreason the person you're inviting to stand next to you might notnwant to stand so close to the water because she gets seasick!\" \"Why are you evennhere if you get seasick?\" he demanded, still looking totallyngrossed out. Okay, I would too, but I would at least try to make itnno big deal so the other person didn't feel like total crap. I put my hands on mynhips. Hottie or not, this guy was infuriating . \"You'renright, I should spend the entire week in my four-by-two-foot room.nWhat the hell do you think I'm doing out here? Getting oxygen!\" \"Not out here,\" henhissed. \"On the boat!\" \"My father,\" Insniffed, \"just happens to be the captain.\" He started to saynsomething, and then stopped. A vicious grin spread across his face.n\"Oh, right. My apologies. If I had known who you were, I wouldnnever have made you come to the rail.\" I started to tell himnthat it was okay when he continued with, \"If a girl runs out of anbar at the site of a boat I can imagine what its like being on one.\" It was an innocentnenough statement, but you didn't see the look on his face when hensaid it. He was mocking me. \"You didn't make me stand next to you. I did it on my own.\" \"Yeah, well maybennext time you should-\" \"Oh no,\" I said,nturning away. \"There's not going to be a next time.\" As I walked back to mynroom, I could feel his stare on my back. It was hot andnuncomfortable, almost like- But, no, that wasn'tnpossible. Because he was alive, not a ghost. The person I foundnstanding in my room, however, definitely was. A ghost, I mean. Shencouldn't have been much older than I was, maybe twenty. Long blondnhair, braided down her back and a brown dress that looked like it hadnseen better days. Oh, and a large gash in her forehead. \"Not now,\" Inmoaned, unconsciously throwing off Jack's coat onto a chair. \"I'm sorry toninterrupt,\" she started quietly in a sweet soprano voice, lookingndown at her hands. I sighed and shook mynhead. \"No, its fine. Really. How can I help you?\" \"Oh, no,\" she saidnas she shook her head, her eyes wide. \"I came to warn you.\" \"Warn me?\" Thatnwas a new one. I'd never been warned of anything by a ghost before.n\"What about?\" She bit her bottom lipnand looked away. \"He knows. Well, he doesn't know, but he willnsoon.\" Ugh. Cryptic messages.n\"Who knows what?\" \"He knows thatnyou're different. That you're not like the others on the ship.\"nShe looked at me, a sense of urgency coming over her. \"Don't letnhim touch you. Don't let down your guard.\" She looked toward thenceiling suddenly and seemed to recoil. I looked also, and didn'tnsee anything at first. But after a minute, I saw it… the bloodyntendrils crawling across the ceiling, down the walls. \"Oh my god!\" Injumped into the middle of the room, hunching my shoulders and holdingnmy arms against my chest. \"What is that?\" \"Don't let himnknow you see,\" she whispered in a panic, starting to fade. \"No, hey! Who? Hey,nget back here! Oh, that is so not fair!\" Really, if I'm going tonhelp a wandering soul, it's not fair that they can fade awaynwhenever they want to. But wait, I hadn't helped her. She'd comento warn me . Don't let himntouch you. Don't let him know you see. Who? The same personnwho was going to drown me in my bathtub? Hold up. I turnedntoward the bathroom, the door slightly ajar. I didn't have anbathtub. I had a stand-up shower. I grabbed my head.nWhat was going on with my ghost senses? A knock on the doornmade me jump and I contemplated not opening it, until I heard mynbrother call, \"Ames? You in there?\" \"Jeff,\" I sighed,nopening the door. \"Hey, what's up?\" He walked inside, hisnhead almost hitting the ceiling. Despite the fact that we're twins,nhe's a good four inches taller than me. \"I haven't seen you allnday. I just wanted to make sure you didn't drown or anything.\" He was joking, but hisnsmile vanished as I looked toward the bathroom. \"Something wrong?\" \"Jeff,\" I startednhesitantly. \"I don't have a bathtub.\" He relaxed. \"Is thatnall? Well, it's a good thing. That means you won't drown.\" \"No,\" I shook mynhead. \"That's the point. It's not good. It means there'snsomething wrong with my ghost whatever-it-is. I saw myself drown in anbathtub, in this room . But there's no bathtub.\" \"So?\" He shrugged.n\"It was just a fluke. No big deal.\" \"I've never had anfluke before,\" I retorted, irritated by his total indifference.n\"And tonight when I was on the deck, Jack was glowing. Red!\" He started to look anlittle concerned. \"Are you sure it wasn't some trick of the waternor something?\" Instared at him. \"Okay,nokay.\" He put up his hands defensively. \"So what do think isngoing on?\" \"Indon't know.\" I bit my lip, thinking. \"I got a warning tonightnfrom a ghost about someone on board who wants to… do something.\" \"Donsomething?\" Jeff's eyebrows furrowed. \"Like what?\" \"Indon't know.\" I waved my hands in a helpless gesture. \"She saidnsomething about someone on board knowing about me and that Inshouldn't touch him. I don't know who,\" I snapped as he openednhis mouth and he shut it with a sheepish look. I collapsed on to thensmall bed and pulled my pillow over my face. My voice was muffled asnI whined, \"I want to go home.\" \"You'renright, I'll go tell dad to turn the ship around take all threenhundred people on board back to the dock so we can drop you off atnhome.\" \"You'rennot helping,\" I growled, though the affect was lost through thenpillow. He pulled it off of me and then hit me in the stomach withnit. \"Ouch,\"nI moaned. \"Don't do that. I just threw up all over the deck.\" Mynbrother laughed like only a boy would. \"Really?\" \"Well,ntechnically just on Jack's shoes. But the deck was there.\" Henfell off the bed he was laughing so hard. \"Oh my god, that'snhilarious! Tell me it was the Prada ones, please!\" \"Well,nhe was pretty pissed off about it. He um…\" I rubbed my side, justnnow realizing how much it hurt. \"He threw me down.\" Jeffnstopped laughing. \"Wait, he hurt you?\" \"Well,nnot really. I mean… well, he pushed me and I fell down.\" Hisnexpression got dark. \"Ames, listen to me, if he hurt you, I swearnI'll cut off the jerk's-\" \"Um,nreally, Jeff,\" I said nervously, trying not to imagine what part ofnJack's anatomy Jeff was talking about. \"It's okay. I'm fine.nJust… really tired.\" \"Okay,nbut if you need me,\" he made a fist and punched his other hand. Insmiled at him. Annoying, yes, but Jeff was the best brother anyonencould ask for. I leaned over and gave him a hug, and somethingnbox-shaped crinkled in his pocket. \"Sincenwhen did you start smoking?\" I demanded, snatching the box out ofnhis pocket. He looked puzzled for a second and then realized what Inwas talking about. \"Thosenaren't cigarettes; it's Dramamine- it's to help withnseasickness.\" \"Oh.\"nI turned the package over in my hands. \"So what do I do with it?\" Henstood up, walking towards the door. \"There are instructions on thenbox, Ames. I gotta go see dad up in the captain's cabin.\" \"Oooh,\"nI said nervously, getting onto my knees. \"Please don't tell himnwhat happened. Please!\" Henlooked at me like I was crazy. \"Right, and if I were, what exactlynwould I tell him? Don't worry about it.\" He tousled my hairngetting a much-deserved irritated look from me. \"Get some sleep.nPlease. You look like crap.\" \"Fine,nfine.\" I got underneath the covers and said, \"Goodnight, Jeff.nAnd, um… thanks.\" Hengrabbed his chest like he was having a heart attack. \"Doest my earsndeceive me? Was that gratitude?\" \"Don'tnget used to it. And shut the door, its cold!\" I slid down onto mynpillow as I heard him leave, not even bothering to change my clothesnor turn off the lamp. I was so tired, and as I drifted off tonsleep I thought I heard someone in my room. It sounded like Jack. Hensighed softly and there was an edge of malice in his voice as henwhispered, \"What am I gonna do with you?\" Butnit might have been part of the horrendous nightmares that started asnsoon as I fell asleep.[Chapter 4] Nightmares haven't ever really beenna problem of mine. I mean, lets face it, when you talk to deadnpeople, there's not a lot that'll scare you. But these werenterrifying- flashes of images that made no sense at first, just bloodnand death and eyes. Terrifyingly beautiful blue eyes with a feralngleam, hungry, endless… Eventually they coalesced into somensemblance of order, images running together to make scenes, all ofnthem nonsense, just people and lurking shadows, none of themnconcerning me at all. Except for one. I was wearing a black satin dress,nlong and sleevless, just a little low-cut… and covered in spots.nDark spots, that smelled metallic somehow, almost like… Oh my god, I thought,nhorrified. I'm covered in blood. It occurs to me just then that therenare dark shadows on the ground around me. I don't want to look, Indon't want to know , but the whole place is suddenlynilluminated, and I finally see where I am. Since this is a nightmare,nit's pretty obvious that I would be on boat. But even my scarrednpsyche could never have come up with the horribly mutilated figuresnlying around me. They were so mutilated, in fact, that I couldn'tntell who they were. Until the light shifted away, like a search beam,nand I saw a flash of auburn hair, and it was so much like mine, thatnI thought for a second that it was me and I was a spiritnhovering over my own body. But why was I wearing a tux? Realization hit me like a bag ofnbricks in the stomach and my breath left my body in a rush. \"Jeff?\" Ingasped, my stomach turning, and for once it had nothing to do withnthe water five decks beneath my feet. I dropped beside my twin'snbody, my hands shaking uselessly above it. He was dead. He had to be.nThere was so much blood… To my horror, thenthing groaned and turned over, smearing more blood on the deck. Greenneyes that mirrored my own turned to look at me, the only thingnremotely human in the chopped flesh of the face. A scream stuck in mynthroat as the swollen partial lips opened and my brother's voicencame through crystal clear. \"Happy Birthday,nAmes. Sacrifice is your gift.\" He reached for me with his leftnhand, the only part of him left whole, except for the burn mark onnhis palm, an anchor with an arrow at the top. The scream I'dnbeen choking down ripped from my throat and broke the night sky. The sunlightnstreaming through the tiny window of my room burned my eyes as Ingroggily opened them and turned over to look at the alarm clock.nEleven fourteen. \"Happy Birthday,\" I said softly to myself as Insat up. My mother's picture sat staring at me next to the alarmnclock. My eyes prickled with tears and I sniffed to keep them fromnrunning over. \"I'm eighteen, Mom,\" I told the inanimate woodennframe. \"Nice time to start having nightmares, huh?\" There was a knocknon the door, and I started, putting my hand to my head. My hair was andisaster. Oh what the heck. It was probably just Jeff, anyway. Instood up and lumbered to the door, swinging it open with, \"It'snabout ti- oh, um, Jack.\" Crap. \"Hi.\" \"Hi. You, um,nhave my coat, I think.\" He smiled apologetically. \"And this wasnoutside your door.\" He handed me a Happy Eighteenth Birthday! balloon through the door along with a white card. I took them andnthrew them into my room, trying to smooth down my hairninconspicuously. \"Thanks. Uh,nyeah, it's in here- on the chair. Just a sec.\" I closed the doornand went inside, tearing a brush through my hair before grabbing thencoat and opening the door again. I handed it to him. \"There you go.nBye.\" I started to close the door, but he stuck his foot in it. Indebated on trying to close the door anyway, but decided against it. \"Look,\" henstarted, his eyes wide and pleading and… pretty much adorable. \"I'mnsorry about what happened last night. I was a jerk, and you didn'tndeserve it. Forgive me?\" \"Sure,\" I saidnabsently, too busy staring at him to really register what he'dnsaid. Oh come on, if you'd seen the look on his face, you wouldn'tnhave been able to focus, either. Not to mention the khaki slacks andnblue sweater that fit oh-so-perfectly. He smiled. \"Great.nYou wanna go get breakfast? Well… lunch, I guess.\" He looked atnhis watch. \"I don't know…\"nI was thinking about his Prada shoes. \"The birthdayngirl,\" he said seriously, \"should not spend the day in her room.\" How do you arguenwith that logic? I agreed and told him to wait a second while I gotnready. It was my birthday, and if I had to spend it on a boat, Inmight as well spend it with the hottest guy on the boat. Girl logic.nIf you're a guy reading this, don't try to figure it out. I opened mynsuitcase to find a pretty purple tie-back dress on top with a HappynBirthday tag attached to it. I pulled it out, wondering how my dadnhad snuck it into my bag without my knowing. It had a sweetheartnneckline and a gauzy sash on the empire waistline that, when tied,ngave my waist a very deceivingly thin look. It had spaghetti strapsnand a low back, came about to mid-thigh… and I was thinking thatnmaybe my father hadn't gotten it for me as I looked in the mirror.nIt was, however, the one and only dress I owned, and gosh darn it, Inwas eighteen. I wanted to look eighteen. No matter how much I hatednwearing the thing. Thankfully I had a pair of white flip-flops thatnmatch everything, or I might have had to go barefoot. At the last second,nI remembered the box my brother had given me and grabbed it. I took a deepnbreath in front of the door before opening it, which I knew was whennthe panic would set in. At least, I assumed it was. I really didn'tnhave much experience with guys. But I think I mentioned that before. I opened the door.nOoh. Well at least I knew something , I thought, trying not tonhyperventilate as he smiled at me. \"You look great,\"nhe said appreciatively. I think I said thank you, but it came out asnincoherent garble, which he thought was just hilarious. He offered menhis arm and I took it, vowing to keep my mouth shut for the rest ofnthe day. Which wasn't that easy to do, I decided as we walked tonthe dining room, since Jack didn't seem like the talkative type. The dining room was huge , with seating for four hundred and giant crystalnchandeliers placed at tasteful intervals on the cloud-paintednceiling. The walls were a cream color, with a shiny brass railingnalong the entire length of it. One end of the room was taken up by andance floor, currently unoccupied. And it was bright with sunlightnand smelled of fresh air and for the first time in a really longntime, I felt… almost peaceful. Almost. Let's not forget that Jacknwas standing next to me, leading me to a quiet table for two next tona window. Oh, and he was still glowing a little red. I leaned my back,nlooking out the window. Really, if you didn't look too much at thenmotion of the water, and just focused on its sparkliness, it wasn'tnso bad. In fact, it was kind of pretty. \"So,\" Jack saidnafter an awkwardly long silence. \"What do you want to eat?\" \"French toast andnstrawberries,\" I answered automatically, since it was what I hadnevery birthday. I blushed, looking down at the menu. \"Oh, um… donthey serve that? I mean, since its lunchtime and everything.\" \"No problem,\"nhe said as he motioned a waiter over. He ordered my breakfast ornwhatever it was and a cup of cocoa, but that was it. I cocked my head atnhim. \"You're not hungry?\" The question,nthough I thought it was pretty simple, seemed to surprise him. \"No,\" he shooknhis head. \"I ate this morning.\" \"Oh.\" Anothernawkward silence. I fingered the box on the table next to me, staringnabsently out the window. \"What's that?\"nJack asked, nodding toward the box. I looked down at it. \"Oh, uh,nDramamine. My brother gave it to me last night. It's supposed tonhelp with sea sickness, but… I'm not sure what to do with it.\" He looked at thenbox, as if contemplating something- probably how someone could end upnso completely clueless- but after a minute, made up his mind andngrabbed the box. He opened it gallantly and pulled out a round whitenpatch, saying, \"Allow me.\" Allow you tonwhat? I started to ask, but he leaned across the table andnbrushed my hair back, placing the patch gently behind my ear. I wouldnhave been able to enjoy his close proximity- and wonderful breath andnbeautiful eyes and... nevermind- if I hadn't suddenly screamed andnjumped out of my seat.[Chapter 5] A/N: Sorry about thenlong wait guys. We're getting ready to move and I haven't had toonmuch time to write- much to my psychotic breakdown. I hope you likenit! I had a ton of fun writing it. Violence is always my favorite.n;-) \"What?\"nJack yelled, jumping back from me. \"What's wrong?\" I didn't saynanything. Well, what could I? Look out Jack, there's this reallynpissed off ghost standing behind you. Oh, and she has a knife ? It was true, though.nShe was very pretty, besides the psychotic look on her face, withnlong, straight black hair and blue eyes, and a model-perfect figurenthat she probably never in her life had to exercise or cutnback on junk food for- But I digress. Becausenit's not like I'm bitter or anything. The ghost seemed tonnotice that I wasn't exactly oblivious to her presence, because shenlooked behind herself as if I could be staring at someone else, likenI was terrified of a waiter or something. But if she thought she wasngoing to ruin my birthday date (whether it was really a date or not,nit was my birthday, and I was going to pretend it was), she hadnanother thing coming. Namely, my foot in her stomach. I walked passed Jack,nwho turned to look at me with eyebrows drawn together and a concernednlook on his face. \"Amelia, what is it?\" I didn't answer. Thenfact that she was holding a knife meant that she was fairly knew atnthis ghost thing- apparently she didn't know that she hadnpreternatural powers yet, a plus for me, but I could have taken hernout if she had. A tough hide and fast healing goes with the wholenghost-seer thing. \"I, uh,\" Instammered, suddenly realizing that I hadn't answered Jack'snquestion. \"I forgot something in my room. I'll be right back.\" I walked toward thenwoman, looking pointedly toward the deck outside the restaurant. Shendidn't seem to get it, so I hissed, \" Outside.\" She stared at me. \"Youncan see me?\" \"Yeah,\" Inwhispered, not in one of my best moods. \"And I'm kind of busy sonput down the knife-\" \"Or what?\" shensnarled, her black hair whipping around her face. My teeth were grittednnow- never a good sign. \"Or I'll make you wish you'd gone tonhell.\" \"Amelia, who are you talking to?\" Jack's confused voice came from behind me. Inturned and gave him a strained smile and nervous laugh. \"Myself, Indo that a lot.\" Henraised an eyebrow. \"You're telling yourself that you'll makenyourself wish you'd gone to hell?\" Notento self: be discreet when talking to invisible beings. \"Uh,nyeah,\" I laughed nervously. \"Dramamine wouldn't happen to havena psychotic side-effect, would it?\" \"No,\"nhe said, his expression going dark. \"It wouldn't.\" Whoa .nI really didn't like that look on his face. It was littlentoo axe-murderer for me. \"Well,\"nI said quickly, backing away from him and hitting a chair in thenprocess, \"I need to go get that thing from my room. I'll be rightnback.\" Hensmiled, the axe-murderer look not going away. \"How about I walk younthere?\" Hownabout you jump off the boat? I wanted to say, but didn't. \"Ohnno, its no big deal, I wouldn't want you to have to walk all thenway-\" \"Hello!nWhat about me? I have issues I need worked out here!\" Oh,ncrap, I'd completely forgotten about the knife-wielding skank. \"Justna minute,\" I gritted at her over my shoulder. \"No,\"nshe said, putting her hands on her hips. \" I'm the deadnperson! You're supposed to help me first, not take your boyfriendnback to your cabin, because God knows I'm not going to stand aroundnwatching that-\" Inturned around and punched her in the mouth. \"You know what?\" Inyelled. \"Not everything is about your stupid little problems, okay?nYou're dead . Get over it!\" Asnsoon as the words were out of my mouth, I regretted them. Not becausenthey were nasty- I meant every word- but because I'd just yellednat a ghost in public, and if there's one sure-fire way to getnthrown into Western State, that's it. Infelt a hand clamp onto my right forearm and turned my head to seenJack as he started pulling me out of the room. The expression on hisnface was definitely still axe-happy murderer- minus the happy. \"Whatnare you doing?\" I demanded, trying to pull away from him. \"Let gonof me!\" Hendidn't say anything, just kept dragging me with him toward I had nonclue where, since I had only just come out of my room. I tried tonpull away, but the grip on my arm? The word steel comes tonmind. \"I'llnscream,\" I threatened as he pulled me through a door and down anmetal staircase. \"I swear I will, and I'll tell them you tried tonrape me-\" \"Shutnup,\" he finally snapped. Okay.nThat did it. I took a deep breath, prepared to scream, when I feltnfire on my cheek, and my head snapped to the side. I put my hand upnto my burning face and gave Jack a dumbfounded look. \"You slappednme!\" \"Intold you,\" he growled, \"to shut up.\" Allnright. Screw the rule about not using my ghost buster moves onnmortals. I was going karate kid on his ass. Inbrought my left leg up and slammed my foot into the side of his arm.nThere was a sickening crack sound and he screamed, pullingnback his arm. Now that I was free, you'd think I'd run. But Inhave this thing about people hitting me. I don't like it. At all.nSo I gave myself a little hop and planted a high kick right in hisnnose. His head flew backwards and he slipped on the metal floornbeneath him, falling flat on his back. Okay, now I could run. I turned, my intention to book it, but henwrapped a hand around my ankle and pulled me right off my feet. Inlanded hard next to him, the breath leaving my lungs in a whoosh .nThe floor was textured, too, and it cut into my bare legs. \"Sonnof a-\" I panted, watching Jack stand up and shake himself off. Andnwas it just me, or did his arm not look broken? He definitelynshouldn't have been able to crack his knuckles like that with anbroken arm. \"Younknow,\" he said, picking me up by the front of my dress with inhumannstrength, \"I was going to just seal you, but you seem to be toonmuch trouble.\" \"Whatnare you talking about?\" I gasped, still short of breath. Hendropped me gracelessly on the floor and knelt down beside me. \"Itsnnothing personal,\" he assured me, grabbing my hand, \"it's justnthat I have a deadline, and it looks like you could get in the way.\" Inwas pulling frantically at my arm to get away, but I couldn't, andnwasn't that arm supposed to be broken? Inclosed my eyes, expecting him to twist it and break it, but to mynsurprise he just held my hand like he was introducing himself ornsomething. I opened my eyes, and found his hypnotic blue eyes staringnstraight back into mine. Until something behind his head caught mynattention. We must have been in a cargo hold or something, becausenthere were a lot of boxes and things strapped to the floor. You maynbe wondering why I would notice something like this when I wasnthinking I was going to be murdered. No big deal really. It was justna bathtub strapped to the floor right behind him. Thenbathtub I was supposed to die in. Thenscream wasn't intentional. I felt my lungs fill with airninvoluntarily, and my throat constrict. That'snwhen the burning sensation started. It began in my hand, like someonenhad lit a match and dropped it into my palm. But the feeling gotnhotter and spread down my arm and into my chest, through my wholenbody, until I felt like I was on fire. The feeling stopped abruptlynwith a tearing feeling- not like I was getting cut or stabbed ornsomething, like I thought would happen, but like my mind was beingntorn away from my body. Thenfeeling stopped, but I couldn't open my eyes. I felt like I wasnfloating, like I was weightless. This must be what dying feelsnlike , I thought, and opened one eye. They both opened, though,nand the scream I couldn't let go of earlier tore from my throat. I was floating. And the girl lying on the floor below me in thenpurple dress looked just like- Ohnmy god. I wasn't dying. Inwas dead .[Chapter 6] A/N: I'm sonsorry guys! This whole moving thing is a pain. The internet hates me.nUnfortunately, I am addicted to it. It's an unhealthy relationship.nAnyway, I'm posting two chapters tonight, just because you guys arenso great. Thenshock gave way to anger. Mind-numbing, teeth-breaking fury. \"You killed me,\" I grittednsoftly between my teeth. Jacknlooked as surprised as I did. \"No, I-\" Henstopped, staring at my body, and then seemed to pull himself togetherna bit, He cleared his throat, looking like he was in completencontrol. \"Well, I had to control you somehow. I can't let anspoiled brat ruin my plans.\" \"Controlnthis,\" I told him, and threw a psi ball at him. Inknow what you're thinking. I had just died. I should not have been able to do anything as powerful as throwna psi ball yet, especially since I was still connected to my body,nseeing as it was right below me. Trust me, I was surprised, too. Indid not, however, waste anytime contemplating my new situation as Inwatched Jack fly backwards into the metal wall. I concentratedninstead on getting my feet- or whatever you want to call them- to thenground, which is not as easy to do as it sounds. By the time Inactually reached the ground, Jack had fully recovered and was lookingnat me in total outrage. And,nby the way, the red glow had turned into a red blaze. \"Younthink,\" I growled, walking forward, \"that you can go aroundnkilling people just because you're some kind of super ghost? Whonthe hell do you think you are?\" Hisnvoice was deadly serious, his eyes blazing as he calmly told me, \"I'mnthe soul salvager.\" Injust stared at him. \"Am I supposed to be impressed or something? Inknow what a salvager is,\" I told him and continued at his surprisednlook as I continued walking forward, enunciating every word. \"You'rena lackey. A meaningless, useless, worthless minion that they sent down her to get rid of.\" Inwas toe-to-toe with him now and could see the flecks of green andngold in his perfectly blue eyes. Not that I was noticing at the timenor anything, since I was dead . Jack, lookingnnone too pleased (to make the understatement of the century) liftednhis hand and to hit me. Inclosed my eyes, bracing for the blow, but it never came. Opening onenof my eyes, I saw him, standing with his hand in mid-air, staring atnme. No, wait, not me. Something behind me. Hisngrin was malicious as he whispered right against my ear, \"Someone'snhere to see you.\" Inturned and saw what he'd been looking at. \"Jeff,\"nI choked, staring at my twin. He wasn't looking at me, he wasnlooking at my body and he had the most horrible expression on hisnface. Like he wanted to scream and puke and hit something all at thensame time. \"Ames?\"nhe whispered hoarsely, falling down to the deck. \"Ames, are you allnright?\" NonI'm not all right! Inwanted to scream at him. I'mndead! But psi ball ornnot, I couldn't communicate with the living. Not yet, at least.nGive me about five more years, and I could slam a door, but for rightnnow I was stuck. Ornso I thought. Jeffngently turned my body over, brushing my hair out of my face. Then henput two fingers against the side of my neck and, after a second, gavena sigh of relief. \"Not dead,\" he murmured. Notndead? What did he mean, notndead ? I had just beennfloating four feet above his head, for the love of- \"Whatndid you do to me, Jack?\" I demanded. To my horror, he looked asnconfused as I did. \"Indon't know,\" he told me calmly. \"If I'd known that younweren't already dead-\" \"Ofncourse I wasn't already dead!\" I shouted. \"I was walking aroundnon deck!\" \"Younwere talking to other ghosts!\" he shouted back. \"You never camenout of your room!\" \"I'mnafraid of water!\" I screamed at him. Insaw Jeff jump to his feet suddenly and look around the room warily.n\"Ames? Was that you?\" \"Jeff!\"nI yelled, completely forgetting about Jack for a minute. I ranntowards him, stopping a foot or so away. \"Yes, it's me! Can younhear me?\" \"Yes,nI can hear you.\" He turned in a circle, looking very confused.n\"Where are you?\" \"I'mnright here, in front of you.\" Henlooked at my body, then slowly leaned down, saying lowly. \"Innthere? You're stuck in there?\" \"No,\"nI growled in annoyance. \"I'm a ghost. Look, stop staring at mynbody like that, its creeping me out.\" \"Uh…nsorry.\" He looked around the room, putting his hands out in frontnof him, like he was feeling around for me. \"Where are you?\" \"Yournhand just went through my stomach.\" Jeffnmade a disgusted sound and waved his hands around. \"God, Ames, what happened ?\" Mynteeth gritted. \"Ask-\" Jeff'sneyebrows furrowed. \"Ask who? Ames?\" Inmoved my tongue around, but no sound came out. His name was on the tip of my tongue ,nbut I couldn't spit it out. \"Jeff,\" I whispered, horrified. \"Incan't say it. I can't say his name.\"[Chapter 7] A/N:nHere ya go, here's your second! I know I promised romance in thengenres, but its coming, I promise. Just a teaser here. ;-) P.s.- I HATE THISnINTERNET CONNECTION! No fear, however, the special Comcast people arencoming to check on it! \"Jack!\"nI screamed when I'd found a spot out of earshot from anyone.nApparently, I could say it all I wanted when no one could hear me. \"Jack!\" \"What?\"nhe barked, appearing two feet in front of me. Inwas so angry at him, I was seeing red, and it wasn't just becausenhe was glowing. \"I know I threw up on your shoes, but you didn'tnhave to kill me!\" Henstopped and stared at me, then gave me a look and said with a majornattitude I would have gotten slapped for, \"You think this isnabout shoes ?\" NownI was confused. \"Wait, so if this isn't about the shoes... whyndid you kill me?\" Henwalked toward me, looking totally sexy as gave me an appraising looknthrough his overlong bangs. \"You are not normal girl.\" Younhave no idea, Inthought and started when he smiled. \"Oh,nyes I do. Not just any girl walks onto my ship and gets contacted bynmy minions.\" Mynjaw dropped. \"What- how-?\" \"Itncomes with the soul salvager thing,\" he told menconversationally. \"Just like the aura-reading thing, but younwould know about that.\" Instared at him, sizing him up. \"So you knew, all this time? Aboutnmy abilities? Then why did you wait to kill me?\" \"Indidn't have to, until you started screaming at my ghosts in public,\"nhe sulked. \"You didn't leave me much of a choice. And now,nthanks to you-\" the snotty tone was back- \"my whole plannhas to be re-ordered. As soon as your half-wit brother tells yournfather what happened, they'll be looking for your body, and they'llnknow something's wrong. That's not part of the plan, because theyncan't know anything. Anything .nIf they get suspicious and turn back to port- well, let's just saynstrike three.\" \"Wait,nhold it, stop.\" I put my hand s up in front of me. \"What donyou mean, they'll be looking for my body? Its right in the cargonhold! Jeff knows where it is!\" Hengave me that smile that had turned my heart for a very differentnreason earlier. \"Are you sure about that?\" Thenexplosion of anger before had been a grenade. What I was feeling nownwas a nuclear war. \"Jack. What. Did. You. Do.\" \"It'snapparent that you're pretty powerful. I can't have you running aroundnmy ship doing whatever you want.\" I started to cut in, but hencontinued talking. \"You do what I say and I might return your soul to your body. You mess things up and I'll throw itnoverboard, and I hope you like the bottom of the ocean, because as itnstands, you're still attatched to your body. You'll be down therentill Kingdom Come.\" \"Emptynthreat,\" I told him quietly. \"I know right where my bodynis. As you said, I'm pretty attatched.\" Hencocked his head and grinned. \"Do you? Prove it.\" Inclosed my eyes and concentrated. There it was, just like it had beennbefore, but it was at the edge of my consciousness, like when younlose your train of thought and can't quite remember what you werentalking about before. I could feel it there, but where I had no clue. Inopened my eyes, leveling him with my iciest green stare. \"I hatenyou.\" Henraised an eyebrow. \"You think you hate me now? I've made you mynpersonal assistant.\" He leaned forward, putting his lips againstnmy ear as he whispered, \"Just wait.\" Andnthen he was gone.[Chapter 8] Let me tell you something about being dead: it sucks . I mean, it's not like you can watch TV- you can't grab the freaking remote. And even if you could, what's the point? You're dead . So after about the first six hours of worrying and being angry and screaming, I was well, just… bored. I was lying on my bed with my head hanging off the side when the door to my cabin slammed open. Jeff was standing in the doorway, looking crazy. \"Ames?\" he yelled, holding onto the doorway with enough force to rip off the molding. \"Are you in here?\" \"Yeah,\" I sighed. \"It took you long enough.\" He sighed in relief, collapsing on top of my bed. \"How are you doing?\" \"Well,\" I said, lifting my head to look at him. \"I was doing okay and then you sat on top of me and now I'm a little creeped out. Oh. And I'm dead.\" Jeff swore and jumped off the bed. \"Sorry. You could tell me where you are, you know, so I don't… whatever.\" He waved a hand around like it didn't matter. \"You're not dead. When I found you in the hold, you still had a pulse.\" \"Jeff.\" The look I gave him was pointless since he couldn't see me. \"I'm invisible. I'm translucent. And I can float. What about that says alive to you?\" He shrugged. \"I know, but you had a pulse and you were breathing.\" I turned over, facing the wall, like I would have done if he could have seen my face. \"What did you do to me?\" I murmured to a not-present (at least I hoped) Jack. Suddenly, even though I was on a boat, I had to get out of the cabin. Just go somewhere, anywhere else. And it's not like I was afraid of drowning anymore. I didn't have real lungs to get filled with water. \"I'm out,\" I told Jeff and walked through the door. I could hear him protesting, and walking around the room, knocking into furniture as he tried to figure out where I was. I left him there, heading toward the cargo hold. I really was a ghost, I mused sarcastically as I paused in front of the door. Haunting the place I'd been killed. Er… comatized. Whatever. I'm giving myself a headache. The point is, I was just minding my own business, trying to find my un-corpse when he came out of nowhere. No, not Jack (which, looking back, I would have preferred), but someone who thought he was just as important. I could tell by the way he suddenly appeared in front of the door, glaring down at me over the tops of his aviators. I looked him over in disbelief, taking note of his beat-up leather jacket, equally battered jeans, and white t-shirt. Seriously. Like he was a greaser from the fifties or something. \"Wait, let me guess,\" I snapped, and my hands flew to my hips despite my abhorrence of teenage behavior. \"This is your cargo hold. God, I swear, you ghosts are so territorial over the weirdest stuff-\" \"Whoa, cool it, honey,\" he drawled, like some bad line from a John Travolta movie, and then he thumbed his nose. No, I am not kidding. \"You wanna tell me what a dolly like you in is doin' down here?\" He grinned, and looped his thumbs through his jeans. \"Or maybe you're just ditchin' a fake out.\" \"I don't know what that means, but I'm pretty sure I'm not doing whatever you're thinking.\" I slid one foot back and raised a fist, like I'd seen boys do on those old TV shows. \"Now move before I… knock your lights out or whatever.\" Fonzy stopped grinning. \"If I hit girls- and I don't- I'd introduce you to the floor,\" he stuck is his finger in my face and glared at me. I smacked his hand away, \"Whatever. I need to get in there, and since you're such a gentleman and all, do you think you could get out of the way?\" He shook his head, fists on his hips. \"No one goes in there but the boss- no one dead anyhow.\" He narrowed his eyes at me, looking me up and down. \"Say, how'd you get this way, anyway?\" \"Ask your boss. And I'm not dead.\" I held out a hand and pressed against the wall, which made a slight groaning sound. \"See? I'm just… an astral projection or something.\" He snorted derisively. \"That don't prove nothin'. I could pull the whole wall off if I wanted to. \" \"But I'm not dead,\" I insisted. \"Look, the last time I saw my body, it was in there. With the bathtub.\" He looked unimpressed by this fact and for some reason it really ticked me off. \"By God, if you don't get out of my way in two seconds-!\" \"Woah, woah!\" His eyes widened as he took a step back and held up placating hands. \"Cool your jets- no need to blow anything up. Boss would be real happy with that,\" he muttered, and phased through the door. I blinked in surprise. If he thought a little yelling was impressive, he should have been around when Jeff and I got into fights. I reached out to walk through the door, like I was walking through the dark, and stopped. What the hell? The greaser's head and shoulders came through the door and he snapped, \"Hey, girlie. You comin'?\" \"My arm is glowing green.\" I looked from my hand, still held out in front of me, to him. \"Why is it doing that?\" He scratched the back of his head. \"Well, my best guess is that you got one nasty seal on you. But what the hell do I know? I'm dead.\" With that, he walked disappeared into the door, and I followed. God, this was awful- I was giving myself the creeps. He seemed to notice because he tried to comfort me with, \"You think that's bad, you shoulda seen yourself a second ago, all purple and sh-… stuff. The boss really put one over on you, didn't he?\" \"He's not my boss.\" The cargo looked the same, full of boxes and suitcases and that stupid grated metal floor. The dark didn't seem to bother me anymore, though, and I wasn't sure if that were a good thing or not. I could see from where I was standing to the other end without straining. It made me feel like a freaking vampire. \"Do you see me anywhere?\" He gave me a look. \"No,\" I said in exasperation, \"not me , I mean, my body. Look, I was just lying here, right next to the… hey.\" My brow furrowed. \"Where's the bathtub?\" It was gone along with my body, and I was supposed to die in it . Coincidence? I think not. \"Hey!\" I called, and when I got no answer, turned to see the greaser leaning against the wall, not paying any attention. \" Hey!\" \"I have a name, you know.\" He straightened to a slouch, which is a good as it got for him, and extended a hand. \"Friends call me Johnny.\" \"That's great,\" I said, ignoring his hand. \"But where's the bathtub that was here an hour ago?\" \"Lady,\" he said irritably, \"I may be dead, but I got better things to do than keep track a the cargo. Besides.\" He narrowed his eyes. \"You're marked. And the boss keeps pretty close tabs on his property.\" \"He's not my- oh, God. Forget it.\" I sighed, starting through the cargo hold. I only got a couple of feet before I was suddenly stepping on unmistakable black leather shoes and looked up to stare into blue-green eyes. I swore, jumping backwards. Jack grinned and looked at me through his dark blond eyelashes. \"I've got your first job.\" ","Summary":" Three nights without sleep is not a good thing , I thought, struggling to keep my eyes open.

Her father had already checkednin. 'Stick to the plan. He's not your dad right now. Completenstranger.' She stepped up to check in when an old man cut in frontnof her. \"Excuse me sir, but it's my turn toncheck in.\" He ignored her. Her eyes narrowed. \"Sir, I was next.\" Still no response.nShe decided to let it go. After all, he could be deaf. \"Next.\" Angela stepped forward. \"Angela Cummings.\" The young man rannher name through the computer. \"Ah yes. Ms. Cummings. Room 912. Yournkey card.\" She took the card and made her way below. Everythingnbrought back memories. The halls, the people, all were smiling. Shenhad been that way once, but now it's all an act. \"912…912…Ah 912. Now how does thisnwork?\" \"You mean you've never used a keyncard?\" Angela turned. There she saw a young man. Not young as innpre teens but young as in not much older than18. \"I'm Mark Willows. You do it likenthis.\" He took Angela's key card and inserted it into the slot. Anlight flashed green. \"There.\" He handed her the card. \"Thank you.\" She looked up at him. Anfake smile and toyish eyes greeted his own. \"I'm Angela Cummings. It was nice tonmeet you Mr. Willows.\" She turned and entered her room. As she shutnthe door she saw Mark enter the room across the hall. \"Great. It just gets better and better.\"nShe mumbled to herself as she looked around the room. There was ancloset to her right and a small bathroom to her left and a nice bignbed straight ahead. She saw a mahogany dresser and decided that shenmight as well unpack because the Castro would be her home for quite anwhile. She unpacked and then called room service. \"Yes, this is room service. How may Inhelp you?\" It was a woman's voice. \"This is Angela Cummings room 912. Couldnyou bring me some tea?\" \"Absolutely Ms. Cummings. Right away.\"nThe woman hung up. Angela sat on the bed and closed her eyes. Thennight 40 years ago played in her mind. She heard a knock on the door.n'That was fast.' Angela got up to answer it. Instead of roomnservice, it was Mark. \"Yes, Mr. Willows?\" A smile played hernlips. \"Please, call me Mark.\" \"Yes, Mark?\" \"Well I was wondering if you were ok, Inmean, I never saw anyone come with you and I was concerned.\" Hensmiled. \"I'm fine thank you. I'm meeting mynparents later on.\" \"Ms. Cummings, your tea. I hope I didn'tnmake you wait!\" A woman pushed the cart into Angela's room. \"Not at all. Thank you.\" She dug innher pocket and produced a five-dollar bill. \"Oh no Ms. Cummings, I couldn't acceptnthat! Just giving you your tea is reward enough!\" She bowed andnthen left the room. \"Uh.. What was that?\" Mark enterednAngela's room. \"I have no idea.\" She poured herselfnsome tea. \"Would you like some?\" She glanced atnhim. \"No, I don't care that much for tea.nHey, do you do rock climbing?\" \"Never tried it.\" She sipped her tea. \"Come climb with me.\" He took her arm.nShe jerked back, remembering the night she watched Katie die. Two menngrabbed her arms then told her she got the option of how she wantednto die. \"Are you ok? Did I do something wrong?\"nHe sat beside her. \"No, no, you didn't I just have anbruise, that's all.\" She smiled. \"I'm sorry. I didn't know.\" \"It's ok. I guess I'll try climbingnwith you.\"[Chapter 2] Chaptern2: Resolutions Mark led Angelanup onto the main deck. They had left the dock minutes before. \"It's overnhere.\" Mark said as he pointed to a wall covered in hand and footnholds. A girl came up to them. Her dark brown hair was in a loosenponytail. She had a black tank top and jean shorts on. A harness wasnstrapped around her waist. \"Hey Mark!nYou're so lucky you don't have this shift right now! It'sncrazy!\" \"Hi Jamie! Inam lucky, but you get to sleep!\" \"Wait, younwork here?\" Angela's heart froze. 'Too many similarities! Henworks here, jAmIE…..kAtIE.' \"Yeah. It'sna summer job.\" Mark blushed. \"Mark, whatntime do you work again?\" Jamie looked at her watch. \"About 6:00.nBut we have to be there by 5:30.\" \"It's 5:26.nYou better get going!\" Mark turned to face Angela. \"Sorry wenhave to cut this short! Maybe tomorrow.\" He waved and made his waynbelow deck. \"He's cute,nisn't he.\" Jamie stared after Mark. \"Oh, I hadn'tnnoticed.\" Angela looked down. \"In time younwill. Oh, sorry, I'm Jamie.\" \"I'mnAngela.\" They shook hands. \"Do you wantnto climb?\" \"Oh, no thanknyou. I'll just walk for a bit.\" Angela started to walk in thendirection Mark had gone. After a while she had the impression someonenwas following her. She turned a corner and waited for the person tonpass but no one did. She continued her walk. 'It's only a matternof time before things get ugly.' 40 years ago entered her mind oncenmore. She remembered how she took Katie's hand and led her to herndeath. 'I didn't mean to kill you! I thought you would have beennsafe hiding in your room! I'm sorry Katie.' She had made ancomplete circle around the ship. It was getting cooler and the sunnhad begun to set. Angela set off for her room. She began to walk downnthe hall, when she saw her father. Jack had his eye on a woman thatnresembled Francesca, to an extent. Angela continued past them andndecided she would visit the diner and get something to eat. Shenfollowed the sound of people laughing and talking. She entered thendimly lit room. Smoke had filled the diner. Angela paused. Taking anfew glances around the room, she decided to sit at a window-seatedntable. She sat down and scanned the menu. Minutes passed until a mannlimped over. He wore a black suit with a blood-red flower in thenbuttonhole over his heart. His hair had begun to gray and Angelancould just make out his original hair color to be a soft brown. \"Excuse me,nbut would it be alright if I sat with you?\" \"Be mynguest.\" Angela gave a small fake smile to the gentleman as he tookna seat opposite her. \"My name isnPhilip Harwood. And you must be Angela Cummings, or is it Ferriman?\"nAngela's heart stopped. \"Harwood? Isnthis some sort of sick joke? Because if it is you're going to getnit!!\" Angela whispered furiously across the table. \"No, it'snnot a joke. Ms. Cummings, I am sorry to have to be the one to tellnyou this but….\" He paused and checked to make sure no one wasnlistening. \"…you are the only one who can stop the disasternbefalling on these passengers.\" \"You think Indidn't know that? What if I don't want to stop it? What if that'snexactly what I want?\" Philip sighed. \"Then Katienwas wrong about you. You are your fathers daughter after all.\" Withnthat he vanished from the table.[Chapter 3] Chaptern3: An old friend made New Angela hurriednto her room. '909..910..911..912.' She fitted the card into thenlock and opened the door. Once inside she threw herself onto the bednand screamed into her pillow. She sat up. Tears started to form innher eyes. As she wiped them away, Angela took her hair out of thenbraid. Her long dark hair fell to the middle of her back. There was ansharp knock on her door. Angela recognized it but from where, shencould not recall. She sighed and walked over to the door. Angela halfnexpected it to be Mark asking why she left the diner in a hurry, ornher father coming to ask why she made such a scene. She didn'tnbother to check by looking through the peephole in her door. \"Yes?\"nAngela said as she opened the door. \"Excuse me,nbut do you know if the rock climbing is open still?\" It was a youngnwoman's voice. Angela looked at her. A glimmer of hope entered hernheart. \"Katie? Is itnreally you?\" Angela looked at the girl. She looked EXACTLY likenKatie. Her voice was the same but it had a lighter accent. Hernblonde-brown hair fell in front of her shoulders. She had a lightnblue shirt on and jeans similar to the ones Angela wore. \"No, um, mynname's Kathy. Kathy Belladichi.\" Kathy peeked into the room. \"Oh,nyou have tea. May I have some? I'm really thirsty.\" Angela camento her senses. \"Yeah. It'sncold though.\" She stepped aside to let Kathy in. \"Oh that'snfine.\" Angela poured her a cup. \"My name'snAngela Cummings.\" Kathy sat on the bed. Angela just stood therenlooking at Kathy. \"So, how oldnare you Ms. Belladichi?\" \"Um, I'mn12. How old are you Ms. Cummings?\" \"I'm 13.nOne year older. And please, call me Angela. 'Ms. Cummings' is toonformal for my taste. Uh, if you were wondering why I called younKatie, it was because my dad told me stories of a ship called thenAntonia Graza. I looked it up on the ..\" Angela tried to think whatnkids called it. \"Theninternet?\" Kathy suggested. \"Yes, thanknyou. I looked up on the internet and found names and photos of allnthe people on board. You look like a girl named Katie Harwood. Shenwas traveling solo to greet her parents in New York. Then…well…nonone knows.\" Angela congratulated herself. It was a perfectncover-up. 'There's so much there, Kathy wouldn't know anynbetter.' \"Yeah. I sawnthat site too. But, you're forgetting something, Ms. Cummings.nThere was another girl traveling with her mother, but they were innseparate rooms so you could say she was traveling solo too. A girlnnamed Angela Cummings. And that's weird because that's your namenand it looks a lot like your picture. I went looking for some tracenof Katie after I learned I had an aunt. Then when a man came with annold suitcase saying they found it in the ocean addressed to KatienHarwood I knew I had found the answers to all my questions. That wasnabout a week ago. But I printed out your photo and Alex's photonjust in case.\" Angela couldn't believe it. Kathy knew about her,nKatie and Katie's relationship with Alex. She knew about Angela'snfather and his wicked ways. \"I have herndiary in my room if you want to see it, Angela.\" \"I…I couldnbut I would feel guilty for prying into her private thoughts. Katie'sndiary is hers. I mean..\" Kathy took Angela's hand. \"Trust me,nshe wanted you to read it. Just when the time was right.\" Angelanlooked into Kathy's eyes. She felt as if Katie was the one staringnat her. \"I better bengoing.\" Kathy stood and headed for the door. \"Wait. Arenyou traveling with a relative? If not we should continue ournconversation.\" Kathy smiled. \"Yes. Mynfather and I are going to New Jersey to visit his parents. Goodnnight, Angela.\" Kathy left. Angela sank onto the bed then jumped upnand raced to the door. She ran after Kathy and spotted her rounding ancorner. \"Kathy,nwait!\" Angela sped after her. Kathy stopped and waited for Angela. \"Yes?\" \"You neverntold me what room you're staying in.\" Angela's breathing gotnheavier. Kathy smiled. \"Room 921.\"[Chapter 4] Chaptern4: Beckoning Past Angela heldnKatie's diary in her trembling hands. \"I foundnpassage 18 to be the most interesting. I marked it with yournphotograph.\" Kathy opened the diary and handed it and the picturento Angela. She looked at the photo. Angela was smiling in the photo.nA true smile. She recognized it from her grandmothers' house. Itnwas taken before she departed to return to America with her fathernand mother. Angela began to read the passage Kathy had indicated. ' Today wasnmost boring. Of course, that is like every day. Angela says someonenwill rescue us. We've been on this ship for 5 years now so itnshould be 1967, but I am not certain. Alex and I danced today. Not onnthe dance floor but near it. After what happened I won't go ontonit. After that I played with my word toy…' Angela recalled thenmemory. She remembered watching Katie and Alex dance. She rememberednhow she wanted so badly for them to be happy. '…. Angelansaid the most peculiar things…' Angela didn't have to read thenentry to know what Katie was referring to. Flash back Angela walkednup to Katie who was sitting where she had been 5 years earlier. Katienwas twisting the word toy. \"Hi, Katie.nSo, does Alex know you like him?\" Angela watched Katie's face asnshe looked up. \"How do younknow I like him?\" \"How can Innot know? It's written all over your face when you're near him!\" \"Is it thatnobvious?\" Katie set down her word toy. \"I admit I like him,nbut..\" \"But we'renon this ship. Katie, you could get off of this rust bucket and have anlife worth living.\" Angela started to tear. She got on both kneesnin front of Katie and took her hands. \"Please,nKatie, possess me! Get out of here!\" \"Why won'tnyou go? Why me?\" Katie searched Angela's eyes for something thatnwould qualify for a decent answer. \"I…I havenno reason to live after…after what happened to everyone except me.nIt was me who survived when I shouldn't have. You shouldn't havendied, Katie. Take my place in the world! It will be better offnwithout another one like him!! Do it Katie!!\" Tears streamed downnAngela's face. She rested her head on Katie's lap. Katie gentlynstroked Angela's hair. \"You arennothing like him! You are my reason to hope we'll be saved. Thentime will come when your courage will save more people than younknow.\" Angela looked into Katie's brown eyes. \"I.. I'm sonsorry Katie.\" Angela started sobbing. \"It's notnyour fault.\" Katie wiped the tears from Angela's cheeks. \"I'mndestined to be like him. I killed you Katie.\" \"No youndidn't! It was those men who killed me! You tried to save me!\" nAngela held Katie's wrists and put her hands together. \"Katie,nplease, never stop being my friend.\" Angela disappeared to hernroom. End flash back '…she rannoff before I got a chance to ask what she meant. Of course I'llnalways be her friend, no matter what.'[Chapter 5] Chaptern5: Tainted Soul Angela couldn'tnsleep. Nightmares of her past haunted her. She saw Greer's face asnhe fell into the darkness of the elevator shaft. Her father killingnall of those innocent people. The pool being filled with blood andnbodies. The horrified look on Katie's face as they were separated. Angela satnupright in her bed. Cold sweat covered her face. Her hair stuck tonher cheeks. She got up and stumbled into the bathroom. Citrus scentnlingered in the air. She flipped on a light. Angela took one of thenglasses and filled it in the sink. Quietly she slinked back to hernbed. Angela looked at the digital clock on her nightstand. The timenread 2:11. She sipped the cool water. \"Today isngoing to be a bad day.\" Angela whispered to herself as she set thenglass on her nightstand. She lied down again and tried to get atnleast some sleep before morning. Angela dreamt she was still on thenCastro but it was the night it would surrender to Jack. Angela sawnherself, Kathy, Jamie and Mark. Angela was in the dress she had onnwhen she was on the Graza. Angela, Jamie and Mark were shooting atnthe men who worked for her father. \"Just woundnthem! I'll kill them! Kathy, don't shoot anyone or kill anyone! Indon't want you turning out to be like me!\" Angela shouted overnthe screams. A shot rang out. Kathy yelped and clutched her leg. \"Kathy! Arenyou alright?!\" Angela ripped a part of her dress off and tied it onnKathy's leg. Angela sawndarkness. She heard Katie's voice. \"You arennothing like him! You are my reason to hope we'll be saved. Thentime will come when your courage will save more people than younknow.\" Angela steppednout of her room. The last dream she had felt so real. She had onnanother pair of jeans and a black T-shirt. Angela wore more blacknnowadays. It was an appealing color to her. Angela's hair was downnso when she bent her head, her hair created a wall around her face. \"Goodnmorning!\" Angela turned to see Mark. \"Goodnmorning, Mr. Willows.\" \"Would younlike to walk with me, Angela?\" A shiver went up Angela's spine.nThe way he said her name made her heart throb in agony. \"Well… Inwould love to.\" Angela smiled, a genuine smile. Mark smiled asnwell. \"Willows!!!!\"nA woman rounded the corner. She wore her black hair in a tight bun onntop of her head and a gray suit. \"Willows!!\"nShe barked. \"Yes Ms.nJulian?\" Her eyes flashed with fury. \"You didn'tnrestock the cigars last night!\" \"It wasn'tnmy job.\" Mark kept his composure. \"What did younsay?\" \"Nothing Ms.nJulian. I apologize. You can take the un-done labor out of mynpaycheck.\" \"Just becausenyour father owns this cruise liner, doesn't give you the right tonbe a smart mouth Mr. Willows! I want those cigars stocked now!!!!\" \"Yes Ms.nJulian.\" He turned to face Angela. \"Another time I suppose.\" \"Y-yes.\"nMark followed the tense woman down the hall and around the corner. \"Excuse me,nmiss?\" Angela peered over her shoulder. It was Jack with thatnsmutty woman again. \"Could younplease point us in the direction of the diner?\" Angela put on anfake smile. \"Of coursensir. You want to take a left and go to B deck. There you'll see ansign that say's 'diner' on it.\" \"Thanks kid.\"nJack and his whore stumbled off. Angela made her way back down thencorridor. She wanted to get to know Kathy more than just anconversation worth of information. She wanted to be in her ghostlikenstate, but reminded herself to appear as normal and alive asnpossible. She turned the corner and stared down the empty hallway.nShe couldn't help feeling like she needed to run, to get away fromnher father and his men. To run from him and never look back. 'If you run,nyou can't learn.' The voice was familiar, but different. Angelanspun around to see if anyone was there. No one. She was distant fromnthe world around her. \"Is therensomeone there?\" Angela called. It might have been a prank of somensort. Or Jack and his little mind games. The voice came again. 'Don't run.nStay and I will help you.' Angela ran from the hall and to Kathy'sndoor. She furiously knocked. \"Kathy, it'snme, Angela! Open up!\" There was no answer. Panic crept intonAngela's heart. \"Angela?\"nKathy was at the end of the hall. Her yellow dress had small whitenflowers on it. \"Angela, whatnis it?\" Kathy made her way to Angela. Angela frowned. \"Why are younwearing that?\" \"My dress? Inlike it. It's summery.\" \"But it'snnearer to winter now. Fall should set in soon. Maybe in a week or twonit'll be fall.\" Angela looked at the ground. As long as Kathy wasnwith her, she felt a need to cry. \"Angela,nwould you like to come in?\" Kathy took her card key and opened thendoor. \"Yeah, sure.\"nAngela stepped into the sun lit room. \"You can goninto your ghostlike form if you want to. I don't mind.\" Kathy satnon the bed. \"I reallyndon't like how you know so much about me, and I know almost nothingnabout you.\" She sat in the chair opposite Kathy. \"Kathy, younknow the person who…who killed everyone on the Graza, right? Katienwrote about him, didn't she?\" Kathy thought for a moment. \"Yes. I knownwho you're talking about. That wicked man! If I was there--\" \"You'd bendead. Kathy, there's something I need to tell you.\" Angelanhesitated. \"I haven't told anyone that's alive. Well, exceptnfor Epps and Lynn.\" \"Who?\" \"I'll tellnyou about them later. What I wanted to tell you was that he's…\"nAngela was interrupted by a knock at the door. Kathy stood and openednit. Immediately there was a SLAP. Kathy stumbled backwards, her handnclutching her red cheek. A man with tattered cloths on stepped intonthe room and looked at Angela. \"Who the hellnare you?!\" Angela saw the liquor bottle in his hand. Quickly, shenwent to Kathy's side. \"Kathy, arenyou alright?\" Kathy gave a small nod. \"I asked youna question missy!\" He grabbed Angela's throat and put her on thenbed. He pressed his left knee into her abdomen. \"Now who arenyou?!\" His eyes were red from lack of sleep. \"Dad! Stopnit!! Don't hurt her! Let her go!!\" Angela couldn't take it anynmore. The pain was too much to bear. She went into her ghostlikenstate and passed through the man who was Kathy's father. Somethingnwas wrong. Angela looked at herself. Instead of wearing the clothsnshe just had on, she was wearing the dress she wore on the Graza.[Chapter 6] This is thensecond to last chapter. All the action will take place here. I mightndo another \"Aftermath\" chapter to officially conclude the tale. MissnYumi Chaptern6: Death becomes her Kathynlooked at her. Angela went back to being human, but the dress wasnstill there. \"Kathy,ncome with me.\" Angela took Kathy's hand and led her out of thenroom. \"Whatnhappened to your cloths?\" Kathy asked in confusion as Angelandragged her towards her room. Angela didn't answer, for not evennshe knew. The lights flicked as the ship swayed to and fro. Katienwas watching them. Angela still had her determination andnstubbornness. Katie smiled and thought about how good she was. \"Well,nwell, well. Who do we have here?\" Katie turned to see a boy. \"Katie.\" \"That'sna nice name. I'm Adam.\" \"Nicento meet you Adam. If you'll excuse me.\" Katie turned back tonwhere Angela and her niece had gone down the hall. She too started innthat direction. 'Wakenup darling girl.' It was a different voice in Angela's head. Anwoman this time. Angela recognized the voice but from where shencouldn't recall. \"Angela,ntalk to me.\" Kathy grabbed Angela's wrist and spun her around. \"Talknto me.\" Kathy's eyes were filled with worry. Angela turned fromnher sad expression and unlocked her door. She ushered Kathy inside. \"I'mngonna change. When I'm done, we'll talk.\" Angela rummagednthrough her draws and picked out another black shirt along withnanother pair of jeans. Kathy sat on the bed and waited. Angela camenout of the bathroom and threw the dress on the floor. \"Wherendid you get that?\" \"Indon't know, but I don't want to find out.\" Jacknhad set up everything for that night. A party was planned afterndinner, in honor of the ships first voyage. 'And last.' Jack toldnhimself as he went to Angela's room. He lightly knocked. Footstepsncame to the door, then muttering. \"Whonis it?\" \"Jack.nOpen up.\" There was a hesitation. \"Inthink you have the wrong room.\" The voice sounded distressed.nNothing at all like Angela's. Jack studied the room number. 912. 'Inhave the right room.' He thought to himself as he heard morenmuttering, then a gasp, and hurried footsteps. The door swung open tonreveal Angela. \"Everythingnis in order. We'll strike tonight.\" Jack ruffled his hair as hensmiled at her. \"Tonight,ngot it!\" Angela went to shut the door when Jack stuck his foot intonthe door jam. \"You'renhiding something from me, Angela. I can smell the fear on you.\"nJack's eyes seemed to bore holes through Angela. Angela shook hernhead. \"Injust have a guest right now, that's all.\" Jack continued tonstare, then nodded and turned to leave. He turned back before Angelancould close the door. \"Makensure she's out of there soon. We need to prepare.\" He gave her anpenetrating gaze. Angela nodded and closed the door. She didn'tnwant to stand there and let Jack kill everyone all over again. Shencouldn't. Jacknhad told her to meet him in the cargo hold two hours before thenformal dinner and dance were to take place. He was waiting for her.nAlready dressed in his best attire, he was very charming, but asnAngela knew all too well, looks aren't everything. \"Angie,nI want to tell you the good news first. The good news is that withnevery soul on board, save you and I, we can fill out quota. The bossnsays that if you play your cards right, you could follow in mynfootsteps and become a salvager as well.\" He smiled at her. Angelanwanted to hurl. How could she stand here and smile back at him? 'Staynand I will help you.' That voice………….she recognized it now.nHow could she have forgotten? It was……the answer couldn't bengrasped, but Angela was certain she knew who it was. Right now, shenhad to find out Jacks plan and foil it to the best of her abilities.nIf she only got one person off, it would be enough to stop him, for anwhile, that is. \"Thatnwould be great! It could be a family business!\" Angelanran back to her room. She had next to no time before the carnagenbegan. She quickly slipped into her black dress and brushed her hairnand tied it back. She put on low heels. She would be running a greatndeal, after all. She had told Kathy to stay out of the way, and notngo anywhere where she would be easily detected. Angela hurriedly madenher way to the Ballroom. If she could get even one person off thenship alive, it would at least delay Jack. She had to prioritize.nWomen and children? Her new found friends? Kathy? There was no waynshe could save everyone ,nthat is, unless she could magically kill a man that couldn't benkilled. Angelansighed in frustration. 'You know what you have to do.' It wasnthat girls voice again, but only it was louder, as if the girlnherself were coming for her. A shiver went up Angela's spine. Shenremembered whose voice it was…..after all, she had the same one. Angelanrounded the corner, and spotted a flash of light blue dress. Angela'snheart stopped beating. Immediately, she knew who it was. She rannafter the girl. \"Katie!\"nAngela yelled as she, too, rounded the corner. But it wasn't Katie. \"Kathy,nI told you not to come out here! It's too—\" A great screamingncould be heard on the ship. Angela's blood ran cold. 'He startednahead of schedule.' Angela gripped Kathy's hand and dragged hernthrough the halls. \"Angela,nwhat's going on? Where are we going?\" They had begun to run. \"Inwon't make the same mistake twice! You're getting off in anlifeboat.\" They headed towards the main deck, but two armed mennstopped them. \"Oi!nYou there! Were do 'y think yer goin'?\" One of the men made anmove towards them, but a crowbar struck him in the back of the head.nA figure leaped out of one of the rooms and crushed the other mansnskull. It was Jamie. She was breathing heavily, her hands shaking. \"Younshouldn't have done that!\" Angela practically screamed. \"Donwhat? Save your ass?\" A rumbling sound stopped them. It was thensound of a crowd of over one hundred people towards them.nThey had begun to swarm into the halls like locusts, pushing thenthree girls back the way they had come. Jamie gave a grunt as someonenpushed her into an empty room. Angela grabbed Kathy. \"Whatevernyou do, don't you dare let go of me!\" Angela turned into hernghostlike state, and in doing so, turned Kathy as well. Angela easilynslipped through the wooden walls and to where Jamie was. \"Wenhave to go!\" Angela grabbed Jamie's hand with her free one. \"Angela,nyou're dress.\" Kathy indicated Angela's dress. It had not beennthe one she was just wearing, but the one she wore on the AntonianGraza. Innone fluid motion, the three of them passed through wall after wall,nand finally stopped. \"Whyndid we stop?\" Kathy asked as she watched people run by them. \"Donyou hear that?\" Angela moved to a door across the hall and pressednher ear to it. Inside she heard crying, and then shouting andnterrified screaming. Angela stepped back and kicked open the door.nInside was a man in white and a young woman. He had his pantsnunzipped and was restraining her on the bed. At Angela's intrusion,nhe looked up. \"Hellonpretty. Want to be next?\" He gave her a wicked smile. Angela didnnot hesitate. She simply strode forward and plucked the gun that wasntucked in the back of his trousers. She smiled sweetly and whispered, \"Gonto hell.\" She fired one shot, and it hit him right between theneyes. The young woman was screaming with fright and began to sob.nAngela looked at her. She was pretty, about Marks age, with a slimnfigure with her blonde hair in a pixie cut. Angela looked back at thenman. She quickly searched him for more weapons, but came up emptynhanded. The girl stood up, a look of disgust and hatred on her face. \"Younbastard!\" She began to kick the man over and over again. \"Angela!\"nKathy yelled as she saw more armed men coming at them. Withoutnthinking, Jamie grabbed Kathy and threw her into the room. Angelanpassed them and went out, gun blazing, into the hallway. Out of thenfive men that were there, Angela killed three, and severely woundednthe other two. \"Allnclear.\" Angela called as she disarmed the men. She handed a gun tonJamie, the Pixie girl and one to Kathy. \"Don'tnkill them, any of you. You got that? If you do, there will be consequences.\" They all nodded. \"wenhave to find Mark.\" Jamie said as they started out again. Angelannodded. \"Inknow. Jamie, where would he be, do you think?\" Jamie thought for anmoment. \"Henshould be in the kitchens or the dining hall.\" Angela's heartnfell. Theynmade it to the dining room without much hassle. The entire room wasnempty, except for a few bodies here and there. A movement caughtnAngela's attention. She readied her gun and motioned for the othersnto stop. Slowly, she crept forwards. Out of nowhere, a frying pannconnected with Angela's back. It didn't really hurt, but she gavena small scream from surprise. \"Mark!\"nJamie shouted as she ran to him. \"Alrightnyou guys. We need to get off this ship.\" Angela said as hugs werenexchanged. \"Sorrynfor hitting you Angela. I didn't really look to see who you were.\" Angelanhad given Mark her gun. After all, she could cope without one. Asnthey rounded a corner, they came face to face with a dozen or so men.nAngela sprang forward in her ghostlike state and snatched a gun fromnone of the men. She opened fire. \"Justnwound them! I'll kill them! Kathy, don't shoot anyone or killnanyone! I don't want you turning out to be like me!\" Angelanshouted over the screams. A shot rang out. Kathy yelped and clutchednher leg. \"Kathy!nAre you alright?!\" Angela ripped a part of her dress off and tiednit on Kathy's leg. 'Hey, wait a second. I've seen this before.'nA wave of déjà vu washed over Angela. In a fit of rage,nAngela picked up Kathy's gun and shot the rest of the men. Markncame to kneel next to Kathy. \"Cannyou walk?\" He asked. Kathy shook her head. She had been shot in thencalf, and wouldn't be able to walk properly until it was almostnhealed. Mark nodded and put one of Kathy's arms around his neck. Henscooped her up bridal style. Angela tucked Kathy's gun into thenribbon around her waist. \"Alright,nwe really need to kick it in gear and get to the main deck.\" Theynstarted off again, dodging the frantic passengers as they scrambledninto rooms, as if a lock would protect them. After much pushing andnshoving to be free, the small party finally made it out into thenopen. Another shot rang out and Mark crumpled to the ground in agony. \"Mark!nOh, my God!\" Jamie rushed to his side. A man in uniform reached fornher, but she shot him in the chest before he made contact. Mark hadnbeen shot in his abdomen. He grunted as he raised himself. Angelanhelped Kathy stand. \"Shenis now marked for sin.\" It was a voice Angela could never forget, anvoice that haunted her dreams. Angela turned to see Katie. Nothingnabout her had changed. \"Katie,nhow did you get here? I thought you had moved on.\" Angela wasnconfused. Innocents immediately moved on to the next life, so Katienshouldn't be here. \"Inmade a deal with a certain someone you know. She agreed to let menvisit you.\" \"Butnwhy are you here ?\" \"Inam here to convey a message. If you continue on your quest to savenand protect, your slate will be wiped clean, and you will be allowedninto Heaven when you die.\" Angela couldn't believe it. Her…. In….. heaven ? \"ButnKatie, I'm a monster. Surely there is some mistake!\" Katie simplynshook her head. \"Satannmakes no mistakes in the matters of family.\" And with that, Katienpassed on for the second time in less than a week. \"Whonwas that?\" Pixie girl asked as they found a lifeboat. \"SomeonenI knew a long time ago.\" \"Itnwas my aunt, wasn't it?\" Kathy asked with a small thrill. Angelanonly nodded. \"Everyonenin.\" Angela directed them and helped both Mark and Kathy into thenlittle boat. Angelanset about lowering the lifeboat. \"Angela,nno, come with us!\" Kathy pleaded as she began to cry. \"Yeah,nkid, let me lower the boat.\" Pixie girl offered. Angela shook her head. \"No,nyou have to get away from here. I'll follow once you're in thenwater.\" \"You'renlying.\" Jamie said as she cradled the injured Mark in her arms.nAngela gave a weak smile. \"Incan't leave here. I still have some unfinished business.\" Withnthat, Angela started to lower the boat, the ropes stinging her hands.nThey had begun to hurt like hell and……….Kathy screamed as shenwatched a bullet hit Angela in the back. The velocity was so strong,nit went right through her. A pool of crimson marred her pretty bluendress. A pool of crimson so close to her heart. The ropes slippednthrough Angela's hands as she staggered for a moment. After theninitial shock, Angela tightened get grip, the ropes making burns onnher hands. Slowly, she began to lover them again; her breath comingnout is short gasps. Another shot, and another stain of blood rightnthrough Angela's right lung. The rope slipped again, but not as farnas the first time. \"Angela!\"nKathy was sobbing. Angela couldn't think, and could hardly breathe.nIf she went into her ghostlike state, she would live, but that meansnshe would not be able to hold the rope, letting the boat drop and bendashed to pieces by the force of the impact. Angela made an executivendecision. Grittingnher teeth, Angela began to lower the boat once again. It was just anfoot above the water when Angela couldn't hold it any longer. Shenlet it drop. \"Angela,nAngela, Angela. I thought you were smarter than this.\" Angelanturned to face her father. Her vision began to swim as she drowned onnher own blood. She had minutes left, if even that long. \"Oh,ndaddy, don't be mad at Angie.\" Angela felt a hand on hernshoulder. Angela didn't have to look to see who it was. She knewnalready. Not only was it one of the voices in her head, but hernsister. That is to say her twin sister. \"Sophia,nwhat on earth are you doing here?\" Jack asked as he looked at hisnother daughter. \"Daddy,nyou of all people should remember I'm no longer Sophia, but Satan.nI'm your boss' boss. I have been for 43 years.\" Angela began tonsway. 'This is it.' She thought grimly. Jack came to stand nextnto Angela. He opened his mouth to say something, but a gunshot madenhis head whip to the side, blood oozing from the wound. Angela turnednslightly to see Pixie girl with an upraised gun. Men were shouting atnher and running to the side of the ship, readying their guns. Angelandidn't have much time. She pulled out the two stashed guns from thenribbon around her waist and started shooting the men. Angela'snvision started to blacken, and she only dropped the guns after thenlast man had fallen. She started to fall backwards, over the railing.nAngela reached for her sister. Their fingers grazed each other'snand then………….[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 Angela opened her eyes.nA blinding light forced her to shut them again. Slowly, Angela becamenaware of her surroundings. She could feel a hand on hers. Angelanopened her eyes again, only a little slower. She glanced beside her.nIt was Sophia who was holding her hand. Her twin smiled at her. \"Hey, baby sis. Younfinally woke up.\" At hearing this, Francesca hurried to herndaughters side. It was then Angela noticed she was in the Hospital,nand the blinding light had been the light reflecting off of the whitenwalls. \"Oh! My angel you'renawake. Jack! Jack! She's awake!\" He crossed the room to wherenAngela lay. \"Oh, thank God.\"nSophia cleared her throat. \"Oh, sorry dear.\" He looked back downnat Angela. \"What happened?\"nAngela was intensely curious, after all, she was just on the Castro battling for the lives of her friends. Francesca was the one tonanswer. \"Your sister got madnat you and hit you over the head with her Pitchfork. You've beennunconscious for almost two weeks. But you woke up just in time to gonon our trip.\" Her mother smiled lovingly at her daughter. \"Trip?\" Angela'snvision became fuzzy. 'You saw into the future, Angela.' It wasnSophia. 'You saw what he will do. You have to end this here andnnow. I cannot. Even as the Devil, I am bound to some laws. I cannotninterfere with these sorts of things. You can only end him withnsomething I have.' Sophia's eyes flicked to her Pitchfork, andnthen back to her sister. \"Yeah, well, mynPitchfork is pretty heavy sometimes. I'm actually surprised itndidn't kill you.\" Angela heard the meaning in her sisters voice.nAngela directed her gaze at Francesca. \"Mother, may I speaknalone to Papa? Please?\" Francesca searched Angela's eyes. Shenfinally nodded and motioned for Sophia to follow, which she did. Whennthey were gone, Angela had begun to rise, when Jack put his armnaround her waist. \"Let me help you,nhoney.\" She smiled at him. She knew what she must do. \"You don't have tonhold me, Papa, just hand me Sophia's Pitchfork, and I can lean onnthat.\" To Angela's surprise, he did not question her. He merelynhanded her the very thing she was going to use to kill him with. \"What did you want tontalk to me about?\" \"Oh, just……Yournjob.\" Angela's voice became cold and empty. \"My job?\" Jackndecided to play dumb. \"Yes, the AntonionGraza and the Lorelei . That job.\" Jack just looked atnher. \"How do you knownabout that?\" \"I know a great manynthings father .\" Angela spat out the last word. \"You know nothing!\"nAngela couldn't take it any longer. She stabbed at his chest, andncontacted. Jack let out a roar of pain. Angela kept stabbing him overnand over again repeating, \"That is for Katie!nThat is for Alex! That is for mother! That is for me! That is for thenpassengers on the Graza ! That is for the people on the Castro !\" when her rage was finally expended, angela saw thatnher father was in a bloody heap, dead. \" You are nothingnlike him! You are my reason to hope we'll be saved. The time willncome when your courage will save more people than you know.\"[Chapter 8] 40 years later Angela and Sophia madentheir way up the stone steps of Katie's house. \"How do I look?\"nAngela asked nervously. Her twin sighed. \"You look positivelynradiant.\" Angela gave her a scowl. \"You don't have tonbe so sincere about it.\" She turned and rang the buzzer. The patternof feet was heard on the opposite side of the door. Slowly it swungnopen to reveal Katie. She smiled at the two sisters. \"I'm glad younfinally got here!\" she ushered them into the parlor. They sat andnin walked a dashing man. \"Hello Angela,nSophia.\" He gave them a nod. \"Hello Alex.\" Thentwins answered in unison. \"Aunt Katie! UnclenAlex! I can't find my Walkman!\" In came a 12 year old girl withnshoulder length light brown hair. \"Ah! I don'tnbelieve you have been formally introduced. Angela, Sophia, this is mynniece, Kathy. Kathy, this is Angela Cummings and Sophia Ferriman.\"nKathy studied them for a moment before she spoke, and when she did,nshe addressed Angela. \"I feel like I metnyou in a dream.\" To which Angela replied, \"Don't worry, itnwas only a nightmare.\" THEnEND……….. ","Summary":" Ship of Demons: Ship ofnnightmares sequel Disclaimer: I own everyone except Jack, Epps andnKatie. A"},{"Movie":"Red","Title":"The Great Kidnap","Author":"Silver as the Rain","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11353400","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I'm back baby, and so is Natalia! Introducing (very proudly) the sequel to 'The Great Seduction'! I own nothing save for characters of my own creation and the plotline and this is for entertainment purposes only, no money is being made from this blah, blah blah-let's just get reading already! (If you can't tell, I am very excited about this) Love you all! Stuffing my hand into my bag, I brought out a handful of Skittles then began to let them slide into my mouth, grinning as my tongue lapped up the sweet taste then I began to chew, slowly so that I could savour the taste before consuming some more. Humming along to the song on my I-pod, I shuffled my feet with the rhythm, lifting my hands to dance along despite the fact I was in the middle of the street. Who cares? If you got the beat, you gotta move your feet. Tipping back my head I threw another couple of Skittles into my mouth then frowned, looking through my songs to find another one with an upbeat tempo. Eyes so focused on my screen that I didn't look where I was going. The traffic was racing through at the rare occurrence of a green light and although the rushing sound of the cars were all around me, the music drowned most of it out so unwittingly, I stepped out onto the road. When a horn blared at me, screaming in fury I looked up and yelped but a hand grabbed my arm and tugged me back, forcing back onto the sidewalk as the driver shouted. \"Watch where you're going!\" \"Slow the hell down!\" I bellowed back then turned to thank the person who had probably saved my life. Lifting my eyes I did not even catch a glimpse of the guy before lips were pressed firmly against mine and there was a hand on my back, pulling me closer still. A few people wolf whistled and I squeaked, eyes shut upon instinct and refusing to open from shock before they shot open and I saw a very familiar face. \"Han!\" I gasped as he pulled back from me then smirked. \"Still an attracter of trouble I see.\" He murmured to me in that god damn sexy voice and I shivered at the sound, not pulling away from him. \"Huh?\" I blinked, too caught up in his scent, eyes and that cocky smirk he had plastered on his mouth. \"Oh, right.\" I blushed sheepishly. \"Probably why you came running so fast.\" I answered then flung my arms around him. \"You're here!\" \"Yes, I am.\" He answered bluntly. \"Now do you need me to make sure you get home unscathed?\" I tilted my head back, smirking at him. \"I'm a big girl, I can walk myself home.\" He cocked an eyebrow at me disbelievingly as I drew back then poured some more of my sweets into my mouth. Suddenly the bag was gone and I blinked as Han frowned at the contents, poking his finger inside before drawing out the red ones, my favourites. \"Hey! No fair, that is crossing a very dangerous line.\" I warned him, springing forwards but he had already thrown them all into his mouth, snatching them from me. \"You jerk!\" I pouted, thumping my fist at his chest then lunged for the bag but he lifted it up out of my reach. \"You are so dead.\" I growled at him as he retained his overly confident look on his face. \"Is that all you got Natalia Sophie Francesca?\" Damn him, damn him to hell. He can't calm my temper by just speaking my name like that! There has to be some sort of law against it, if not then I'll damn well make one! \"Jackass.\" I pouted, crossing my arms across my chest as he finished the packet off then slipped the packet into the bin. \"I paid good money for that bag. It's my end of week treat!\" He grinned so I turned and began to walk away, crossing over the street then made to leave him behind but Han seemed to have other ideas. His strong arms curled around me and I instantly inhaled sharply, untamed attraction spilling from me as I instinctively leaned back into him as his face carefully leaned into the side of my head, burying into my hair which hung loose over my shoulders to cover my ears against the wintery cold. When I heard the crinkle of paper, I looked down to see him offering me a large brown paper bag. Inside were two hot muffins. One plain, one chocolate. I love this guy. \"You are forgiven.\" I decided simply, burying my hand inside then drew out the chocolate muffin, taking a large bite then turned to Han. \"How long?\" \"Not long. A few days.\" He answered with a soft sigh, pulling me to him away from the centre of the street so that no one would knock into us. His arms wound around my waist and he gazed down at me, letting go with one hand to brush back my hair as I ignored my muffin to pay him attention. \"I missed you.\" I murmured to him and he nodded his head, hand resting to the side of my face whilst his thumb brushed away some stray crumbs with a tiny smile of amusement. \"I know. I'm sorry.\" Shaking my head I leaned forwards and hugged him, resting my head against his toned chest as he sighed deeply. We stayed like that for a time, drawing comfort one another but then I sensed Han tensing his right shoulder, twitching slightly so I pulled back and frowned at him. \"What's wrong?\" He gave me a meaningful look and my eyes widened slightly before I lowered my voice. \"You're hurt? Damn fool. Come on, I'll patch you up.\" I tugged on his arm and marched him back to my apartment, this time taking extra caution as we crossed the roads and Han kept his face hidden from the cameras and I did the same, sneaking into the building. \"What happened?\" \"Just a contract.\" He answered simply, not going into any further detail. Sometimes I hated the way he kept me very carefully separate from his other life, never combing the two so I never knew exactly what was happening and what he was doing, which made me worry however I understood that for him, I was his kind of sanctuary, his solitude where he could put that part of him aside. I had to compromise and for Han, I was willing to do it. It was no worse than if I were a soldier's wife, I suppose, she would feel the same worries I did, however circumstances were often entirely different. I unlocked my door then kicked it open, striding inside and flung off my coat, scarf and hat to get out my first aid kit, glancing over to Han who took off his coat, jacket and then his shirt as he sat down painfully in a seat. \"Han?\" I murmured softly to him as I approached him. I'll admit, my eyes did flicker rather intriguingly over his torso as he opened his eyes and looked at me. He sat forwards and I looked at his back. My eyes widened with horror. \"Han, that's…\" He had been hurt bad. Really bad. There was blood pooling from the patch he had covered the wound with but it was completely red and there were dried rusty trails trailing down his back. \"You have to go to hospital.\" He shook his head. \"Han.\" I growled in warning but he shot me a look. \"Han I'm serious, this looks bad.\" I said as I peeled it back, wincing as I saw the deep stab wound. \"Please…\" \"Just clean it for me.\" He answered in a dark tone and I sighed, closing my eyes. Saying nothing more I took a cloth that I had dampened and began to wash away the blood, the cracked stains on his back slowly rubbing away and I made several trips back to the sink to clean out the cloth, the warm water soon completely red. I used cotton balls to swab around the wound, disinfected it then put in a few stitches to keep it together. Good thing I was trained for this kind of thing. When I had pressed the disinfectant to Han's wound he had hissed slightly but then clenched his jaw tightly to hold back any further sound. Once a fresh patch had been placed over his wound and I had taped it down, I set about clearing up as Han went over to the bedroom, opened a drawer of his things then pulled on a fresh shirt. Tossing the kit away I drained the water then scrubbed the sink clean, scrubbing fiercely through narrowed eyes. Slowly his arms slipped around me from behind and instantly I relaxed, exhaling to relieve the tension from my body as Han kissed my shoulder gently. \"Thank you.\" He murmured to me softly and I closed my eyes, unable to look at him. With his arms still about me I dried my hands, looking out to the snow filled city, pale clouds still hanging low overhead with the threat of a snowstorm looming not too far away. Han's hand brushed against the inward curve of my waist, his head still resting on my shoulder as he relaxed against me and I against him, though I still kept my eyes facing forwards. \"Han.\" I said and he lifted his head, looking at me as I carefully in his arms, finally turning my green eyes to face his dark orbs. \"Please don't keep soldiering on.\" I murmured to him, lifting a hand to brush my fingers against his face which remained firm and expressionless. \"Just…take care of yourself. Please, for my sake as much as yours.\" Without a word he smoothly reached down and touched his lips to mine, making me exhale softly into him before turning my face upwards to reach him better. His hand slid around to the back of my neck then tangled his fingers into my hair, his breath hitching slightly as I fisted my hand into his shirt, pulling him closer to me whilst my tongue suggestively touched the borders of his mouth. He drove me insane with want, even after two years of seeing each other. It was hard sometimes, there were cases when I would go months without seeing him before he would turn up again but then other times he would be back every couple of days and once, he even stayed for a full three weeks without leaving. It was a crazy patchwork quilt, misshapen and unpredictable with what was going to come next but all the same, I could hardly complain. I loved Han and although neither of us had really admitted it yet, I knew that we were reaching that stage where it would be okay to say the words out loud. Suddenly Han pulled back and his head turned to look at a canvas in the corner of my studio, covered by a large sheet and he tilted his head to the side with curiosity. \"Want to see?\" I whispered and he nodded his head. Another thing about Han, he genuinely liked my art. Loved it even. He once spent an hour going through just one scrapbook and I couldn't pull him away with it. He said he liked the way I caught life in every single creation, with the light and colours. He followed me over as I reached out and carefully pulled the sheet away, revealing the canvas's proud display as Han stood back and gazed at it. It was a blossom tree, petals caught on an imaginary wind, pale pink with an azure blue sky caught like shards among the branches. I said nothing, rolling the sheet up in my arms then tossed it aside as Han's eyes wandered freely over the painting, which was admittedly one of my less adventurous creations but pretty all the same. \"It's going for auction.\" I said to him quietly, standing at his side as his arm curled around me. \"In two days at the gallery on Nineteenth Street.\" Turning my face I could not hold back my smile as I placed my hand on his shoulder then leaned against it, content with simply studying his face as he gazed at my newest artwork. For a while he said nothing before finally, he looked down at me. \"You are too talented.\" He spoke quietly and I instantly warmed at his words. \"Now, what do you want to do?\" \"Honestly? Just stay here.\" I admitted and he turned his body to face me, leaning down to press his cheek to mine. \"Maybe order takeout and I'm pretty sure I have a good stock of cookies in the cupboard.\" Han chuckled, shaking his head. \"Your sugar craving is going to make you fat one day.\" I pouted then punched him in the gut, making him grunt and double over as I smartly stepped back from him. \"You can take that back or you're sleeping on the sofa.\" I announced but when his eyes slowly rose to meet mine, fire burning in their depths, I realised that I was now in some deep trouble. \"Holy crap!\" I yelped then darted away. \"I come in peace! E.T phone home!\" Leaping over the sofa I tried to run to my bedroom where I could barricade myself inside until Han gave up the chase. No such luck. He barrelled me over as I leaped, the both of us crashing into the sofa then tumbled from the cushions as Han tried to grab my wrists and pin me down but I twisted, wriggling out from beneath him then flipped him over, careful of his wound then scrambled to my feet. \"This is not mature behaviour!\" I yelled over my shoulder, using the table to separate us as Han lowered his stance, moving to mirror me whenever I made to move off somewhere. \"And completely irrational!\" He smirked then suddenly darted forwards, sliding over the table and grabbed me before I could escape. \"No! Don't do it!\" I pleaded him as he lifted me up into his arms, writhing like a snake. \"Han! I swear you'll be sleeping on the STREET unless you put me down right NOW!\" He laughed. Then when he had me pinned down on the sofa, he began to tickle me. I squealed and yelled, squirming beneath him as he found all my sensitive spots until finally I was burning with laughter, giggling like a schoolgirl until finally he stopped, firmly holding my hands down as he gazed into my eyes. His were soft, warm although there was a slight tension in them, watching me carefully as my smile began to fade. \"Han?\" I murmured his name and he sighed, going lax against me so I shifted beneath him, turning onto my side to face him as we curled into one another, his fore finger stroking the side of my face as I closed my eyes and simply absorbed his presence, the gentle caress soothing me until I was drifting in and out of sleep, lulled by the sensation of his closeness until I felt him shift, pulling away from me. I moaned softly, blinking myself awake as Han walked over to the cupboards and began to make himself something to eat. \"Hungry?\" He asked me in his mellow voice but I shook my head, yawning with a stretch. I hadn't realised how tired I was until now. Perhaps an early night's sleep was exactly what I needed. Shower first. Slipping away into my bedroom I grabbed a set of slacks and a tank top to wear for pyjamas as well as my towel then stepped into a hot shower, twisting my hair up to keep it from getting wet then listened as Han cooked something. My music blaring from my I-pod, I began to sing along, not caring that my voice could shatter glass. I could feel Han smirking from the kitchen. Once I was all squeaky clean I jumped out, dancing along as I continued to sing mockingly, pulling on my pyjamas then pulled on a hoodie over the top, grabbing my music pod and slipped it into my pocket as I walked back into the kitchen. My stomach rumbled when I inhaled the mouth-watering scent of grilled chicken, rice and heaven knows what else. Now I was regretting telling Han I wasn't hungry. He looked back at me then pushed a plate outwards and instantly I brightened. \"You gem.\" I sighed, grabbing the plate as well as a knife and fork before carrying it over to the table, sitting down to eat. \"So what's the plan for you?\" \"Stay here.\" He answered simply. \"Until I get a call.\" Stupid phone. Do you think he would notice if I tossed his cell into the sewers? Probably, this is Han we're talking about. Glancing up at him I frowned ever so slightly before returning to my food. \"Natalia.\" His voice sent an involuntary shudder down my spine as I looked up at him. \"You know I cannot help the way things are.\" He murmured and I nodded my head, lowering my eyes down again. \"I know.\" He paused before continuing. \"Are you angry?\" I shook my head honestly. \"No.\" \"Do you ever get angry?\" Slowly I put my cutlery down, pushing the plate away to turn and face Han who was watching me carefully, reading every single sign my face gave away so I kept it carefully guarded. \"Sometimes.\" I admitted. \"But I'm used to this. My dad was the same, now you. It's always been a part of my life so I've just grown to accept the fact that I won't be able to have the ideal relationship with any kind of man that walks into my life. You're all I want Han, which means I'll accept any time I can get with you no matter how long you're gone for in between. I'll always be waiting.\" Standing up I picked up my half-finished food. \"It's apparently what I'm good at.\" I added a little bitterly then stalked back to the kitchen, feeling a little guilty that I hadn't eaten everything on my plate so I took some kitchen foil and wrapped it up. Han did not say anything. Perhaps I should have just held my tongue, he's been through hell and I probably am not helping but what am I supposed to do? It gets a little lonely just sitting here waiting all the time. I can't go anywhere since I never know when he'll be back and I could miss him, which I don't want, yet there's so much I want to do. I want to go travelling and see the world, not stay cooped up here where the city practically chokes me. I can't even call him like a normal girlfriend would do as I might interrupt something or give him away or blow his cover. I just have to sit and wait every single day, never knowing when he'll come back. Some days are easier than others, let's just put it that way. Rubbing my head to try and ease off the headache, I gave up trying to stay awake and simply went to bed. It was dark already so I drew the curtains closed then slid under my quilt, hugging it around me as I curled up into a tiny ball, simply staring into the blackness as I tried to think. What the hell was wrong with me? Han goes through enough crap without me giving him more stick. I was being totally unfair. With a sigh I was about to get up when my door clicked open and the quiet footfalls of Han's shoes touched me ears so I lifted my head. \"Natalia?\" He murmured softly and I couldn't hold back my smile as he said my name. \"I'm awake, Han.\" He walked up to the bed then sought me out so I flicked on my bedside lamp so that he could see. \"Natalia…\" He began to speak but I shook my head. \"Just ignore me.\" I told him softly, pulling him closer. \"It's okay. Honest.\" He sighed with relief, his shoulders slumping slightly as he released the tension. He moved closer and I turned my head further, closing my eyes as I met his lips with mine before he pulled away and began to undress. I lay back my head, watching him quietly as he pulled on some sleeping bottoms but didn't bother with a new shirt, climbing in beside me completely bare chested and I turned over, placing my hand on his chest then began to trace the lines of his impressive body, making him chuckle then lift my hand to his mouth, kissing my wrist tenderly then pulled on it, sliding his other hand beneath me as I shifted closer. \"I missed you, Natalia Sophie Francesca.\" Han murmured in my ear, lips brushing and I shivered, making him smirk. \"I missed you too, you damn jackass. Now go to sleep. I'm shattered.\" Nodding his head he let me get comfortable first, turning over and curling up into a tiny ball which he then moulded to, placing his arms around me as my head tucked neatly against his chest. Content, happy and feeling very safe, I went to sleep without a problem.[Chapter 2] Continuing on, next chapter is up and running! Quick, catch it! I was startled awake when Han kicked out, groaning quietly as he flinched then twitched, his face contorting slightly from the nightmare. His arms had lost me as I had rolled over in the night and he now had his back facing to me, so I quickly moved closer and sat up, placing my hand on his arm. \"Han…\" He whipped around and his fist stabbed at me as if it were gripping a knife but I quickly snagged his wrist, never even blinking as Han's eyes widened when he saw what had happened. \"Natalia!\" He breathed then darted away, stumbling from the bed as he got as far away from me as possible. \"Natalia, I'm sorry...\" \"Just calm down.\" I told him gently, pulling back the covers then slowly approached him, lifting my hands to sooth him. \"It's alright. It was just a nightmare.\" \"No, no don't-\" He was still in confusion, unsure of where he was and what was real or not so I ignored his warning and touched his face, stepping close to him as I gripped his neck and looked boldly up into his eyes. \"Look at me.\" I ordered him and he obeyed, shaking ever so slightly with a slight sheen of sweat on his skin. \"Am I real?\" I made him think, not looking away as he slowly lifted his hands and pushed them through my hair, moving the messy locks back from my face before he nodded his head. Giving him a comforting smile I reached up to kiss him but he turned his face away. \"Han, it was just a nightmare.\" I sighed but he shook his head. \"If I had had a knife, I could have hurt you. Killed you.\" Han argued but I rolled my eyes. \"Which is precisely why I don't keep weapons under the pillows.\" I retorted simply. \"Han, I held back your hand. I'm alright, I'm used to this and I'm good at protecting myself. It's what I do.\" He refused to look at me still so I stepped back, giving him his space to think. \"I'll make some toast. You just get yourself together, okay?\" I told him gently then left him to sort himself out as sometimes, it was what he needed. I went to the kitchen, humming a song to myself and grooving my hips as I put some bread in the toaster and poured myself some juice, throwing it back in one gulp. I was just about to reach for a plate when I heard Han striding up behind me. Turning around to ask if he was now alright, I squeaked when I found he was actually a lot closer than I thought. His hands slid through my hair, tilting back my head to raise my lips to his as he pressed his mouth firmly against mine, kissing me hungrily as I readily accepted his advance. My hands jumped to his shoulders, pulling him closer as they then slid around his neck and his hands found my waist, his body dropping slightly as he then lifted me up and set me on the counter, my legs hooking around him as his tongue swept through my mouth, claiming it for his own as tangled his hair through my fingers. Gingerly his hands brushed against my top, sliding beneath to feel my skin and a small sound escaped me, drawing him in further. Hell yeah, this is what I'm talking about. You guys jealous much? I know I would be if I wasn't me, but I am, so I'm not. I would stick my tongue out at you but it's a little busy right now. Han slowly pulled away but I followed him, wanting more as his left hand rose up my back to find the bullet scar on my left shoulder. He traced it a few times, gazing intently at me as I desperately tried to regain my breath. He wasn't even gasping! \"How is it you have a totally unfair effect on me that I don't have on you?\" I pouted at him and he smirked, lowering his head to whisper in my ear. \"I don't let your effects show as easily.\" Damn that seductive voice. \"Natalia…thank you.\" He murmured and I chuckled, pulling him into me to embrace him. \"For what? That insanely amazing kiss or for just being undoubtedly the best thing that's ever happened to you?\" I asked jokingly, arching an eyebrow at him as he laughed quietly into my neck. \"You know.\" I did know, moreover, he did not need to say. He kissed me again, slowly and meaningfully, not allowing one inch of my mouth to go unexplored until I heard the toaster pop. \"Food!\" I mumbled into his mouth and he chuckled. \"It appears I have competition.\" I shot him a sly smirk. \"Don't worry, you taste just as good.\" He arched an eyebrow at my comment before smiling broadly. Han rarely smiled but when he did, I was always captivated by how charming and good looking he was instead of the usual serious expression he wore. I pulled out a slice of toast but instantly dropped it, yelping sharply as the heat burned my fingers. \"Hot!\" Han rolled his eyes then took my hand, turning it over then rubbed his thumb into my palm before lifting it to his lips and kissing it gently, lingering before pulling away as I watched him silently. \"You know, I burnt my fingers, not my hand.\" I said to him hopefully and he smirked before kissing each of my fingers in turn. \"Han?\" He looked up at me and I gave a little grin. \"You're such a romantic for a guy who kills people for a living.\" \"I have many layers.\" He answered simply and I arched an eyebrow then tugged at his finely tailored suit. \"Well, I can fix that.\" I murmured suggestively and Han raised his eyebrows at my flirtation. What can I say? Aunty Victoria taught me well. Realising that my toast was still waiting to be eaten I slid off the counter, which put me inevitably closer to Han but I then turned my back to him to put some chocolate spread on my slices. As I lifted my first piece of chocolate smothered toast to my mouth, Han grabbed my wrist, jerked it away then took a large bite of my breakfast. \"Hey! Get your own you little thief!\" I stared at him then quickly retreated with my food, hoarding it possessively as I fell back to the table, sat down then hunched over it protectively, watching as Han smirked then found one of his favourite sketchbooks. He went through the pages as if he were seeing it for the first time, taking in every detail and did not move on until he had memorised it perfectly. It felt good to see my art being really appreciated as much as Han did. Dad would tell me it was great but I knew art didn't really interest him, though he was always proud whenever a piece of mine went on show and he'd always bring Sarah along to come and see it as she was far more interested in the art world than dad was. Speaking of which, he was calling me right now. Answering his call after I finished the food in my mouth, I spoke. \"Hey dad.\" Han glanced up, smirked then continued looking through the pages. \"Hey baby, just calling to see if you're okay.\" Dad answered. \"And to see if you would be alright to come down for a few days? Sarah wants to go and see this show and since I'm not the greatest of people to hang out with at such things, we wondered if you would want to come too.\" \"Hang on a sec, let me just check the calendar.\" I replied cheerfully, getting up and walking over to where the calendar hung next to the clock. \"I'm watching you.\" I warned Han who chuckled to himself without looking up as I passed. \"How is Sarah?\" \"She's great, not gone stale as of yet.\" Dad's sarcasm made me laugh. He tried so hard. \"Well that's always good news. I was beginning to worry you'd start going all overprotective on her again.\" I paused. \"You haven't, have you?\" \"No!\" \"Liar!\" Sarah called back with a laugh. \"Hey Nat, how's things? Is Han there? Have you seen him recently?\" She interrogated and I grinned, going to answer but Han shook his head seriously, still not meeting my eyes and my smile dropped. \"No.\" My tone dropped to a dark level as I watched him carefully. \"He's not here.\" \"Oh.\" Sarah felt disappointed for me so I quickly changed the subject. \"Well, when were you thinking about this show? What is it?\" \"Oh! It's an opera, I really want to go, you know, try new things.\" Sarah explained. \"It's on Tuesday night, three days' time. You up for it?\" I had no bookings at work and Han would probably have left by then so I guess there wouldn't be a problem. \"How about I come down tomorrow? Tickets will be cheaper then.\" Turning my narrowed eyes away from Han, I focussed on my calendar. \"And I'll stay for a couple of days. Would that be okay? I could use a holiday.\" \"Sure!\" Sarah cut in ahead of dad, making my lips twitch in a smile. \"I'll make sure to have some sweet stuff in and we can have a girl's night in, movies, popcorn, manicures, the whole thing.\" My smile widened a little. \"Sounds like something I seriously need. Okay, I'll be there no later than twelve, dad?\" \"Yeah baby?\" \"I miss you.\" He paused, registering the slight crack in my voice. \"I miss you both a lot.\" \"Baby, are you okay?\" Shaking my head slightly I looked down at my feet, struggling to keep my breathing at a regular rate. \"Yeah!\" I answered a little more cheerfully than needed and dad was instantly on alert so I just kept talking. \"It's just I don't think you guys know how much I love you. It gets a little lonely sometimes in the city away from home.\" \"Baby…we'll talk when you get there.\" He knew. He knew Han was there. \"Can I talk to Han?\" \"No, sorry.\" Not needing to explain, dad sighed. \"Okay baby.\" \"Wait I thought you said Han…\" \"Sarah, we'll talk with Nat tomorrow face to face. It'll be easier for her.\" I loved my dad so much, he understood me better than anyone else. \"Oh, okay then. I'll buy some extra Skittles then.\" I chocked on a laugh. \"Thanks Sarah, you're the best. I love you guys, see you tomorrow.\" Out of the corner of my eye I saw Han get up slowly, pushing my sketchbook away as he kept his back turned to me. \"We love you too baby.\" Dad answered softly. \"Take care, don't forget the alarm button I installed.\" I rolled my eyes. He was still overprotective dad from time to time. He'd installed quite an impressive alarm system into my flat where I only had to push a button and a bell would go off at dad's house to tell him I was in danger. \"I promise, I'll be cautious and careful.\" I assured him, taking a deep breath. \"See you later.\" I hung up then tossed my phone onto the worktop, not bothering to look at Han as I strode into my room, dragged a suitcase from under my bed then began to pack. He followed me, leaning against the doorframe as he watched me in silence for a while, his expression blank. \"Don't look at me like that.\" I commanded him sharply, shooting him a look as I tore off a long sleeved shirt from a hanger then folded it up. \"Like what?\" He challenged, sneering slightly and instantly I bristled against the mockery. \"Like it's my fault.\" I answered back, doing my best to keep from shaking. \"You're welcome to come along, if your busy life schedule will allow it.\" He said nothing for a moment so I continued my packing but paused to start up my laptop to book tickets online. \"But I need to get out of here. I've been trapped in this damn place for two years, waiting for you every single day.\" \"I warned you that this is what it's going to be like.\" Han growled back evenly, taking a step inside as his eyes narrowed further. \"Right from the start.\" \"And I've compromised, sacrificed and turned away from everything else that I wanted from the start just for you!\" I flung back, grabbing a pair of heels and tossing them inside with a nice dress to wear to the opera. I growled aloud then clutched my hair, inhaling deeply before sighing. \"Han, you mean the world to me but I just…I just can't sit back and wait all the time.\" I turned to face him, struggling to keep my features straight. \"You never call, write or anything, there's no communication between us and that's one of the fundamental requirements for a relationship to work!\" \"You're saying this isn't working?\" My temper flared. \"No! It isn't! I've spent two years sitting on my backside when I wanted to go see the world! Travel! Yet here I am, twiddling my thumbs everyday praying to God that you're alright and not hurt. How do you think that makes me feel? Damn useless, that's what!\" He watched me silently as I began to stab the keys of my laptop. \"Natal…\" \"No, don't you dare use my name as a weapon against me.\" I lifted a hand to shut him up before he could take control over me. I needed him to know this. \"You are a jackass on a good day, a pain in the backside most others and damn well insufferable the rest but you know what? I don't care. What I can't stand, however, is how you seem to think that it's alright to simply walk in and out of my life at your own leisure without any consideration as to how the lack of stability is affecting me.\" I turned and lifted my shirt and hoodie, showing him the frailness of my torso which sunk in at the ribs and exposed most other bones as well. Han didn't react, which only made me madder. \"I go days without eating when I get particularly worried about you, when I hear nothing for weeks on end!\" \"Then stop your worrying. I'm good at what I do, I always come back!\" Han spoke sharply as the level of his voice rose a little louder as he took another step forwards, becoming defensive. \"With stab wounds and lord knows what other injuries! You never go to a hospital, always come crawling back to me to fix you up!\" \"Because it gives me just a little bit more time just to be near you!\" His voice now matched the volume of my own which was beginning to be pretty loud. \"You being dead on my doorstep is hardly helpful!\" We faced one another down, glowering intently as our argument began to really reach its point of peak. \"If you expect anything better then you are mistaken.\" Han snarled at me and I struggled not to flinch away from the threatening pose he had adopted, so to make myself feel a little better, I took one too. \"Is a little more communication too much to ask?\" I demanded fiercely, lifting my chin. \"You never even show up to any of my art displays and you weren't there for my graduation either, you've not lifted a finger to support me through anything when I needed you!\" He said nothing, and that was worse than him arguing back. \"Damn it Han, say something!\" I thrust out a hand and shoved it against his shoulder but his fingers nimbly gripped my wrist, gripping it tightly. \"You have no idea what you're talking about.\" Han said in a dangerously low voice. \"You are such a child at times.\" \"And you are an inconsiderate jerk!\" I retaliated, snatching back my hand then tried to storm away from him but he grabbed my arm and spun me back around, gripping onto me tightly so that there was no chance for escape. I was having none of that. Kicking up a leg I broke his hold on my right arm then twisted, freeing the other before taking a step back, lowering my stance to prepare myself to either attack him or defend against him should he charge. \"How dare you grab me like that? I am not your puppet! I go where I want!\" \"You're not being reasonable.\" Han snapped back at me, taking a menacing step forwards. \"Just listen to me!\" \"No! Why should I? Why should I listen to you when you never listen to my thoughts and feelings? You're cold. Cold and heartless. Sometimes I wonder who the hell you are!\" My words flew with my temper and I was powerless to stop them, despite how desperately I wanted to. Deciding that the best way to avoid more damage was to simply walk away but once again, Han refused to let me leave. His hand snagged my wrist but I whirled my foot around to strike him off but his other hand easily blocked the blow, catching my ankle but I twisted my wrist, turning my arm to change the grips so that I had his jacket then slid both feet forwards, landing on the ground whilst throwing him over my head. \"You son of a…ARGH!\" I bellowed, turning as he spun to his feet then jumped to block my punches and strikes. I didn't want to hurt him, not really, but I was wound up and tense and this was the safest way for me to relent the anger that had built up in me without destroying everything around me and seeing as most of it was my art, I did not want to make some stupid, reckless mistake that I would regret later. Han deflected my blows easily as I was hardly putting any effort into planning what I was doing, merely went for him tooth and nail. I swung my leg and he ducked beneath it, shooting forwards to grab my legs, drive his shoulder into me to overthrow my balance then sharply pulled me onto my back to the ground, a grunt escaping me as Han then went to pin me down but I wriggled, creating space as my heart hammered furiously in my chest, the blood roaring in my ears as I hissed through clenched teeth. Jerking my head forwards I head butt him, allowing me the freedom to flip him from me then stagger to my feet. However now I took a large step back, clenching my fists together as I dragged breath into my body, trying to calm the tempest that raged like a hot inferno within me. Stupid Korean assassin. Why did he always seem to ignite every emotion in me to its fullest? Spinning around I reached out to touch Han's shoulder, intending to apologise but for the first time in my life, I was caught off guard. His arm instinctively lashed out and he backhanded me across the face, causing me to yelp and fall from the force of the blow. I struck my head on the table before collapsing to the ground, completely frozen in shock as Han took in a sharp breath. Tears rose to my eyes from the stinging pain but I bit them back, my body trembling from the shock. He'd hurt me. Actually struck me. Had he meant to do it or was it simple blind instinct from being grabbed from behind? Either way, it still hurt. He just stood there as I slowly uncoiled from around myself, shifting to an upright position as I lifted my eyes to meet his. Han was as frozen as I was, staring down at me as his hand remained slightly raised, as if unable to register what he'd done. Deciding that I needed to be alone, I struggled to my feet, tongue sliding out to touch the split in my lip before gritting my teeth. \"Leave.\" I ordered him in a brusque tone, unable to meet his eyes any longer. \"Natalia I…\" \"Just go!\" My voice thundered though inwardly I wanted him to put his arms around me. What was I doing? Was I crazy? Han, his pride getting the better of him, glared at me. \"Let me…\" \"No, go away Han, I don't want to see you anymore! Get out of here!\" Lifting my head proudly I stalked away, slamming my bedroom door behind me then grabbed a pillow, burying my face in it to muffle the scream before I flung it aside, striking the bed. When I heard my front door slam, my mistake suddenly dawned on me. No, he might misinterpret me, he could leave for good! \"Han!\" I yelled, racing after him. \"Han wait! I didn't mean it like that, Han!\" I tore open my door and practically flew down the steps, to try and beat the elevator, tripping over several times in my haste but the banister kept me upright as I hurtled down past my neighbours who all shook their ancient heads. \"Han!\" He was already gone, I couldn't see him. Not even when I ran out onto the street did I see his face disappearing into the crowd. Undeterred, I ran for the nearest taxi, dragged the guy who was about to get in away then took his space. \"I'll double the price if you floor the gas and get me to the airport.\" Not questioning me, the car lurched forwards and we darted away, me only just managing to get my seatbelt on. We slipped through the traffic, crossing several amber lights and even one red at some point but despite all the near death experiences, I was determined to get to the airport where I knew Han would have flown in on his new private plane. \"Wait there!\" I yelled at the taxi driver then raced into the airport, pushing through the thick stream of people as I tried to search for Han at the checkout points, frisk stations or just anywhere. I had no idea which runway his plane would be on, so I went to find out. Sneaking past some security guards I walked towards the computer room where all the data was stored. Looking at the card key I had swiped from one of the guards, I smirked to myself. It pays to be so awesome. Swiping the card against the pad I waited until it was green before sliding inside. There was someone filing reports so I carefully slipped out of side, inching my way towards the computer as he lifted his head. \"Hello?\" I kept my mouth shut, breathing as quietly as possible as the worker frowned, put down his reports then went to the door. \"Who's there?\" \"Your momma.\" I muttered once he had gone, turning to the computer and swiftly bringing up yesterday's flight patterns and landing directions. First I searched under Han's name but found nothing, so I tried a few other names I knew he went by until I found what I was looking for. \"Seven. Runway seven. But that's all the way over…\" The door opened and I cut off my rant, closing everything quickly. \"Never mind.\" Hurriedly I manoeuvred around the filing guy then ran off, gripping the security tag tightly as I kept my head down and avoided the cameras as much as possible, which isn't particularly hard when you were trained by Frank Moses. Gate seven, just typically it had to be the one on the complete opposite side of the airport. Pulling on a cap I had taken from one of the staff, I pulled it on, tucking away my hair then continued forwards, pulling a jacket from a rack as well and shrugged into it. Using the tag to get through locked doors I hurried out into the open, casting my eye down the runway to see a plane already taking off. \"Han!\" I yelled but it was too late. My heart dropped to my feet as I watched his plane take off in the air, flying further and further away from me until finally, it was gone.[Chapter 3] Good to know that I've been missed, thanks for everything guys! Chapter three, in the box so enjoy! Trudging up the stairs I could not even think. My body felt so numb with disbelief as I inwardly cursed myself for being so stupid. Unintentionally, I had ended the only relationship that had really meant something to me. He'd been the best thing to ever happen to me and I'd just tossed him away in a stupid, childish tantrum as if he were nothing more than a toy. I was a horrible person. Stupid, moronic and plain demented! What was I thinking? Think before you speak, Nat, always think! For the first time in a long while, I began to cry. Hot tears spilled down my face and for a moment I was confused as to what they were before I realised. Damn, that man did things to me no one else was able to. Stupid! Pushing open my door I closed it quietly behind me, looking around my apartment. My hand drifted over the sketchbook Han had been looking through before my eyes fell on my phone. Should I? Deciding that I didn't care what the result, I grabbed my phone and began to dial the number Han had said to only use to contact him in an emergency. Well, seeing as our relationship has reached a critical point, I'm counting this as an emergency. Dropping onto my bed I curled into a tiny ball, still crying as I hugged the pillow, blinking away the tears as the phone rang in my ear. It rung several times and when he didn't pick up, I listened to the answer phone telling me that he was unavailable in Korean. Too right he's unavailable, he's mine! When the irritating beep sounded, I took a deep breath. \"Han?\" I hated the way my voice cracked and that you could obviously hear that I was crying but I couldn't help it. I had to try and fix this mess that I'd stupidly created. Wait, what should I say? Someone help me, I have no idea what to do! There are so many things that I could say, but sorry was not yet one of them. I wanted him to apologise first for hitting me, however I guess I should probably put aside my pride and just say that I'm sorry because I kind of did go all crazy on him and nearly strangled him. Hey, I was a mess and I could easily strangle that guy as easily as I could kiss him most days. Don't blame me! However when I tried to form the words, I just couldn't manage it. They weren't enough, they were too base and meaningless. Anyone could say that they're sorry without meaning it, so what's the point? There was only one thing I could say that might make everything alright, might make him understand why I worried so much and got so frustrated with him. Three little words. \"I love you.\" I gasped inwardly as they escaped me so easily. It felt natural, comforting even to say them out loud as if they had been bottled inside me like shaken champagne and now they had finally burst free. Deciding that I couldn't manage anything else, I hung up. Now all I had to do was wait. Wait. All I ever did was wait. I should probably get dressed, though, as I needed to catch my train soon to get to dad's house by tomorrow. If Han came back…he'd know where to find me. If. Getting up I took a quick shower, brushed my teeth then pulled on some jeans, shirt and a leather jacket, heelless boots coming last. I grabbed my suitcase and flung it open, remembering that I still needed to put towels and shower stuff inside then set about finishing the job. My door clicked open. Instantly I was on alert, sliding behind my wardrobe and lowered myself down, hand groping underneath then pulled a handgun that I had taped there. When no one called out, I knew that I was in trouble. They had picked the lock and now I could hear several heavy yet slow footsteps stalking around my apartment. \"Check the bedroom.\" A voice ordered and I stood, back pressed to the wall as I watched my full length mirror which I had positioned to face the door for situations just like this. Hey, when I make a house a home, I take all possible situations into consideration. Including breaking in and entry. Now, what did these assholes want? Suddenly I became aware of the hissing sound from within the other room. Was that gas? Oh hell no! The gas poured in from under my door and I quickly searched for something to cover my mouth with but before I could even reach for a shirt, I began to feel light headed and woozy. No, this can't be happening. What…what do I do? I whimpered slightly, unable to focus as my head spun wildly and my room with it, whirling until I dropped to the ground. \"In there.\" Someone announced and my door was flung open, light spilling inside and several boots came into my blurry vision. They each wore a gas mask and one was pressed over my face, filling my lungs with clean oxygen which I inhaled deeply but remained still. \"Is she responding?\" Someone shook me but I remained limp, trying to give myself as much time as possible to get my head straight. Once I could form a coherent thought, I struck. My hands lunged forwards and I grabbed the head closest to me, spinning around to knock him out with my gun then shot several times, my other hand clutching the mask to my face as the other four men dived for cover. When the door was open, I made a run for it. \"Get her! We need her alive!\" Someone bellowed through the rasp of the gas mask but I had no intention of letting them take me down without a fight. A largely built body lunged for me but I turned, using my foot to flip up the coffee table and the glass shattered on his head as I then turned, kicking him back into a sofa then aimed my gun to shoot him. \"Get her!\" Switching to target a more aggressive threat, I pulled back the trigger. Three bullets hit the man in the shoulder and arm, making him cry out and drop to the floor with blood pouring from his wounds as I then lashed out at a man coming up behind me, growling as I deflected his blows, ducking underneath him then punched him three times in quick succession in the kidneys, throwing him to the ground then dived for cover as a hoard of bullets were fired at me. I rolled, crouching down low behind the sofa which exploded with padding and fluff. Damn jerks, this is my favourite sofa! When the gunfire paused, I lifted my hand and shot back at them. \"She needs to be alive you moron!\" The lead intruder was heavily accented, Mexican, and obviously wanted me alive for some reason. What had I done? \"Get out of my apartment you pricks!\" I bellowed then ran for the kitchen to get a fresh gun from one of the drawers, taking cover along the way. I spun around the door then kicked it with all my might as someone followed, barrelling after me and when the door struck him, it splintered through and he was now wearing the door like a collar. \"Good boy. Now sit.\" I commanded, slamming my foot into the extremely sensitive area of a man, doubling him over as he bellowed in agony. \"Ouch, sorry about that.\" I growled, grabbing a frying pan then struck him over the head, knocking him out before going to grab a new gun. \"But at least you can't have kids that look as ugly as you now. Poor buggers.\" Another intruder ran at me so I turned but his hand gripped the gun, pointing it down so I squeezed my trigger finger and shot him in the foot. He howled in pain, leaping backwards so I grabbed him with one hand then flung him around, using a foot to help propel him into a wall then shot at another man as he tried to sneak in, forcing him to dive for cover. Suddenly a knife cut into my torso and I cried out but he had grabbed me by the hair and spun me around, striking me head on the worktop then slid me along, pushing aside all the dishes that were drying on the rack and they shattered on the ground. I groaned but twisted, grabbing his hand then dug in my nails to force his fingers to pop open, releasing my hair so I swiftly drove my knee into his gut, turning his arm over in a lock then forced him to the ground, kicking him again then let him go, taking a step back to gather momentum before planting my foot in his face. \"Many happy returns.\" I spat at him then grabbed a cloth, pressing it to my side as I moved out from the kitchen to my studio, freshly loaded gun in hand. \"Don't move, or I shoot!\" A voice snarled so I froze in place, pausing in my attempts to run for the window to get out on the fire escape. \"Hands up.\" Another voice, the leader's voice, commanded so I lifted my hands, letting my gun go slack on my finger and it was swiftly taken away from me. The moment the dumb fool got too close, I spun around then used him as a shield, moving backwards then grabbed a knife that was taped to the underside of one of my tables. I pressed it to his throat but the Mexican guy merely lifted his own gun and shot his comrade in the chest, killing him and I stared as he went limp against me. \"Take her in.\" Snarling with rage I shoved one of the tables forwards, jabbing it into their guts then turned to face one of the others as they lunged for me. We fought, fists, arms and feet but I managed to lift him up with surprising strength then flung him onto the table, splitting it in half. Hey, he was kind of tiny so it wasn't all that hard. \"Must I do everything myself?\" He growled then strode forwards, tossing his gun to someone else. I turned to face him, breathing deeply for air as sweat trickled down my brow. This asshole is going to regret breaking into my flat. \"Who the hell are you people?\" I demanded as he struck first but I deflected it. \"What do you want with me? Don't you know who I am? You're all going to be meatloaf if you don't back the hell down!\" I roared but my threat had no effect on the leader who struck out at me with surprising speed and accuracy. He was good, far better than I anticipated. He flung me into a cabinet of art books and the drawers splinters, toppling the contents of everything above onto me and I groaned, feeling my beaten body begin to complain at the hammerings I had taken. Damn, can I just shoot him now? His hand grabbed me by my hair and dragged me to my feet, ignoring my hiss as he suddenly jabbed a needle into my neck and inserted a serum. I screamed aloud, hoping that someone might have the sense to call the cops, because then at least I might be able to scrape through if they decided it was better to run. My hand curled around his and dragged the needle from me but already I was beginning to feel the effects, making my limbs feel like lead as lethargy swamped me. Someone grabbed me from behind and lifted me up, carrying me as I struggled weakly, snarling, hissing and spitting as I struck out with my feet. When I was brought to the main room, I suddenly saw the white switch by the door. Dad's alarm. I writhed determinedly to reach forwards and with a final kick, my foot slammed the button and red lights spilled through my flat, sirens wailing as everything suddenly went black.[Chapter 4] Hey guys! Next chapter is here, whoop! Whoop! lilnightmare17 - Haha, great minds think alike, I was planning on doing things from both Natalia's point of view and Frank's. Han I am not going to delve into as I kind of can't really explain what he would be thinking, I haven't got a clue what goes through that damned man's head, even when I'm writing him! So yeah, there will be a broader spectrum from Frank and Natalia's POV and Han will remain mysterious and secretive ;) Lunarose Jodes - Yup, I totally second that one. XD Frank When the siren began to shriek, I leaped up and ran to call Natalia. \"Frank! What is this?\" Sarah demanded, standing in the doorway but I ignored her focused on my task and listened to the phone ringing before Natalia's chirpy voice came on the line. \"Hey this is Natalia, obviously, since this is my phone, sorry I can't answer but leave a message after the beep and I'll call you back A-S-A-P. Beep!\" I had already hung up and was moving to gather my things together. Natalia knew not to use that alarm unless she was in real danger, which meant that either Han had hurt her or something else had happened. If Han was the culprit, no amount of bullet proof vest was going to save him from me. I swear to god, I'll kill him. \"Natalia's in trouble. She's set off the emergency alarm.\" I explained to Sarah who suddenly lost all colour in her face, going pale and fear struck her eyes widely. \"So, you're going?\" She questioned then strode forwards as I nodded my head. \"Then I'm going too.\" \"Sarah no, I have to find out what's going on and find Natalia. If she's hurt then…\" \"Oh enough.\" Sarah scowled at me and I groaned. This is not going to be easy. \"I care about Nat as much as you do. Now I'm going whether you like it or not. So put an extra gun in for me and let's get moving!\" And with that she strode off to pack. I hid my smirk then grabbed my keys. If anyone had hurt my baby girl, I'll damn well kill them all. Natalia Groaning I blinked my eyes open, finding myself rather uncomfortable with my hands tied to the back of a chair as I slumped forwards in the seat. Slowly I lifted my head, listening careful and ascertained that there were two other people in the room with me. I could hear them breathing. \"Good. You are awake.\" It was the Mexican who bust up my home. Instantly I tugged forwards, testing the strength of the bonds but they held me well and good so I settled for a snarl. \"You had better let me go or there will be hell to pay!\" He smirked then looked to the smaller man on his left who grinned. \"I like you. You've got spirit.\" \"I also got a real badass family who will come breaking down your door unless you let me go.\" I retorted sharply then looked down my body, trying to see my injuries. I was bruised but my cut had been cleaned and patched up, so I didn't worry about it for now. \"Where am I? Who are you? What do you want with me?\" I demanded and the smaller, much reedier guy inched forwards into the light. He was Mexican too, with jet black hair which he kept neatly oiled back but he spoke English very well. \"Well, since you're sitting so comfortably, I'll tell you a little, my dear.\" I arched an eyebrow. \"I'd hardly call this lump of rock comfortable .\" I muttered and his oily grin spread further. \"Good, at least you have humour. If you had been a girl that cried and sobbed all day, I would have hated to have cut out your tongue and remove your vocal cords.\" Something told me he was not joking, so I decided that it might be safer to simply bite my tongue rather than hack him off with my dry comments. \"You're safe, for now. That's as much as I can promise you. You see, we've come to understand that you and a… friend …of mine are rather close?\" I frowned slightly. \"Be more specific.\" I ordered and he laughed, tossing a few photos onto the table in front of me so I looked down, using the dim light to see what they were of. Me. Or more specifically, me and Han. What? There was one where I was sitting at a table with Han where he wasn't eating his food, merely watching me. Another was of him pulling me closer to him in the street, smiling softly as his brow rested against mine and I grinned happily up at him. Another caught us kissing in the window of my apartment. Wow, these guys were serious whoever they were. Should I be worried that they've been stalking us for what looked to be three months now? \"Never seen him before.\" I deadpanned, looking up and the tiny man chortled with laughter. My eyes slowly narrowed as I tried to think of a way out of here. Hopefully I could kill this irritating little twerp whilst I'm on the go. \"Quite blatantly.\" He replied then shook his head, still smiling. \"You see, you're the bait.\" Bait? They're using me as bait for Han? Should I tell them that Han and I may or may not have fallen out and split up or should I keep that little detail to myself? Seeing as the only reason I was still alive was probably so that they could use me to lure Han in, I decided to keep quiet. \"You're little boyfriend there has cost me quite a lot of money. Killed one of my partners which blew an entire operation we were running.\" Blinking innocently as he leaned down towards me I moved a little closer. \"What kind of operation?\" I asked curiously but he laughed. \"Oh you know, this and that. It's a very dirty world, my dear, so I shan't give you nightmares with my gory details. You just sit tight and don't move. We'll be calling that boyfriend of yours in a moment and I would very much like you to speak to him.\" Instantly I was pressing my mouth firmly shut. Han can't know they have me. If he does then…wait, what's to say he'll come after me anyway? We're not technically together, so why should he bother? However, it was really plainly obvious that he cared a lot about me, I could always tell by the way he looked at me. Yet on the other hand, maybe he just hates me now because of what I said? Man, I hate being a woman sometimes. I think way too much. \"Ricardo.\" The taller, broader and angrier looking guy spoke to my little companion, holding out the phone to him. Watching them dial the number I mentally prepared myself for the blows I was undoubtedly going to take. I wasn't going to speak, they couldn't make me. Without proof Han wouldn't be able to know whether or not they were bluffing, which would leave a little more time for me to escape. The tiny man suddenly lifted his head and smirked. \"How nice to speak with you, Mr Cho-Bai. You know who I am, of course.\" I couldn't hear the reply but from the dark look that flit across his face, I'm guessing that Han had given one of his sardonic replies. \"I am not very happy that you killed my partner, Cho-Bai, you took him away from me so I thought I would be polite and return the favour. I took something of yours.\" Suddenly he strode over to me, continuing to speak. \"She's very pretty, isn't she? Spirited as well, aren't you my dear?\" I said nothing. \"Come now Natalia Sophie Francesca Moses, talk to your precious man. You must be missing him.\" He held the phone out to me but I turned my head away, refusing to speak. \"I see how it is.\" Turning his head to the side slightly Ricardo gave a single nod. \"Manuel, get her talking.\" The man strode forwards, balling a fist then struck me across the face. I did my best not to make a sound as my head snapped back, blood filling my mouth so I turned my head to the side, spat it out then fixed my eyes coolly on Ricardo. \"Hmm, rather tough isn't she? Her father trained her well. Again, hit her harder this time.\" Manuel obeyed, striking me again then gripped my throat with his hands, squeezing whilst pressing his thumbs into my windpipe. I gurgled, struggling to not gasp aloud but tiny sounds escaped me as I struggled to breathe, my face going bright purple from the lack of oxygen as Ricardo continued to speak. \"Very well. Manuel, stop choking her.\" The moment the hands disappeared I sucked in a deep breath, rasping as my neck began to bruise heavily. The phone was pressed to my ear and I almost cried out as Han's soft voice spoke. \"Natalia, are you there?\" I bit my lip but Ricardo grabbed my face and squeezed tightly, his eyes narrowing dangerously. \"Speak you little…\" He insulted me in his native language and what I heard I did not like, however I continued to remain silent. \"Natalia.\" Han said a little more forcefully and I could hear him getting agitated. Manuel drew out a clamp and pressed my fingers in between the tongs, crushing my fingers and I struggled not to scream from the pain as he threatened to break them. \"No, no, don't be so unoriginal.\" Ricardo snapped, brushing Manuel away so he released my fingers. \"Go get a blow torch.\" Holy crap, I have to get out of here! \"Cho-Bai, I apologise. Your girl is being incredibly stubborn. \"You do not have her.\" Han answered simply and I almost breathed a sigh of relief but I quickly caught myself. \"Do not toy with me, Ricardo, you are playing with fire.\" \"Hmm? Oh yes, well I suppose there is another way to show you my sincerity. I could just kill her right here and now.\" Han hesitated and my eyes widened slightly. Don't be an idiot, please don't be an idiot. \"Let me speak with her again.\" Ricardo shoved the phone back at me but gripped my head, anchoring it in place with a hard grip as he forced me to listen. \"Natalia, if you are then speak. Do not put yourself in danger. Speak.\" My lips never even trembled. Ricardo roared in anger then went for me, slapping my face several times and a small whimper escaped me before Manuel finally turned left the room, smirking with satisfaction to find some instruments of torture. That's when I moved. My feet slammed into Ricardo, shoving him back and the force toppled me backwards so I rolled, the chair rolling with me as I rose to my feet then sprung forwards, kicking the phone away then slammed my knee into his gut, doubling him over then delivered a round house kick to the side of his head, knocking him clean out. \"Kiss that, bitch.\" I spat angrily then summersaulted, landing on my back and smashed the wooden chair to splinters. Good thing these dumb asses didn't think about cameras in here. Stupid to underestimate me. Looking at the phone it was completely shattered, dead. Damn, I could have called dad. Lifting my hands I untied myself to the remains of the back of the chair, tossing the pieces away then hid against the wall where the door would open to hide me. My ears picked up footsteps outside after a while so I braced myself to run. The lock clicked as it was turned and Manuel flung open the door, making me wince slightly as it hit me. \"Ricardo!\" Manuel snarled with anger, dropping several things from his hands and leaped over to the unconscious man. \"Brother?\" Makes a little sense, I suppose. Slipping around I quickly grabbed a knife then ran out the door as silently as I could, hurrying down the corridor of a dark, damp filled warehouse. \"Stop her!\" Crap! My pace quickened as Manuel hurtled after me, feet pounding as I leaped around a corner then waited, pressing my back against it as he caught up. The moment he had swung around the corner I sprung forwards and tackled him, lifting my knife and stabbing him in the shoulder. He howled at me so I swiftly rose to my feet, grabbed his head then smashed it against the wall to shut him up. \"There! She's over there!\" Hot damn, what do I have to do to get a break around here? What I wouldn't give for some Skittles right now. Or a chocolate milkshake… When bullets hurtled after me I snapped myself awake. Right, escaping. Focus Nat! Think about chocolate later. Ducking down I quickly dived around a corner, rolling to my feet once more then continued to run, aiming for the stairs. A door opened to my left so I grabbed it and slammed it back, knocked out the guy who was trying to exit then hurtled on again all in the space of a breath. Badass much? I took the stairs three steps at a time, getting out of the basement then quickly looked around. I was in a storage unit, surrounded by large cargo containers and crates. Sniffing the air I got the distinct taste of salt. We were by the sea, so a harbour? We were at some sort of port or docks? That hardly helps my current predicament, I still have no idea exactly where I was. Sneaking between the crates I kept my knife prepared to strike, listening to the whir of machines as the larger containers were moved. There was idle chatter of men working not too far away, but I was now focusing on the crates beside me. Digging my knife into the wood of one of the crates I tore it open then stared as the packs of C4 glared up at me. Eyes wide I opened another to find a similar content full. Holy…damn, this is bad. What were they planning to do with all these explosives? When I heard someone coming closer, their conversation interrupting my thoughts, I abandoned the crates then made a run for a new hiding place. Now I absolutely have to get out of here. This is beginning to look way more than I can handle alone, I need dad. Hell, I need the entire team! \"Someone find me that bitch and bring her back here!\" Manuel roared and I flinched when I heard his voice pierced my ears. I pulled back into some shadows, looking towards the wide bay doors then to the truck that some of the crates were being loaded onto. I wonder where they were going. Taking a tentative step forwards I glanced both ways to make sure no one was coming before slipping forwards. Back pressing against the cool metal of a canister I moved slowly onwards, eyes fixed on the truck to see if there was an insignia on the side but it was plain black. Very helpful. Everything looked too tight for me to get out, there were workers everywhere and Manuel was now scouting through the cargo hold with their guns and eyes raised in search for me. I had to move right now unless I wanted to become the Sunday dinner. Just ahead of me one of the larger cargo containers moved, being lifted up from the ground and I instantly bolted for it. I clenched the knife carefully in my mouth and gripped onto the back end by the metal pole, working my fingers into the smooth then curled up to remain out of sight as I was lifted up and carried through the air, feet gripping on for extra support. I held my breath, watching below me as my fingers began to burn, bruised and sore from their mistreatment of recent hours. When the holder was set on the back of a bare truck I instantly scrambled to climb higher, hoisting myself up the pole then dragged myself up the side and lay flat on the top as someone moved around the back. \"Alright, let's get this one moving! Hurry up and strap it down.\" Crawling forwards on my belly to avoid the straps as they were tossed over. Giving a small yelp I rolled to the side, moving out the way of another before I finally lay there quietly, closing my eyes to recover slightly from the stress of recent events. I want to go home, I'm too damn tired to be dealing with all this crap. The truck started to move and I exhaled with relief, hand curling around one of the straps to anchor myself in place. \"Stop that truck!\" I swore out loud, cursing the sky. Someone up there has it in for me, I swear. I'm betting it's my mother if she is actually up there. There was a clang as someone jumped on so I rolled onto my front, preparing to push myself up and fight off whoever leaped at me. A guy crawled onto the edge then instantly began to run at me so I sprung to my feet and whipped out a leg, striking him in the chest to fling him backwards as another quickly replaced him. Keeping a stern face of concentration as I ducked under the first blow, which was a clumsy left hook then punched them in the ribs, flicking up a foot behind me to catch them on the nose then gripped their arm, swinging them over their head then tossed them into the other as he managed to get up and run at me. \"Don't you have anything better to do than make complete idiots of yourself?\" I demanded then sprang for them. With two very hard, accurate kicks, they both flew off the side of the truck which was continuously moving all the way through the encounter. Suddenly the truck screeched to a halt and I cried out in alarm, collapsing and rolling along the top and nearly fell over the edge had I not grabbed onto one of the straps and clung on for dear life. \"Don't move!\" Manuel shouted to me and I looked up, seeing him climb onto the container with me. As another truck roared past, I got to my feet then leaped for it. I spread out my arms and legs, landing in a starfish shaped position to anchor myself down then stayed still, listening to my surroundings. There was an almighty crash from someone else landing on the truck with me and when I turned, Manuel was already running at me. I turned onto my back and placed my hands back beside my head, flicking back onto my feet then swung a punch at him but he ducked and tackled me around the middle. My torso screamed from the bruising attack as we crashed down to the container top but I twisted beneath him then shoved my elbow upwards, catching his face then swung my legs and hips, turning him over to then grip him down in place. \"You are such an egotistic jackass!\" I thundered as I punched him twice in the face but Manuel then flung me from him, his strength overpowering mine and we both rose, taking on defensive stances before running at each other. We fought viciously, not holding anything back as I knew that this was my likely only chance of escape that I would get. I had to make it count. With a yell I gave a high kick but he swatted my legs aside, forcing me to spin mid-air to maintain balance as he aimed a blow to my gut but I used both arms to block then snatched his wrist and forearm, swinging him around into an arm bar but he turned his body slightly and stood, his free hand going for my hair and pulling my head forcibly around, my eyes stinging from the pain until finally he managed to land a strike of his knee to my gut, doubling me over as I was left winded but he then was strangling from behind, locking my head in place. \"Now, now, no struggling, or I'll have to carve some of your pretty little features away as punishment.\" This guy was sick. \"You'll never get away with this. You wait until the cavalry gets here, then you'll be running for your mommy to hide behind her skirts!\" I hissed but without a word he slammed my head down onto the hard metal and like a bolt of lightning, I was struck down to blackness.[Chapter 5] Frank The place was a mess. Whatever had happened, my baby had put up a good fight. Sarah had gasped when she had seen how wrecked the place was but moreover, how much blood there was on the sofa, in the bedroom, studio and in the kitchen too. \"Oh my god…\" She whispered, gingerly stepping forwards. I had got us through the cops by flashing an ID badge at them, Sarah close behind but there was several places taped off, forensics still going over exactly what happened. I didn't need a team to tell me exactly what the fight had been like. \"She was in her bedroom.\" I murmured aloud, thinking everything over as I read the signs. Sarah looked up from one of Natalia's art pieces which had been destroyed, slashed to pieces and covered in ink. \"Then they hit her with gas.\" I could see the stains from the gas canister on the carpet and you could still taste it in the air slightly. Frowning slightly as I looked at the bedroom, I deduced what had happened. \"She fell half unconscious and they brought her back round with a mask with oxygen tanks.\" Sarah frowned. \"How do you know that?\" I pointed to the disarray of her suitcase then picked up a few strands of hair from the floor where Natalia had been lying. \"She stumbled around a bit, knocking things over then she landed here.\" I explained. \"The gas could have killed her, so they had to make sure that she stayed alive in order to take her fresh.\" I shuddered at the word. Fresh. Like she was a piece of meat ready to be stuck on the end of a fishhook. \"Then what happened?\" I walked through the scenes with her. She had attacked and drawn blood from one guy when on the floor then shot at the others. There were bullet marks in the wall at a slanted angle, which meant she had still been on the ground. Nat had then managed to get to the living room, probably smashed the coffee table against someone's head to get them to back off as it lay in shards with blood spattering the carpet, then had shot someone else. There had been a standoff, bullets filling the walls of the living room as I slowly made my way from there to the kitchen then to the studio. Her newest piece was completely ruined. They had used red paint to graffiti it with the words 'an eye for an eye' on the dainty petals of the blossom tree. \"We have to find her.\" Sarah decided. \"We need to call the others, we'll need their help.\" I agree, my head wasn't feeling right, I was lost as to what to do. Then the door opened. Instantly I grabbed Sarah's hand and pulled her back into the wall, turning my head to listen to the footfalls that slowly entered the living room before making their way towards us. Lifting my gun my finger curled around the trigger as I waited. When they were in range of the door I spun around and aimed for their head. Han lifted both his guns and aimed at me but seeing one another, we both froze in place. \"Han! Oh thank god you're here.\" Sarah breathed with relief as she tackled me with a hug. \"Nat's gone, she's been taken by someone and we don't know where she is or how long she's got before…\" Seeing that neither of us had let down our weapons, Sarah glanced between us. \"Guys?\" \"What did you do to her?\" I growled and Han narrowed his eyes at me. \"Why weren't you here? You were here! You were here when I called!\" A flicker of shame passed through Han's eyes as he sighed, slowly lowering his guns but mine did not shift. \"We argued.\" He answered simply. \"And I left.\" I wanted to shoot this guy so bad but Sarah had gripped my arm and was speaking to me firmly. \"Alright big daddy, put the gun down. We need Han alive to help find Nat. Okay? Just put it down.\" With her hands forcefully pushing my arm down, I lowered my weapon but kept my accusing eyes fixed on him. I knew he wouldn't be good enough for my baby girl, never committing to the relationship but Natalia could never see things the way I did. All she could ever see was how much she cared about this guy. \"You shouldn't have left her.\" I growled then dug my hand in my pocket, dialling Victoria's number. \"Honey, watch the door.\" Glad to have been so readily given a task, Sarah trotted over to stand watch, looking down both ends of the corridor as I listened to my phone ring. Victoria's groggy voice answered. \"Francis, do you have any idea what time it is over here?\" She moaned sleepily but I quickly cut to the chase. \"Natalia's been kidnapped.\" Instantly Victoria was wide awake. \"What? When? How? Francis what happened?\" Victoria demanded then hissed to the man beside her. \"Ivan! Ivan wake up. Wake up!\" \"What is it my little bunny?\" Ivan yawned, turning over with a rustle of sheets. \"Natalia's been kidnapped.\" Ivan swore in Russian and they were instantly both listening. \"The alarm I fitted at the apartment went off this morning so I knew that Natalia was in trouble so we flew over. The apartment is trashed. She put up a hell of a fight but she's gone. Someone has taken her!\" At the beginning I was calm but in my haste to get things moving, my voice shot up the octave and panic settled in firmly. \"Alright Francis, calm down. Ivan, get us a plane.\" Victoria ordered as she got out of bed and began to get dressed. \"We're flying right over, Francis, just remain calm and do what you would normally do. Where's Sarah? Is she with you?\" \"Yes, she's here.\" I answered, my throat dry and breaking. \"Good, keep her there. If Natalia was taken as leverage against you, they might be after her next.\" \"They did not take her because of you, Moses.\" Han interrupted so I shot him a glare, instantly becoming defensive. \"What?\" My snarl was dark and threatening but Han ignored it. \"They took her because of me. They are using her to get to me because I stopped one of their partners from shipping explosives out to Mexico and took care of them personally.\" If my eyes could narrow any further, they did now. \"My daughter is gone because of you!\" I thundered and would have ran at him to break his neck had Victoria not spoken. \"Francis! Remember what I said about calm?\" I took a deep breath. \"Good, now find out what you can about who has taken Natalia then feed the information back to me, I'll get all I can about them and I'll contact Marvin. We'll be there soon.\" Finding her words a little comforting, I cut the call to glare at Han. \"I knew you would be trouble for her.\" Han returned my threatening look. \"You don't think I knew that too?\" \"Then why did you stay and put her in danger?\" I raged so Sarah shot me a look. \"Don't make me come over there.\" She warned then turned back to her post. Han's clenched fists slowly loosened as he sighed, looking away as he pressed his eyes shut. \"I do not know.\" He answered then moved towards a sketchbook that was strewn on the ground, several pages torn out and ripped up. Han crouched down before it, shifting through the pages then picked one up, gazing at it intently before collecting the pages together and neatly stowed them away. \"This was my favourite book.\" His soft tone startled me as I watched him stand with it in his hands before he slid it into a bag he had brought with him, tucking it away then turned to face me. \"Ricardo and Manuel Medina. Drug lords, weapon traders and all round black book criminals.\" I sent the names over via messenger to Victoria then turned. \"Come on honey, let's go.\" \"Where are we going?\" Sarah asked as I placed my hand on her back. \"To talk to some old friends of mine.\" I paused at the door then turned a sharp look at Han. \"You coming?\" He nodded his head, glancing around the apartment before striding after us as we headed for the elevator. Sarah fidgeted, biting her lips as she looked around. \"So what were you two arguing about?\" She asked Han who clenched his jaw. \"Us.\" He answered darkly then shot her a look that warned her not to press. Sarah was oblivious. \"You two having trouble?\" She smiled charmingly. \"It'll pass. These things always do.\" He said nothing in reply so Sarah let it drop for the moment, though I had a feeling that she would try to poke a little further to get all the details. Before the doors slid open, I turned to face Han. \"Just one thing.\" I balled my fist and punched him in the face with all the power I could muster. Han was flung back and Sarah squeaked in surprise as I instantly held out a hand to prepare to push her back behind me but to my surprise, Han did not retaliate. He wiped away the blood from his face then exhaled, lifting his head to regard me. \"I suppose I deserved that.\" He muttered then strode out the door as they slid open, his face dark and stormy as the rain gathered outside and the heavens opened. \"Well, that's something that doesn't happen every day.\" I mused, following after him with my arm around Sarah. \"I just punched a notorious hit man and came out without so much as a bruise against me.\" Sarah chuckled weakly. \"You know, I think they're really struggling with their relationship, Frank, couldn't you at least try to be more supportive?\" Sarah questioned me and I frowned. \"I am supportive! I support her every time she talks about simply kicking his ass into next week.\" She scowled at me then sighed. \"You know what I mean.\" She said, tugging on my scarf to make it sit better around my neck. \"Nat has always had a lack of stability of life, not that you could help it sometimes.\" She lifted a hand to silence my protest so I clamped my mouth shut. \"But with you constantly trying to persuade her to leave him, its put undue pressure on them because she feels like she's going against you by being with him. Come on Frank, you've seen them together.\" She gave me a soft smile, one that instantly melted my heart. \"They adore each other. I'd go as far as to say that they loved each other a lot.\" \"But he's a hit man! An assassin! He's no good for her, Sarah. Honey come on, you see how Nat gets when the time between them seeing each other gets too long. She stops eating, she hides herself away and sometimes she'll even cry! He can't do that to her. Not my baby girl.\" \"Frank, all she needs is a little more support from you, all you have to do is say 'it'll be okay' and Nat will be fine. If Han isn't there for her then you need to be.\" She flicked out her umbrella, opening it up as we stepped out into the rain. \"Now, who are these friends that we're meeting?\" I groaned. This could either go really well or really, really, really , badly. Uh oh, Frank's hacked off with Han. This could be interesting, very interesting :)[Chapter 6] So we're back with Natalia, who is getting a little agitated at repeatedly being captured. Hot damn, what is she going to do now? Read on and find out! Natalia Another tray of food was thrust into my little cell but I kicked it away, not wanting the horrible grey mush that they called 'nourishment'. It smelled worse than when dad had accidentally fried a rotten egg when he had had a cold and couldn't smell anything then tried to give it to me for breakfast. I lay down on the hard bed, allowing myself plenty of rest seeing as my body was pretty bruised, battered and hurt from all the fights I had been in these last twenty four hours. Whilst body rested, mind went at seven hundred miles an hour. How was I going to get out of this one? I suppose I'll have to wait until they move me, seeing as I have no idea where I was or how to break through walls, so I'm pretty much stuck in here for the time being. What would dad do? Hmm, that's a good question. Only thing is, I'm not dad. Okay, so what would Vic…no I'm not her either. Right, third time lucky. What would I do? Slowly getting up I walked around the plain room, glancing to the four cameras situated in every corner of the ceiling. At least they weren't so dumb as to not learn from their mistakes. Lifting the tray I set it calmly back on the slide panel and pushed it back, not wanting it though I was beginning to get really hungry. Formulating a plan I sat down on the bed and waited. They'd done a fair bit of tormenting before throwing me in here, half drowning me and strangling me until I was almost dead before reviving me. However I knew that I had to just live through this bit of hell, because then they would leave me alone for a while to only come back later, which was when I would have to move. If they carried on the way they were going now then I won't survive the night here. Dad would have got my distress call and would have roped in Victoria and the others by now, so all I needed to do was keep alive until they found out who was holding me then find a way to get back to them before they could kill me. Oh, I also had to kill them on the way out, seeing as they probably won't leave us alone until they were. Plus, they were the bad guys and that's good enough reason for me to get rid of them. I do not even want to imagine what they're planning to do with all that C4. When my door grunted and swung open, I opened my eyes and calmly looked at Manuel as he stepped forwards, beating a heavy looking plank of wood with several nails sticking out at the head, sharp and rusty. into his open palm as he smirked. I rolled my eyes. \"You really enjoy this, don't you?\" He nodded his head. \"I do.\" I was going to vomit, however, I needed to be calm and do something that only I would do. Slowly I rose to my feet, arching my back as I rolled my body slightly, parting my lips then slowly moistened them, blinking purposefully as I took a step towards him, angling my body as I lifted my chin. Oh yeah, seducing. This is what I would do. Manuel shifted uncomfortably and I made a low sound in my throat as I took another step closer. \"Is that how you like it? Rough and painful?\" I questioned in a whisper, pouting my lips slightly as his eyes stared at me, utterly transfixed. \"A fine line between pain and pleasure, don't you think?\" He growled as I reached him but he did not push me away or step back himself. I had him in the palm of my hand, right where I wanted him. Lifting a hand I eased it under his jacket, brushing my fingers against his side as I tilted my head to the side and directed my mouth up to his, slowly closing my eyes as he reached forwards. Before his mouth could touch mine my hand whipped the gun from his holster and I spun around, gracefully landing my foot in his face, which was already battered and bruised from my kicks but now his nose was gushing, slightly crooked from my blow. Before I could aim to shoot him the door burst open and I changed target, shooting the two men who barrelled inside then the third who had lingered, not waiting as he fell forwards and slumped over the first two. \"Adiós, amigo.\" I saluted then shot him as he leaped up. His snarl was cut off and his entire body jerked before going perfectly still and I raced out of my cell, heading away from the sound of men as they ran towards me. I ran forwards, hands gripping my gun as I slowed around the corners, pointing the barrel both ways before moving on again. I shot past the security camera and continued to select random directions until I was met with a group of four men with badass guns. Springing up I grabbed the first guy's head and shoved it down, leaping over him as I jammed my gun forwards and shot the next to in the chest, using my foot to kick aside the fourth's gun then shot him too and finally, I finished the last of them. If the government ever found out about this, I would be in such serious trouble. Pushing my hair back from my face I lowered myself to the ground, crouching as I listened for anymore gunmen coming close but when none came from ahead, I charged forwards and instantly looked at the elevator. I bolted for it then stabbed the up button whilst keeping my back pressed into the crease of the wall, gun up and aimed as the elevator whirred into life, slowly descending to my floor. When the doors slid open I heard the soft click of guns being raised. With a yell I leaped forwards, ducking under the first man to use him as a shield as I shot my gun into the elevator, shooting three men in quick succession then grunted as I was kneed in the stomach. \"Get her down!\" Oh hell no, I am not going back to that hell hole. As I was flung back I quickly recovered, ducking down again and rolled on the floor, facing the last two men as they went for me with their guns but I dropped down into the splits as they instinctively fired and shot one another dead. Men. Too trigger happy. Swiftly I shoved the bodies out then struck the ground floor button and I was raised higher, holding down the button to gain direct access. Wherever I am, I'm getting the hell out of here. When the doors rolled back I paused, back pressed against the panel so that I was out of sight whilst tucking my gun into the hem of my jeans and covered it with my jacket and shirt before stepping out of the elevator. Instantly I was swept away by a rush of people. Looking around I could tell that this was some big organisation, though I couldn't tell what. The interior of the building was sophisticated but in an ugly modern sort of sense. There was no greenery, just metal and glass. There was a tall structure in the middle, two metal beams coiled together with water sprouting up the centre but it still made everything look ugly. I moved around this, keeping my head down as I headed for the glass doors. Suddenly alarms went off everywhere. \"Nobody move!\" A voice bellowed and everyone shrieked in confusion as security guards stepped forwards and began to search through the women, looking at their faces before moving on. As one of the guards moved closer to me I turned and hid myself behind two men, sticking to them like glue before sliding past the guard as he turned to check a different woman. I moved slowly, not wanting to be spotted and my chest burned the closer I got to the doors, which people were starting to move through after they had been checked. Seeing two guards standing there, I realised the front door wasn't an option. Turning around I made my way back towards the fountain, scrambling for ideas. This was the kind of time when I would simply love aunty Victoria to come sauntering with a nice looking gun and distract everyone for me. Just like last time. Oh good times. Good times. Heading towards the janitor I followed them as they shuffled down the corridor, an idea suddenly coming to mind. I gave a low whistle and the guy stopped, frowning. Without a word I slammed his head against mine, knocking him out then dragged him under the arms into the cleaning closet to strip him of his overalls and stepped into them myself, taking his hat then used several cloths to gag him and bind his wrists to a rack of shelves. Stepping outside I tucked up my hair, lowered the cap then pushed the cleaning trolley forwards. When armed guards raced past me I kept my head up slightly, not flinching away from them but continued forwards until I reached the end of the corridor then turned left, glancing around. I had managed to make my way to the back of the building and just below me was a car park with some very nice, very expensive looking cars. Jackpot! I grabbed a window and opened it as far as it would go, hoisting myself up then slid through carefully, biting my lip as I cautiously hung over the edge then dropped to the ground. With a roll to absorb the shock I quickly got to my feet, shoved my hands into my pockets then moved over to the cars, trying to look as inconspicuous as possible for the cameras. Patting my pockets as I approached a black Mercedes, I glanced around to see if anyone was watching before picking up my elbow and smashing the window in. The glass cracked and shattered, allowing me to reach in and unlock it from the inside by opening the door but then I quickly dropped and hotwired it as the alarms went off. Thanks for the tutoring Marvin! Once the engine was rumbling, I pulled the door shut just as there were shouts from across the car park. \"Over there! Get her!\" \"Later losers.\" I muttered then sped out of there, shifting up the gears as I swung out onto the road then sped off, racing away as several cars chased after me. Well, at least I knew we were still in New York. Gunfire hammered after me so I swerved, cursing as they sped to catch up in their muscly four by four. Turning a sharp corner I barely had time to yell in fear and swerve to avoid the people trying to cross the road, the lot of them screaming as I drove onto the wrong side then caused other cars to scream in rage at me, slamming palms onto horns as I quickly manoeuvred out of their way and back onto the right side of the road. The trucks came thundering after me, people screaming as bullets fired but I kept my head low, slouching slightly in the seat to avoid being hit in the back. Again. Tyres screeched as I drifted around another corner but then fell into congested traffic, completely immobile as other cars gathered behind me. \"No!\" I snarled then flung my cap down, throwing open the door then raced towards a taxi, spotting a young man inside talking on his phone. Before the other cars could catch up to me, I opened the door, slid inside then grabbed his phone. \"He'll call you back.\" I announced whilst ripping the buttons from my overalls to slide free from it. \"What the hell do you think…?\" I grabbed his jacket and pulled him to me as I saw out of the corner of my eye that men were jumping out of their cars and racing towards the black Mercedes I had taken. Turning my head I planted my lips firmly on his and began to kiss him slowly but with ardour, keeping a tight grip on his jacket as he gave a grunt of surprise before closing his eyes and going for it. We moved forwards painfully slowly as I pulled the overalls off and kicked them under the seat, my mouth still firmly pressed against this stranger's as my pursuers began to check the streets and car windows for me, however when they saw a couple kissing rather passionately in a taxi they quickly moved on. Admittedly this guy was a good kisser but he was nothing compared to Han. He was greedy, over excited and I had to force myself not to roll my eyes as he pulled me closer to him. The driver frowned at us. \"You guys need a hotel?\" I would have laughed but simply waved my hand at him, signalling for him to keep driving, so he did. We broke free of the traffic and the moment we were a few streets away I sighed with relief then broke off the kiss. \"I'm sorry but this relationship isn't going to work.\" I apologised with a smirk. \"It's not you, it's me.\" I assured him as I then turned and leaned forwards. \"Pull over here will you?\" \"Do I get a kiss?\" He asked and this time, I did laugh. \"Sure thing sugar.\" I reached forwards and kissed his cheek. \"Thanks boys!\" I trilled as I slid from the car. \"Hey wait! Can't I have your number?\" I blew him a kiss then turned, quickly falling into step with the thick throng of shoppers. I needed a change of clothes, fast. I ducked into a nondescript store where there were no security cameras and browsed the racks, pretending to seriously consider my clothes as the girl at the till slouched in her seat, texting on her phone with boredom. Taking a new pair of jeans, shirt and hoodie I went into the changing room and got changed. I looked awful, in my opinion, though for just the one glance you could say I looked fine. I hadn't bruised much on my face by some miracle, must be those arnica tablets dad practically raised me on. It was the rest of my body that was in a worse shape, with fist marked bruises on my ribs and gut and I was pretty certain I may have cracked a rib, though it could just be me. I twisted back my hair under a woollen hat I had also grabbed then stepped out, hanging my old clothes up on a rack as the girl glanced over to me but then quickly returned to her phone. The tags I left in my old jacket pocket, walking outside and lifted my hood, stuffing my hands deep into my pocket as my gun rested in the back of my jeans. Now I needed to contact dad. I'll go to one of his safe houses and contact him from there. It'll be safer for definite. Only problem? The nearest safe house was four hours walk away. Best get started then.[Chapter 7] Sorry for the delay! Please don't be mad, next chapter is here for you guys so yeah, enjoy! Peace out! Frank We pulled up outside a nightclub and Sarah arched an eyebrow before grinning. \"I like it, classy.\" She decided, unbuckling herself then slipped into the open air then looked down at herself. \"But now I totally feel underdressed.\" \"You look fine honey. Come on.\" I murmured, placing my hand on her arm to pull her gently forwards, Han getting out of his car to follow. He was tight lipped and I could tell that he was worried, seeing as he hadn't heard anything from those brothers that kidnapped my little girl. I swear I'm going to kill him when this is over. If my baby comes back with so much as a hair out of place, I'll wring his neck. \"Frank?\" Sarah awoke me from my internal threats to face the bouncer at the door who was much larger, broader and chunkier than I was, though we sported the same haircut. \"We're here to see Owen. Tell him Frank Moses is here.\" I commanded and he arched his eyebrow and for a moment, I thought he was going to try and toss me on my rear there and then but he turned and walked away, nodding to the other bouncer at the door who checked people for weapons before allowing them through. \"So who is this guy?\" Sarah asked me, slipping her hands through my arm to hold on as she glanced around, music blaring unpleasantly loudly from within. \"He's a crook but one of the nicer kinds.\" I answered. \"He and his partner Ronin swung a couple of petty deals back in the day but they're the best at getting information. They have fingers in every pocket around this city so if they have anything on our guys, I'll get it from them.\" She arched an eyebrow at me. \"You're not going to duct tape them are you?\" I gave an uneasy laugh, feeling the tape in my pocket. \"No! Course not. I'm going to ask nicely.\" Pausing I gave a little shrug. \"First time round.\" The bouncer returned and nodded his head. \"They'll see you in the VIP suite.\" \"Ooh, sophisticated.\" Sarah mused as she stepped through first, completely at ease as she shot the bouncer a wink, making me bristle slightly before I rolled my eyes. The lights flashed in bright neon colours and I frowned against them but Sarah was already dancing, swinging her hips and both Han and I looked at each other. \"She's your girl.\" Han stepped back, lifting a hand to signal I was on my own. I sighed then grabbed Sarah's waist. \"This way honey, up here.\" I said directly in her ear so that she could hear me over the horrid excuse for music that was playing at full blast. Sarah pranced her way up the steps, singing along with the words then spun around but her hand flew out and smacked a guy in the face. \"Oh! I'm so sorry about that!\" Sarah gushed. \"Are you alright?\" The older man scowled at her, shaking his head then straightened his suit, turning a dark look upon me. \"Moses.\" He greeted with a cold not and I grinned. \"Glad to see me Owen?\" I asked, spreading my hands before becoming serious. \"We need to talk right now.\" Sighing he nodded his head then gestured for us to follow. Han was interrupted by several girls moving to dance around him, moving provocatively but he pushed past them, climbed the stairs then firmly slammed the door shut behind him, shooting me a look then fixed his eyes on Owen. \"Where is Natalia?\" He demanded and Owen arched an eyebrow, swirling his whiskey as Sarah began to poke her nose through a few of his files curiously though no one paid her much attention. \"Who?\" I growled. \"My daughter. Where is she?\" Owen snorted. \"Isn't she grown up now? Surely you don't need to keep such close tabs on her by now.\" Both Han and I strode forwards, grabbed an arm each then tilted Owen back in the chair so that it leaned on only two legs, his eyes widening as we both drew a gun. \"Now I don't want any trouble. Just tell me all you know about Ricardo and Manuel Medina.\" Knowing that compromise wasn't an option, the little ferret began to speak. \"They're shipping explosives down to Mexico and from there out to other places in the world to terrorists.\" He babbled all at once and Han slowly narrowed his eyes. \"They're the top sellers of C4 and other explosives in the world so it makes them pretty powerful. I'd hesitate before messing with them if I were you.\" \"Too late.\" Han answered bitterly and Owen smirked. \"So, you're the one who took out Antonio. They lost millions in that deal, I can see why they're pretty pissed. You dating Moses's daughter?\" Han said nothing but Owen continued regardless. \"I'd move on if I were you. Find some new ass to grope, she's as good as dead if she isn't already. Those guys are brutal when it comes to torture.\" Without warning Han had lashed out and punched Owen on the nose, breaking it squarely so that it sat practically flat on his face. \"Damn bastard!\" \"Where do we find them?\" \"How should I know? I'm just the one who listens!\" I grabbed Owen's arm again and twisted it, threatening to break the arm as he howled. \"Fine! I'll tell you some more. Damn you Moses.\" He shot me a filthy look. \"Where's Ronin? I need that sorry son of a…\" The door opened and Ronin stepped in, looking well set up with his expensive suit and Rolex watch on his wrist. \"Moses.\" He greeted with neither warmth nor coolness. \"Please release his arm.\" I let go, turning to face Ronin who was always the more reasonable of the two. \"Ronin.\" He walked forwards, pouring himself a drink as he sighed. \"I heard about your little girl. I'm very sorry.\" Ronin said slowly, taking a sip after he had dropped some ice into the drink. His eyes turned to Sarah and he arched an eyebrow curiously. \"Hello there, you must be Sarah. You're a favourite topic around here, the woman who captured Frank Moses.\" Sarah beamed. \"I'm famous?\" Ronin smiled. \"In a manner of speaking.\" Looking undoubtedly happy, Sarah flicked closed a file then put it back on the shelf to reach for another. \"So, Moses, I can guess what you're after.\" Owen growled. \"My arm is going to need a sling after this.\" \"Shut up.\" I growled at him before looking back at Ronin. \"Tell me.\" Shaking his head sadly, Ronin lifted his eyes to meet mine. \"It's not good, I'm afraid. They want him.\" He gestured towards Han who stood up a little straighter. \"They plan on a trade where they'll kill Han and probably your girl too. These guys don't allow any second chances, Moses, they'll get them both and you too if you step in their way. They have multi-billions of dollars, endless lists of allies and enough weaponry support to amass an assault on the Whitehouse, take over and control America.\" This was not sounding good. \"But where are they?\" I pressed. \"I want to get my baby girl home safe.\" Ronin smiled. \"I respect that about you Moses, really I do, you're a family man.\" Giving a long sigh Ronin leaned back. \"It's a pity.\" Instantly both Han and I were on alert. \"Sarah.\" I stretched out my hand and she came to me, instantly looking worried but did her best to hide it. \"What are you talking about, Ronin?\" Owen shifted uneasily. \"Sorry Frank. We appreciate what you've done for us in the past but…well. They pay well.\" Owen explained, getting up and with a soft click, aimed his gun. \"You two can go, it's only the Korean they want. You could just walk away.\" Considering Sarah's safety, it was what I wanted to, yet the moment I made the move to leave all I could see was Natalia's devastated face. Ugh, fatherhood has made me into a softie. \"You jerks, no way are we leaving Han! Right Frank?\" Sarah demanded with a pointed look and I sighed. \"I'm going to regret this later.\" I growled then whipped back a leg, knocking the gun aside then punched Owen down, knocking him out as Han did the same to Ronin. \"Now let's move.\" Hand firmly against Sarah's back I marched her from the club but pulled her into the alley as several cars pulled up with men carrying hidden weapons stepped out, most of them Mexican looking. My phone began to buzz and I hissed before quickly answering in a hushed tone. \"Yeah?\" \"Francis we are about to land. Meet us at the airport and we'll be waiting at the front. There's some things we'll need to discuss.\" Victoria started then quickly added. \"Marvin has said he'll meet us there too, see you soon.\" Hanging up I nodded my head. \"Alright, let's go.\" I led Sarah back to the car once it was safe where Han got into his own, avoiding being seen before following me as I led the way. He called me up. \"Where now Moses?\" \"Airport. Victoria might have something.\" I answered then glanced to Sarah as she tapped my shoulder. Slowly she slipped some papers from under her coat and I stared at the red stamp that read 'classified'. \"Ha! Honey you are a genius!\" I praised and she smirked. \"I know. Want to know what it says?\" I put Han on speaker phone. \"These are some deals that those guys made with the Medina brothers last year. They bought some drugs off them, typical suspects, cocaine, cannabis, morphine, nothing really special but they filed the place of the handover and a few tidy little contract details. Think we should arrange a deal?\" My smile broadened. \"If not then at least we can totally put these guys away with evidence.\" My grin became even wider if it were possible. \"Honey, I love you.\" I proclaimed. \"Let's go get my daughter back.\"[Chapter 8] You guys are going to be wriggling in your seats after this chapter ;) Oh I love being a writer, putting in unexpected plot twists and cliff hangers, aren't they fun? And only I know what's going to happen! Mwhahahaha! Natalia Too tired to keep walking and seeing that it was quickly becoming dark, I ducked through to an alley where some squatters rested around a trash can which was billowing with fire. \"You look lost.\" Someone remarked to me so I shrugged. \"No, just got no place to go to.\" I answered, gesturing to a vacant space. \"Mind?\" They all shook their heads so I sat down and warmed my fingers against the flames, shivering against the cold. \"So what's your story?\" I laughed. \"You wouldn't believe me if I told you.\" A couple of them snorted, rolling their eyes. \"Try us.\" I arched an eyebrow then smirked. \"My story is my own. It's safer if you don't know a thing about me. In fact, the moment I'm gone you'll all do well to forget my face and that you ever saw me.\" An older, scraggly haired man shifted slightly, turning to face me a bit better. \"What's a pretty girl like you doing on the streets now? Where's your family?\" I paused, unsure how to answer. \"I'm getting there, just no money to get there faster.\" I answered with a shrug then wrapped my arms tightly around my waist, closing my eyes to rest some. The alley protected us from the cold mostly, though I could still hear it howling outside. I was just under two hours away from the safe house, where I would be able to actually rest in a proper bed and find some food. I dozed for a while, allowing my feet to recover though when one of the younger homeless people tried to steal my hat and search my pockets, blind instinct and reflex actions drove me forwards. My hand shot out and grabbed their wrist, flinging them onto their back then buried them in the snow as they yelped in pain and surprise. \"Don't!\" He squeaked so I growled then let him go. \"Stupid move, buddy.\" I shot at him then stood, stretching before nodding to them all. \"Goodnight.\" They stared in awe as I strode away, not even looking back as I focused on moving forwards. The streets were all lit up so I kept my hood low over my face and my cold hands deep in my pockets. There was a scuffle in the snow behind me and I instantly focussed my attention on the sound though I did not break my gait. Keep walking, just keep walking. Perhaps it's nothing. Maybe you're just being paranoid because of the really crappy time you've been having. When footsteps began to crunch in the snow behind me, I sighed aloud. Okay, guess not. I'm being followed. Can't they just back off for a while until I actually have the energy to fight them off? When I heard their pace quicken to a run to catch me I whirled around. The figure stopped, trembling from the cold and I blinked when I found they were simply an unarmed woman. However when they shuffled closer and stood under the lamplight, highlighting their withdrawn and aged features, I could only stop and stare. Her hair was tousled and bland when it had once been a rich mahogany and her eyes were now dead and empty though her lips constantly murmured, staring wide eyed at me as my mouth fell wide open with shock. \"Mom?\" Frank Victoria gave me a strong hug when I walked up to her, hand rubbing my back with a sympathetic but determined look in her eyes. \"Hello darling.\" She turned and embraced Sarah who returned the hug. \"Han, how are you?\" She then turned to Han who shifted uncomfortably. He gave a single nod of his head just as Marvin and Ivan arrived. \"So! Who stole away my sweet little mint cake? Tell me, I'd like to but bullets in them.\" Ivan's richly accented voice said cheerfully, clapping and rubbing his hands together. \"Well, she could always be dead.\" All eyes glared at Marvin who shrugged and lifted his hands, palms facing upwards. \"I'm just being realistic.\" He excused but Victoria snorted. \"Natalia is far too intelligent to get herself killed. No, we can rely on her to protect herself but we have to locate her so that we can extract safely.\" Victoria looked at me. \"We'll need a place to set up our computers.\" \"I know a place.\" I nodded my head then led the way over to the cars. \"Who's going where?\" \"I think Marvin had better ride with you.\" Victoria elected, shooting Marvin a look as he stroked his pig. He'd brought the pig with him? \"Han might kill him if he opens his mouth too much. Besides. I want to have a little talk with Han.\" He nodded his head, not bothering to argue then stalked over to his car. \"So what have we got so far?\" Marvin asked as he slid into the back, Sarah and I in the front. \"We know who took her, all we need to find out is where they are and where they have taken Natalia.\" I replied then flicked up my phone as it began to ring. \"Yeah?\" \"The Medina brothers own several business corporations mainly in New York and Mexico.\" Victoria's diplomatic voice spoke and I listened intently. \"Apparently they are a dedicated science utility producing drugs and researching medical illnesses such as Alzheimer's, cancer and the usual saint like suspects however it says here their factories were searched for other drugs that they had bought in such as morphine, cannabis and such that they sold on the black market. Case was suddenly cleared and they were set free though I doubt it was legal.\" \"So where is their nearest building or factory?\" I asked and Victoria paused, searching. \"Twenty miles away from here, though we need to make a plan of action, Francis, we can't just go in guns blazing.\" Too bad. All I want is to get my daughter back and I've wasted enough time as it is, she could be seriously hurt and I'm not there to protect her. \"Francis?\" \"Yeah?\" I questioned. \"Don't worry. We will get her back.\" Told you there was a plot twist :P[Chapter 9] Yeah, sorry about that cliff hanger, that was very mean of me. Anyhow, on with the show! (Disclaimer - I own nothing of the RED verse save for the characters of my own creation and the plot line, so yah). Natalia My mom, who I had not seen in nearly twenty years, shivered on the couch of my dad's safe house. A small apartment in a quieter part of New York, where there was enough food to last a month as well as guns, weapons, money and emergency supplies tucked away in various places and to avoid simply staring at my mom in shock, I had set out searching every nook and cranny to find them, familiarising myself. She had a blanket wrapped around her whilst she guzzled down some soup I had made her. I couldn't believe it. I thought she was dead, she had been so mentally unstable when she had run away that I simply did not believe that she would have been able to take care of herself. \"What happened to you?\" I asked her as she rocked forwards and backwards, still murmuring under her breath as she stared wide eyed at the floor. She still looked insane, those eyes had frightened me when I was a child. Suddenly she blinked and looked up, as if coming to her senses. Then she smiled. \"Natalia, you look so pretty.\" She said then continued rocking, returning to her state of mind. I sighed. This was not going to be easy. The only thing this place lacked was a working phone. The landline was cut at the cord and with no other network with a safe line, there was little I could do to contact my dad so instead I booted up the several screens then began to search for him, running a face scan on all recent camera feeds in my home block where my own apartment lay trashed and found a couple of matches though I needed to find a more recent one. Whilst this was going on I opened up another software and began to search for Ricardo's files and I came across an interesting website, however when I tried to access the more private file, I was blocked. Growling under my breath I started to hack in, tapping the keys then sent through my virus to tear down their firewall. Leaving the software to run I slowly approached mom, lowering myself down to crouch in front of her. \"Hey mom?\" I whispered softly and she looked at me, going perfectly still but her eyes remained wide and fearful. \"I'm going to have a shower, are you okay to just sit here for a moment?\" She nodded her head, biting her lip like a scolded child then drained the rest of her soup. I took the bowl from her then went to the shower, picking some fresh clothes from the closet that dad had recently added for me. He'd gone round every safe house and made sure he stocked it up so that my needs, as well as Sarah's, would be supplied for. I have never been more grateful for hot showers than when I stepped under the thick stream of water which eased all the aches in my muscles. I groaned aloud then carefully began to wash myself clean of all the blood, cleaned my hair then allowed my mind to go blank. After about ten minutes I stepped out, knowing that I really needed to see to my cuts, gashes and bruises. I reapplied a protective pad to the deep cut on my side and another to the one on my back, flinching every now and then as I cleaned them with disinfectant then smothered my bruises in sudo-cream to help them heal faster. Once I was dressed I twisted back my damp hair and turned, inhaling deeply. I almost choked on the smell of smoke and instantly I was flying out the door just as the fire alarm went off. So much for keeping low. \"Pancakes!\" Mom trilled happily, dancing around the kitchen as she went to add more oil to the fire she was burning in the pan. \"Mom no!\" I yelled and she screeched, dropping the oil then flung herself backwards, sobbing as she clutched her hands to her face. I quickly doused the flames with a fire blanket, turning off the gas to all the hobs then rounded on mom, preparing to shout angrily but I checked myself, taking a deep breath. \"It's okay mom, look see? No more fire. I'm not angry, I was just worried you had hurt yourself.\" I gently took her hands and stared at the burns before quickly pulling her over to the sink, turning on the cold water then went to the freezer, pulling out a pack of ice, opened it then dumped it into the sink, lowering her burnt hands into the ice cubes. They weren't bad, just a little red so I didn't worry about taking her to the hospital, they were mere spits on her skin. \"There now, hush, it's okay, you're okay.\" I felt like I was babying a child but mom responded, settling down as she let me tend to her burns. \"I wanted to make you pancakes.\" I gave her an uneasy smile. \"It was a lovely thought, thank you mom, but I'm not hungry. Maybe we can make them tomorrow? Together?\" She brightened at the thought, smiling broadly then nodded her head enthusiastically. Taking a deep breath I looked at her. \"Mom, how did you find me?\" \"Oh I saw you, when you slept in the alley and I knew who you were, a mother always knows.\" She continued to smile, swaying from side to side as she stared off dreamily into the distance. \"And when you threw that boy, I knew you were your father's daughter as well. I knew you would know me, so I followed you.\" She then began to mutter under her breath, two words never fitting together as she spoke utter nonsense. I had no idea what was wrong with her, but my mom was seriously ill in the head. She needed a doctor to help find out exactly what was wrong so that we could get her better. She wasn't always like this, dad had said she had once been a CIA office girl. It was where they met. Once I had held her hands in the ice for a length of time, I inspected them, put some cream on them to help heal the burns then gingerly wrapped them up so that they wouldn't get infected. \"Here mom, how about you was and change into something?\" I suggested, guiding her over to the bathroom and frowned for a moment, trying to think of how to do this before helping her out of her clothes down to her underwear. She was thinner than I was, far more gaunt and bonier too. It was frightening, however I hid my reaction well and dampened a cloth with warm water then began to wash her body for her as she played with the water, flicking it about as she hummed under her breath. I didn't trust her to leave her alone, she might decide that she wanted to clean the floors again by flooding everything, or use the showerhead to wash down the walls. I lent her some of my clothes, fresh jeans, a new top and sweater before brushing her long, greying hair then plaited it for her. \"Are you hungry?\" I asked her and she nodded her head, so I made her some more food and ate something myself before taking her over to the bedroom, settled her down in the double bed then sat by her side as she closed her eyes. \"Tell me a story.\" She pleaded and I sighed before complying. \"Once upon a time there was a little boy named Jack, who lived on an old farm with his mother and his friend the cow, who he called Daisy.\" I started, not knowing what else to say. The lull of my mellow voice sent mom swiftly to sleep so I tucked her in again, left the door slightly ajar so that I could keep an ear out for her then went to the cupboard. I poured out the entire contents of a jar, wrapped it up in a cloth then smashed the pieces into shards, doing the same again with another jar of sauce that was way past its sell by date. Once I had my pieces I stepped outside the room and scattered them on the floor, turning off the lights so that they couldn't be seen. We were the top floor and there was no other lodger, so there was little chance of someone else coming up here unless they were coming to try and get me again. This time I was going to be better prepared. Returning to the rooms I loaded the guns and set them up in an orderly fashion, placing them in more convenient places like under the sofas, on top of books as they sat on the shelves, behind the counter and even in a vase which sat on the table. Once that was done I put together an emergency pack, placing money, a few mag, an extra gun, clothes, medical supplies and passports just in case. Setting this close beside me, I slipped into the bedroom and settled in the armchair, pulling a blanket over me then closed my eyes to sleep as my body desperately demanded it.[Chapter 10] You guys have no idea how much I love writing this story, I just love the Nat/Han pairing and I can't wait to get them interacting again! Hope you guys enjoy this next chapter and thanks for all the reviewing! Crunch. My eyes flew open and instantly I was up, taking a gun in hand then moved to stand where I was hidden but I could see the front door from the reflection off the window. The door rattled quietly as someone tried to open the door but it remained fast. Then I blinked. Oh crap, mom . What am I going to do? If she starts screaming then she'll alert everyone as to what was happening and give away my position. Quickly I moved over to her side and shook her awake, clamping my hand over her mouth as she whimpered. \"Mom, we're going to play a game. Want to play?\" I asked her and she nodded her head, sitting up with a smile. \"We're going to stay as silent as possible. The first person to speak loses, okay? No matter what happens, you have to stay silent .\" I emphasised and she nodded her head, clapping a hand to her mouth to assure me that she was already playing. I nodded my head to her then drew her to me, pushing her under the bed. \"Now stay here, the game starts right now.\" Once she was safely tucked away I moved back to my spot. Suddenly the door burst opened having been kicked in and I moved, the silencer on my gun already in place. I shot down three men as they shouldered their way inside but as a gun was lifted at me, I dived out of the way and crawled over to the kitchen as bullets sparked off the walls, wood thudding dully as it was cracked open by the quiet fire of the gun. Anyone below would just presume that it was rain and go back to sleep, however I wanted to know how they found me. This is a safe house, there was no way they could have found me unless someone had sold me out. Some stranger on the street, those homeless people, possibly even my mom but I doubted that. When I was settled I lifted my arm and shot, catching another man though I don't know where, all I heard was his yelp of pain before he collapsed onto the table and smashed it. So destructive, honestly. Were they seriously going to trash this place too? As I heard the gunfire stop and someone moved closer, I leaped over the counter and tackled them to the ground with a snarl. I punched them in the face then rolled forwards, smoothly rising to my feet then blocked a heavy swing with my hand, turning to use the momentum to flip the guy onto his back, his foot catching the stereo. Somehow, I have no idea how, he managed to click the play button and suddenly the room blasted with the music of 'Apple Bottom Jeans', making me flinch as it pounded in my ears but I soon found the rhythm and fought to it, striking hard and fast, paused, duck, got low then flipped backwards, throwing my opponent into the wall, collapsing a shelf of books and I quickly lunged for the gun, snatching it mid-air then backhanded it across his face. With powerful force I was grabbed and tackled to the ground painfully. A hand slapped me and my head wrenched to the side, causing me to whimper from the harsh blow but I quickly moved, getting free and twisting as I remained half in his grip to slam my brow against his. He growled from the blow as I leaped to my feet but he wrestled with me, managing to rip my long sleeved top at the back as he tried to grab me. His strength suddenly came into play and he lifted me up then tossed me back into an armchair, drawing a gun to aim at me as two others finally got their feet, cornering me. I panted for breath, staring at the barrel of the gun before moving. My leg rolled in an arc, foot swiping the gun away but before I could spring forwards there was a loud bang, barely masked by the blare of the music. My head snapped around to see a long coated figure standing in the doorway, wearing a cowboy hat and carried a toy pig under his other hand. Suddenly dad appeared, shooting the other two as Marvin blew the smoke from the tip of his revolver. Oh god, I'm saved! I'm safe! Dad's here! \"Baby!\" He gasped and I leaped up, springing into his arms and clutched him tightly as he sighed with relief, holding me close. Suddenly he pushed me away and was gripping my arms, assessing me as I smiled. \"I'm fine dad, honest. They have incredibly weak hands.\" I assured them then turned to Sarah as she rushed forwards. \"Sarah!\" \"Oh thank god you're okay!\" She breathed, hugging me tightly. \"Your dad was going insane with worry!\" I looked up and smiled as Marvin stepped forwards, patting me firmly on the back. \"Glad you're not dead.\" My eyes shifted to Victoria and Ivan, the latter of whom spread his hands up to the sky. \"Little mint cake! You're alive!\" He boomed and I pulled away from Sarah to embrace him and Victoria who brushed away her tears. \"Oh thank goodness, we were all so worried about you Natalia, your father was unable to stay calm.\" She said to me, combing her fingers through my hair and I sniffed. \"I knew you'd come for me.\" I murmured and she chuckled before pulling back but Ivan kept on holding me tightly. When he drew back he tapped my nose, dived a hand into his pocket then slipped a little chocolate mint cream into one of my pockets. \"Never to break tradition.\" He informed then stepped back. My eyes lifted to the door and I froze, staring at Han as he just stood there, watching me. \"Han.\" I breathed his name and stepped towards him but he quickly turned his face away, clenching his jaw so I stopped, frowning in confusion whilst flinching with hurt. Victoria stepped forwards and touched my shoulder, rubbing it gently as I lowered my head. Then I heard someone move behind us and my head shot up. \"Dad, I'd prepare yourself if I were you.\" I warned him then opened the bedroom door. Mom stood there, tilting her head curiously up at me then beamed, clapping her hands as she jumped on the spot. \"I won! I won!\" She laughed at me then frowned at everyone else as dad's jaw dropped practically to the ground. \"Rosella?\" Mom smiled cheerfully. \"Yes! That's my name. Rather pretty isn't it?\" She flipped back her braid then wrapped her arms around me, snuggling close and I couldn't help but put one arm around her. \"What…what are you doing here?\" Dad demanded, gobsmacked to say the least. He'd been looking for her for a very long time, even since he'd long given up he hadn't stopped, constantly watching out for her as he felt guilty about her leaving. Dad had tried to find her to make sure she was safe but she had simply disappeared. \"She found me, dad, on the streets.\" I answered for her as mom began to purr like a cat, rubbing her cheek into my neck as I swallowed, unsure of what to do so I led her over to the sofa and sat her down, ignoring the fact that it was pretty beat up by bullets. \"But…\" Sarah frowned. \"Who is she?\" She asked Victoria who was also staring in shock. \"Francis's ex-wife.\" Victoria whispered back. \"She left them both when Natalia was very young, she's not completely right in the head. Think of Doctor Baily only a little more permanent.\" Sarah nodded her head then slowly moved forwards, sitting beside my mom then touched her arm. \"Hey, I'm Sarah.\" Mom suddenly frowned at Sarah and I quickly saw the darkened look in her eye and how she tensed, glancing between Sarah and dad. He must have seen it too as he was suddenly lunging forwards. I grabbed mom's arms and pinned them behind her as she yelled and lunged for Sarah, baring her teeth and trying to attack. Dad swiftly pulled Sarah out the way and restrained mom's legs as she howled, suddenly writhing like a snake and twisting her face into a hideous snarl as I shifted beneath her, wrapping my legs over her torso to pin her down. \"Okay, okay…\" I sighed, closing my eyes as I used all my strength to pin mom down so that she wouldn't go for Sarah. \"You're okay, just calm down.\" \"Marvin, get something to knock her out.\" Dad ordered, jerking his chin towards the medical cupboard so Marvin quickly went to find something to sedate mom with. \"You bitch! I'll kill you! He's my husband! You've been cheating on me Frank! Adulteress!\" Mom screeched at them both but when I placed a hand over her mouth she clamped her teeth down and I yelped in pain as she drew blood, digging in her teeth and refused to let go. \"Let go!\" I practically screamed, twisting as my eyes filled with tears of pain and hurt, both internally and outwardly. \"Marvin!\" Dad shouted and Sarah stood beside Victoria, watching with horror as Marvin ran back and quickly placed the needle into mom's arm which I struggled to keep still. \"Mom let go! You're hurting me!\" I begged, my hand trembling as Han suddenly appeared by my side and gripped my mom's jaw, forcing her mouth to open then grabbed my hand, wrapping it in a cloth before crouching beside me, one arm around me as I leaned into him, crying silently. He was so warm, it was an immense comfort to have him close to me again, his face pressing against mine as he gripped my hand tightly and stemming the blood flow as mom slowly stopped writhing, falling to simple twitches before finally falling asleep. \"Baby?\" \"I'm okay.\" I croaked to him, giving a tiny nod of my head before turning to rest my forehead against Han's shoulder. His arm drew me closer as dad lifted mom and carried her back to bed to let her sleep. Han pulled me into his arms and lifted me up, carrying me to the sink where the ice still remained, though slightly melted. I reached forwards and turned on the tap, pulling off the cloth and began to see to the bite marks as Han moved back, helping Marvin and Ivan stow away the bodies for now as Victoria switched on the lights. \"How did they find you?\" She asked but I shook my head. \"I don't know, I thought I was clean. No one followed me save for mom. They couldn't have known about this place, could they?\" Dad entered and shook his head. \"No, this place is tight.\" He stopped at my side and looked at my hand with me. \"It's going to need stitching.\" \"I'll do it.\" I nodded my head then sighed, lifting my other hand to pinch the bridge of my nose. \"This is hell, dad. You should see the operation they're running. I found some of their cargo, it was C4.\" His head snapped up. \"Enough to blow a bank and more. There's a big deal going down and I'm not liking the look of it. Dad, they sell to terrorists, they're going to do a lot of damage unless we stop them.\" \"Baby, I just want to get you home.\" Dad murmured to me softly. \"You've been through hell, we can leave this to someone else.\" \"No! Those jackasses kidnapped me and I want to know what they're up to.\" I growled, grabbing the medical kit and began to thread a needle. \"They're dangerous and I want to remove them.\" \"This isn't what you're meant for, Natalia, you're not fully trained to do this sort of thing.\" I looked up at dad winsomely. \"But you are.\" He groaned, rubbing his face in one hand. \"I hate it when you pull that look at me.\" I smiled softly then kissed his face, leaning into him briefly before focusing on my task. \"We'll take a further look into them. Sarah managed to swipe some reports about a deal between some old friends of mine and Victoria is close to finding out exactly who and where they are.\" There was a sudden beeping and I looked over to the software. \"So am I apparently.\" I mused, taking the kit over to the computer screens with me as everyone crowded around. I searched through their files then selected one. Detailed plans came up, focusing on Hoover Dam and the points at weak the structure was weakest, mostly at the top but there were also plans laid out to blow it from the bottom. My eyes widened. \"Those little…\" I held my tongue then searched through the other files. Empire state building, Statue of Liberty, Golden Gate Bridge, Brooklyn Bridge, the Whitehouse and CIA headquarters. \"They're not selling, they're going to use those damn explosives!\" \"Your country seems to be in a little bit of trouble.\" Ivan mused and Victoria slapped his arm lightly. \"We have to alert authorities.\" We all looked to one another then fixed on dad, who sighed. \"Alright, I'll give them a call.\" Just then Han's phone rang. He growled and answered it, narrowing his eyes dangerously. \"What do you want, Medina?\" He demanded and I could hear the reply. \"Aren't you eager to get your girl back?\" Han opened his mouth but I spun around in the chair and kicked him, shooting him a pointed look then gave a small nod of my head. His eyes left mine as he then answered. \"Yes.\" \"Well then, how about we do an exchange? We'll drop the girl off somewhere if you hand yourself over.\" I had been quickly scribbling on a notepad and once I was finished, I lifted it up and showed Han who read it quickly. \"No, we'll do this properly. You'll hand her over to her family with me there. Once she's safe, I'm all yours.\" His tone was bitter and cold so I went to reach out to touch his shoulder but he shrugged me off, stepping away. My eyes darted to Sarah who bit her lip then took my arm in her hands, giving me a brave smile then rubbed my back as Victoria did the same. Han looked to dad for a moment then hung up. \"He'll give us a time and place.\" He informed then shot me a look. \"What are you planning?\" I bristled against him, narrowing my eyes. \"We'll catch him.\" I answered simply. \"We'll catch him and then either hand him over to the CIA or just shoot him. Preferably the latter but now that I have dad watching, I'm going to be under orders.\" I glanced to dad then turned around, facing the screen. \"If we can distract him long enough, we can disarm any bombs he's put into place, take over his hoards and bring him down once and for all.\" Victoria rested her hand on my shoulder and I looked up at her. \"Nat, have you been tagged?\" I blinked at her then frowned. \"I…I don't know.\" Marvin stepped forwards, holding a weird little contraption that he'd obviously built himself then waited for me to stand before waving it over my body. When I turned however, the two prongs stretched forwards and it whirred at us, flashing red as Marvin stopped at my left shoulder. \"Yup, you're bugged.\" He growled and dad instantly stepped in the way to shield me. Now I was beginning to panic. \"Get it out! Take it out of me!\" Dad caught my hands and brought me to him. \"Okay, just stay calm. We're getting out of here. Victoria, download those files, Sarah, grab anything that we might need, Marvin, Ivan, ammunition, Han?\" Dad's eyes narrowed sharply. \"Just stay away from her.\" Her being me. \"Dad…\" I began but he cut me off with a sharp look then led me forwards. \"I want you to…uh…look after your mother for the moment.\" He frowned, unsure of what to do. \"We'll um, find her someplace to stay once we get that chip out of you.\" Marvin approached with a knife. \"I can get it…\" \"No!\" We both growled at him and he lifted his hands in surrender. \"Just offering.\" I whimpered and looked over my shoulder. \"Damn those jerks. I swear I'm going to kill them for this.\" Victoria approached with a scalpel, swabs and medical scissors. \"Sorry sweetheart, but that thing needs to come out.\" Nodding my head I sighed then went over to the couch, sitting down then reached for my shirt but I paused, looking to the boys. \"You guys might want to turn around.\" I advised and they all instantly spun around, facing their backs to me. I took off my top and both Victoria and Sarah gasped. \"Nat! You're…you're hurt bad .\" Sarah gaped at me, touching a bruise and I twitched as it throbbed tenderly. \"What? What's wrong?\" Dad demanded but stopped himself from turning around. \"Nothing.\" I shot a look to Victoria and Sarah to keep quiet and they glanced to one another before nodding. I lay on my back and gripped Sarah's hand as Victoria slowly cut a line into my back. Hissing sharply I then grit my teeth, relaxing into the sting as Victoria opened up a little cut, deepened it then searched for the chip. \"Got it.\" She announced victoriously, drawing it from me then quickly sealed up the cut. \"Brave girl.\" She murmured to me and I gave a weak smile, struggling to keep my eyes open. \"We'll get moving now. Come on, shirt on.\" I obeyed then got up, shrugging into a jacket then looked over to the bedroom where mom slept. \"I'll carry her.\" Dad murmured to me. \"Keep close to Sarah.\" \"Aye, aye captain.\" I answered sleepily, though if we were attacked I doubted I would be much use in protecting Sarah. I'd stand in the way but that would be it, I had no energy to fight. Sarah slipped her arms around me, helping me to stumble over to the broken door and we made our way to the stairs, Marvin checking to make sure the coast was clear. \"We'll take my other car, it'll fit all of us inside.\" Dad said, stepping forwards and holding a sleeping mom in his arms, trying to fish for his keys. He brought out the thick bundle then headed over to the garages out back, telling us to wait in the shadows. I yawned sleepily then rested my head on Sarah's shoulder, though I kept on glancing over to Han. \"What's happened between you two?\" Sarah whispered to me. \"He told us about the argument, must have been pretty bad.\" \"Yeah, you could say that.\" I muttered bitterly. \"I think he may have misinterpreted it as an end to us.\" Her eyes darted to me. \"What?\" She yelped but quickly quietened down when everyone frowned at her. \"What? But he's been worried sick about you! More so than your dad.\" I gave a weak smile. \"I'll talk to him later. Right now I'm too tired to even think.\" That's when I collapsed onto Sarah, who instantly hissed for someone to lift me up. I had no idea who caught me, but I was vaguely aware of someone carrying me over to the car as dad pulled up in front of us. After that, it was pretty much blackness and silence.[Chapter 11] This is kind of a long chapter because you know, I couldn't really find any place to cut it. So here it is! Hope you all enjoy. I was thinking with this one, hey, we've had a new face, how about we pull in someone old? Hope you guys like this new little twist I put in ;) (Oh and there will be an extra twist, hope you all don't get mad!) We were still driving when I awoke though it was light, which meant it was around eight or nine in the morning. Dad looked back at me. \"You okay baby?\" \"Fantastic.\" I muttered, rubbing my head. \"I am in desperate need of sugar, however.\" Sarah held out her packet of mints and I took one with a grateful smile to her. It'll do for now. \"So what's happened?\" \"You slept.\" Marvin answered. \"Han got a call from that Medina brother and we've been given a time and place for the apparent 'handover', it's close to one of his factories.\" He was still clutching onto the pig, hugging it tightly as Victoria leaned against Ivan, who had his arms curled around her in the back with Han next to them. My stomach twisted uncomfortably and I wriggled slightly in my seat, biting my lips together then looked at the seat in front of me to see mom still completely knocked out. \"How much did you give her Marv?\" I frowned at him and he shrugged. \"Enough to knock out a bull.\" He answered and I groaned before reaching forwards and checking her pulse, which was fine so I drew back. \"What's next Frank?\" Sarah asked. \"We'll set up in a hotel which is close to the factory, I've called up an old friend who said he'd help us. He's going to meet us there.\" He glanced around the road before signalling to turn off the highway. \"We're going to work together to sort out this mess.\" \"Sweet. Do I get to shoot some people?\" Dad shot me a look. \"You are going home the moment I can put you on a flight and you are going to stay there with Sarah until we get back.\" I narrowed my eyes. \"Oh hell no.\" \"I agree!\" Sarah concurred, pouting at dad who ignored us. \"Francis you can't cut them out of this.\" Victoria said and Ivan chuckled. \"They will only make their way back here the moment you turn around.\" He agreed, nuzzling Victoria who gave a little laugh and an adoring smile to Ivan who grinned happily. \"Let them stay, after all, love is the best healer in the world and Natalia is gravely wounded. Let her stay so that we can help heal her faster.\" \"Yes! Thank you Uncle Ivan.\" I mumbled through my chocolate mint that I had just remembered was in my pocket. \"See? I need to stay here so that I can get some T-L-C. That's 'tender loving care', dad, in case you didn't know.\" Dad rolled his eyes. \"You getting more hurt is not going to help to fix you up.\" \"You're not going to change my mind, dad. Sarah and I are staying and that is final .\" I emphasised and Sarah smirked smugly, shifting closer to me. \"Don't argue with women, Frank, you'll never win.\" Marvin advised helpfully and I tossed him a grin then glanced over my shoulder to Han who was glaring out the window. Biting my lower lip I sighed then turned away. Dad pulled up outside a hotel and got out, looking around until a figure stepped forwards, wearing a black coat and an amused look on his face. \"Moses.\" He nodded his head and dad laughed. \"Cooper. Good to see you again.\" They clapped hands and, me being impatient, I got out the car along with the others and walked up to dad. The handsome looking man turned his eyes to me, dark hair neatly cropped and his face clean shaven. He was tall and well-proportioned and he held himself with pride. \"Natalia Sophie Francesca Moses. I hear good things about you.\" Cooper greeted me with a nod. \"It's a shame you never applied for a position at the CIA, we could use with a few more agents like you.\" \"Over my dead body.\" Dad said, placing a protective arm around me. \"You wouldn't happen to be the William Cooper who tried to kill my dad five years ago, would you?\" I questioned and Copper smirked a little. \"Good times.\" He inclined his head towards the hotel. \"Rooms have already been checked out for you all, Frank, we'll need the information.\" \"Right here.\" Victoria answered, lifting a pen drive but pulled it back when someone moved to take it. \"And it'll stay here for the moment thank you very much.\" She strode forwards, giving a nod to Cooper as she passed, heading into the hotel with Ivan chuckling after her. I grinned. \"That means we're not being shut out from the planning.\" I translated then looked to Sarah as she joined my side. \"Right Sarah?\" \"Absolutely.\" She agreed then looked down to her rumbling stomach. \"Are they still serving food in the kitchens?\" Dad led her away to order some food and I made to follow, mom now gripping onto me but Cooper caught my arm. \"You did well to get out of there alive. Others haven't been so lucky. I lost a good man by sending him into the Medina brothers' corporation.\" My smile slipped slightly. \"I'm sorry.\" I told him sincerely and he nodded his head gratefully. \"Would you consider applying?\" I glanced over to where my dad had disappeared then shrugged. \"I don't know. I'm not really good at much else. Maybe.\" Letting me go he turned and murmured something to one of his agents then nodded to me. \"Agent Roose will take care of your mother. As I understand it, she needs serious medical attention.\" I sighed with relief, though I felt guilty at being so relieved to hand her over into the care of someone else. \"Perhaps I should stay with her…?\" I looked to Cooper who shook his head, smiling kindly to me. \"She will be well looked after, don't worry.\" Looking to mom I gave her a gentle nudge. \"Hey.\" She stopped her murmurings and looked up at me, blinking. \"Would you like to go with the nice man over there?\" I asked but she shook her head, clinging onto me desperately and I grunted, flinching as she put pressure on one of my many injuries. Noticing my little flinch, Cooper stepped forwards and turned to mom. \"Good evening ma'am. I'm William Cooper, head of the CIA. Would you like to come with me? I have some friends who would like to meet you.\" Charmed by his good looks, mom slowly began to let me go. \"That's it, come on.\" He encouraged and mom looked at me, so I nodded my head. \"It's alright. They're going to make you feel better, mom.\" I promised her so mom wrapped her arms around Cooper and he began to lead her away. I turned to head inside but stopped when he called after me. \"We'll be meeting in ten minutes. Make sure you get your little family together. Frank knows where to go.\" Nodding my head I turned and walked inside. Instinctively I looked around me, staring at the architecture with wonder as the beautiful leaved designs rose in the corners, pillars rising up to the ceiling as the plush red carpet shone on the mirrors above. Turning a full circle I couldn't help but smile as I looked around me, drinking in everything until I heard someone address me. \"Ma'am, your room.\" I looked to the woman who held up a key and I took it with a grateful smile. \"Thanks.\" I said to her then looked at the number. Looks like the elevator was necessary. I am not climbing six flights of stairs when I still like I had just got run over by a truck. Several times. I stepped into the elevator then turned, looking down at my nails as I fidgeted, unable to keep still. Just before the doors slid shut a hand darted out to catch them but when Han stepped forwards and saw me, he froze in place before taking a step back. \"I'll take another.\" He muttered but I arched an eyebrow at him. \"My ass is not that big. There's room for at least one more.\" I told him sharply then jerked my head back. \"Get in.\" He slowly inched forwards before taking the step inside then looked to the buttons but didn't touch one. Apparently he was on the same floor as me. He turned his back to me which allowed me the perfect opportunity to study him. He was tense, frozen like a stone statue though his head was slightly turned towards me. \"Han.\" I ground out, quickly becoming irritated with him. \"Talk to me.\" \"What do you want me to say?\" He asked, turning his head a little further and I sighed, slumping against the side. \"Anything.\" I admitted simply but he said nothing more so I decided to lead the conversation. \"Those things I said, I never meant them.\" \"You did.\" Fair point. I meant some of them but not all of them, some of the things that I had thrown at him I wished I could take back and lock them away in my mouth. \"Well maybe, but not all of them. Especially the last thing I said, I never wanted you to leave.\" His shoulders tensed sharply so I exhaled and rubbed my temples. \"Now what is it?\" He did not answer. \"Han, answer me. What is wrong?\" Slowly he turned around to face me and when my eyes met his, I was shocked to find ghostly tears residing there, his brow creased as he struggled to hold them back. His hand raised up and brushed lightly against my face and then I understood. \"I struck you.\" \"You didn't mean to.\" I murmured, moving closer but he instantly snatched back his hand and took a step back. \"Han, you reacted on instinct. You were in a defensive mind set and I was stupid for not being more careful, for not keeping my temper under control.\" This time I stepped up to him until he was backed into the side, trapping him there so that he couldn't escape me. \"I don't blame you for what happened.\" \"Natalia…\" A shiver ran down my spine. \"It is too dangerous. I should never have allowed this to become so serious.\" I pulled back slightly at his words, frowning. \"You being close to me is only putting you in harm's way. I never…I never meant for us to go so far.\" My temper spiked but I fought to keep my voice level and even. \"What do you mean?\" I asked him coldly, narrowing my eyes. \"Ordinarily you would have dated me for a few weeks, had your way then left?\" He flinched then looked away. Oh that son of a bitch, that absolute…jackass! \"I can't believe you!\" I fumed, taking a large step back from him and he drew himself up slightly. \"So what, you enjoyed me too much and decided that you wanted more? You…\" I couldn't even find a word to describe him. \"You used me?\" He fixed his eyes on me but did not say a word, allowing me to come to my own conclusions. I wanted to strangle him but I clenched my twitching fingers into fists to avoid such a situation. Lifting my head high I did my best not to tremble, though I suddenly felt exceptionally calm. It was strange, I thought I would be furious, angry from the depths of my body until I exploded into a raging inferno. Nope. I was perfectly serene, which considering, is probably more dangerous seeing as I could think perfectly clearly, making me more lethal than if I were in a temper. When the door opened I spun around and left, striding forwards as I checked the numbers on the doors and did not stop until I had reached my own. Han entered his room, directly opposite mine. Damn him to hell, how…how dare he use me like that? \"More fool you, Nat, you should've just listened to dad in the first place.\" I muttered to myself as I kicked the door shut then went to freshen up, checking my injuries also. There was a knock on my door and I opened it to find dad and Sarah there, waiting. When they saw the tears in my eyes, red and puffy and my trembling lip, their faces dropped instantly. \"What happened?\" I turned and walked away, allowing them to enter at their own leisure. \"You won't have to worry about boyfriends anymore, dad. I refuse to date ever again. All men are assholes, liars, cheats and unreliable unless they're family.\" I told him, wiping my eyes as Sarah slowly approached me. \"Nat, what happened?\" She asked me gently and I cracked slightly, turning to face her as I stood by the window, drawing the curtains. \"He said he hadn't meant for us to get so serious.\" I whispered and Sarah gave dad an alarmed look. \"Sarah…I really loved him.\" \"Okay, okay.\" Sarah murmured as I collapsed to my knees, shaking as tears rolled down my face. Her arms enveloped me and I leaned into her as she hushed and rubbed my back. \"It's going to be fine, you'll see. Maybe he just needs some time to think?\" I lifted my face, tight lipped then shook my head. \"He made his feelings perfectly clear.\" I answered then fought to pull myself together but I just couldn't do it. Dad approached me slowly, slightly hesitant and at a loss for words, unsure of what to do so I just reached out and he sighed, glad that I had given him the opening. He pulled me and Sarah into his arms, rocking gently until I was calmed. \"You deserve better than him anyway.\" Dad whispered to me and I chocked on a laugh. \"No, not really.\" I gave a pathetic little shrug. \"But thanks for trying.\" Dad smiled warmly down at me then stood up, helping Sarah to her feet as he held me in his arms like I were a little girl again. \"You okay to come down?\" I nodded my head. \"Give me a few minutes.\" I murmured then walked back to my bathroom, gripping the sink then leaned forwards, hanging my head as I fought to regain control. I shouldn't be crying, men were not worth crying over. Splashing my face with cold water I made myself presentable before following dad and Sarah down to the conference room, which was heavily guarded by CIA agents. Dad pulled out a chair and stood behind it as Sarah sat down, her little tag flashing in the light as she shot my dad a smile whilst I took the seat on her other side. \"Ah! Little mint cake. Are you feeling alright? You look pale.\" Ivan asked as he politely held the chair for Victoria who sat on my other side. \"Yeah I'm good.\" I nodded my head though I tasted the foulness of my lie like bile. Nodding his head Ivan shot me a worried look but said nothing more. Victoria gave me a warm smile then reached under the table, squeezing my hand softly. Marvin fidgeted uncomfortably, still holding the pig to his chest whilst glaring suspiciously at the agents around him. Cooper sat down opposite dad then nodded to Victoria. \"The plans?\" She slid the pen across the table and he took it, slid it into a computer which then projected the images as a tech guy flicked through the files. Cooper's eyes widened. \"Damn.\" He murmured then faced my dad. \"You really know how to draw attention to yourself.\" \"It's a gift.\" He answered simply, shrugging and I hid a weak smirk behind my hand, looking down and away as Han shifted in his seat. \"They are setting the bombs in place tomorrow.\" He said to them. \"They are to be detonated at noon, when the handover is meant to take place.\" I shifted in my seat, wondering what sort of crazy plan they would come up with to sort this mess out. \"Do we know how they plan to detonate?\" Cooper asked and this time, Victoria spoke up. \"It's the typical countdown and blow things up to kingdom come.\" She answered. \"They haven't made an exact plan of how things are going to work in these files, they're too smart for that however they do have a few reports on how test runs have gone using fuses, terminal switches and they have even considered suicides to set them off instantaneously. However, I am fairly certain that they will simply go with the more reliable method of clock countdowns.\" She looked over to Marvin who simply gave a nod of his head. \"Shouldn't be too hard to disarm.\" He answered. \"Easier than red mercury, anyway.\" I spluttered on my laughter, snorting slightly as I smirked before clearing my throat and giving an apologetic smile to everyone. \"We could send men into the building and stop them from getting in in the first place.\" One agent suggested but Cooper frowned. \"But that would only force them to back off and return at a later date, besides they could slip through our nets and go ahead with everything regardless.\" Cooper replied then glanced around to dad. \"What do you think?\" \"Undercover.\" He answered simply. \"Have cameras everywhere and bomb disarming units close by to each target.\" A few discussions broke out and I leaned back in my chair, wincing slightly as my side gave a twinge but ignored the stinging sensation further. Without warning the door burst open and several of us were on our feet aiming a gun at the person, woman, who walked in. \"Stand down.\" Cooper ordered so we lowered our weapons. Han, however, remained standing. \"Kin?\" He blinked in surprised as the small and incredibly thin Asian woman smiled and strode right up to Han. \"Hello handsome.\" She greeted, grabbed his jacket then kissed him firmly. My jaw dropped and Victoria made a very bland laugh before looking at me, waiting to see my reaction which she probably expected to be me going over there and pounding that Asian chick's ass. Quickly I snapped my mouth shut and looked away. Great, this is most definitely my kind of day. The woman, Kin, pulled back from her pretty intense kiss with Han then smirked. \"I missed you.\" She whispered then smiled to Cooper. \"Am I late?\" Is anyone else getting a sense of déjà vu? \"No, just in time. Everyone, this is agent Kin on loan to us from Japan for training. She is a specialist in undercover operations, target infiltrating and one of the best classic martial artists around.\" He introduced and she giggled, taking the chair behind Han who was still blinking like an idiot. Rolling my eyes I picked up a pear from the bowl of fruit just before us and flung it at him. When it hit him square on the head he jerked then turned around. \"Whenever you're ready to return to the land of the living.\" I drawled then looked across to Cooper. \"You said you could disarm the bombs, but what about Ricardo Medina?\" \"And Manuel.\" Dad added but I bit my lip and blushed. \"Yeah…about that. I may have already killed him.\" Dad shot me a surprised look as everyone else turned to stare at me. I sucked on my lower lip nervously then shrugged. \"What? He was going to beat me up with a plank of wood with a nail in it!\" Suddenly dad leaped to his feet. \"What?\" He practically yelled and I cursed. \"Way to go Nat. Dad? Sit down.\" But he was already pacing. \"This is exactly why I didn't want you anywhere near this sort of situation! He roped you into this and you almost died because of it!\" Dad turned and went to leap across the table to strangle Han and was about halfway there when I lunged forwards, grabbed his ankles and yanked him back. \"Dad! You are being a damn pain in my ass! Now sit down!\" I grabbed his jacket and smartly whirled him around, placing a firm hand on his shoulder and shoved him down into his seat. Kin giggled. \"A daddy's girl are you?\" She questioned with a pretty smile but I shot her a dark look. \"And you can shut up, before I smack that pretty little smile off your face.\" Her lips dropped and she narrowed her eyes at me, her perfectly straight hair pulled back into a ponytail as her red painted lips thinned dramatically. I was smug inside. \"Manuel is gone, period, I shot him through the chest and unless he's a miracle walking, then I'm pretty sure he's out of our way. Ricardo, however, is still a problem. He has the run and control of tonnes of drugs, which he sells to traffickers, other drug lords and whatnot, however we know exactly where he's going to be at a specific time and place.\" I folded my arms across my chest. \"I say we take him then.\" \"You are staying out of…\" I clamped a hand over my dad's mouth to keep him quiet and Sarah laughed. \"Do you think he'd really show up?\" Cooper asked me, having the time of his life watching me put dad in his place. \"He wants that jerk over there stone dead, so yeah, I'd say he'd turn up to see that the job is done. He's an arrogant prick like that.\" Cooper smirked with amusement as I continued to stop dad from talking though he was still gurgling into my hand. \"If not then I could always get captured again and then kill him. Since I've killed his brother, he'll probably want my head more than his.\" I jerked my head towards Han who watched me with an unreadable expression. The jackass still had red lipstick on his face. He should really wipe that off because he looked ridiculous. \"No, you are not-\" My hand clamped back down on dad's mouth and he glared up at me so I gave him a false grin. \"What can I say? I'm your kid.\" Cooper chuckled. \"We will do our best to avoid that option.\" Kin smirked over at me, arching a perfectly plucked and threaded eyebrow. Damn, why was she so gorgeous? Totally unfair. If she's my rival then could she have at least have a spot or freckles or something! Not simply a woman with flawless skin, pristine hair, beautifully dark eyes and an altogether too attractive. I must look like a harpy next to her, seeing as I'm so beat up. I bet she does kung-fu too, just brilliant. Classic martial artist, I remember now. \"Maybe we should just send the girl over there in alone? She'll certainly knock them dead with her appalling mannerisms.\" I considered simply shooting her in the head, but that would give me a bad report so I refrained from jumping for my gun. \"Or maybe we could just throw you out the window? At least I could get some flipping peace!\" I retorted easily. Cooper sighed and was about to say something when Ivan stood up. \"In Russia, we dealt with situation very similar, minus the captivity of a beloved one.\" He gestured to me and I threw him a bright smile as he winked. \"We first burned out their bank, leaving them with nothing then blew up their entire fortress of weapons supplies.\" He gave a little shrug before sitting down again. \"Thought I might throw in a suggestion.\" There was some more arguing and dad went over to Cooper, drawing up plans on a map and the endless droning until I was practically asleep in my chair. \"I think we had better leave them to it.\" Victoria whispered to me and I yelped, jerking awake and she blinked at me as I grabbed onto the table to stop myself from falling backwards. Kin smirked and rolled her eyes before muttering rather loudly. \"Clumsy child.\" Oh I so wanted to claw her eyes out. \"Alright Aunty Vic.\" I nodded my head then touched Sarah's shoulder as I stood, rubbing my eyes. Sarah snorted unattractively as she woke, cutting off her snore as she grumbled. \"What now? Are we being shot at?\" \"Not yet. Wait until tomorrow.\" I answered, hoisting her up. \"Then we'll have a fantastic array of bullets hurtling into our asses. Come on.\" Sarah allowed me to guide her and Victoria walked beside us, clicking her fingers one by one. \"So tell me dear, what is going on with you and Han? I rather expected you to simply shoot that little minx right there and then.\" Tempting but no. \"It's no longer my concern who Han kisses.\" I answered with a shrug, supporting Sarah's weight as she was still yet to fully come around. \"But darling, you two are obviously mad for one another.\" \"I'm mad at him. There's a little difference.\" Sighing softly I shook my head. \"Last time I saw him, we argued and it got a little out of hand. We had a bit of a fight but when I had calmed down, I tried to grab his arm to get him to turn but he hit me, purely out of reflex.\" I quickly put in as Sarah gasped loudly. Victoria didn't seem surprised. \"Yes, he'd mentioned that to me earlier on. I just don't think you should give up on him, Natalia.\" I shook my head. \"Why? He admitted himself that all he wanted was a casual relationship but he mistakenly allowed it to get out of hand. Why should I bother when he turned out to be exactly like all the other jerks that I've ever dated?\" Victoria placed a warm hand on my arm as we stepped into the elevator. \"Darling, I talked with Han and believe me, he was distraught. I tell no word of a lie but there were tears in his eyes though he didn't let them spill.\" I frowned at her as Sarah pushed the buttons for our floors. \"He's completely fallen for you, which is probably what has frightened him, Natalia. Haven't you considered that he may have said those things just to put you a safe distance away from him?\" Though I went to reply I paused. No, I hadn't. So wait, what the hell am I supposed to think now? \"You can't just let go of what you have with Han, Nat. You two were made for one another, completely and irreversibly, even if some Asian tramp that decides to walk in and…\" The doors slid back open and Kin stood there, beaming prettily at us. \"Mind if I join you?\" She asked then stepped inside, turning her back to us all. \"Floor two.\" I arched an eyebrow. \"Do we look like porters to you?\" She turned her head and gave me a sickly smile. \"Do you really wish for me to answer?\" Victoria had to grab my wrist and dig in her nails to keep me from moving. Her accented voice irritated me. It was like that of a young girl, too proud and up on her high horse to be compatible with us lowly human beings. I hope her horse rears and she falls flat on her ass. There was a moment of silence before Sarah bravely questioned the young girl. \"How do you know Han so…well?\" She asked with a glance to me. Kin smirked then turned around, her ponytail flying out and flicking me in the face. I held back a growl. \"We met when we both went to train with monks in Japan. He got to know me very well.\" I did not want to particularly know the details of this meeting. \"We were together for a few months but then it ended when things got a little too serious, though I would happily go back to him.\" Her eyes were fixed on me the whole time. \"It's so unpleasant, being away from a man such as Han, isn't it? Makes you feel unworthy of him when he disposes of you.\" That coy little snake. She's treading dangerous ground. However I kept my cool and arched an eyebrow. \"What exactly are you insinuating?\" I questioned and her sly smirk grew a little further, the tiny dimples on her cheeks darkening. \"Things have been heating up between Han and I for a few weeks now, I do not think it will be long until we are back together.\" She reached forwards and patted my shoulder, giving me a false sympathetic look. \"Don't worry, I am sure he will forget about you very soon. I'll help him.\" When the doors opened, she gave a little grin. \"I am glad I met you all. Goodnight!\" She trilled then flounced away. I paused before bolting to go after her but Victoria smartly gripped me under my arms and hauled me back. \"Let me at her, let me at her!\" \"Natalia, it's what she wants. She wants to make you look bad in front of Han. Don't stoop to her level, alright? There now darling, just calm down a little.\" I took deep breaths as Victoria continued to restrain me and she didn't let go until the doors were shut and we were moving again. \"I hate her. I actually hate that stupid little…please can I just go and shoot her?\" \"No.\" Victoria told me sternly and I pouted. \"Not even a flesh wound?\" She gave me a hard glare so I sighed then slouched back against the wall. \"Well, I told you Han wasn't worth it.\" They both looked at me, alarmed. \"We only separated the other day. Apparently he's been seeing her for weeks.\" The door opened and Victoria hesitated to step out. \"Sweetie, do you need to talk some more?\" I shook my head but Sarah placed a hand on my shoulder and rubbed gently. \"I got it.\" She said softly to Victoria who nodded then let us have our privacy. \"So, Nat, what are you going to do?\" I gave a weak shrug. \"Get over it. I should have learned my lesson by now. I was…stupid to think Han would be different.\" Sarah rolled her eyes. \"You really going to let that jerk of a child get you down? Come on Nat, think of all the times you and Han were out together. All those dinners, the walks, the park concert, ice skating, you remember he took you that one time to the ice rink? Last Christmas?\" Yeah, I remember. I don't think I'll ever forget the look on his face when I told him that all I wanted to do was go ice skating. \"And what about that time you two went to the Statue of Liberty and he danced with you for the first time?\" Yup, remembered that too. Han was a good dance partner and he had given me his coat when I got a little cold. \"Are you really that willing to just give up on him?\" \"I don't know, Sarah. I really don't know. Maybe I just need to sleep on it. Things will be clearer in the morning, after the debrief and go time and if I'm still alive afterwards, I'll try and talk with Han again.\" Satisfied, Sarah beamed at me then got out at her floor, leaving me alone. I sighed, closing my eyes as the doors slid closed but opened them when I heard someone slip through. Before I could even look, I had been spun around and there was a cord at my throat, choking me as a man hissed in my ear. \"Ricardo Medina sends his greetings.\" Damn that jackass! I struggled, gasping as I tried to breathe then narrowed my eyes. Without warning I lashed out and slammed my feet into the side of the elevator, forcing him back and he struck the opposite wall heavily, winding him and the sudden slackness around my neck allowed me to twist around, grip his hands then force the cord around his own throat, holding it tight before tying it off. He chocked, clawing at his neck as I then turned and swiped my foot into his head, knocking him out clean then left him twitching. \"Don't mess with me, peasant.\" I rasped, clutching my throat as the doors opened at my floor. I was shocked to find Han there, walking past but he stopped and glanced at me but when he saw the figure laying at my feet, he whirled around. \"What happened?\" I ignored his question and pushed past him, stumbling to my door and let myself in. Behind me I heard Han using his ear piece and tagged microphone to call Cooper to dispose of the body before he followed me. Saying nothing I quickly glanced over my throat, seeing that there was an angry red line before striding over to the drawer at the bedside where apparently a gun had been left for me. I took it then made sure it was fully loaded before tucking it into my jeans. \"Natalia, what are you doing?\" I couldn't talk to him right now, he was the last person that I wanted to see but as I headed towards the door, he grabbed my arm and spun me around, though I instantly tried to circle it to break free however Han crushed me against the wall and pinned both hands over my head, glaring down at me. \"I said, what are you doing?\" \"Nothing that concerns you, however, if you really must know, I'm going to check on my mother.\" I hissed then jerked my knee forwards but he smartly blocked the attack with one hand. With my arm and hand now free, I slammed my brow against his then turned him around, throwing him to the ground but he rolled with me, landing me down on the ground then straddled my waist with his knees, keeping a firm grip on me as I slowly arched an eyebrow. \"Well this feels familiar.\" He blinked at me so I quickly shoved him off then got to my feet. \"Natalia, we need to get you away from here.\" Han murmured, reaching out to touch my arm but I shoved him off. \"I'll go with Cooper and dad in a moment, just as soon as I've made sure my mom is okay.\" I spun on my heel and made to leave but I stopped at the door, sighing before speaking though I did not turn to face him. \"You know, I thought I could trust you.\" I sensed his confusion but ignored it. \"But apparently, you're just as bad as those college boys. Everyone I know seems to be the same, from you to my mom and even to my dad at times. Unreliable, abandoning and apparently uncaring.\" I could not turn to face him as then he would see how much he had hurt me and I could not allow that. \"I thought that you'd be different. Guess I'm still just a naïve girl with her head in the clouds. I hope you're happy with that Asian child, seeing as she's already convinced that you two are back together.\" \"Nat wait.\" I was surprised, he'd never used my nickname before however I did not stop from leaving. \"Natalia!\" \"Don't follow me. I will shoot you three times in the head if you dare take a step after me.\" I warned over my shoulder and he stopped, knowing full well that I meant it. \"Though I should probably just shoot you anyway.\" I added in a mutter under my breath. I didn't take the elevator, I chose the stairs instead, needing some time to think about what I was going to do. That guy had found me again, was there another chip somewhere that Marvin hadn't found? If so then that meant I was putting everyone in danger. I had to go. Get out of here before I could get someone that I cared about killed. Just one stop, I needed to make sure mom was okay and let her know that I would come back. I slipped through the door on the fourth floor where mom was being kept in a room with an agent who was keeping watch over her. I knocked on the door and was allowed in when I gave my name, mom instantly bounding over to me. \"Nat-Nat! Look! Look at the pretty colours!\" She threw the handful of sweets into the air and I sighed before giving a shaky smile. \"Are you happy mom?\" \"Of course, look, look! More colours!\" She dragged me over to the TV and pressed the remote control buttons, staring in awe as she flicked through the channels. I let her continue then lowered my voice to speak to the agent. \"Any trouble?\" \"She tried to flood the bathroom by overfilling the bath but other than that, as good as she can be. We've arranged for her to be admitted to hospital so that they can properly ascertain her medical condition.\" Mom gave a little hiccup then clapped a hand to her mouth, staring at me as if she were a child that had just done something wrong before she hiccupped again then giggled. \"Thank you.\" I said to them then stepped forwards. \"Mom?\" \"Nat-Nat, I want to go shopping, let's go shopping and find all the pretty colours we can find!\" She grabbed my hand and made to run for the door but I held firm, tugging her back. \"Not now mom, the shops have gone to sleep for the night. They won't wake up until tomorrow.\" Her face crumbled and I knew she was going to have a shouting fit so I quickly moved on. \"But when they wake up, I'll take you to all the shops we can find and we'll build a mountain of colours, how does that sound?\" She paused, thinking for a moment before nodding her head. I couldn't linger, I really had to go but mom had suddenly thrown her arms around me and sighed. \"I love you mommy.\" She murmured and I choked. The agent sent me a pitying and apologetic look as my mom nuzzled her face into me so I gently guided her around. \"Okay, time for bed byes now.\" I whispered softly to her. \"Sleepy girls need to get into bed.\" \"I'm not sleepy Nat-Nat! I want to stay up all day and all night long.\" I gave a chuckle as she climbed into bed then settled down regardless, closing her eyes and was soon fast asleep. Glancing over to the agent I nodded to him then got up, pressing a soft kiss to my mom's brow before leaving her to rest. I closed the door quietly behind me then raked a hand down my face, stuck between a rock and a hard place. Moving forwards I returned to the stairwell to sneak out of the hotel without anyone seeing. There were agents at the front doors and every other exit so I strode carefully towards the kitchens, melting into the background as I followed a waiter inside then went out towards the closet where they kept all their lockers, clothes and uniforms. I changed into a chef's suit, plonked a hat on my head then walked back out, stuffing my clothes into a black plastic bag then went to 'take out the trash'. The agents let me past so I carried on walking, left the building to step into the cold, snow ridden alley then quickly changed back. I shoved the clothes into a dumpster, pulled my jacket back on and slid my gun into place before jogging out into the street and before anyone could figure out I was gone, I had already disappeared from sight. For Kin, I'm imagining her to be a Zhang Ziyi kind of look, like when she was in Rush Hour Two. Hope you guys liked, don't forget to R+R before you leave! Thanks again![Chapter 12] Don't shoot! Don't shoot! I'm so sorry I haven't posted in a while, I was camping! I'm back now and I promise things will be a little more regular, honest! Anyway, hope you guys enjoy this next chapter, you get to see a little more overprotective Frank :) He's such a cute dad, I have to say I had barely been running for ten minutes when two cars skidded to a halt either side of me, doors flinging open to cut off my escape and several dark clad figures stepped out, cracking their knuckles. One advanced further than the others so I turned to face him, preparing to swing but then a hood was dragged down over my head from behind and I lashed out, screaming in rage as I was then restrained, handcuffs being clamped onto my wrists. God damn it! Rather unceremoniously I was thrust into a car, hands grabbing me and firmly holding me down as I kicked and struggled, writhing like a snake until someone had the sense to whack my head and knock me out of all sense and feeling. Then for a long time, I felt nothing, which strangely was an immense comfort. Frank \"What do you mean she's gone?\" I bellowed and Sarah jumped with surprise, glancing with concern to Marvin as I slammed my fists onto the table. \"Where is my daughter?\" \"Francis, you need to…\" \"Don't you dare tell me to calm down!\" I turned to Victoria though somehow managed to control my voice a little. She lifted her hands in surrender. \"Alright, perhaps this once panicking is completely appropriate. Who was supposed to be watching her?\" An agent stepped forwards and nodded his head. \"Me, ma'am.\" \"And where were you?\" Victoria asked sweetly, giving a cold smile as she turned to face him. \"Sweeping through the halls to make sure they were clean.\" Victoria's smile never left her face as her fist darted out and punched him square on the nose. Ivan laughed aloud then shook his head, drawing Victoria back as she glared at the man. \"Frank, we'll find her. We already have CTTV scanning for her face match. It's still light, we can bring her back.\" Cooper said to me but I shook my head. \"I have to go and find her. I can't just sit here!\" \"Frank, there's nothing we can do until we get a visual on Natalia's location.\" Sarah said to me diplomatically, resting her hands on my shoulders, guided me down into a seat then began to massage them. The tension suddenly fled from there and I leaned back, allowing her to work her magic before I closed my eyes. \"My baby girl's out there all alone with people wanting to kill her.\" Suddenly I frowned. \"Usually it's me they're after.\" The irritating Asian girl giggled. \"The stubborn child will be fine. Why are we all worrying? I thought we had a bigger issue at hand. Those bombs aren't going to deactivate themselves you know.\" I hated how she was right. As much as I wanted to simply go and find Natalia, I had to put the safety of innocent civilians first and those bombs needed to be dealt with. \"Alright, stick to the plan.\" I nodded my head, finally coming around to my senses. \"We don't all need to be in position right now.\" Victoria announced then looked to Sarah. \"You, Ivan and I could drive around the streets and search for Natalia for as long as we can. We'll take a radio with us so that you can tell us if you find her.\" Though I was about to argue that I wanted Sarah safe next to me, she pressed a kiss to the top of my head. \"It's useless arguing.\" She interrupted. \"I'm going to bring Nat back. Sit tight and don't even think about killing Han until Nat's here to save his ass.\" Kin glowered at Sarah who shot her a smug smile before striding off. Kin then possessively moved closer to Han, sliding her hands down over his chest and he shifted a little uncomfortably. Although I hated him right now, I couldn't help but feel defensive. That was my daughter's boyfriend that Asian chick was touching! Or was he her ex? I don't know, I'm totally confused. Pulling out my ghost-line phone I dialled the number that Sarah had managed to extract from the files from back at Owen and Ronin's place. Lifting it up to my ear I waited as it began to ring. \"Who is this?\" A Mexican accented voice demanded. \"How did you get this…\" \"Ricardo Medina, you don't know me but I think you have something of mine.\" I cut him off, my voice even and low. \"And I want her back.\" There was a long pause before a menacing chuckle sounded. \"Frank Moses. A true legend. It is an honour to be speaking with you.\" I ignored this and continued on. \"If you let her go, then I shall not come after you. Let Natalia go free and you shall never have to meet me, because if we ever do meet then I promise you that you will feel pain unlike any other.\" Again Ricardo laughed. \"She is very strong. Truly her father's daughter. Aren't you my sweet?\" Suddenly Natalia's voice came on the phone, shouting rather loudly in German, the language she preferred to use when insulting or threatening someone. Han sat forwards suddenly, eyes fixed on the phone as he listened to Natalia's voice. \"I am surprised how much pain she can take, I have been trying to find her limit, tried to break her but she cannot seem to crack.\" Without warning there was an ear piercing scream and it took everything in me not to fall out of control. \"Leave her alone.\" I commanded in a deadly calm voice. Natalia's screaming stopped at Ricardo's forwarded order. \"You want her? Come and get her.\" \"I will. You can be sure of that. I'll come for her, I'll kill you and I will make sure that it will not be a quick death.\" Ricardo paused for a moment, thinking before snorting. \"I will look forwards to it. Rafael? Dislocate her shoulder.\" Then the call was cut off. I swore colourfully, almost crushing the phone in my hand as my fingers clenched into fists but I took deep, heavy breaths to calm myself. Cooper slowly approached, understanding my pain. \"Frank?\" He questioned firmly yet also gently, gripping my shoulder and I nodded. \"Let's do this.\" Nothing had come back on Natalia's whereabouts. I swear when I find her, I'm going to ground her for the rest of her life and put her under house arrest where I can keep an eye on her. What else can I do? It seemed the only way to protect her was to shelter her and I was more than willing to do it. We loaded up the cars but I paused, looking over to Rosella as she swayed on her feet as if to a rhythm, muttering under her breath as she stared blankly ahead of her. Slowly I approached, reaching out and touching her arm. \"Rose?\" I said her name quietly so that I didn't startle her but she turned a large smile upon me. \"Frankie!\" She gushed then flung her arms around me. \"Where's Nat-Nat?\" She asked, still clinging on with a surprisingly painful grip. \"She's gone out for a walk.\" I answered, trying to pry her off but she merely held on tighter so I let her. \"But we'll both come and see you soon. Okay?\" She nodded her head then began to purr like a cat. \"Rosella? It's time to go for a ride now.\" An agent doctor said softly to Rosella, touching her shoulders and the woman blinked. \"But what about Nat-Nat? Something isn't right.\" She whined, tears filling her eyes. \"Where's my baby? My baby's hurt! I can feel it, they're hurting her!\" She screamed but I covered her mouth carefully with my hand, hushing her. \"Okay, it's alright. We're going to find Natalia, okay?\" I quickly put in, sighing. It had been so long since I had last seen her, the changes were quite shocking. She had once been a very beautiful woman who could have easily modelled, but now she was wafer thin, pale and her eyes had sunk into her skull. \"My baby, where's my baby? Let me hold my baby!\" I had to restrain her, gripping her arms but she kicked out and actually landed quite a good blow on one of the agents, doubling him over. \"My baby is hurt, I know it, I can sense it! Don't mess with a mother, where's my Natalia?!\" Her natural motherly instinct must have taken over and now I was worried. Even when Natalia was a child, Rosella always knew when she'd hurt herself at school or had fallen over in the garden and would go rushing to see her, much to the shock of everyone else when they found that she was correct. If Rosella said that Natalia was in pain, that meant she was in pain. Seeing my panic and distress, Cooper quickly hurried everyone along. \"Alright let's move!\" Rosella was taken from me and Sarah quickly placed her hands at my face. \"It's okay, she's going to be okay.\" She whispered to me as I trembled, tears filling my eyes as I tried to hold them back. \"I want her safe, Sarah, that's all I want.\" \"I know, I know and we're going to get her back. I promise.\" She took my hand and gently led me over to the car where Marvin was waiting. \"But you have to focus right now.\" I nodded my head but I stopped, turned and walked over to Han. He turned his head then faced me but I gripped his jacket and hoisted him forwards, glaring at him as the smaller Asian girl went to attack me but Han lifted a hand, signalling for her to stop. \"If they have her, you damn well better get her back alive .\" I said to him seriously, my voice trembling with anger. \"And if you don't, then you'd better die trying.\" Han said nothing more made any movement so I let him go, satisfied that I had got my message across. \"Honestly, that child is more trouble than she's worth.\" I spun around and pointed at the woman with a slight snarl. \"You can shut your face or I'll do it for you. My baby is older, more mature and a lot better at this sort of thing than you are, she has more experience than a seasoned agent and she's shaping up to be even better than I was. So you hold your tongue or I swear to god I'll shoot you right now!\" \"Francis…\" Victoria placed a hand on my shoulder, murmuring softly. \"I know you're worried but you have to get yourself together. Mind over matter.\" Nodding my head I turned one last look on Han then shook my head. \"Natalia is far better than that .\" I shot a pointed look to Kin who bristled and Han just looked uncomfortable, narrowing his eyes slightly before getting into the car, Kin following. Fine, if they were happy together then that's their problem. My baby girl deserves way better anyway.[Chapter 13] Hey guys! I'm back again and guess what? I brought Natalia and all her awesomeness along with me :) Hope you all enjoy, there is some serious butt kicking, fluff and plot twists in this chapter, please don't skip this out! Natalia Ow. That's pretty much that's all on my mind right now. Ricardo must be really stinging about me killing his brother, because I'm pretty sure I have a few cracked or broken ribs and these last couple of hours have been absolute torture and I mean that in the literal sense. I would not be surprised if my hair was now white from the stress of electricity being pumped into my body and then being forced onto a water board with the agonising drip of water on your brow and an uncomfortable metal mask on your face. That was only the beginning. After their beatings, I simply could not move. There was nothing left in me now, there was no point in fighting as there was too much pain for it to even be possible to take another hit. If I tried to fight back, they would just kill me. Running away. Great plan Natalia, absolutely spiffing. Now you're captured, half dead and also a hostage to the most dangerous man in the west. Oh, and he plans to use you to kill Han and then just shoot you anyway. Brilliant! I swear, one day I am going to be the death of myself, unless I already am. Still, let's hope the others and my dad think of something clever because I'm all out of ideas. I should really have just ignored dad and gone ahead to apply to the CIA, at least then I would have had in depth training and I'd be better prepared for situations like this. All I got now are my wits. Still, I could kill for some sugar right now. I really fancy some gummy bears, or some more Skittles. Not entirely appropriate but there we go. Can't help having a sweet tooth. However when the door burst open and two men strode inside I groaned, allowing them to lift me upright in a chair then held me down, forcing my eyes open as Ricardo stepped forwards, glaring down at me with loathing. \"You killed my brother.\" He accused in a rather spine tingling voice and I was briefly afraid, though I swiftly recovered myself and narrowed my eyes. \"He was going to kill me.\" Ricardo's hand shot out and slapped me, however the blow was pretty weak and I didn't even move my head, which only angered him further. \"You will pay for this affront, you have my word. For now, however, I am going to keep you alive and kill two birds with one stone, as it were.\" I kept my eyes fixed on him, trying to think of what to do or say. I had to be careful. One slip of my tongue and I could lose it and then my life. Deciding to play it safe, I said nothing. \"Quite the little vixen, aren't you? I can see why Han Cho-Bai had his eye on you. You seem to be exactly his type.\" \"I suppose.\" I answered with a shrug. \"Though technically he isn't my partner anymore. We split up the other day, in fact, the very day that you first kidnapped me. Isn't life funny with all its little twists?\" I said dryly and Ricardo's face went purple, the vein in his neck jumping as he clenched his fists at his sides. \"No matter. He has still agreed to the trade. Obviously he still has a soft spot for you somewhere in that ice cold heart of his.\" I closed my eyes and inhaled deeply, trying to focus on the scent of my blood and infections, as it was the only thing keeping me awake since the smell was so bad. \"Whatever.\" I sighed, tilting my head back to click my neck as it was stiff and beginning to go numb. \"When are we leaving?\" \"Soon. Very soon.\" He promised then looked to the two men in the room with me. \"Ensure that she does not die or escape.\" They nodded their heads then stood over me, watching like bloodhounds so I simply allowed myself to rest, drifting in and out of sleep which was surprisingly easier than I had thought it would be. I swear, when this is all over, I am going to live in my shower to keep my body from hurting so much. Damn. The two men muttered to one another in Spanish, thinking I would not understand but I knew exactly what they were saying. I'm fluent in English, Spanish, German, Russian, French and Italian. If there was one other thing I was good at, it was learning languages. I picked it up so quickly that it was insane. Oh, and Han had been teaching me a little Korean, which might come in handy later. They were talking about sports and the recent baseball game so I zoned out of that, though their voices did hinder my sleeping ability since they were like constant flies buzzing in my ears. Deciding that a better use of my time was to interrogate them, I moaned, pretending to be faint which actually wasn't too hard. \"Where am I…?\" I murmured and one of them looked at me. \"Secret facility with Ricardo Medina. Now shut up.\" \"Where? Where am I?\" The other, being a little pitying of me, crouched down and lifted my head a little, touching my brow to check my temperature. \"You are in New York. Can you remember the date?\" I blinked at him then slumped forwards, holding my breath and the guy instantly panicked. \"She isn't breathing! Get her adrenaline!\" There was a sound of someone fumbling with bottles but a few moments later, something sharp pricked my arm and adrenaline was flushed into my body. Instantly some of the pain dulled and I slowly began to breathe again, allowing them to relax as I groaned. \"What's happening? Someone help me…I don't understand…\" \"You're going to go home soon.\" The colder man lied, grabbing my head by my hair and pulled it back, forcing my airways to open so that I could breathe better. \"Once your boyfriend turns up.\" Why did everyone seem to insist that Han was still my boyfriend when I have expressively explained that we had split up? Honestly. Some people. \"Water…\" I croaked. There was a movement but the first guy hissed. \"What are you doing?\" \"She can't die from dehydration, let her just have a little drink.\" Then a cup was pressed to my lips and I drank greedily, the coldness allowing my mind to be bitten back into function. Through my half open eyes I saw the two men hovering with frowns on their faces above me. \"Is she going to be alright?\" The first asked. \"I don't want her to die before she's meant to, otherwise we get shot for failure.\" \"She'll be fine. Just let her alone now.\" My hair was dropped and my head rolled forwards. So we were still in New York, possibly at one of Ricardo's facilities, most likely the one that's close to the drop off point. This then meant that there would be a lot of supplies in here, including the bombs. Hmm…light bulb! They gave me measured dosages of adrenaline, enough to keep me awake and dull the pain but not enough to allow me to break free from this place, however when the time came for the handover, they took the medicine with them in a little handheld case. Two men literally had to carry me as I continued my damsel in distress act, one gripping me under the arms whilst the other held my legs as we ascended some stairs but they then dropped me onto a chair and one guy held me upright. I opened my eyes slightly, looking around me and found myself surrounded by crates, though some of them were open and I saw that the entire contents were various explosive materials with detonator packs sitting on top of them. As well as this, I also saw a rather massive pile of money just sitting innocently to my left, like a towering mountain. Hot damn, that's a lot of dollar. Glancing around I slowly inched my chair a little closer to one of the crates, looking back to make sure no one was watching but they were all too engrossed in the TV which was showing some sort of reality show and they had beers in their hands. Before anyone could notice I reached forwards, grabbed a detonator then slipped it into my pocket then slumped in my chair as someone turned around to check I was behaving myself. I'm being good as gold, sir, honest. After a few minutes, a voice on a radio signalled that they were ready to move out, so two different men picked me up again and carried me out to the car which skidded to a halt in front of us and I was bundled inside with the men, one either side of me as I slumped forwards. \"Give her another shot.\" \"You sure that's wise?\" The other queried eyeing my suspiciously then poked me. Though pain flared up my side I did not make a sound, biting on my tongue to keep from sending him a decorative insult. \"Ricardo wants her awake for when we go to meet that Korean guy.\" He answered then stretched over, took the case then applied another small dose to my bloodstream. I jerked slightly, eyes fluttering open and I groaned, wishing they would just leave me alone. However in my head I added the dosage to the tally I was keeping, working out exactly how much I had been given so far. It was all looking good for the moment, just need to try and think of step two. Wait, did I even have a step one? Oh crap, I hate being unable to think properly. Looking at one of their watches, I saw that we had fifteen minutes until midday, which was when everything was meant to go boom. Bugger it, and I was so looking forwards to a normal Christmas this year. Which reminds me, I still haven't put up a tree or done any of my food shopping. Whoops, I should really stop leaving things so late, shouldn't I? Oh well, at least I bought the gifts already. It was a short drive, literally down the road to then stop before the gates where, when I slyly looked through the window, I could see Han there waiting, wearing those stupid oversized glasses with that irritating little vixen he cheated on me with. Well technically that's unfair, I only have her side of the story but you can be damn well sure I'm going to demand the truth from him, because then I can totally have a legit reason to kick his ass. Even so, it felt a little encouraging to see him there. Ricardo stepped out of a different car, there being three in total. His men followed him, all stepping out from the car save for the driver of the car I was in and a man beside me. Okay, now I really need to start thinking. I can't let them hand me over in exchange for Han, as much as I hate him right now, I still do kinda care about him. A lot. Though I doubt he's alone, there are still variables that I needed to deal with. My wrists were cuffed, which would make things a little…no they won't, this is perfect. Oh hell, I love being me. With all the force I could gather I slammed my fists back into the guard's face, shifting to sit on his lap and pin him down as I grabbed the hand taser from his belt, jamming it into the driver's neck and he jerked about, grunting as I knocked him out with my feet kicking out at the other guy, keeping his hands from reaching for the door whilst also striking his mouth a few times to gag his sounds. Once the driver was out, I shocked the other guy too. Gasping slightly I grabbed the medicine case, unzipped it then measured out some more adrenaline, enough to give me a slight overdose without it being too much to cause me harm. I was going to need it. Glancing through the window I saw that someone was turning back and frowning, calling through the radio to bring me out. I flinched as I injected the needle and pushed the drug into my body then slid out the car of my own accord, wincing as my dislocated shoulder began to throb from the movement I was putting it through. Biting down any sound I quickly shoved it back into place, feeling it pop uncomfortably. \"Han!\" I called out and he lifted his head, watching as I struggled forwards, pretending to limp before collapsing to my knees. \"Get out here you moron! What do you think you're doing?\" I shouted over to him as I was forced to my feet, someone gripping my hair. \"Shut up!\" Ricardo snarled as I was brought to him. His hand reached forwards and gripped my hair tightly as the other man let go. My body began to tremble from the effects of the adrenaline, though others would merely perceive it as fear. \"Finally afraid of me are you?\" He mock snarled and I shivered, trying to keep my body from jerking too violently. I switched to a different language and Ricardo, none the wiser, assumed I had been insulting him though in reality I was trying to tell Han to just get away from here and not worry about me. \"Enough with your German.\" Inwardly I smirked. Stupid jackass can't even tell the difference between German and Korean. All the more brownie points for me. He turned to fully face me, forcing me to my knees then looked over to Han. \"You should not have believed me.\" Han made to step forwards but several guns were pointed at him so he stopped. \"Let her go.\" He growled sharply and I licked my lips, counting how many men there were around me. A gun cocked and I looked to Ricardo who had his weapon aimed directly at Han who kept his eyes steadily on me. Our eyes met and I saw him give a secret, tiny smile but his eyes shone brightly to me, warming me completely and I could not help but smile back at him. \"Any last words for your lady?\" Ricardo asked mockingly and Han glanced to him before returning his gaze to me. \" Dangsin-eul salanghabnida.\" My eyes widened suddenly, staring at him as he continued to regard me carefully, his expression once again placid and unreadable but I didn't care. He…he'd said the words. The words. Renewed with determination, I gasped slightly as Ricardo smirked then began to turn his gun to aim at me. Before it could reach me, however, I had snarled and sprang into action. No way was I going down without a fight, fair or not. My head whipped back then hammered forwards, catching Ricardo square in the crotch and he howled, collapsing down so I smacked my head against his again to stun him then leaped to my feet, spinning around in the air and kicked back two men as they went for their guns. Bullets began to dance through the sky, ringing in my ears as the two men facing me dropped and in the distance I could see Victoria with her sniper, carefully aiming. I shot her a grin then turned, squeaking slightly as another man went for me with a machete. I lifted my hands to protect myself, the chains of my handcuffs blocking the blade but he stabbed at me again, forcing me to step back and angle my body, using the cuffs against to redirect the blow until finally, the chain snapped. \"You're in trouble now.\" I smirked then leaped forwards, cartwheeling over his shoulder then slammed the long side of my hands into his neck, knocking him out then turned, leaping over the bonnet of a car to grab a fallen guard's gun then turned, shooting as more men poured out from hiding places. A truck roared into view, sporting a machine gun on the roof which began to fire relentlessly at the CIA agents, who all dived for cover including Victoria. Angered that my aunt was in danger, I turned and shot at the car, cracking the windscreen and taking out the driver so it swerved out of control and the gunmen let go of the trigger as the truck began to circle dangerously. With one well aimed squeeze of my trigger finger, I blew a hole through the gas cap and heat suddenly flared up as I turned, smirking with a plume of fire dancing high behind me. Badass and bad, that's me baby, Looking over to Ricardo and seeing that some of our agents were about to be executed, I shouted out to him. \"Hey Ricardo! How much do you love your money?\" Tugging the detonator from my pocket I waved it at him then placed my thumb on the button. Ricardo froze then bellowed for a ceasefire, staring in horror at me as I rubbed small circles into the red button, taunting him smugly a as I panted for breath. Slowly he began to laugh. I arched an eyebrow at him as he turned to face me, shaking his head, paused then pointed a finger at me. \"You are very extraordinary woman.\" \"Such comments have been brought to my attention before.\" I answered blandly, taking a step forwards. \"Now stand down, or your bank goes boom.\" He lifted his hands in surrender. Agents stepped forwards and were beginning to take men into custody when a sharp pain exploded at my knee and I cried out, falling down but then a cold blade was pressed to my throat. Staring upwards I then narrowed my eyes. \"You little snake.\" I snarled up at Kin who giggled. \"He pays well.\" She shrugged, lifting her blade then began to smoothly slice it over my skin, not drawing blood but a few hairs did go missing. \"Such a pretty face.\" She murmured then lowered her face to a hiss. \"I hate other pretty women.\" \"Well, that makes you a bitch.\" I answered as Han stood stiffly, preparing to run for us but I moved first. As Kin went to retrieve the detonator, I grabbed the wrist with the knife then yanked her forwards, pulling her off balance then flipped her over my head as she gasped. Several guns rose but Ricardo dived out the way and the fight burst free again. I, however, was now focussed on my new opponent. She gave me her signature sickening smirk then ran at me with a scream. I tucked the detonator in my pocket then faced her, preparing for the first attack. She moved so fast that I could barely keep up. The adrenaline was the only thing saving me from getting my butt kicked into the next century. Sure, she was tiny, but she was also vicious , like a deadly cobra! It was terrifying! Especially when she came at you with bared teeth and those loud shrieks as if she were a banshee. Ugh. I ducked, stepped back, dodged, parried, blocked, ducked again then got a foot full in my mouth, causing my nose to bleed as I smacked my head on the ground. Kin leaped at me and I rolled with a yelp. \"Are you crazy?\" I demanded, staggering to my feet but she punched me several times in the side, grounding me again. I gasped for air, crawling backwards as I trembled. \"Why? Why are you with them?\" \"Good money.\" She answered with a shrug. \"Being the hero is overrated.\" \"But you'll lose Han.\" I reasoned and she scoffed. \"There are plenty of other men like him.\" Kin replied and her answer made me very, very, very angry. There were no other men out there like Han. Not one. How dare she-you know what? I'm going to break her face. Without a word Kin went to slam her foot into my face but I reared back, wrapping my arm around her limb then stood abruptly and gave her a sharp tug to land her flat on her back. Her other leg whirled around and somehow found a rather sensitive spot where I had a deep cut and pummelled it, forcing me to let go, struggling to keep my balance. \"You are pathetic.\" Kin shot at me with a lashing tongue as I racked air into my body. \"Weak, unrefined, you have no skill in the art of fighting.\" I narrowed my eyes. \"Oh bitch, you are so going to regret that.\" I growled. She slammed into me and pinned me to the ground, going for my throat to strangle me but I crossed my arms over hers and brought them down swiftly on the crooks of her elbows, forcing the hold to break then with a powerful jerk of my head, I slammed my brow against hers, causing her to yelp. \"Welcome to street fighting. Batter up.\" I tossed her from me then threw a punch, catching her in the jaw. \"Strike one!\" I rotated my body, turning a full arc with my leg and caught her head again, making her stagger backwards as blood dripped from her lip. \"Strike two!\" With an enraged snarl Kin ran at me but I lifted my hands into a boxing stance then ducked under her blows, keeping light on my toes as she put all her energy into landing a blow at me, eyes narrowed in fury as I continued to dance out from beneath her. With a final swing she stumbled forwards so I turned, dug my fingers into the back of her jacket then pushed her down as I lifted my knee, cracking her in the gut to wind her then flung her backwards. \"Strike three.\" I finished with one, powerful swing of my fist, knocking her out clean so that she fell backwards and went completely still. \"You're out.\" Lifting my chin I panted for breath, shoulders slumping as I groaned, touching my head where a powerful throb cursed me relentlessly. For a tiny little thing she hit pretty hard. Looking around, the fight was ending and we were the victors. Ha! May the odds be ever in our favour. Okay, my head isn't thinking straight. Please excuse any idiocy on my part for the next couple of hours. Spinning around I searched for Han, praying to god that he was alright. He was standing with his back to me, his shoulders rising and falling as he breathed in deeply but he was perfectly still otherwise, his opponents lying at his feet. \"Han.\" I called out, my voice breaking slightly from weariness but he heard me. Han turned around, facing me fully and he relaxed when he saw me. God I loved him so much right now, even though he was probably sweaty and was covered in blood, I still loved him. Together we started to move towards one another, though I was gripping my side as I was bleeding from an injury that had cracked open again. I was going to need therapy after this. Either that or a tonne of sweets and my favourite foods to make me feel better. His arms slipped around me, pulling me close and I gazed up into his eyes. \"Han.\" His name was a mere breath on my lips as he shuddered. Wait, did he just show effect? Ha! I have an effect on Han! That's one point to the Natalia scoreboard! \"Natalia.\" He greeted quietly, reached out and carefully brushing back my wild hair so that it didn't fall into my face. Relief flooded through me the way if Hoover Dam had actually been blown up and flooded…oh crap, how did everything else go? Was America still intact? A blur of movement caught my eye and my head snapped around, causing Han to frown then turn his face but I was already shoving him aside. \"No!\" I bellowed in defiance, standing in front of Han as Ricardo fired his gun just as a black CIA car pulled up and Cooper got out. With quick reflexes Cooper drew his gun and shot Ricardo twice in the chest but it was too late. The bullet struck me and I yelped, doubling over slightly as my hands jumped to my wound, shuddering instinctively then fell forwards. \"Natalia!\" Han grabbed me then carefully lowered me down, arms protectively sliding over me as he then slowly turned me into his arms, cradling me like a child as Cooper called for an air ambulance. Grunting slightly I clenched my jaw, dealing with the pain as I pressed my hands firmly into the wound to stop the blood loss, Han slowly lowering me down to lay flat so that he could place his hands over mine too. \"Stay with me Natalia.\" Han murmured to me gently, looking into my eyes and I gave a shaky laugh. \"Never wanted to leave you in the first place.\" He smiled softly then gave a weak chuckle before darting forwards and kissing my head. \"Han, please don't ever leave me like that again.\" I begged in a hoarse whisper and he nodded his head. \"I will not.\" He promised, leaning a little closer as his eyes continued to rest firmly on mine. \"I love you Natalia Sophie Francesca Moses.\" My heart did a little dance as I beamed up at him. \"Ditto twinkle toes.\" He rolled his eyes but instantly became concerned as I whimpered, taking a deep breath to try and calm myself before looking back at Han. \"I ran after you.\" I whispered and he gave me a little look of confusion. \"When you left, I went after you but…but the plane had already taken off. I was on the runway.\" He just gazed down at me and I felt a small burst of pride with how adoringly his eyes were watching me. Suddenly I grunted, my head spinning violently and I growled. \"Argh, this sucks.\" I shot him a filthy look. \"Why did I have to be the one shot again?\" He cocked an eyebrow at me. \"You were the one stupid enough to throw yourself in front of a bullet.\" I grinned. \"For your benefit, may I add?\" I reminded him. \"I saved your ass, now you owe me big time. I hope you've booked Christmas off, because if not then I'm going to kidnap you and hold you hostage, then your agents can't say anything about it.\" He smirked at me as I shuddered, blinking furiously to hold back the tears. \"And next time, you can be the one to get shot.\" By this time Cooper had reached us, dropping down to crouch beside me. \"Alright, you're going to be fine.\" He assured me and I laughed. \"Yeah right. You're not the one laying on the ground with a hole in your gut. You guys get all the luck around here.\" Cooper smirked, glanced to Han then back to me. \"You're a brave woman. If you ever want a place at the CIA, just give me a call.\" I nodded my head gratefully. \"Thanks sir.\" He looked around when he heard the chopper and I turned my eyes to the sky, wondering why it was getting brighter. \"We'll get you in first…\" \"No.\" I cut him off, shaking my head as my eyes began to slide closed. \"Order of need. Get others attended first if they need the attention more. I'll…I'll hold a little longer…\" My head began to drift to the side but Han's sharp bark penetrated my mind, though it had no effect. \"Stay awake!\" Cooper shook my shoulder but I was already gone, completely oblivious to all else as I felt my heart rate slow down, gradually winding further and further down as my vision blackened and the world spun away from beneath me until I was flying into the air. It was easier than falling asleep. To be continued... Probably... Maybe... I don't know, maybe I should just leave it at that...?[Chapter 14] My eyes slid open slowly, momentarily confused before my mind registered that I was still in hospital. There was a strong clinical smell and the lights were very bright at first but my eyes soon adjusted. There was Christmas music playing quietly, carols and cheesy old songs and there was tinsel decorating the ward. \"Baby?\" I turned my head and looked at dad, blinking once before groaning and removing the mask from my face. \"Dad?\" He sighed with relief and moved forwards, not disturbing Sarah who was curled up in a chair, sleeping. \"Hey baby, you okay?\" I nodded my head. \"I'm alive, which is a good thing.\" Sitting up slightly I frowned. \"What day is it?\" \"Christmas eve.\" Hot damn! \"Yeah, you slept for quite a while.\" Dad gave me a soft smile as I stared up at him. \"Damn! I missed all the parades!\" I pouted and at my complaining, Sarah jerked awake. \"Nat!\" She grinned, flying to my side and hugged me though carefully, only at the last moment remembering that I was still a little bit on the tender side. \"We were so worried about you. They said you weren't likely to pull through.\" I smirked. \"I'm a tough girl. Besides, I am not going to die when it's so close to Christmas! That's just sad.\" Suddenly I grinned. \"Hey, I have advent days to catch up on, you know what that means? Candy!\" Sarah beamed then pulled something out of her pocket and I stared at the Skittles in awe. \"You didn't…\" \"I did. Think they would mind?\" I arched an eyebrow at her. \"Do I look like I care what those bozos think? Let's open the champagne!\" Still grinning Sarah opened the bag and poured a healthy portion into my hand which I devoured hungrily. Oh man, sugar. Never tasted so good. \"They say you're doing okay now. You woke up a few times though I don't know if you really understood what was happening.\" Dad explained to me as Sarah picked out her favourite ones. \"We can discharge you and take you home if you want?\" \"Sounds good to me. I hate hospitals.\" I nodded my head, sitting up a little further then looked around. \"Where's Han and the others?\" \"Han is…organising something.\" Dad frowned. \"He didn't say much, but he promised he would be back.\" I felt a little disappointed but Sarah punched my shoulder gently. \"Hey, he was at your side for a full week. We practically had to drag him away to get some proper rest, change his clothes and eat.\" Perking up a little I smiled. \"Really?\" \"Yup. Dead set on not moving.\" Dad sighed, rubbing his face with one hand. \"Cooper called a couple of times, asking how you were.\" \"That's nice of him.\" I returned, sitting up further until I was perfectly upright. \"What do you think dad, about me joining the CIA?\" Dad paused then made a face. \"I can hardly stop you.\" He shrugged then sighed, coming to sit by my side on the bed, reaching out and taking my hand. \"I want you to know that whatever you do, I'll always be proud of you, Natalia. Always.\" Giving him a loving smile I reached forwards then kissed his face. \"How's mom? Is she okay?\" Sarah nodded her head. \"She's been taken back to a hospital close to where we live so that we can visit her often. Since you're apartment is completely trashed, we thought you might like to come live with us for a few days until you can claim insurance.\" I blushed slightly then looked down. \"Yeah, about that. I couldn't really afford insurance.\" Dad groaned. \"Seriously?\" \"Hey! I'm a young woman still trying to find her way in the world. Don't get lippy with me just because I can't afford insurance on my apartment.\" Dad grinned at me. \"Okay, we'll sort that when it comes to it. For now you can live with us, we'll visit mom and I can keep a very close eye on you.\" I rolled my eyes. \"Yeah, like that's really going to work for long.\" I paused, almost hesitant to ask but I plucked up my courage. \"Do they know what's wrong with her?\" Sarah and dad looked at one another before looking back at me. \"Baby, it's not very good. There's something not quite right in her mind, she's been classed as clinically insane and they're looking to place her in a special care facility that can look after her properly. She thinks she's still a child but there's another side to her that is more violent and dangerous. There are some moments when she can flick between the two personalities when something triggers the reaction however the more violent side is also the maternal side of her, which is why she can remember you specifically.\" Nodding my head I sighed. \"At least they'll take care of her. I don't think I would have been able to handle it the way you did, dad, it would have really hurt to see her that way.\" He nodded his head in understanding then looked around as a doctor approached us. \"Good morning, my dear, how do you feel?\" He asked me kindly and I grinned. \"Like a million dollar model on a catwalk, can I go now? Please? I want to get home for Christmas.\" He chuckled, looking over some results that they must have tested recently. \"You're still recovering from the trauma of your attack. As your doctor I advise that you stay as it may cause further injury if you try and get back on your feet now.\" Dad got up and turned to face the doctor, doing his best to not look intimidating. \"I'm confident I can take care of her. She'll be fine.\" The doctor paused, reluctant. \"I formally request to be discharged.\" I continued, giving him a small smile. \"Honestly, I'll be careful. I just want to be on my own sofa on Christmas day.\" Sighing, the doctor gave in then nodded his head. \"I'll find you a discharge form. Merry Christmas to you all.\" \"Merry Christmas.\" We chorused back then turned to face one another again. \"So.\" I struck up, grinning. \"Tell me about the bombs.\" Sarah burst into story, recounting every single detail with impressive enthusiasm as I listened with a widespread grin. Ha! Did you really think I was going to let this girl go? Not likely! Had you all fooled there for a moment though, didn't I? :)[Chapter 15] Dad unlocked the door and I sighed contently, stepping inside his house with my suitcase that he had brought back to the hospital from my apartment in the week. Sarah had already decorated, so there was tinsel and little ball balls hanging from the ceiling and there was a wonderful smell of turkey roasting with potatoes, parsnip and all other good food smells. \"Merry Christmas my sweet little mint cake\" Ivan boomed, striding forwards with wide arms then gripped my shoulders, kissing both my cheeks then lifted a bag to shake it at me, an entire packet of my favourite mint creams with a sweet green decorative bow on the front. \"For you.\" \"Thanks Uncle Ivan!\" I beamed, taking the present then kissed his cheek. \"Is that you Natalia?\" Victoria called from the kitchen and a moment later she appeared, wearing an apron and cooking gloves. \"Hello dear.\" She smiled warmly and I kissed her cheeks, returning her smile. \"Feeling better?\" \"There's nothing like a little Christmas spirit to heal up a bullet wound.\" I informed her proudly but inwardly, I desperately wanted to make it to a sofa to sit down. \"Well you know technically there will still be people dying and starving all over the world today…\" \"Marvin! Not now.\" I scolded him then gave him a big bear hug, startling him slightly but his arms found their way around me. \"Not on Christmas day.\" Someone shifted behind me as I stepped back from Marvin and the moment familiar hands touched my waist to gently turn me around, I knew who it was. \"Well, well, well, isn't this a surprise?\" I smirked at Han who arched his eyebrow at me. \"I thought you were off on a job?\" \"No.\" He answered, reaching forwards and placed a light kiss on my face. \"Just organising some things.\" I hardly heard his reply, I was a little caught up with how good he smelled. I caught his little smirk and couldn't hide the blush as he leaned a little closer. \"Can we do presents now?\" Sarah asked, jumping forwards and hurtling into the living room. \"I want to be Santa! I get the hat!\" I laughed, turning to follow everyone else but Han trapped me to him, not letting me go. \"Natalia…\" Without a word I looked up to the mistletoe that hung above our heads in the doorway. Han looked up also then back down to me. \"What?\" Smirking I gripped his jacket lapel and pulled him to me, kissing him slowly under the mistletoe. When I pulled back his eyes remained closed and we hardly moved away from one another. \"It's meant to be lucky.\" Suddenly he smirked. \"Well then.\" He gently gripped my head and pulled me back to him, adding a little tantalising fire to the kiss as it threatened to consume me completely. \"You need all the luck you can get just to survive through life.\" \"Hey!\" I thumped him on the arm but he merely spun me around then trapped me to his chest before pushing me into the living room where the tree was beautifully decorated with the glistening colours of Christmas, shining off the tinsel and decorations as presents spilled under its branches. Jackpot! Sarah knelt on the ground burying deep into the trove, wearing a sweet Santa hat before resurfacing with a present in her hands. \"Marvin!\" She grinned then tossed it over to him. He caught it then frowned, shaking it curiously but no sound came from the squishy parcel. Sarah was already moving on, handing dad and Victoria their gifts so I retrieved the presents from my suitcase and placed them inconspicuously under the tree. Marvin pulled on his jumper with a very large reindeer on the front, the nose flashing bright red and I grinned at him. \"Can I take a photo?\" \"No.\" Marvin pouted at me. \"Because then the satellites will get them from the phone and then everyone will be trying to kill me.\" \"What about on camera?\" I suggested but he merely shot me a look. Too bad, I'll get him later don't worry. I took photos at random, capturing the moments of our shared Christmas as we all laughed, especially when Sarah gave dad a book that read 'A Guide for Overprotective Dads to Cut Some Slack on their Children'. I liked that one. Sarah and I found it last month when we went shopping together. For Victoria I had knitted a poncho with tassels, Ivan I had bought a very nice bottle of whiskey as a sort of joke and an ice bucket with leaf print designs for the ice, Martin a new miniature tool kit with a case that could fit into his pocket, dad a knitted scarf, some new gardening tools and seeds to start the garden he had been meaning to do for the last couple of years. When Sarah drew out a gift for herself from me, she instantly brightened. \"Ooh, what is it?\" I grinned at her, shifting against Han's arm which was slung over my shoulders. \"Open and see.\" She instantly tore off the wrapping off and found a box, which made her glance up at me curiously. I made a gesture for her to continue, wriggling with excitement so she lifted the lid then stared inside. \"Oh my god!\" She squealed and quickly lifted out the holster which I had bought to fit the gun dad had bought her two years ago, her initials printed in cursive gold writing. Beaming she ran her fingers over the holster then looked further into the box. There was a decent sized handbag which when she opened, found several more goodies. Sarah opened the makeup case and at my instruction, lifted the eye-shadow panel to find a professional lock picking toolset. The lipstick doubled up as a stun gun and there was also pepper spray, a pack of gum that exploded when set on a fuse, a glasses case which held extra bullets for her gun and also an I-pod which doubled up as a listening device when the headphones were plugged in and one of the radio beads was planted somewhere. \"I love it!\" She squealed then practically leaped at me. \"Thank Han.\" I grunted as she slammed into me. \"He got me the contact.\" \"Thank you so much!\" Sarah surprised everyone when she flung her arms around Han, who blinked in shock then slowly nodded his head, resting a hand on her back before she drew away. \"Okay, who's next?\" A present was launched into my lap by Sarah. I smiled softly in confusion at the envelope but opened it, only to find a pair of plane tickets to Italy. Staring in shock I pulled them out, checking to make sure they were genuine before looking around. \"Who was this?\" I asked and Han gave a little smirk then looked at me. I stared at him. \"We're going to Italy?\" I asked, still gobsmacked as my heart began to pump with excitement. \"No, we're going travelling.\" Han answered quietly, leaning closer to me. \"But Italy first.\" I'll admit, I squealed like a girl. Hands up to that. My arms flew forwards and I leaped onto Han, crushing him to me as he chuckled. \"Travelling? We're really going travelling? To see the world?\" He nodded his head. \"Wherever you want to go.\" I beamed up at him, wriggling closer as his arms lifted me closer to him. \"Thank you so much Han.\" I murmured and he smirked smugly. When my present to Han was passed to him, I got off his lap and curled up on the sofa beside him, already thinking about all the places I wanted to go. Greece, Spain, Turkey, Germany, Poland, China, Brazil, everywhere! I can't wait, I really can't. Hold up, is Han opening my present? Oh no! Now I feel totally inferior. Too late to take it back now, he's already opened it. Han stared at the sketchbook, glanced to me then opened it. His fingers traced the lines of our faces, not missing a single detail as he slowly and every so attentively went through the pages. There were drawings of us, his favourite landmarks, times we went out together, some rare few happy childhood memories of his, some copies of photos of proud achievements of his like when he was in the military and other things. I watched him all the while and I could tell that this little book now meant more to him than any million dollar gift I could have bought him. It made me feel a little better about him spending ridiculous amounts of money taking me out and now this amazing around the world tour he was planning. He better know that I'm not letting him pay for everything, I can't expect that of him. When he got about two thirds of the way through I rested my head on his shoulder as he flicked through the blank pages. \"For later.\" I told him simply and he turned to look at me. He whispered a thank you in Korean and I smiled to him, gazing into his eyes before closing my own and touching my lips to his. For once dad said nothing, although I could sense everyone watching us. Suddenly I heard Victoria chuckle but I still didn't pull away from Han though I heard perfectly what she said. \"I think they're going to be just fine.\" I do too. Hey guys, chapters are beginning to dry up, the next will be the last one, I'm afraid. :([Chapter 16] Italy, we're finally here, we're finally here! Oh my goodness, I have to try the ice cream! I don't care if it's January, Italian ice cream is apparently amazing and I am going to sample it myself. Han didn't take me to a hotel, in fact, he took me to his home. He has a home in Italy. Did not know that. Wait, hang on...no. He has a mansion . \"Uh, Han?\" He looked back at me then smirked at my awe filled expression. My eyes snapped to his. \"Exactly how rich are you?\" He shrugged then held out a hand to me so I took it, winding my fingers through his. \"Richer than you.\" He answered simply and I laughed. \"Well, that's not entirely difficult to be fair.\" I paused then regarded him curiously. \"How many homes do you own?\" \"Several.\" He replied with another shrug. \"In different places.\" I slowly began to beam. \"I love having a filthy rich boyfriend. Does this mean you have loads of cars too?\" He laughed. \"A few.\" \"Can I play with them?\" \"No.\" I pouted but he whirled me around and picked me up easily, carrying me into his mansion as he smirked. \"You stole my car last time, I'm not letting you anywhere near them.\" \"Hey, I gave it back to you!\" I retorted simply as he dropped his bag on the ground then began to carry me upstairs. I gave him a seductive look. \"Already thinking ahead are we? If you're heading down that road then I insist you make me a drink beforehand.\" He laughed then leaned forwards, whispering huskily in my ear. \"Later. Right now I want to show you something.\" I gave him a look but he said nothing more, merely carried me in his arms. Something began to play on my mind, an insistent tugging until finally, I couldn't hold it in any longer. \"Han, what exactly went on between you and Kin? It's just she said something to me that indicated that you two were back together...well...before we broke up temporarily.\" I swallowed and bit my lip, watching Han carefully as he continued to look a head. \"We met again in China whilst I was hired for a job. It had been several years since I had last met her, which was when I ended our relationship but then she seemed to keep on reappearing, following me. I understand now it was because Ricardo wanted to know my whereabouts but nothing happened, Natalia. I promise.\" At ease I smiled at Han then nodded my head, settling it on his shoulder as he then carried me out onto a rather impressive landing then stopped to face a wall with an intricately detailed picture of Venice painted with acrylics, hued mostly in gold as it was lit at night. My mouth fell open. \"That's mine!\" I tumbled out of his arms, staring at it then looked down the hall to see another one of my pieces, an autumn tree of vibrant colour and opposite that there was a smaller set of charcoal drawings set behind gold picture frames. \"But…they all went to auction.\" I spun around to face him, eyes wide in shock. \"You bought them?\" Han nodded his head. \"I wanted them.\" He murmured softly, stepping a little closer. \"I bought a lot of your work, Natalia Sophie Francesca Moses.\" I could only continue to stare at Han as he placed his hands on my waist and stepped right up close to me, his voice soft and calm as he looked down to me. \"Sometimes I could not make it to your auctions, so I would send someone else instead to buy the piece no matter the price.\" I blinked at him. \"But…please tell me you didn't place stupid amounts of money on things I would have just given to you?\" I pleaded with him, lifting my hands to cup his neck. \"You only had to ask if you wanted one.\" \"Natalia, art is your work and life, I wanted to support you in it. I knew you would get suspicious if I bought them at the prices I thought they were worth, so I only bid as high as I needed to.\" A smile tugged on my lips as I glanced back over my shoulder to the Venice piece. \"And sometimes I notified art collectors of your work, they are very interested to meet you. There is someone who wants to showcase your work professionally at an event. I told him I would give you his contact details.\" Have I mentioned that I flipping loved this guy? He…he bought my pieces. Not just to give me money when I desperately needed it but because he wanted them and also wanted to support my passion for art. For a long time I said nothing, merely stared at him and he slowly began to frown with concern. \"Natalia? Are you angry?\" \"Angry?\" I laughed, shaking my head. \"Han, you're a damn complicated guy, you know that? There I am thinking I had you all figured out then you throw this at me? Hell, you're going to be keeping me on my toes, aren't you?\" He smirked at me then tugged me closer, holding me tightly. \"So twinkle toes, how about that drink?\" Without a word Han swept me up and carried me into a room, kicking the door firmly shut behind us as our lips locked into a fiery dance for dominance. And there it is. The end of the sequel to The Great Seduction. I hope you guys all enjoyed, thank you so much for all of your support, it really has been a blast writing for you all. I don't know if there will be a threequel but hey, stranger things have happened :D See y'all later! ","Summary":" I'm back baby, and so is Natalia! Introducing (very proudly) the sequel to 'The Great Seduction'! I"},{"Movie":"Red","Title":"The Great Seduction","Author":"Silver as the Rain","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11101905","Passage":"[Chapter 1] So this is my first RED fanfiction and it was requested by Shantygordon, so I hope you find this Shanty, it's dedicated to you!

Enjoy and I'll probably be updating chapters every few days or so, hopefully. \"Large cappuccino, extra frothy with a cheese and bacon melt, table four!\" Someone from the kitchen yelled as the items were brought forwards. Turning around with a tray I picked up the two plates and carefully placed them on before carrying them forwards. It's funny, this is exactly the kind of meal my dad would have ordered. \"Good morning, here's your drink and your panini, if there's anything else you need please don't hesitate to…\" When the newspaper folded down I looked up and my mouth fell open when I saw a familiar yet strange face. \"Dad?\" \"Hey baby.\" He said softly and instantly my mouth clamped shut. \"No. Oh no you are not going to interfere with this job, it's taken me weeks to find another after you totalled my chances in the last one! Remember? You trashed the place just because my ex-boyfriend was in the same room trying to kiss me goodbye.\" Glowering at him I shoved the panini across the table then sighed impatiently. \"What the hell are you doing here?\" I demanded as I tucked a stray lock of black hair back behind my ear. \"I need your help.\" Rolling my eyes I glanced around at the slow moving café before back at my dad. Frank Moses. Tagged RED by the government, the best badass father any girl could want, too bad he was a little too badass, especially when boyfriends were involved. \"It's been two months since you last called.\" I informed him and he looked down, unable to meet my gaze. My eyes softened slightly and I risked another glance around before taking the seat opposite him. For a moment there was an awkward silence where he sipped his drink then inspected the food cautiously. \"Dad, dad, its fine. Alright?\" To prove my point I took the sandwich from the plate and bit into it despite my dad's protests. He could be a little too overprotective sometimes and by that, I mean a lot. \"So who's trying to kill you this time?\" He sighed, looking at me with a slight frown. \"Everyone.\" \"When is it not?\" He shrugged in agreement then took a bite from the cheesy bacon, glancing around. Eyes fixated on him I sighed. \"Marvin, can you please stop trying to hide behind there? You're scaring the couple at table seven.\" Slowly a figure crept into view wearing a low hat, large overcoat and his clear blue eyes darted nervously around the place. Turning to look at him I stuck out my foot and dragged a chair to the table. \"Come sit with us.\" He sat down and I smiled, reaching over to hug him. \"How you been Marvin?\" \"Good apart from the fact I died and everyone's trying to kill me.\" He muttered monotonously and I grinned. \"You died again? What, isn't this like the seventh time now?\" He shrugged slowly with a slightly innocent look on his face. \"I don't know.\" Turning back to dad I sighed. \"Look dad, whatever is going on, whoever is trying to get you, you'll figure something out without me.\" Reaching across I took his hand. \"I made a promise myself not to get back into this sort of thing and so did you. Dammit dad you're retired! You promised me you'd make more time for me and Sarah. I still haven't even met her yet, by the way, so you should probably do something about that.\" My eyes slid slowly towards the counter where a new customer had just come in, wearing a loose black shirt tucked over and into his pants. \"Oh hell no, you've got to be kidding me.\" Marvin looked around to where I was discreetly looking then he paled visibly. As the guy slowly began to turn dad suddenly yelled. \"Get down!\" Springing across the table he slammed into me, knocking both Marvin and I backwards to the ground as bullets began to hit the wall where we had just been sitting. \"Dad! I'm so going to kill you for this!\" I bellowed as I pushed him off me then crawled forwards and grabbed my waitressing tray. Rolling onto my side I flung it forwards like a Frisbee as everyone screamed, either running to the door or coming out of hiding to shoot at us too. The tray hit the guy at the counter square in the face but I had already rolled forwards and locked my legs around another agent, sweeping him to the floor before taking his gun and whacking it across his face. Checking the mag I looked back to dad and Marvin as they finished off the other agents. \"Nice.\" I mused at the gun then looked up at Pete, the guy who owned the place. \"Sorry about the mess. Please don't fire me?\" I asked hopefully but he simply stared, trembling like a leaf before screaming. \"Get out! Get out! Don't come back! You're so fired Natalia!\" Ouch man, that hurt. Dad gripped my arm and pulled me up as Pete made a bolt for the back. I glared at him. \"Alright, since I have nothing better to do now anyway, let's go save your ass, okay?\" I armed the gun, pulling back the barrel before holding it up to the side of my face. \"This way.\" I led them through the kitchen, yelling for all the chefs to keep down as we took the stairs up to the roof. \"Where's your car?\" I demanded at dad as we stopped at the fire escape door. \"Couple of streets down.\" He answered, listening. \"All clear?\" I peeked out the window but saw nothing. \"Clear. I'll go first.\" Kicking the door open I stepped out and aimed, checking the surroundings before whistling to dad. \"You know, most daddies pay for their daughters to go to ballet class or gymnastics, Frank, not teach them how to fight and shoot guns.\" Marvin said as we headed forwards at a steady pace towards the ladder leading down into the street. \"Wha-she wanted to learn!\" Dad defended as I stuffed the gun into my jeans then looked over the edge. \"She asked me to teach her.\" \"Doesn't mean you actually agree, no wonder you're not teaching Sarah anything.\" I looked to dad with an amused look. \"She's interested is she?\" He stammered, mouth opening and closing uselessly as I looked to Marvin who rolled his eyes. \"You better keep her, dad, I like the sound of this one. She'll be good for you. Now, moving on.\" I flung myself over the side and gripped the edge of the ladder, sliding down easily until after a few moments my feet hit the ground again. When Marvin and dad had joined me I gripped his arm. \"By the way, dad, I did want to go to ballet class.\" I informed him then turned on my heel, sneakers squeaking before following Marvin, leaving a bewildered Frank Moses behind me. \"Why me?\" He complained. \"Why do all women hate me?\" I couldn't supress a grin as I listened to him complain as he hurried to catch up. \"Nat, come on, Nat, don't be like this. Baby please talk to me.\" He begged as I ignored him. \"What have I done now? Why are you angry at me? I'm sorry I came to you and asked for help but I don't have anyone else I can trust more than you.\" He paused. \"Apart from Marvin and Sarah.\" Spinning around in the middle of the street I placed my hands on my hips and glared at him. \"You know what dad? I'm not mad, I'm just upset.\" He nodded his head, telling me he was listening. \"Oh jeez.\" Marvin groaned then stepped away to give us some space. \"I'm not mad because I am so tired of trying to feel something towards you, anything at all! You did a great job raising me on your own but you pushed me more than you needed to. You were always teaching me to be more like you though you refused to let me follow in your footsteps. When I got older and started to date, you were always there breathing down my neck and scaring them all away because they were all too scared to fight back. Now I never see you. Ever. It's like…I don't know. It's like you don't even care anymore.\" \"Baby, it's not like that at all. I thought you wanted space.\" Dad tried to explain but I glared at him, making him fall silent. \"There's a difference between giving some space and not talking to me for two months solid!\" Throwing my hands up in the air I growled then rubbed my head, trying to get my thoughts into some sort of coherent manner. \"You're either too caring or don't care at all. I'm not sure which I prefer.\" Glancing back to Marvin I stepped a little closer to dad. \"Look, I'll help you however I can. Whether it's simply having your back or keeping Sarah safe, I don't mind. However after this, I want you to promise me that you'll try harder to be the dad that I need. I need you in my life because it's so damn lonely without you there. Can you promise me that, dad?\" His eyes bore into mine and when he nodded, I knew he meant it. \"I can baby. I promise I'll try.\" Opening his arms I stepped closer to him, allowing him to hug me, tucking my head onto his shoulder. \"God you're so beautiful. Just like your mother.\" I blinked in surprise. Dad never talked about mom. \"I know I've messed up too many times to count but you will always have me there, whether you can see me or not. I'll never abandon you.\" \"Not like mom.\" I muttered under my breath and he tensed before relaxing again. Before he could speak Marvin interrupted. \"Look I know this is a massive leap in this seriously messed up father daughter relationship but I think we need to get going if we want this relationship to remain intact before some more of those agents decide to blow a hole in it.\" He said monotonously and I laughed. \"I've missed you guys. Come on then, lead the way.\" Marvin led us into an empty street where a pretty woman leaned against a car, looking slightly miffed at being left behind. Instantly I beamed and strode ahead. \"Hi!\" I called and she looked up, instantly her eyes widened. \"Are you-? Is she?\" Sarah asked dad as I reached her and pulled her into a hug. \"I'm Natalia, you must be Sarah.\" She smiled as I pulled back from our hug. \"It's so good to finally meet you. Dad hasn't told me much but I'm glad we finally met.\" \"Yeah you too. You're his favourite pass time topic.\" Sarah said, shooting a look to dad. \"He's a little overprotective of you too, isn't he?\" Rolling my eyes I nodded. \"You have no idea.\" \"Well then, I think we should get talking. I have a feeling you and I have a lot of stuff to catch up on, seeing as your dad couldn't make the arrangements for us to meet earlier and under a less…life threatening situation.\" I got into the back with Sarah and instantly I found that I liked her very much, she was gutsy and very sweet. \"Dad hasn't given you a gun, has he?\" I asked and Sarah shook her head. Pulling the gun from my back pocket dad turned and frowned. \"Hey, hey, what are you doing?\" He demanded with a worried tone and expression but I merely grinned. \"It's a simple concept, you aim and fire. Pull back to arm.\" I demonstrated. \"Once you're clean out, you pull the mag out downwards, grab a fresh one then slide it back up.\" I reloaded to show her. \"Slap it up with your palm to make sure it's locked in then pull back the barrel to arm.\" Finishing off I held it out to her. Dad made a small sound of protest but Sarah was already grinning and taking the gun from my hands. \"Your daughter is way cooler than you are Frank.\" Sarah informed him as she pulled out the mag, reloaded then yanked back the barrel. \"Not so hard, you don't need to tear it off.\" I said as she mock aimed the gun towards Frank's head. Chuckling I pushed it away from where she was aiming it. \"Just in case.\" After a moment she handed it back to me. \"Yeah maybe I should get one with a safety lock.\" She decided as she shifted in her seat, tugging on the belt that strapped across her and continuing to wriggle until she was comfortable. After a long silence I decided to finally ask what in hell's name was going on. \"What the heck is going on, dad, Marvin? Either of you care to enlighten me?\" Marvin glanced back through the mirror at me so I gave him a stone dead look to assure him I was not going to mess around the well. I wanted the answers now before I threw him down into the water below. \"Ninety six hours ago someone posted a document online that said that you and I took part in an operation called Nightshade back in seventy nine.\" He said whilst looking at dad who merely nodded his head once with a deep frown of concentration. \"That's why you fake died?\" Sarah asked with a slight ring of uncertainty. \"Yep. The cheddar went through the roof.\" \"So everybody's after you for something they think you know that you don't even know at all?\" \"Classic pin up.\" I sighed. \"Set someone else up for the blame and they go after that person instead of you. Who could have done it though?\" Glancing at her feet she picked up a jar containing two rather venomous spiders. \"Oh my god, spiders!\" \"Ah, be careful with that. They're deadly.\" I warned her and she shot me a sidelong panicked look before hastily but carefully putting them down and lifting her feet off the floor. \"Listen honey, you need to get to ground and its best that I don't know where.\" Dad said as he looked back at Sarah who arched an eyebrow comically at him. \"Yeah I'm not going anywhere.\" Reaching back dad handed her a thick wad of cash and her eyes lit up. \"Cash only, no calls, no contact.\" \"Ooh thanks!\" She said as she pocketed the money then leaned forwards. \"Look.\" She finally sighed. \"I'm not hanging out in some bunker while you slink around and save the planet with Marvin and your daughter.\" She paused for a minute then frowned. \"Hang on a second, how come she doesn't have to go hide in a bunker?\" \"Because I need her with me, she's good at the sort of thing we do. I taught her myself.\" Sarah stared then looked at me so I offered a weak smile. \"Guilty.\" \"Oh man, that's so unfair.\" Sarah muttered under her breath. \"Sarah, Sarah look at me.\" Dad reached forwards and cupped Sarah's chin, making her look back at him. \"It's hard for me to be the kind of guy I need to be right now and do the kind of things I'm going to have to do with you there.\" \"This is going to be good for us.\" She kissed his forehead and I smirked slightly, looking out the window to hide my expression. \"Let's face it Columbo, things were getting a little stale.\" \"Wow, mommy just slapped daddy at the dinner table.\" Marvin mused lightly and I couldn't help but cackle. \"She's got you there dad.\" He shot me an unforgiving look. \"With the two of you paired up together, I'm actually afraid I'm not going to live through this.\" Sarah and I gave each other a secret smile of plotting until we both heard something screaming and banging from behind. Sarah blinked as I frowned, leaning back to listen closer. \"Is-is there a human being in the trunk?\" She asked. \"Yep.\" Marvin nodded simply, unfazed by the sound. \"Who is it, Marvin?\" Dad asked with a hard expression. \"It's uh…he's a senior director of military intelligence. I've been caramelising his onions for a few days.\" \"Caramelising how?\" Marvin shifted uncomfortably. \"Three tabs of acid and a lot of rats.\" He said and I honestly did not know whether he was joking or not. \"You're…kidding…right?\" I asked but Marvin just shot me a blank look. \"Damn.\" So tell me guys, what did y'all think? Hope it's okay and please R+R for me, bye![Chapter 2] Yawning I awoke slowly, stretching out I blinked myself awake before sitting up. I was in the back of the car, stretched out lazily, with my dad's jacket tucked over me. Smiling I swung my legs around and got out of the car, squinting as my eyes hit the harsh sunlight before adjusting. When I heard a slap I looked to the left. \"Hey, Marvin?\" I questioned as he hugged the director of military intelligence then slapped him again. \"You know there's always the, ask nicely with a please, way of going around things?\" \"Already tried that.\" He answered then jerked his thumb over his shoulder. \"Your dad is with the girl.\" \"Roger that.\" I sighed, yawning again before heading towards the couple. It was strange seeing my dad actually settled down for once with a woman. Sure he'd had a few girlfriends before but they all left pretty quickly when they couldn't handle him disappearing off all the time and when they couldn't tolerate my fighting any longer. Dad and Sarah seemed happy together, although he was extremely reluctant to let her have that taste of adventure that she so desperately wanted. If he could just learn to let go and involve her more with things like this, they would be set for life. Perhaps they would get married one day, I'd like to see him married for once, it would really finish the icing on his cake for the retired life he wants. \"Hey baby, you okay?\" Dad asked as I came closer, his jacket hooked over my arm which I handed back to him. \"Yeah, mind if I join you?\" \"Sure. Come sit down.\" Sarah brushed down an earthy patch then patted it for me to sit down on. Taking the place next to her I looked back to Marvin as he continued his interrogation. After a while of comfortable silence Sarah broke it softly. \"Where do you guys learn all this stuff?\" I looked across to dad who inhaled slowly then sighed. \"Manuals mostly.\" He watched Marvin as he hugged his prisoner. \"Some of this stuff you just can't teach though.\" I chuckled. \"Oh I don't' know. You taught me pretty well dad.\" He smiled slightly then shrugged. Sarah exhaled happily, grinning. \"Isn't this cool? We're on a mission together.\" \"Do you have any idea how many people are trying to kill us?\" Dad asked her seriously but she brushed it aside easily. \"Pretty much anyone and everyone as far as I know it.\" I piped up, leaning back into the warm sun as it brushed against my skin smoothly. \"You and I both know this is where you belong. Right here. In the thick of it.\" She had a point, clever girl. I was liking Sarah more and more, hands down the best girlfriend dad had ever found, maybe he finally got it right. \"Pussycat's right, Frank.\" Sarah looked at him triumphantly. He rolled his eyes slightly then stood, helping Sarah to her feet. \"Watch your step.\" He said but when he reached to place a hand on Sarah's hip, he felt something cold brush against his skin so I watched him pull out the gun. \"Come on! Where did you get this?\" \"Oh uh, Marvin gave it to me.\" Sarah said, dropping Marvin in the thick of it. Dad turned to face Marvin with a cold expression. \"You gave her a gun?\" \"It is America Frank.\" He defended simply, making me laugh as I jogged down to join them. \"Everyone else gets a gun, even Nat does! Why can't I have one too?\" Frank continued to focus on Marvin. \"She has no idea what to do with this!\" Sarah sighed impatiently with a roll of her eyes. \"I know exactly what to do with it.\" Taking it from dad's hand she tried to get a grip on the gun but instead fired it, the shot ringing out loudly, making the guy by the car scream and dive for the floor. \"Very smooth.\" I commented. Frank took the gun back then glared at Marvin, lowering his voice. \"You don't give fire to a kitten.\" He said then walked off. Slipping closer to Sarah I lowered my voice to whisper. \"Nice grip but it was too tight, especially with the trigger finger. Next time hold it securely with all other fingers and hand but keep the trigger finger loose until you want to use it.\" I said, grabbing the trigger finger to make sure she knew which one I was talking about. \"Got it. I'll remember for next time.\" \"Just don't tell dad or he'll try and ground me for a year.\" She winked at me then looped an arm through mine as we walked back towards the guys. Marvin was sitting in the trunk with the director of military intelligence whilst admiring his ugly spiders. They sent shivers down my spine, I seriously hated spiders, especially tarantulas. \"Tell them what you told me.\" He glanced nervously at Marvin and his spiders before beginning. \"During the cold war Nightshade was cooked up by a rogue US army general as a first strike capability against the soviets. That's it.\" He lifted his hands in surrender but Marvin didn't buy it. \"That's it? Really?\" He lifted the jar to tip the spiders down the guy's neck but he instantly cracked down. \"No! Okay at the height of the cold war a megaton yield device was smuggled into Moscow in diplomatic pouches piece by piece and then the weapon was lost. That's it. That's it I swear.\" I felt kind of sorry for the poor traumatised guy. \"You lost a nuclear bomb in Moscow?\" Sarah asked in disbelief. Suddenly the guy pointed his finger and added some more information to the stirring pot. \"The scientist, was Edward Bailey.\" He gave a firm nod of his head. \"That's it.\" Noticing the sudden change in Marvin and dad I glanced to Sarah who was as equally lost as I was. \"What?\" \"Made a mistake.\" Dad said quietly. \"Edward Bailey was a genius physicist who built some of the greatest stuff during the cold war, neutron bombs, particle beam weapons, nerve gas, excellent nerve gas. He was a rock star of conceptual mass killing, they called him the Da Vinci of death.\" Marvin began then dad continued. \"We were the security detail. Assigned to getting him in and out of Moscow safely.\" \"What happened?\" Sarah asked gently. \"We thought he was secure…soviets got him with a car bomb.\" As dad's mind wandered back through his memories I watched him seemingly grow older by the second. He seemed tired, really tired, as if all the life and energy was beginning to drain out of him. Reaching out I took his hand and held it gently, giving a little squeeze for comfort. \"It's my fault. He's dead.\" Marvin nodded his head then looked to dad. \"Run or fight?\" We all knew that running was never an option, not even with our case. We dropped off our prisoner for someone else to pick up then headed to a diner to eat and plan the next move. I gorged on my chocolate milkshake, burger and fries as the others located the web page where the information was placed. \"All we got is this page off the internet.\" Marvin informed monotonously. \"Out of a…Paris IP.\" Sarah announced as she found the information. \"Hmm, in Paris it could be anybody.\" I glanced around the diner, sucking the chocolate shake up through the straw before looking back to the page. \"Wait, wait just scroll back down a second?\" Sarah slowly scrolled down and I saw what dad had noticed. A large stain on the paper. \"Oh uh…coffee stain?\" \"Wine.\" I corrected her. \"You know what that means dad?\" \"Frog.\" The other two jerked up their heads, Sarah's face plastered with confusion. \"What?\" Just then Marvin's phone began to ring. That's a point, I should probably check mine. Flipping it open I scrolled through the endless streams of texts and missed calls I had from Jeremy. \"Who's Jeremy?\" Dad asked, seeing my screen. \"Oh come on dad, don't get all overprotective just because I'm talking to a guy.\" I sighed but he pointed. \"Why is he calling you baby? Only I can call you baby.\" Trying to hide the grin on my face dad leaned a little closer so I tried to hide the message that had just popped up. \"Oh no, you are not dating that guy from college, are you? That Jeremy? Why do you even have that anyway?\" \"Dad the line is safe, okay? It was a birthday present from Joe.\" Dad blinked in surprise but relaxed a little however the challenging look in his eyes did not disappear. \"Baby you know how I feel about that guy, he's a creep!\" \"We're not dating, dad, not in my books anyway. He's trying it on with me but I want nothing to do with him. Happy?\" Marvin held out the phone to dad who took it. \"We'll discuss this later.\" He warned me then turned to the phone. \"Yeah?\" Sarah reached over and squeezed my hand with a little wink. \"So who's Jeremy?\" \"This guy I used to go to college with. We did date for a little while but it ended pretty soon.\" I paused for reflection then grinned. \"In fact it was the only relationship I ended myself without dad interfering.\" \"Is he like that? Always sticking his nose where it doesn't belong?\" Sarah shot him a pointed look as he sighed then got up to walk a few steps away. \"You could say that. He's beaten up a fair few of my boyfriends until he sent them running. Soon word got out and everyone began to avoid me like I was toxic or something.\" Draining my milkshake I yawned then leaned back in my chair. \"I got a little angry that he'd unintentionally ruined my college years so we stopped talking for about a year until he needed my help getting a hostage out of a terrorist gang's headquarters. The girl was some kind of rich billionaire's daughter and her daddy paid the government to get her back before they began making demands.\" I grinned at her as she leaned forwards with interest. \"Well what happened?\" \"My dad got called in, he called in me. There wasn't enough time for me to actually get accepted into the gang or anything so I kind of seduced my way inside. Dad wasn't happy with it but there was little else we could do.\" \"Oh my god, did they hurt you?\" Lifting my shirt I showed her a pale scar on my belly, just over my hip. \"Knife. Just managed to avoid a serious injury but dad totally flipped. He went crazy. If you think you've seen him fight, it was nothing compared to what he was like then. It was like, I don't know, the bullets just bounced off him or didn't hit him at all as he got to me and carried me out of there.\" Sarah's eyes were wide with wonder. \"Wow…that is cool. What happened to the girl?\" I shrugged. \"She was a little beaten up but we got her out. Dad wouldn't let me go, not even to the paramedics when we got to the hospital. Insisted on carrying me all the way to the bed then held my hand all the way through as they stitched me up.\" I smiled weakly and looked down at my sneakers. \"It's a weird one but life and death situations really do bring families back together.\" \"Tell me about it. Your dad and I seem to just click so much better when we're doing stuff like this.\" Sarah agreed with a grin. \"It's just so much fun!\" \"Agreed, that's why dad likes you. Don't mind him being so overprotective. I found all you got to do is keep pushing back, spread your wings a little then eventually he'll cave in and follow your lead.\" When dad came back over slowly, his face was completely blank. \"Victoria just accepted a contract from MI6 to kill every one of us.\" Oh joy. \"Really? Are you kidding me? Who else is coming? The cavalry?\" I groaned then slammed my head onto the table with a grunt. \"This just keeps on getting better and better.\" \"You don't think she'd do that, do you?\" Sarah asked hesitantly. \"I don't think she would.\" \"She's a friend.\" Frank shrugged but Marvin was beginning to panic. \"Are you stupid? You don't take a contract out to kill a friend! She called to give us fair warning.\" Dad nodded to me so I stood and grabbed my phone, stuffing it into my back pocket then tugged my blouse to sit better on my body. I seriously needed a change of clothes. \"There's one more thing.\" Dad said and Marvin looked back at him. \"Han just went number one.\" Who the hell was Han? Marvin blinked then let his frustration out loudly to the entire diner. \"Why don't they just coat us all in honey then stake us to an ant farm?\" Ouch that sounded painful. I shuddered at the image playing in my head as I grabbed Marvin by the collar of his coat then pulled him around to head towards the door, dad and Sarah leading the way. When a guy came out too soon after us for Marvin's liking he whirled around to aim a gun at the man's head but I quickly grabbed his wrist and pushed it down. \"Crazy old bastard.\" The guy spat then hurried away. \"Easy there uncle Marv, it's just a guy from the diner wanting to leave.\" I patted his arm then led him after the others. After a moment Marvin spoke to dad. \"Frank do you feel old?\" \"Not really.\" \"Yeah me neither. I mean crazy sometimes, yes.\" He dumped the laptop into a canister then continued to walk away without breaking pace. \"So who's Han?\" Sarah asked. \"Yeah dad. Who is this other guy that wants to kill us?\" Dad glanced at me then answered. \"Korean.\" Well that sounds like trouble immediately. Those guys know how to fight and damn do they fight hard. \"Frank put him away in jail for a few years.\" \"We should be super scared of him then, huh?\" Sarah guessed as dad led her back to the car. \"Yes we should.\" Marvin grumped. \"He's the best contract killer in the world.\" Wow dad, you really know how to pick your enemies. \"Dad, why the hell did you bring me into this?\" I sighed as I yanked open the door. \"What were you thinking? Contract killers, Victoria, Nightshade? I don't understand any of this, let alone what I'm supposed to do.\" Dad reached over and gripped my shoulder. \"Baby, you are the one person in the world I can rely on to keep Sarah safe. I know it's unfair of me to ask this of you but…I just felt that you needed to be in on this one. I wanted a chance to try and fix everything that's gone wrong between us.\" \"And you think pulling me into a life and death situation is the way to fix it?\" He tried to answer but his mouth just opened and closed uselessly. Suddenly I smirked. \"Alright then. Let's hit it. As long as I get to kick some ass along the way, I'm in.\" When I was almost in I stopped then got back out. \"Oh and dad?\" \"Yeah?\" \"Loosen up the reins on Sarah just a little bit.\" I winked then slid into the seat next to her. You know the drill, R+R and thanks for stopping by. See ya![Chapter 3] The best thing about being the daughter of Frank Moses? Hell, I don't even know where to begin. Right now we were focussed on stealing the plane that belonged to Han Cho-Bai, the contract killer who was trying to kill us. Sweet! \"Alright dad, watch and learn.\" I paused as I undid my hair from its plait then looked to Sarah then winked at her. \"You too.\" With that I walked out, wearing her heels. They clicked softly against the ground as I held the clipboard casually in my arms, smiling as I walked towards the pilots. \"Good morning gentlemen, I trust the plane is ready for take-off?\" I questioned smartly, arching an eyebrow at them. \"Take-off?\" One of them frowned, glancing to the other. Looking down at my board I ran a finger down one side, pretending to look at the flight schedule. \"Why yes, this plane is scheduled to leave in ten minutes. Surely Mr Cho-Bai informed you he did not intend to stay very long?\" They both paled dramatically. \"Not to worry, is the gas full?\" \"It will be in just a moment, the truck is coming over right now.\" The one on the left assured me so I nodded my head with a little frown for thought. \"How did we not get this schedule?\" \"It was rather short notice, unfortunately I cannot personally assist every departure and flight pattern but since Mr Cho-Bai was so insistent on punctuality, I decided my attention was required here.\" Just then the truck pulled up and one of the pilots hurried to get everything moving quickly. \"Ah, very good. Everything seems to be coming together.\" I smiled at the young pilot, slowly taking in his features then pointedly drawing in his body. He smirked ever so slightly and I dipped a hip towards him, arching an eyebrow. \"Something you like, miss?\" \"Oh I couldn't say, not with that helmet on.\" I teased with a seductive smile. \"It shadows your face a little, you see.\" Without question he yanked it off then shook out his hair. Biting my lower lip I glanced around then stepped a little closer. \"Well, well, well, do I spy a little tattoo right there?\" I asked, tracing a finger delicately under his jaw where the tattoo lay inked onto his skin. Working as slyly as I could I reeled the guy in, seducing him until the gas was full and the truck began to pull away and drove off. Before the other pilot could come back I leaned in close to the pilot still with me, snaking my arms around his neck as his hands found my waist, reaching forwards eagerly with his mouth. Before he could blink I slammed my elbow down into the grove of his neck, knocking him out. Giving the signal I dragged the body backwards, tossing him onto a luggage cart as Marvin dealt with the other. \"You know it's very awkward watching my own daughter seduce a guy.\" Dad said as I climbed up the steps into the lavish plane. \"Then don't look.\" I shot back with a grin, kicking off the heels to exchange with Sarah for my old sneakers. \"Well this Han guy knows how to live the life.\" I mused, leaning back into the plush leather seats. \"Dad, camera in the corner.\" I nodded towards it and he approached to deal with it as Marvin took the cockpit. As the plane lifted off I noticed how much comfier a private plane was to a public one. For one there was more food and really nice wine. I wasn't much of a drinker but I did enjoy the odd glass every now and then. Sarah had found some old photos that she began looking through whilst I lay down and tried to grab some sleep. \"So how good is this guy?\" She asked. Marvin left his station to join us, flying on autopilot. \"Han is the best contract killer in the world. Let's just say Frank is in some very, very deep dog do.\" \"He's not going to kill me!\" Dad argued back loudly. \"Yeah. No one kills Frank Moses.\" Sarah agreed helpfully. \"Right!\" \"Yeah the people who he really doesn't like, he tortures for several days before killing…\" \"Hey can we just focus on trying to catch the frog?\" Dad asked and instantly Sarah was alert. \"Okay. What's the action plan for target acquisition and rendition?\" I cracked open an eye and shot her a grin as dad scowled. \"Marvin?\" Marvin looked up innocently. \"Quit teaching her stuff.\" I lifted a hand. \"Guilty.\" \"You too missy! We're still not finished with that conversation about Jeremy.\" He warned me so I sat up. \"You call that a conversation?\" Sarah laughed. \"Dad, its fine. He's just not getting the message. I want nothing to do with him.\" Settling back down I smirked. \"Besides he's not my type.\" \"Oh yeah? What is your type?\" Sarah asked curiously then prodded me in the stomach. \"Come on, tell me.\" Her voice was full of mischief and I chuckled as she began to tickle me. \"Okay! Okay! My type is a guy with muscle. Oh and accents. I love accents.\" Winking at her I watched as my dad's face went bright scarlet. Well it's not every day a child can tell someone they embarrassed their parents. The next conversation I didn't hear because I fell asleep, too tired to really focus on what was going on. When I woke up, however, I found myself just outside of Paris. Very nice. Sarah was so excited to be here, it seemed to glow from her radiantly as she struggled to keep still all the way on the bus journey into the heart of Paris. I sat away from the others, looking through my messages. I should really get a new number but that would then mean I would lose the safety of my phone and I didn't want that. With a soft groan I read the last message from Jeremy. He was such a slime ball, it was gross. Finally I decided what I was going to do. I deleted our entire history from my phone then blocked his number, hoping he would get the message. If not I could always find him and take a page out of dad's book. Getting off the bus I couldn't help but smile as Sarah gazed around her with a bright smile. \"Oh my god this is so romantic!\" \"Come on. Keep your head down.\" Dad sighed as he placed an arm around her then led her forwards, me tagging along behind with Marvin just in front of me. The hotel was nice and spacious. I could get used to this sort of lifestyle. Private plane, fancy hotel rooms, maybe a couple of parties thrown in? Sarah was listing off all the places she wanted to go to whist I walked along behind, thumbs deep in my work trouser pockets as I looked around at the architecture. When I walked into Marvin's back I blinked then looked up. Instantly my face fell into a hard glare as I watched a beautiful Russian woman stride forwards. \"Frank is that…?\" \"Hm.\" Dad answered distantly. \"Hello Frank.\" Katya smiled as she walked towards my dad. I seriously considered swooping in there and knocking her ass to the floor but Marvin held my arm to keep me in place. \"Have you seen her since?\" \"Nope.\" His attention was solely focussed on the woman walking at him as she sighed. \"God I've missed you.\" Sarah looked bewildered, lost and totally confused. \"Who is she?\" She asked softly. \"Trouble.\" Both Marvin and I answered at the same time. Before anyone could think what was happening that snake of a woman had grabbed my dad and dragged him into a hot, wet kiss. It made me shudder just to watch. \"Ahh, how are things?\" She murmured richly. \"Ye-yeah, Frank, how are things?\" Sarah demanded sarcastically. Dad turned around with a slightly shocked and awkward expression on his face as his voice shot up the scale. \"Sarah! This is Katya.\" He laughed uneasily. \"Yeah…\" suddenly her eyes shifted to me and I scowled at Katya pointedly. \"Oh look at you, beautiful Natalia, it's been years.\" She smiled broadly as she looked me over. \"You've grown tall.\" I arched an eyebrow. \"Compared to you, everyone is tall.\" I shot back and she chuckled with good humour. \"I'm glad to see you're still as humorous as you were last time we met. It's good to see you so well.\" Looking away I didn't even bother to answer. She ran her hand over dad's cheek then pointed to him. \"I need to speak with you, immediately.\" As she walked away, Sarah finally let her fake smile go. \"What the hell was that?\" Marvin kept his voice low as he answered. \"Katya Petrokovich. Russian counter intelligence.\" \"I think we should hear what she has to say.\" Dad said rather dumbly then went to follow. I threw up my hands then held them out towards him disbelievingly. \"He never learns! Never!\" Growling and cursing under my breath I followed him. She led us into a large retiring room but I didn't sit anywhere near them, I wanted nothing to do with her after what she did to my dad. Filthy pig. I sat at a window ledge, looking out over the beautiful city of Paris, hoping that I hadn't been stupid and left the water running at home. Thanks for reading, see you in the next chapter?[Chapter 4] Unfortunately my dad was still a thickhead and a moron. Katya was welcomed onto the team. At least, by him she was. I just continued to shoot her looks of death until finally, we were all set up. I sat opposite Sarah, reaching under the table with my foot to tap her leg so she would look at me. I gave her a strong smile which she returned slightly. \"So they call him the Frog because he's French?\" She asked and Katya scoffed. \"No. No he poisoned the water supply at Katribi headquarters with an Amazon tree frog poison.\" Well that's nice. Perhaps I'll take a few tips from him and poison your wine, Katya? Rolling my eyes I looked away, cracking my knuckles quietly as I risked a glance over my shoulder. He was sat at the window alone at the moment, looking down at the wine he had ordered. \"The hardest part is going to be taking him alive.\" Dad murmured. \"I'm still up for seducing him into a trap. I could do it.\" I offered but dad instantly shook his head. \"No you're not going anywhere near him. It's too dangerous.\" \"But dad, if you wanted me here then what's the use of me being here if you won't let me help you.\" His expression told me that I wasn't going to change his mind. \"This sucks.\" \"Tell me about it.\" Sarah agreed. We made our move one by one to get into position. \"Damn stupid Russian woman thinking she can order me around like I'm a piece of hightail junk.\" I muttered under my breath, storming across the street before entering the café with the Frog just on my left. \" Monsieur! Monsieur! Un table se il vous plaît !\" I called, snapping my fingers. \"Un table pour trois personnes, immédiatement.\" The waiter nodded his head politely. \" Qui mademoiselle.\" He answered then led me to a table, flicking away a stray petal from the flowers then pulled out the seat for me. I ordered some coffee and a big slice of chocolate cake, telling him to come back when he saw two ladies walk in, one wearing a black jacket with a purple hat and the other with red hair. My cake and coffee came together so I enjoyed them, sighing contently as the chocolate took over my senses, calming me in a strange way. Katya walked in and the waiter instantly showed her over. She ordered some coffee also, exactly the way she had always had it before. Large cappuccino, extra hot and extra frothy, just like dad has it. He had started ordering his like that after they had got together. Sitting across from her I tried my best not to scowl but kept up a bubbly persona, talking to her about nothing in particular. We made up our conversation, talking about family and my travels as such whilst I asked her about the shops she had visited in Paris and asked for any recommendations. I needed some new clothes anyway, might as well make this conversation informative. After a while Katya excused herself to order some wine from the bar so I watched her go then instantly sighed. Listening carefully to the Frog converse with his companions, I wondered why he would sell such important details to such horrible people. People who could do so much damage and wrong. It was both infuriating and heart breaking. When I heard the chair scrape back I turned my head and almost cried out when I saw the Frog whip out a knife and throw it at Sarah who was staring at him right in the eyes. Dad clapped his hands together, trapping the blade. Damn, I'll have to remember to ask him to teach me that little trick. Drawing out a gun he began to shoot at the ceiling, making everyone inside scream in fear and race for the exits. I dived for the ground, yelping as something sharp sliced my hand, broken glass. Blood gushed from the wound but I ignored the stinging burn to crawl towards dad. \"Dad!\" I called out and he looked at me. \"Natalia!\" He stared at the blood pouring from my hand but I merely continued to crawl forwards. \"Slide me a gun!\" \"You're hurt, you need to get out-\" \"Just hand me a flipping gun!\" I yelled across him and he blinked before pulling one from behind him then slid it across the floor to me. Grabbing it I armed then turned, firing at the pillar where the Frog hid. Rolling carefully I flipped a table up onto its side, using it as a barrier then shoved it to the side, moving around then risked a shot. Before I could shoot the glassware behind me shattered and the window exploded around me, making me cry out in surprise and duck down to shield my head from the glass that glittered onto the floor like a thousand diamonds. Shaking slightly I growled then sat back up, shooting at the Frog as he tried to make his escape. Shooting towards me I ducked down out of the way as Katya and dad continued their volleys but the Frog slipped through the open door and disappeared from sight. \"Holy crap!\" I growled. \"This is insane!\" Looking down at my hand I bit my lip then grabbed a napkin, pressing it against the deep cut on the palm of my hand, stemming the flow. \"Nat, Nat baby are you alright?\" Dad called out to me. \"Never been better, let's go get that asshole.\" He nodded then ran out the café after our target. Stuffing my gun safely away I hurried after him then stopped, looking around for some sort of transport. Giving up I ran after dad, hoping that he had already caught the Frog and we could all go home and get some sleep. However when I raced around the corner I saw dad getting into a super nice car with that Russian bitch, leaving me behind. \"Oh great, now what?\" I sighed then cracked my neck. \"Time to get those legs moving, Nat.\" I muttered then sprinted forwards. I took a shortcut across the street, leaping over the bridge to then racing through stalls and down over the bridge, watching as the Frog took a cut down some steps on the opposite side. \"You little…\" I growled, flinging myself over a stall to try and keep up with the others. Sarah and Marvin drove after the Frog in a beat up old Beetle, barely manoeuvring out of the way of civilians. \"What is she thinking?\" I gasped for air, hammering my feet against the ground as I took another cut up some steps and across the streets, down an alleyway, hoping to come out on the other side where the Frog was heading. Sure enough I sped out of the alley as he shot by, Sarah not too far behind. Taking a deep breath I launched myself forwards and caught onto the roof of the car and held on for dear life as she madly drove after him. We went down some pretty crazy routes until finally she went down a no entry street. No entry for one reason, cars did not fit. I tried to hammer on the roof to tell her to reverse but she didn't listen, merely called out with wild laughter as she drove. Gulping down some air I let go of the car as it began to peel against the sides of the alley, slowing it down slightly. Turning I rolled into a break fall, abdorbing the impact into my shoulder. Still hurt a little though. \"Ouch.\" I muttered then staggered to my feet, rubbing my head as I slowly walked back. I climbed over the car, glancing to Sarah through the windscreen then tried to help push them back as she angrily put it into reverse. Gradually we got it free. We drove back to the Frog's house where I sat down and ignored the others, dealing with the deep cut on my hand. The napkin was sticky with blood so I tossed it into the bin, found a bathroom then washed it clean. There was even a medical kit in the bathroom so I wound a bandage tightly around it to keep it safe from infection or irritation. Walking back I arrived just in time to witness Sarah's master seduction. \"Please…please help us.\" She whispered into the kiss as she gazed at the Frog. \"We need this information. You'll be helping us save the world.\" As she drew back I saw the baffled expression on the Frog's face. \"Please.\" She added for good measure. I grinned secretly. The Frog hummed in thought, gathering his concentration together before nodding. \"You'll I'll help.\" He decided. He went over to a desk and searched through the drawer, riffling through the odd assortment of items before producing a key which he offered to Sarah. She took it, kissing his hand as she did so then went to walk away. However she paused when she stood next to Katya. \"And you can suck it.\" She smirked then strode off. \"Honey, sweetie…\" Dad tried to talk with her but she continued past him. \"Seriously? You hooked up with that?\" Rolling my eyes I shook my head at dad then followed after her. \"Sarah come on, please don't be upset.\" I called out to her. Her shoulders shook as she tried her best not to cry. \"Hey, come on. It's okay.\" I said soothingly, taking her shoulder then pulled her into a hug. \"What you did in there was great! A true seductress in the making.\" \"Really?\" She asked, genuinely happy I had said that. \"I did okay?\" \"Totally.\" I confirmed then grinned. \"Although we need to work on your voice. You squeak a little and you need to close your eyes a little more so that they're half lidded, guys go crazy over that sort of thing.\" She smiled slightly, laughing weakly as she wiped the tears from her face. \"I just, just…I didn't want them to see me like this.\" \"I won't tell.\" I promised her gently. \"Hey, you're the greatest girlfriend my dad has ever had. I've seen them all, met them all and hated them all except you. I genuinely like you, Sarah, you're a good person and you make my dad really happy. He loves you. So don't you worry about some Russian trailer trash that's just waltzed back on scene. He'll stick by you, I'll bet my life on it.\" Her smile grew a little wider. \"Seriously?\" \"As serious as serious can get. You know I told you what dad used to do to all the boyfriends he didn't like?\" She nodded. \"Well I kinda did the same to any girlfriend he brought home. I'd test them to see if they were good enough for him. None ever were.\" I hugged her again, rubbing a hand on her back. \"So don't you worry about a thing. Okay?\" \"Okay. Thanks Nat, I really needed that pep talk.\" \"Always here.\" I assured her just as the others walked out. We returned to the hotel and thankfully, Katya parted ways. I camped out in dad and Sarah's room since that was where everyone else was. Sarah stood at the full length mirror, trying to decide between two dresses. \"Is that the same dress?\" Marvin asked unhelpfully as he lay back on the sofa. She blinked. \"They look the same to you?\" \"Ignore him, Marvin can't tell a monkey's ass from an elephant's nose. Let's have a look.\" She held them up for me to see so I could inspect them closely but her face was miles away. \"No one ever called me Frank Moses's kryptonite.\" Marvin shrugged. \"Frank's crazy about you. I've never seen him afraid about anything except losing you. \"Uncle Marv is right. Dad's not even as worried about me than he is of you.\" I put in, picking up the strapless dress and held it out to her. \"This one.\" \"But you can fight and take care of yourself. I'm just…deadweight.\" She looked down, letting both arms go limp with the dresses still in her hands. \"What if I'm ruining his life?\" Marvin sighed and I sensed he was going to say something stupid. \"Frank is a very simple creature with very simple needs. That is killing, eating, sexting, eating…killing, I guess.\" Yes, there we go. Something stupid. \"What's your point?\" However Marvin's mind was off track now. \"Can't believe you kissed the Frog.\" \"Yeah, I kissed a lot of frogs.\" She answered, tossing the dresses onto the bed. \"You and me both sister.\" I sighed, stretching out on the sofa. Just then dad entered the room, smiling cheerfully. \"Got something for you Marvin.\" He said then lifted up the key. I buried my head under a pillow, wanting to sleep but I couldn't be bothered to go all the way across the hall to my own room. When I heard a knock on the door, however, I was instantly up and a gun was in my hand, backtracking towards Sarah who went perfectly still. \"Stay here.\" Dad murmured as he got up and cautiously went to the door, Marvin close behind with his revolver. \"Keep close to me.\" I murmured and Sarah scooted closer, her hands fisting into the back of my tank top as I kept my gun aimed at the door, heartbeat steady as a war drum. When I heard the Russian accented voice, I scowled then lowered my aim. \"She's back.\" I put the gun back away then strode over to the table to grab some grapes from the fruit bowl. \"Want me to shoot her anyway?\" \"Yes.\" Sarah instantly answered. \"No.\" Dad tossed over my shoulder so I slumped into a chair and watched the door with a dark, heated glare. I heard her say something but I couldn't make out what however I smirked when Marvin shut the door in her face. \"Frank what're you doing? She's kryptonite, what are you doing?\" \"I'll handle it.\" He insisted. Finally I cracked. I leaped up and slammed a fist onto the table. \"Don't you ever learn? For heaven's sake, dad, she cares more about her country than the ever will about you. Why can't you just learn from the mistakes you made years ago?\" \"Natalia, don't you dare talk to me like that.\" He warned but I was already on a roll. \"You always do this. You always make promises that you'll do better, that you'll be there for me and for Sarah but you go off and do something so completely imbecilic! Like going off with a woman who has betrayed you before and probably won't hesitate to do so again.\" Storming forwards I slammed my gun onto the table. \"I'll be in my room if you need me to save your rear.\" Shoving past him I tore open the door, making Katya jump in surprise. \"And you can shove your head way up your ass!\" I stormed past her, opened my room then slammed the door shut with a satisfying bang. Grabbing a pillow I screamed in frustration, muffling the sound. Why did dad always have to forget what was right in front of him? The important things? Important things like Sarah, Marvin and me. Throwing myself onto the bed I got some sleep, knowing that I was only ever this short tempered when I was tired.[Chapter 5] When dad wakes up, I am going to murder him. Firstly though I'm going to go shopping with Sarah. It was rather fun, actually, although I wasn't a big fan of girly dresses we would grab anything we wanted off the rails, no matter what the price, then take them to the dressing rooms to change and present our new outfits to one another, trying to make the most expensive one. I think the most expensive my outfit got was one thousand two hundred and thirty six euros worth of expensive fashion. I loved it because I tried it on, felt fabulous then didn't have to pay when I handed it back, saying that it was not what I was looking for. In the end I bought some black jeans, black tank top then also a slim fitting leather jacket to go on over the top. Sarah talked into buying some badass boots since my sneakers were practically falling apart. They were basically your ordinary combat boots with lace ups. Very biker girl. When I realised how much black I was wearing, I bought a brand new bright red cocktail dress with dad's money, seeing as he owed me a few Christmas and birthday gifts anyway. Satisfied we bought some ice cream from the change we had then headed back to the hotel. \"I can't believe your dad allowed himself to get drugged by that…slut bag!\" Sarah cursed as we headed towards the elevator. \"Me neither. When I next see her I swear I'm going to punch her in the face.\" Sarah smirked, obviously liking the image of Katya with a broken nose. When headed back to Sarah's room and let ourselves in. \"He still not awake?\" I asked, looking at the sofa where Marvin had unceremoniously dumped my dad last night when we had found him crashed out at a table. \"Nope.\" He answered, not even looking up from his paper. \"Did you girls buy the entire shops or something?\" \"Haha very funny Marv.\" Sarah grunted as she lifted her bags then placed them on the bed. \"Hey don't look at me, most of these are hers.\" I argued, putting them all on the bed before grabbing the bag where my new clothes lay. \"I'm going to take a shower, call me if he wakes up?\" \"Sure.\" Sarah agreed, shooting him a harsh glare. I went into their bathroom, not bothering to go all the way back to my room just to shower and change. I washed my hair and took all the sweet time in the world, knowing that it was unlikely I would be able to shower again for another few days. Once I felt fresh faced and clean again I dried off, dressed then walked out. \"Damn, that must have been some strong stuff.\" I mused as I watched Sarah poke at him. She peeled open an eye then frowned at him. \"Hm.\" She murmured then slapped him across the face, paused then did it again. \"He's out.\" \"He might be awake.\" Marvin reasoned thoughtfully as he peered closer. \"Oh good so he can feel it.\" She answered back then slapped him again as hard as she could across his cheek. Dad woke up a little, managing to move his head a bit to stare with wild eyes at Sarah as she loomed over him menacingly. \"Did you ever, ever in your entire career…\" She began to yell, grabbing his jacket to shake him. \"Let yourself get drugged?\" She dropped him. \"You still like her!\" She growled with frustration. \"And now she has the key!\" \"Well, she doesn't have the key she has a key.\" Marvin corrected calmly and Sarah turned, blinking in surprise. \"What?\" \"Well I knew she would play him like a banjo in a hoedown so I have the key.\" There was a short silence where dad tried to speak. \"Water.\" In answer Sarah just slapped him again. \"Hey, that actually looks rather therapeutic, can I try?\" I asked, storming over. \"Go for it, knock yourself out. Try knock him out too whilst you're at it. Again.\" She hissed at him, getting up and left. I watched her leave then sat down beside dad. Looking down at him I sighed, shaking my head. \"You screwed up again, dad.\" I told him simply. \"You're going to have to work double time in order to get her back on your side.\" He tried to ask for water again so I nodded to Marvin who reached out and handed me the glass on the table. \"Here.\" Lifting his head gently I tipped the water into his mouth bit by bit until it was all gone. \"Now you listen to me and you listen well, dad, because I am sick and tired of trying to tell you.\" I pointed to Sarah who had her back turned to us as she sorted through her shopping gear. \"That woman is the best thing that has ever happened to you since mom left. You are going to fall on your knees and beg her to forgive you for taking off with that stupid Russian tramp because you thought you could trust her. Sure, you want to protect her, I understand that but what you've got to realise is that if you don't let her have some breathing space and allow her to grow into this sort of life, your relationship with her is going to end. Badly. You got that?\" He nodded so I sighed. \"Listen to your daughter, Frank, women are always right, even when they're wrong.\" I smirked slightly and gestured to Marvin. \"You see? He gets it. I've seen how Sarah has been in all the situations we've been in and she could be good at this if you would just let her try. Alright? Once you're able to walk again we'll get moving.\" With that I got up and left him to recover on the sofa. Later on, about an hour later, dad was on his feet and back to normal. I helped Sarah gather her bags and carry them to the taxi whilst she strode sexily out, wearing a cute black maxi dress, luxurious fur coat, black sunhat, shades and Jimmy Choos. I put her bags into the back then stretched, making discreetly sure that my handgun was well hidden. \"We didn't come to Paris on vacation.\" Dad complained at Sarah who blinked. \"Oh, I thought shopping is what you did in Paris, with your boyfriend's money, whilst you're waiting him to wake up from being taken down by his skanky, slutty, Russian, bitch ex-girlfriend.\" She shrugged. \"So thanks, thanks for the compliment, for telling me that I look nice in my dress and it makes me feel really good and it makes me very loving towards you also.\" She slammed the door shut and the car suddenly drove off before I could get in. \"Oops. Nice one dad. Real smooth.\" I informed him then sighed. \"Why is she doing this to me?\" He asked in honest bewilderment. \"You honestly want me to answer that?\" I questioned and he hesitated before shaking his head. \"We can get another taxi over here.\" Marvin gestured to around the corner so we all headed that way. \"Listen Frank I got to tell you something. You've got to start to learn how to share your feelings to evolve your relationship even if it seems uncomfortable at first. Say you were pinned down in a firefight, what do you do?\" Trust Marvin to link this back to guns. \"You make the run.\" Dad answered simply. \"Yes! You have got to make the run to emotional safety.\" I arched an eyebrow. \"Wow uncle Marv, if I knew you were so good at giving love advice, I'd have come to you on all of my boyfriends.\" Dad shot me a dark look and I grinned at him. I love annoying him. When he turned around I saw his entire body stiffen and instantly knew something was wrong. \"Han.\" He murmured then grabbed both Marvin and I, pushing us to the ground just as bullets began to fire at us. \"Holy crap!\" I yelled, covering my head as the powerful bullets tore through the vehicles we were hiding behind. Sucking in a deep breath I began to army crawl forwards after my dad, flinching as the metal crunched with loud thuds off everything the bullets hit. There was a pause and a softly lilting accent shouted out at us. \"You dead yet Moses?\" \"Not yet!\" Oh great going dad, such a genius. When the bullets started up again I whimpered slightly as the roof of the van exploded, shattering completely. \"Dad! Are you insane?\" I yelled over the noise until it went all quiet again. \"Where's. My. Plane!\" Okay so maybe his voice wasn't as soft and lilting as I had originally thought. \"In my ass!\" \"Dad shut up you moron!\" I bellowed back at him as the bullets began to hit at us again. As he fired back at Han Marvin began to call back. \"It's in an airport outside of Paris called…\" \"Shut up Marvin!\" We both bellowed. Reaching over I grabbed his jacket then hauled him forwards, crawling with him over to dad. Marvin curled up close, tucking his head safely underneath dad's who stopped firing. \"Marvin?\" \"Yeah?\" \"Is that a stick of dynamite in your pocket?\" \"Yeah but I was saving it for an emergency.\" Slowly I turned my head and simply gave him a look that read my father's next words only with a little more heat. \"Well, this is kind of an emergency, isn't it?\" No kidding maestro. Can we get out of here before I become some sort of Swiss cheese? Dad set up the dynamite, tossed it under a car then we scrambled for the man hole in the ground. I was tossed down first without me even having time to protest. I landed on the bottom then scrambled out the way as Marvin leaped down after me. \"Next time, we're getting our own bloody car and I'll drive us away. Not some stupid taxi!\" I growled, rubbing my back tenderly. \"Then maybe, we won't get our asses shot at by some crazy Korean killer!\" \"Whatever you want baby. Are you hurt?\" Dad instantly fussed, grabbing my hand as he strode down the sewers. \"I'm fine.\" I snapped back. \"Just can't wait to stick a few bullets in that guy's head.\" \"He'll kill you first.\" I shrugged, knowing Marvin was right but I wasn't going to admit that. Not yet anyway.[Chapter 6] I stood outside, keeping watch as the others delved into the Frog's secret box thing. It was all pretty quiet, no one walking by so when they came out pretty soon after going in, we headed away. \"So where are we going now?\" \"London.\" Dad answered simply and I blinked. \"London? Why do we need to go there?\" \"It said something about ice.\" Sarah told me but that seriously did not help. What did she mean ice? \"Incarcerate Cannot Execute.\" Oh I get it now. \"Wait so, MI6 have someone on ICE. Who?\" They all shrugged in unison. \"We don't know yet but they've been that was for thirty two years.\" Dad answered quietly as we walked through security. This time I did the arranging for flight patterns since last time Marvin did it and we were held up for an hour waiting for a runway to be cleared for us. I arranged for a jeep to be brought down for us to take, making sure that my details were false and untraceable before giving everyone else the go. The flight over to England took less than half an hour which was nice. I took a nap, seeing as there was nothing else to do and the awkwardness between dad and Sarah was beginning to affect Marvin and I. We landed, picked up the jeep then drove towards London. I read a book, occasionally looking up to see either my dad looking at Sarah or Sarah looking at my dad but never at the same time. It was kind of nerve wracking, waiting to see who would crack first. When I felt the jeep roll to a halt I looked up. \"How could she have possibly found us?\" Dad asked aloud as I looked forwards to see Victoria standing in the road, wearing army combats and carrying a sniper. Slowly dad looked around to Marvin who shifted uncomfortably. \"Because I called her and told her we were coming.\" We all stared at him in silence. \"Well I couldn't take the pressure of not knowing.\" I watched dad reach for his gun so I did the same, swallowing the lump in my throat. \"Why isn't she shooting at us?\" Dad murmured quietly, glancing at Marvin before putting the car into reverse. When I heard the shot fire and the wheel go, we slid down into the ditch on the side of the road, Sarah falling back into my arms as we were thrown off balance. \"She's not going to kill us dad. It's Victoria.\" I sighed, opening the door and getting out. The moment I stepped out my eyes locked on Victoria. Grinning I waved and she smiled broadly. I jogged up the bank and called out her name. \"Aunty Victoria!\" I flung my arms around her and she held me in a tight one armed hug as the other held her big sniper. \"Hello darling, oh I've missed you. Look how much you've grown!\" She fussed, reaching forwards to pinch my cheek then brush away some imaginary mud. \"Staying out of trouble I hope?\" She questioned but I rolled my eyes. \"With a role model like Frank Moses, is there any hope for me at all?\" Victoria laughed then approached the others. We all set up the crash, burning the car and putting fake bodies into the car. I refused to touch the corpses, I left that to dad and Marvin who didn't seem to mind so much. \"That should buy us twenty four hours.\" Victoria called back as Sarah carefully tottered down the slope to her. \"Hello sweetie.\" She smiled as she hugged her. \"Where did you get the bodies?\" Sarah asked as we turned to watch the warm flames flicker brightly before us. \"My freezer.\" Both Sarah and I turned to look at her, slightly shocked and a little disgusted, in the best of ways of course. Once we were all safely tucked away in Victoria's car we drove the rest of the way into London. To be honest I didn't do much, only kept Marvin and Sarah out of trouble whilst dad and Victoria went to get find out exactly what Nightshade was from the guy held in ICE. I wish I had gone with them. Marvin was constantly trying to get out his gun to shoot suspecting agents trying to kill us. No matter how many time I confiscated a weapon from him, more just kept cropping up so in the end I just sat him down on a bench and made him stay perfectly still like a scolded toddler on the naughty step. Sarah kept on rushing in and out of shops so many times I lost track of where she was and every time she gave me a heart attack in my panic. It was like looking after two seriously badly behaved, over excited children. When dad finally came back, without Victoria, I was glad to have him there to keep an extra set of eyes on everyone. \"Who is that? Where's Victoria?\" I demanded quietly, looking to the elder man as he stared in awe around him, humming absently. \"Doctor William Bailey.\" He informed me. \"Victoria stayed behind to gather some more information.\" \"Yes? Someone shout?\" The doctor turned around and smiled. \"Hello there little one. Would you like a sweetie?\" He dug into his pocket and drew out a very tatty, old, musty packet of mints. \"No…thank you.\" I recoiled slightly from the sight. \"That's very kind of you.\" \"Not at all. You just let me know should you change your mind. What did you say your name was?\" \"I didn't.\" I blinked with a frown. \"I'm Natalia.\" \"Ah! Natalia. Are you related to my good friend? She was called Natalia too.\" Slowly I shook my head with a confused frown. Grabbing dad's arm I drew him closer so I could lower my voice into a whisper. \"Please tell me you haven't brought me another adult with the mind of a three year old to keep an eye on because honestly, I struggle with just these two.\" He gave me a weak laugh. \"Baby, it's not so bad. We just need to get to Moscow so he can show us where he hid Nightshade.\" I arched an eyebrow at him. \"Well then. He's your responsibility. I'm going to buy some coffee, something deep friend, calorific, smothered in grease and stuff it into my face.\" Turning I headed off. \"Ooh that sounds great! I want some too.\" Sarah called then chased after me. \"Yeah I'm hungry as well. Wait up.\" Marvin yanked his hat lower over his head as he followed. \"I love crumpets. Especially with butter. Very tasty.\" Bailey murmured dreamily then began to wander off after us, leaving dad behind with a confused and slightly lost expression on his face.[Chapter 7] Sorry for the delay guys but next chapter is here, hope you enjoy it! I have no idea why but recently I've been sleeping so easily, it's like my body has no clue what the right time was. It was probably because we've done so much traveling in such a short amount of time. So I slept pretty much all the way to Russia. I was glad I had bought this jacket but wasn't too sure how warm it would keep me. The moment we landed however, we were greeted with the friendly hand of an entire escort of guns pointed right at us. \"Oh crap.\" I cursed. \"Now what?\" \"Just let it go with the flow.\" Dad suggested. \"Come on.\" So with his hands up he got out of the plane. I followed next with a reassuring smile at Sarah. The Russians waited until we were all out of the plane before escorting us towards the hanger. I stood behind dad, feeling his arm reach behind to guide me further behind him protectively but I stayed slightly in view, wanting to see who it was we were meant to meet. When a smaller man turned into view I blinked. \"Ivan?\" I questioned and he beamed. \"Welcome my friends!\" He looked to me then lifted his hands. \"Natalia, how good of you to visit. Last I saw you were only tiny girl.\" He gestured to the floor, making out the rough size I had been when I had last seen him. \"It's good to see you Ivan.\" I agreed, relaxing. \"Hey wait, how come you know him?\" Dad demanded in confusion, looking between us. I scratched my head. \"Well, when you were off doing whatever it was you did back in the day and you used to get aunty Victoria to babysit me well…sometimes Ivan stopped by. He used to bring me chocolate mint creams.\" I remembered that part very clearly. Ivan gave me a little wink before turning to Doctor Bailey. \"So, it is true, you're alive! Tell me then doctor, where is this device?\" Ivan asked calmly. \"Who?\" Blinking in surprise, Ivan wasn't sure whether to take the doctor seriously or not. \"Work in progress.\" Dad whispered quietly. \"Ivan I'm really sorry but we need to get into Moscow as soon as possible.\" I murmured gently, taking his arm. \"We think maybe if we took the doctor there he would, you know, remember a little better. So…could you help us? Please?\" \"But of course my sweet little mint cake.\" He lifted my slightly cold hands and kissed them. \"I shall help you. Of course I shall.\" Smiling broadly I nodded at him as he chuckled. \"You have grown into very strong young woman. Your father should be proud.\" \"I am.\" Dad answered quietly and I blinked at him, unsure how to respond. He gave me a warm, loving smile then turned to follow Ivan as he led the way to our transport. \"I never thought I would be smuggling Frank Moses into the heart of mother Russia.\" Ivan declared as we approached the army truck. \"Yeah me neither.\" Dad murmured under his breath, making Sarah smirk a little before she quickly hid it away again. \"Oh, oh before I forget, Frank, a little something.\" He held up a little pot containing two blue pills. \"In case you get caught or if Han catches you.\" \"He won't.\" I said over my shoulder, pausing in my climb into the truck. \"I'll kick his ass all the way back to Korea before I let him touch my dad.\" With that firmly declared I swung up into the truck then hid towards the back. It was a bumpy ride and on several occasions I was thrown into someone's lap, sometimes Marvin's or dad's but once or twice it was one of the Russian's. I kept on blushing furiously and muttering apologies in Russian as I tried to hang onto my seat. Once I had got to grips with the balance thing I was alright though. We were dropped off into Moscow and we began to walk, dad leading the way. I think he said he had a safe house somewhere around here? However no sooner had we touched down, trouble found us. \"We have eyes on Frank.\" Marvin warned and I began to slowly look from side to side, keeping my guard up. He hit so suddenly that by the time I had turned around, he had struck down Marvin and the doctor with vicious blows and was about to strike a punch to Sarah's jaw. I whipped out a leg, tugging her ankle out so that she fell before the blow could land then I flipped over, moving my foot to catch her head in the grove of my ankle so that she didn't hit the ground too hard. \"Dad!\" I cried out as I saw him fly through a window, the Korean prowling after him. \"Where's my plane?\" He demanded in a dangerously calm voice. Shifting my foot out from under Sarah's head I got to my feet. \"Stay down, keep close to Marvin. Marvin? Marvin!\" I yelled, reaching out and shaking him awake as he groaned. \"Keep Sarah and Doctor Bailey safe.\" I commanded then ran into the shop. \"They paid me to kill you. They didn't say I had to do it all at once.\" Grabbing a tin from a shelf I whistled. \"Hey buddy. You play baseball?\" I called as he spun around. \"Batter up.\" Swinging my arm I flung the tin just as his face turned to me. The tin hit him bang slap on the middle of his forehead. \"Strike one.\" I smirked, picking up another then whipped it out swiftly, striking his gut and doubling him over. \"Strike two.\" The last tin still intact on the shelf crept into my hand as Han stood back up. Arching an eyebrow I flung the last one at him just as dad kicked him from behind in the back. The result was a priceless hit to the groin. Han cursed in his own language as I brushed my hands together. \"Strike three. You're out.\" With a sharp hiss I swung a leg out to kick him but he blocked, getting up onto his feet and he lunged for me. I ducked and curled up, spinning down to whip out both legs from underneath him but he jumped, flipping over me but his foot caught my cheek and I was flung backwards. \"Damn!\" I yelped, touching my cheek tenderly. \"Baby get out of here!\" \"No way dad, not without you!\" I yelled back as I leaped onto Han's back, wrapping my legs around him as he tried to advance on my dad again. He wriggled trying to get me off but I turned, throwing my weight to the side and pulled him off balance. \"Natalia…Sophie Francesca…Moses, I am your father and you will do as I say! Don't make me ground you!\" Dad warned me and I paused as I put a choke on Han, staring at him incredulously. \"I'm twenty four, dad.\" I answered then slammed my elbow down at Han's face but he swept it aside then somehow managed to twist and get free. Dad shoved an aisle over, pushing him back over as I scrambled backwards, pushing various packets and items aside to avoid being hit. Suddenly two Russian cops came in, yelling for everyone to freeze. When Han turned around to fight them, I couldn't help but stare in awe as he moved with such force and speed, he had both cops knocked out on the ground in under ten seconds. Suddenly my dad slammed into him, cuffed him to a cooler then backed away out of reach. \"This is not over Moses. It's not!\" He warned as dad grabbed my hands and gently lifted me to my feet. I touched my head, groaning as I felt it spin slightly. \"You okay baby?\" \"Yeah! Totally fine just…please don't ground me?\" I begged and he chuckled, shaking my shoulder gently before grabbing the cop with the radio and began to wire for backup. I had to love his quick thinking. I carefully stepped out the window, turning to look back at Han. His eyes were fixated on my dad but when he felt me looking at him, he turned to face me. I was quite surprised at how good looking he was for a contract killer. Was it wrong to think that? Oh well, too late. Smirking I tapped my brow. \"You got a little something there.\" I called back at him then hurried to find dad. I could feel his heated glare on the back of my head. \"What's wrong with him?\" Sarah muttered under her breath as we walked casually away. \"Whatever it is, dad and I probably haven't helped.\" I flinched as my hip began to twitch in pain. Probably some bruising to the skin. \"You sure you're okay?\" Dad asked, placing his other arm around me as I nursed my hip. \"Think he landed a good hit to my side.\" I answered with a shrug. \"No big deal, nothing's broken and I can still think straight.\" \"You sure?\" He fussed and I smiled. \"I promise, dad, don't worry about me.\" His safe house was actually the first one he had ever had. It was a small apartment painted in a horrible, dark green colour with the smell of damp and dust. Still it was a place to kick back and relax whilst we planned our next move. Looking around the place, I could find things that had been left here, untouched for over thirty years. \"Why does Han hate you so much?\" I looked up, my interest rising in the choice of subject. \"Not enough hugs as a child.\" Well that's a pathetic excuse. Marvin! Tell us the truth. \"You know…Frank framed him for stealing state secrets so he went from being a highly decorate counter intel officer to being a pariah.\" Marvin began to chuckle to himself. \"What's so ironic though is that Frank actually created the circumstances for his own death. It's poetic.\" \"I ain't dead yet.\" Dad answered softly, still watching the doctor. \"But why'd you set him up, dad?\" I pursued, still not fully understanding. \"Why?\" \"Can't tell you. Sorry baby.\" Dad said, turning to then pull me into a hug. I was startled by this sudden gesture of love that for a moment I forgot to put my arms around him. \"You look tired.\" I shrugged. \"My body clock is totally messed up.\" \"You need to rest?\" I shook my head. \"No. I'll be okay.\" I murmured into his shoulder. He continued to hug me and I was beginning to worry that something was going on. \"Uh…dad? Is everything alright?\" I asked him slowly. \"When was the last time I told you I loved you?\" Now totally thrown off track I tried to think. \"You know, I can't actually remember.\" I told him admittedly, pulling back to look up at him. He sighed, reaching up to tuck a stray lock of hair behind my ear. \"You look just like your mother.\" He told me. \"You have her eyes. Bright green like spring.\" Reaching down he placed a loving kiss on my cheek where Han had kicked me and I felt tears rise to my eyes. \"I love you, my baby girl.\" \"Love you too dad.\" I murmured into him as I hugged him tightly, closing my eyes to stop the tears from flowing. When he pulled away he tapped the tip of my nose just like he used to when I was a kid then went to speak with the doctor. I looked to Sarah and Marvin who were just staring at me. \"Well that was weird.\" \"It was good though. Good progress.\" Sarah reasoned. \"Now if he'll just say that to me…\" I laughed, wiping away the tears that slipped down my face. As I took a few moments to compose myself I missed some of the next conversation. \"Do you remember where Nightshade is?\" Sarah was saying so instantly I looked up. \"I'm sorry my dear?\" \"Do you remember where Nightshade is?\" She asked again, a little more boldly than before. Doctor Bailey sat up straighter in his chair. \"Why, yes.\" He answered simply and seriously. That was a good sign at least. As everyone moved to head out and follow the professor dad touched my shoulder and whispered to me. \"I want you to stay here, arrange our transport back to the states.\" I groaned. \"But I want to go with you guys!\" \"No arguments, Natalia.\" He warned me. He only ever used my real name when he was angry or very serious about something. \"You need to stay and cover our backs, make sure we're not followed.\" \"How am I supposed to do that when I'm cooped up back here?\" Dad paused, thinking about the best option. \"I could check the perimeter?\" \"No. Han's still out there.\" \"He doesn't scare me.\" Dad arched an eyebrow at me. \"Well he should, Nat, he could have killed you today for simply being in the way.\" Maybe I should be taking this a little more seriously but I hated being left behind when all the fun was happening. \"Please dad?\" He shook his head. \"You arrange our journey home and stay hidden in here, okay?\" I hated it when he pulled the parent voice on me. \"Yes dad.\" I nodded, folded my arms across my chest. \"You stay safe, okay?\" I gave him a quick hug then watched as he left with the others. \"Story of my life.\" I sighed then picked up my phone to speak with Ivan, hoping he still had the same number he had fifteen years ago. Once all the arrangements were made I sat down on the sofa, wondering what to do next. \"You know what? Screw this.\" Ahh, she's just asking for trouble now :)[Chapter 8] Another one up and ready, a little bit of action and interaction. Read on my friends! I grabbed my jacket and slid it on, neatened my braid then left the apartment, carefully following after the others. Just as I stepped outside my phone began to ring with a number I didn't recognise flashing up on the screen. \"Hello?\" \"Hey gorgeous, where have you been? You didn't show up the other night for that little get together I had arranged.\" I groaned silently and clapped a hand to my forehead. \"Jeremy, I don't know why you keep trying but we are never getting together again. It's not happening.\" \"No need to be shy, come on baby how about we meet up and talk things over? I'm not happy with the way things ended between us.\" His voice was so nasally and irritating, why had I ever been attracted to him in the first place? \"Things ended between us because I caught you making out with my best friend.\" I replied tartly, slipping in and out of bustling people as they hurried to get to wherever they wanted to go. \"Hey that's not fair, she sprung on me! I was in shock.\" \"Sure you were, it must have been really hard to think when your tongue was down her throat.\" I rolled my eyes. \"I'm hanging up.\" \"No don't! Come on baby, you weren't exactly faithful yourself.\" I froze, frowning suddenly. \"What's that supposed to mean? I've never cheated on any boyfriend in my life! You trying to call me a slut now?\" \"No, no, no, of course not baby-\" \"Don't call me baby.\" He paused, laughing nervously and I could imagine the sweat rolling down his face at my dark tone. \"Just, there were loads of rumours, Natalia, you know? That you were hooking up with Robbie as well.\" Blinking in surprise I stepped out of someone's way and continued to circle around the perimeter. \"And you believed them instead of actually asking me about it? Jeez, thanks.\" There was a little silence. \"Were you?\" \"Hell no! Robbie was just a friend, a really sweet, geeky friend who helped me with my homework and played video games with me whenever we felt like hanging out. Besides, he had a girlfriend back in Los Angeles, I think. Why the hell am I trying to explain myself to you? You were the one with your tongue down my friend's throat. Listen, buddy, I am not going to get back with you, not now or ever, so just get over it already and leave me alone!\" With that I hung up. Pretty much as soon as I put the phone back in my pocket it began to ring again. \"Oh piss off Jeremy.\" I muttered under my breath, keeping my head down as I continued to walk around in the fresh air. Sighing softly I glanced around then continued to walk. I turned down a smaller street to find it empty save for a group of three Russians. They were all tough and mean looking, with thick coats that accented their size as they looked around at me. Slowly I began to backtrack as they sneered and pushed off from the wall to approach me. \" What's wrong sweetheart?\" One of them asked in the rather sexy language of Russian. \" Nothing, buddy, I was just leaving.\" I answered then turned around. \" No don't be like that. Come have a drink with us.\" \" Come on baby, we can show you a good time.\" Shuddering slightly I tried to head back down into the open street but one of the three men slipped out in front of me and cut me off. \" I'm warning you, I'm not interested. Now leave me alone before I kick your ass into next week.\" My voice was so fierce and cold that the guy in front of me actually blinked and took a tiny shift back as the other two laughed as they came up behind me. \" Loosen up, we only want a little fun.\" \" Don't say I didn't warn you.\" I muttered then lashed out. My foot swept out and hooked the back of the knee of the man in front of me and he fell into a kneeling position. Using his shoulders as leverage I lifted myself up and kicked both men in the chest behind me. I spun off, balling a fist then smashed it across his face, flinching when it hit his solid jaw with little effect as he began to get back up. \"Okay then.\" I frowned then grabbed his wrist as he tried to lunge for me. I twisted it, ducked under his body then bent his arm into an unnatural position, making him cry out as I pushed him forwards into his buddies, throwing them off balance. \" When I say leave me alone, I damn well mean it.\" Snapping my teeth at them I turned and tried to leave. All three of them sprung on me at once. I ducked and avoided their blows, getting underneath them so that they ended up hitting each other more than the air. Then one blow landed. I yelped as I was tossed against the wall, the wind knocked from my lungs and my head began to spin uncontrollably, blurring my vision. Blinking I tried to get up but my legs gave out underneath me. The Russians cursed and insulted me, one of them kicked me sharply in the gut and I grunted, still not having enough air in my body to cry out. Sucking in a deep breath I managed to blearily see another foot coming at me so I spun onto my back and lashed out, almost clumsily, to hit it away, shifting as my head continued to spin with my vision. Then I heard cries of pain. Through the shifting shapes I could see a dark suited figure beating back the three Russians, flipping them all onto their backs then kicked the last one forwards as they retreated. Wait a second, was that…? \"Han.\" I growled and tried to get up but his fist curled into my jacket and forced me to my feet, slamming me against the wall again. Ouch, that kinda hurt you asshole. Hearing a gun click I blinked, trying to focus on the gun as it was pressed into the side of my head. Once my vision was pretty much normal I swallowed the fear and slowly turned my head to look him directly in the eyes. Dad had always taught me to look at your potential killer right in the eyes because sometimes, it unnerves them enough to hesitate before shooting. Han narrowed his eyes at me as I breathed evenly, still focused on him. After a moment he began to tense. \"You going to shoot me or what?\" I asked and his eyes flashed dangerously, lowering the gun to press into my gut. \"Where is Moses?\" He demanded in a low, rather sexy voice. \"Well if I'm pretty sure he's dead now, it has been over a thousand years since he parted the Red Sea, you know. He should be dust by now.\" The gun dug deeper into me and I clenched my jaw, trying not to show pain. \"Do not test my patience. Tell me where your father is.\" I pressed my lips into a firm line, assuring him that I wasn't going to tell him anything. \"Tell me or I'll shoot you.\" \"Go ahead.\" I shrugged, still looking straight into his eyes. I didn't realise that they weren't as dark as I initially thought, there was a little bit of a warmer tone in there, like really rich chocolate. He also smelled really good, I couldn't really describe it but it was enough for me to want to breathe in a little deeper. Was a contract killer allowed to smell that good? I'm not sure they were, I imagined them to smell like, well, death. He shifted, stepping back to aim the gun at my head whilst gripping it with both hands. My eyes still locked on his, he hesitated. The moment I saw the hesitation I sprung forwards. Faster than I could believe possible I swept his gun hand to the side then kneed him in the crotch, turning as he doubled over to grab the collar of his well-cut jacket to drag him backwards, slamming him into the wall then knocked his head a few times against it. When he dropped down I snatched the gun from beside him then aimed it down at him. He was knocked out cold and I couldn't help but simply look at him. He really was a good looking guy, it was almost a shame to have to kill him but I had to. Right? He was trying to kill my dad. I had to protect dad, I had to. Shivering ever so slightly I tried to control my erratic heartbeat, breathing in and our harshly as the steam swept out into the cold air. He looked almost…peaceful, lying in the dusty snow with his eyes closed serenely, his features relaxed. Dammit, now I was the one hesitating. \"I'm really sorry. Please don't haunt me for this?\" I asked a little hopelessly. \"I do not intend to die today.\" When his lips moved I blinked and almost missed him as he spurred into motion. His legs shot out and yanked mine out from beneath me and I fell to the floor. All at once he had the gun back in his hand and he was looming over me, one hand pinning a wrist down as his body trapped mine down. \"Crap.\" I flinched as his strong grip tightened then sucked in a deep breath of air. \"So…back to square one.\" I nodded my head, trying desperately to think of how to get out of this mess. I should have run when I had the chance. After a moment I realised my only free hand was gripping his wrist with the gun in it. Great reflexes, huh? Without waiting I threw all my strength into pushing the gun aside just a little, getting it away from my body before twisting, swinging a leg up and over to use its momentum into a roll, switching positions but he flipped me back over easily but I carried on rolling until we hit the wall. Jerking my head forwards I head butted him sharply, making him hiss in pain the same I did. Damn he had a hard head! Twisting free I punched him with all my might, squeaking slightly as pain shot up my hand. \"You jerk!\" I shook out my wrist as it stung then kicked him instead. His hand caught my ankle and he tugged, making me have to hop stupidly to keep my balance. \"Hey! Batter up!\" I called out then spun, pointing my toes as my free leg rotated around the other, smashing into his jaw in an effort to let me go. When he did I bolted, wild panic spreading over me as bullets hit the wall as I hurtled around the corner. Taking deep breaths I headed into the thickest stream of people, ducking and weaving until I was a part of the crowd. As I walked past a stall I swiped a hat then after a few steps put it on once I had whipped off the tag. The dark grey fur instantly warmed my head, the traditional Russian styled hat. It was kind of nice but I didn't intend to keep it. Maybe Sarah would like it? Glancing back I saw Han in the crowd, looking this way and that in search for me so I quickly turned my head and walked calmly with the thick crowd, blending in until I was safely away. Returning back to the apartment I was glad to find that I had got back before dad. I went to the bathroom and assessed any hurts. I ached all over, my chest felt like something was clamped tightly around it and my head now had an astounding ache. \"Stupid…Korean…jerk.\" I muttered as I pressed a cold flannel to my head then checked for any bruising. Good thing I had a tough body otherwise dad would figure out I had left. Having nothing else to do I sat down and began to read a book, waiting for dad and the others to return. When Katya walked through the door, however, I instantly went cold and still. \"It's not what you think, baby.\" \"Don't 'baby' me dad.\" I told him sharply as Katya smiled at me. My fist whipped forwards and I punched her hard across the jaw. She yelped and backed off, clutching her face where I had struck. \"That was for betraying my dad. Twice.\" I snapped then refused to sit anywhere near her. Let's just say that when Natalia says she's going to hit someone, she means it. Next chapter up pretty much straight away. See you there![Chapter 9] One of my favourite chapters right here, please read and then review it for me, tell me what you think. Love you guys ;) Doctor Bailey found a decent bottle of vodka which we all had a taste of. As he came into the room with it, smiling happily, he poured me a drink. \"Hey comrades!\" He called softly, lifting the bottle as he approached Marvin to fill up his shot glass. \"Here's to more success.\" \"Success.\" Marvin agreed calmly. \"To saving the world!\" Sarah piped up proudly, smiling as she lifted her glass. \"Saving the world!\" We all chorused and I threw back my head, draining the vodka then smacked my lips, savouring the taste. Not too bad, a little strong though. Dad's phone began to ring so he stepped out of the room to take it. \"So come on, tell me what happened.\" Sitting down I faced Sarah who blushed slightly. \"Well, I was left on guard duty whilst these three went off to get the bomb.\" She looked really happy and proud of herself. \"It was all fine until this guy came along and I had no idea what he was saying. I think he was hitting on me? Couldn't really be sure. Anyway I told him what Frank told me to say if someone were to come and speak to me but he just continued to talk.\" \"This sounds juicy. What happened then?\" I shifted a little closer. \"Well, he got a little close after I think he invited me for a drink so I just went for it.\" \"No…you kissed him?\" She nodded, tilted her head back a little smugly as she glanced to Katya. \"Come on, I step back for just one moment and all the good things happen?\" \"There'll be plenty more of that, sweetie, I assure you.\" She flashed me a grin then we all looked up as dad slowly walked back into the room with his hands up. \"Dad what are you…?\" I trailed off when I saw Bailey following dad with a gun aimed at him. \"Marvin.\" Frank warned. \"Guns down.\" Knowing what Marvin was like, it was probably the better idea to tell him not to react. He gave me a long look then nodded. Slowly I reached behind me and drew out the gun, holding it carefully with my finger away from the trigger before placing it on the ground. \"You planted the thing on Wiki-links, didn't you?\" Marvin murmured quietly as dad stepped over to stand beside Sarah. \"Oh yes it was a, uh, cell phone taken from a guard. Just itching to get my revenge on MI6 you see and um, Frank you were absolutely marvellous the way you found the Frog, no one else could have found him. Jack?\" He called back and I tensed, my hands still in the air as I slowly stepped towards dad. \"Sorry Frank but I've made a deal already with Mr Horton for red mercury.\" Just as he spoke a tall, broad and blond American guy walked in, eyes set in stone. \"Well done Bailey.\" He spoke lowly as he passed. \"Thank you.\" \"Nice to see you again Frank. Pick up the guns.\" He said as he stood in front of my dad. My fist ached to wipe that smug little gleam from his eyes. \"Your country appreciates your sacrifice, Frank.\" He waited, allowing the message to sink in before clapping him on the shoulder. \"Your time's up.\" As he turned his eyes found me. \"This your daughter?\" In answer dad reached out behind him with one hand and I clasped both hands in his, narrowing my eyes at Horton. \"Pity.\" Walking away he nodded to Bailey. \"It's time.\" \"Yes it is time.\" He sighed then pulled the trigger. I flinched, eyes widening as Katya fell to the floor. \"Katya!\" I called out as dad and I fell to her side. \"Very interesting, rogue American agents turned nuclear terrorists kill top Russian officer.\" Bailey murmured thoughtfully. \"You sick, twisted bastard!\" I snarled at him, gripping Katya's hand tightly as the other held her head as dad held her in his arms. \"Sorry fellas. Come on boys, let's go.\" Bailey said as he left. Seething with rage I turned back to Katya. \"Keep breathing Katya, you're going to be okay.\" She chuckled softly, looking up at me. \"I'm sorry I failed you. I knew you were hurt as well when I left.\" Her voice was frail as she tried to speak. \"Keep breathing, don't talk just breathe.\" I swallowed the hard stone in my throat, blinking as tears fell from my eyes. \"Please?\" \"I could have done better…to be like a mother to you. I'm so sorry.\" \"It's fine. None of that matters now.\" I assured her, brushing her fringe away from her eyes. \"It's okay.\" She smiled and gave a weak nod before looking up for Sarah. \"Sarah?\" Sarah came a little closer, sadness and shock still spilling from her eyes with the watery mists that enveloped them. \"You take good care of them for me.\" \"I will.\" She promised, voice cracking just as the Russian soldiers swept inside. Katya's head went limp against dad's chest as she exhaled for the last time. Blinking in shock I suddenly felt this overwhelming wave of guilt hit me. I had been cruel to Katya when for a good portion of my life she had been the closest thing to a mother I had ever had. Now she was gone. Rough hands grabbed me and pulled me back but for once, I didn't fight. I allowed myself to be shoved into an army restraining vehicle then we were all driven out of Moscow to the nearest airfield. Under the hood of my sack I could feel Sarah next to me, crying so I reached across with my cuffed hands until I found hers. \"We're going to be okay.\" I promised her although I knew it was looking pretty hopeless. Even as women they weren't particularly kind to us. We were shoved about, cuffed to posts then I think someone spat on me. I considered cursing them with every insult I knew but I held my tongue, knowing it would not help our situation. On my right was Sarah, I could hear her softly crying under the sack we wore as hoods. When mine was ripped off I blinked against the sunlight then glared at him. As he walked away he called out an order. \"What did he say?\" Sarah asked with fear shaking her voice. \"Ready.\" \"You know you're not helping Marvin.\" I growled, trying to slip a hand out of the shackles but they had me pretty tight. \"Do something. Do something…\" She begged as she gazed at my dad. \"I love you.\" He murmured and her breath caught in her throat as panic began to settle in over her. \"At least Han didn't get us first.\" Marvin mused thoughtfully as he stared blankly at the guns. \"Really? You're gonna bring that up right now?\" Dad has a point Marvin, there are good times and bad times. Now would be one of the bad ones. When the marksman called for aim, I shifted, swallowing my fear as I readied myself for death. Before the final order was given, a bullet hissed through the air and hit him in the shoulder. As the other gunmen spread out, calling out in panic dad spread his hands a little wider, tensing the chains before they were shot apart. He disarmed one of the Russian soldiers then shot at them in warning, making them split up and run for safety. With a slight frown of concentration I tensed the muscles in my arm as I pulled forwards and climbed up the pole, using the shackles to keep me off the ground as a soldier ran my way, aiming at dad. Shooting out both legs I kicked the gun down then yelled as my legs wrapped around his neck, dragging him back as I cut off his air supply. He gripped my legs, trying to pry them off but I hung on, small grunts of effort escaping me as this guy was pretty strong. From the rise where I knew Victoria lay with her sniper, a bullet shot forwards and the guy went limp so I let him fall to the ground then dropped back down. \"Look away.\" Dad told me as he lifted his gun to aim at my shackles. I turned my head away and stretched the chains out so that when he shot them, they fell apart easily. Sighing with relief I threw my arms over his shoulders and hugged him tightly. \"We're okay.\" \"No kidding.\" I murmured, pulling him even closer. \"I love you dad.\" \"I love you too baby.\" He kissed the side of my head softly then headed towards Sarah who was still trying to overcome the feeling of imminent death. When Victoria met us on the ground, she was not impressed. \"I mean, honestly Frank, two days just two days and you're standing in front of a firing squad?\" \"Yeah but there were…\" \"No, no excuses you're better than this it's pathetic.\" I had to laugh, Victoria knew exactly how to keep dad in check. \"Frank.\" Ivan called as we walked towards Han's plane. \"An American military transport made an emergency landing in London. Everyone on board was found dead. Bailey has taken refuge in the Iranian Embassy.\" Looking to dad I sighed. This was going to be harder than we initially thought. \"Well we've got to go there.\" \"Alright.\" Dad decided in his soft voice. \"Get them ready. I'm going to make sure we're clear for take-off.\" He clapped Marvin on the shoulder as he climbed in. Not particularly wanted to see Ivan kissing Victoria I turned and smiled to Sarah. \"Well, looks like we've got some more work to do. To think that I should be in a lecture at college or somewhere on campus right now. Think they'll buy the excuse that my dad is a retired agent of the CIA and needed my help to save the world?\" Sarah chuckled. \"No, I don't think so.\" She shrugged. \"Somehow I think it's a little out of the ordinary. What's the chances of it actually happening?\" Grinning she turned and climbed onto the plane. \"Ah, my sweet little mint cake. Give Uncle Ivan a hug.\" I smiled and opened my arms, hugging Ivan tightly as he crushed me into his chest. \"It's been good seeing you again. Don't be a stranger.\" I told him. \"It's been too long.\" He laughed richly then held up a finger. \"Oh! Before I forget.\" He dug into his pocket then held a little sweet wrapped in silver and green foil. \"A little parting gift for my favourite niece.\" I smiled, taking the sweet then unwrapped it, popping it into my mouth then sighed as the chocolate and mint creaminess began to melt on my tongue. \"Thank you.\" I laughed then kissed his cheek. \"I'm just going to go find dad. See you really soon Ivan.\" I promised then walked after dad who had gone into the hanger. When I heard fighting, my blood ran cold. Dad was fighting Han with an empty plastic canister whilst Han slashed at him with a knife. Without thinking I ran forwards. \"Dad!\" I cried then slammed into Han, tackling him around the middle then powered him into the ground. \"Don't you ever give up?\" I demanded then grabbed the wrist with the knife, twisting it until he let go but his other hand grabbed my jacket and flung me from him. Before I could even lift my head Han was back on my dad, trying to drive the knife into his throat but dad was pretty strong, he was just about managing to hold it back. \"You having fun yet?\" \"I'll let you know when I start having fun.\" Dad grinded out between clenched teeth. Leaping to my feet I grabbed a length of blue rope then flung it around Han's neck, yanking it sharply backwards. \"Leave him alone!\" I gritted my teeth as he stumbled back with me, taking his knife to try and saw through but I wrapped both ends of rope in one hand then grabbed his arm, pushing it away so that the knife couldn't get at the ropes. Suddenly he flung himself backwards, slamming me into a heavy rack of random items but I refused to let go. As dad advanced with clenched fists Han slammed me again until my grip loosened. His elbow hit me hard in the gut and I yelped in pain, the rope tearing from my hands as he turned with the knife lifted to stab me. My eyes widened in fear but dad leaped forwards, locking up the knife arm then twisted, flinging Han aside into another stack of shelves. They topped over and I approached cautiously as Han picked himself up and glared at dad. \"How much is the US paying?\" \"Twenty million.\" I blinked in surprise. \"Are you kidding me?\" Dad demanded with deep breaths as he retreated carefully, reaching out to grab me by the arm and push me further away. \"Don't even think about telling me to scram.\" I lifted a hand to silence him before he could open his mouth. He pushed over another metal unit but Han darted out of the way. \"I asked for more.\" Han growled as dad lifted a fire extinguisher and Han double kicked it with a clash. He flinched, wriggling his foot to get some feeling back into it. \"What happened to you?\" Dad asked as I circled around. \"You used to be a good agent.\" As their impressive fight broke out, I ran at Han's back. He hit dad in the side in quick succession but dad caught him around the face but I didn't pay attention too much, I was focused on what I was planning. Jumping up into the air I hooked both legs up and over Han's shoulders then arched back, falling onto my hands to then pull Han over to flip onto his front. Standing over him I went to lock his head in place but he grabbed my ankle and yanked it forwards, making me lose my balance but before I fell, he sprung up and twisted my arm, turning me forcibly until he slammed my head into a hard metal surface. \"Payback.\" He spat down at me. \"Asshole.\" I growled back as he turned to prowl towards my dad. \"Stop, just listen. I need your help.\" Dad began as I crawled towards the fire extinguisher. \"I know there's a part of you…that wants to do the right thing.\" Maybe dad was getting a little too old for this, he was out of breath and struggling to stay upright. \"There is a weapon that's going to be detonated!\" His voice rose to try and shout over Han as he delivered a spinning round house kick to dad's face. Pulling the extinguisher towards me I ignored the throb in my head and set it up, pulling the pin and lifting up the nozzle. Looking around I saw dad get off the floor, gun in hand. As Han tried to run at him, I aimed the nozzle and squeezed. A powerful jet of pressurised carbon dioxide shot out and hit him side on. Han was thrown off balance and I hosed him down with a little smirk tugging at my lips. Once he was quiet and struggling to move, I tossed the extinguisher aside then stood next to dad. \"Listen to me.\" He struggled so I stepped even closer and took his arm, helping him to stand up. \"There's a bomb heading for London right now. Eleven million people are going to lose their lives if you don't help me.\" He wiped away the blood from his nose then exhaled deeply. Before I could stop him he had tossed the gun at Han. \"No.\" I moved out to stand in front of him but dad placed his arms around me. \"It's okay baby. It's okay.\" He promised, his soft voice calming me slightly as he pushed me back behind him protectively. Han cocked the gun then held it up quickly at dad. I gulped, gripping dad's shoulder and arm tightly as I watched Han, pleading with him silently. He hesitated. Lifting his other hand to grip the gun, as if trying to talk himself into pulling the trigger, he watched dad closely before his eyes shifted to me. I shook my head slightly, begging him not to kill my dad. Finally he broke, calling out in a frustrated sound before turning back to dad. He tossed back the gun then lifted his head. \"Alright.\" I relaxed visibly, sighing as I rested my head against dad's shoulder. \"Let's go.\" I pulled back as dad turned, one arm snaking around my waist to hold me close as we walked with Han out of the hanger. After a moment Han looked back at dad with a glare. \"This doesn't mean I'm not going to kill you later.\" I smiled a little. \"I know.\" Dad replied as we headed towards the plane. Yay! Han's a good guy. Sort of...?[Chapter 10] So continuing on, Han has come to an agreement with Moses, let's see how this works out for Natalia :) As dad climbed in first I stopped to look at Han. \"At least you got your plane back.\" I offered weakly then inclined my head to the stairs. \"Get in.\" \"Just because I didn't kill you in Moscow does not mean you are safe to order me around.\" He warned me and I arched an eyebrow at him then smirked. \"Just get on the plane twinkle toes.\" He shot me a dark look before climbing the steps. The moment he tore back the curtains to walk into the passenger section, both Victoria and Marvin had guns aimed at him. I stepped in front of Marvin's gun and pushed it down. \"He's with us now.\" I told him. \"So please don't shoot him.\" \"He's a contract killer, Nat, you think he won't try and kill us once this is all over?\" I shrugged at Marvin, reaching into a cupboard to get out the medical kit and some ice from the little kitchen area. \"Maybe. I don't know but for now, we need every hand we can get.\" Heading back out front I tapped dad's shoulder. \"Come on, let's have a look at you.\" I glanced to Han as he sat down with a glass of whiskey, sighing softly. \"Kill Bailey, secure the weapon. How hard can it be?\" I laughed. \"With us, nothing is ever easy.\" As dad groaned in pain I helped him pull off his jacket then lift his shirt to look at the cut. \"Do you ever learn? How many times have I told you? When someone comes at you with a knife, you bloody well get out the way.\" Dad chuckled. \"Taught you too well. Didn't I baby?\" \"No kidding. Come on, where else you hurt?\" I helped him clean up a little before leaving the kit with him and headed into the kitchen again. I found a cloth, wet it with cold water then wrung out the excess before heading back. I approached Han then sat down on the chair next to him. \"Let me see your head.\" \"It's fine.\" He brushed off but I gave him a stern look. Victoria chuckled. \"When she gives you that look, it means you are going to let her help whether you like it or not.\" Han arched an eyebrow at me but my face did not change. \"She'll knock you out if you don't let her.\" Dad warned so Han slowly nodded his head then shifted a little closer. I gently and carefully wiped away as much of the blood as I could to look at the injury. I tried to make it hurt as little as I could, turning down his collar to reach the rest of the blood before taking his chin and turning his face up to the light. I sighed. \"You boys need to learn to fight fair.\" I muttered, reaching out to wipe away the blood from his mouth. \"You've bitten your lip, genius.\" I sighed then reached across for an ice pack. \"Keep that on your head. You hurt anywhere else?\" He shook his head but his eyes had never left me all the way through my assessment. \"Even I can tell you're lying.\" I told him but did not press. Standing I stretched then flinched, yelping quietly as my hand darted to my side. \"Baby?\" Dad instantly looked over to me but I shrugged. \"I'm good.\" I took a couple of steps back then turned, taking off my jacket to roll up my shirt to look at my side. It looked like an ugly pallet of colours. The bruises must have been from the several fights I had been in recently, building up until I had this intricately interesting assortment of colours. \"Man that hurts.\" I murmured to myself, turning to get another icepack from the table but before I realised he was behind me, I had turned into Han's chest. \"Sorry.\" I mumbled but his eyes dropped to the bruising on my side. He lifted a hand and pressed a freezing cold pack against the bruises, taking one of my hands to hold it against it before moving off past me. \"Um…thanks?\" That was a little weird but okay. I sat down as I felt the plane begin to take off, sighing as I relaxed into the comfortable leather chair. Reaching out I picked up Han's drink and drained it, swishing it around my mouth before swallowing. The cold helped reduce the swelling on my side so I was able to relax as Victoria set up her equipment to get some blueprints to the Iranian embassy. Han came back out after a few minutes and I cracked open an eye, arching an eyebrow. He had taken off his jacket and shirt so was now only in a vest top. His arms were nicely toned with muscle so I quickly looked away before I began to drool. \"Baby you hungry?\" Dad called to me as he put out some food on the table. \"Uh huh.\" I murmured then pulled myself up to grab something to eat. I chose a sandwich and a bottle of water, not actually bothering to find out what was in the sandwich until I had bit into it. At least it was only chicken. \"How's your head?\" I shrugged. \"Still intact.\" Dad glanced to Sarah then shifted closer to me. \"Any light headedness?\" I opened my eyes, pausing to think about lying but decided against it. \"Just a little.\" I shot a look at Han. \"He hits pretty hard.\" \"So do you.\" He retorted easily so I smiled a little, rolling my eyes. \"You want some painkillers?\" I shook my head, shifting in my seat to get a little more comfortable. \"Honestly dad, don't worry. I'm fine.\" Taking a long swig of my bottle I felt something warm drip down the back of my neck. Frowning I reached back, rubbing my neck then looked at my hand, stiffening when I saw the blood. Quickly I hid it away then got up, ignoring the spinning sensation I got form the rise of the plane as we gained altitude. Stumbling from side to side a little I headed for the bathroom, tearing the curtain back behind me to dive through the door, whimpering as I lifted up my braid and tried to find where the source of blood was coming from. Cursing quietly I tore the band out of my braid and let my hair fall free, the soft waves framing my face as I parted it, trying to find the cut so I could clean it. \"A little higher.\" I spun around, staring at Han who leaned against the door calmly, watching me. \"Damn don't do that.\" I shot at him, dropping my hair. \"You can't go sneaking up on people like that.\" He inclined his head towards me. \"The cut is two inches from the base of your skull.\" Blinking in confusion I reached up with one hand and felt out the rough place he had given. When I touched the cut, I yelped quietly and instantly tore my hand back. With a silent curse I reached for a flannel and wet it in warm water before beginning to clean it. \"Adrenaline can be such a bitch.\" I muttered under my breath as I gently swabbed the blood away then clean the cloth again. Looking at Han through the mirror I arched an eyebrow. \"So what's the deal with you? Pissed off at the world because of something my dad did?\" \"Maybe. What's your deal?\" I paused to throw him a questioning look before continuing the clean-up. \"Moses raise you to take after him?\" I sighed, looking down into the sink where the clear water was now a murky red. \"Once.\" I shrugged. \"But when I started getting into fights all the time, he decided he didn't want me in so much danger. Couldn't face losing me too.\" Looking up at him I lifted my chin slightly and narrowed my eyes. \"If you think I'm ever going to let you hurt my dad again, then you're dumber than one of those plastic high school girls high on weed.\" Han arched an eyebrow, still leaning against the doorframe. \"What makes you think you could stop me.\" \"I've thrown in a few good hits at you, haven't I?\" I smirked then tapped my brow. \"You should remember.\" His eyes narrowed darkly. \"I am not the one who can't walk straight.\" Spinning around I placed my hands on my hips, taking a threatening step towards him. He smirked, seemingly glad he had succeeded in agitating me. \"Watch it punk or I'll throw you out the hatch.\" He jerked forwards but I refrained from backing off, meeting his eyes evenly. \"Sure you will.\" Damn I hated the fact that his voice sounded so sexy whilst insulting me, it was totally unfair. \"What makes you think I'd let you even get close?\" \"You are now.\" I smirked at him, looking down to his chest then back again. He breathed in deeply as if to try and control his temper. \"Why'd you follow anyway?\" \"Moses looked ready to come running in with a full medic team.\" He answered simply, his voice husky as I realised we were actually only a few inches away from one another. \"So I came to make sure you were alright.\" This was a little surprising, if I wasn't wrong then I could actually see genuine concern in his eyes. How sweet, actually. \"You know, if you weren't this contract killer trying to kill my dad, I think I would actually like you.\" I punched his shoulder slowly and gently, just to be sure he didn't think I was attacking him. \"You're alright.\" Turning away I lifting my hair and ran my fingers through the mess, trying to tame it down as I drained the water then cleaned the flannel. When I looked back up Han was still there. For a while we just simply watched one another, not really knowing what to say. I coughed uncomfortably then looked away. \"I…I guess I should…thank you for what you did back in Moscow.\" He frowned slightly. \"Those Russians?\" He relaxed his expression slightly then nodded. \"But you're still a jerk for threatening to kill me. Even if you didn't.\" I paused, turning around as I dried my hands on a towel. \"Why didn't you just shoot?\" \"Why didn't you?\" He had me there. I wasn't too sure, to be honest. There was something about him that I felt kind of…drawn to. As it were. \"That's not fair, I asked first.\" As I turned around his hands were suddenly gripping the sink either side of me and he leaned closer to my face, making me lean away in surprise. \"I'm asking now.\" Blinking I missed the fact that he had actually said something, I was too focused on his mouth. \"Huh?\" He smirked at me so I shook my head to awaken my thoughts. \"You are such a jerk, you know that?\" He gave a little shrug but did not pull away. I shifted slightly, eyes flickering across his face before I could focus on his eyes. \"You want to let me go before my dad comes in here and assumes the worse?\" \"Moses doesn't scare me.\" I chuckled then grabbed his wrist, twisting underneath him to pin him against the wall. \"Is that so?\" Letting him go I retreated to the door, tilting my head challengingly at him as he turned slowly around. \"How about we go have a little chat with him now?\" \"You're impossible.\" \"You're still a jerk.\" When he growled a little shudder ran down my spine so I decided it was time to get out of there. \"Well, I'll leave you to your business.\" I smirked then slammed the door shut between us before striding back to the others. Haha, great fun to write these two, I'll admit. Please R+R for me, thanks for reading![Chapter 11] Another chapter has been delivered! Enjoy Dozing on the seat I could tell there was a slight tension between Han and I and I think Victoria was beginning to pick up on it. I felt a big one to one talk coming on later. Once she had pulled up all the details we needed I sat up and shifted closer, combing through my hair with my fingers distantly just like my mom used to do when I was really little. Victoria glanced between me and Han before going on with her analysis. \"Of course the external security is very, very heavy but inside there are hard core revolutionary guards they are serious fanatics.\" I cracked my fingers and smiled. \"My specialty.\" Han looked at me then to Sarah as dad rubbed her shoulder. \"The whole thing resides on her.\" \"You do realise if they catch you, they will kill you.\" Victoria told her seriously and Sarah paused before looking up at dad. I inched a little closer and took her hand. \"You don't have to do anything, Sarah, you can still bow down if you want.\" I assured her but she shook her head. \"No, no I can do it. I know I can do this.\" Smiling proudly I nodded. \"Alright then. You remember what I said?\" \"Yeah, half lidded eyes, sexy, smooth voice, small smiles.\" She remembered the list I had narrowed down for her. \"Anything else?\" I pulled my hair over my shoulder, thinking. \"These guys are pretty hot and cold, their either one or the other never in between. You'll have to pull out everything you know about flirting to let him know you're interested but then also keep it downed down. They like mystery, you know the sort of thing?\" Sarah nodded her head then tilted her head to the side, pulling on a seductive face. \"Pout a little more.\" She did, closing her eyes ever so slightly. \"And lick your lips once in a while, slowly, like this.\" I pulled on my sexy face and ran my tongue over my lips, showing her how to do it. Dad shifted uncomfortably. \"When did you even learn all this stuff?\" He demanded then looked to Victoria whilst gesturing at me. \"Should I be worried?\" \"No, she's fine.\" Victoria flicked her hand then looked away quickly. Dad raised his eyebrows then looked at her with a serious expression. \"You didn't…\" \"Didn't what Francis?\" She replied sweetly, twirling a lock of hair around her finger and I blinked when I realised I was doing exactly the same thing. \"You taught my daughter how to seduce guys?\" Uh oh, cat's out of the bag. Victoria lifted her hands. \"Well I thought it would be useful since I knew you were teaching her all the fighting side of things, I just taught her how to use her womanly talents in other ways.\" Dad did not look happy. \"That's my daughter!\" \"Hey dad, it's no big deal okay? I'm not some kind of hooker who throws herself at every guy she has a little fancy for. Besides this stuff is helping us now, right Victoria?\" She nodded in agreement with a small smirk. \"Exactly.\" \"Yeah and I'm kind of enjoying this.\" Sarah smirked, turning her seductive face towards dad who became a little distracted. \"Right, I uh…\" He coughed awkwardly as Sarah stood slowly, accenting her curves. Wow, she really does listen. She smoothly reached forwards and kissed my dad, cutting off his argument completely. When he pulled away he pointed at me. \"This conversation is not over.\" I held up my hands in mock surrender then winked at Victoria who chuckled lightly. \"So what else should I do?\" Sarah asked after she had finished kissing my dad, who threw up his hands and slapped them to his face in defeat. \"Just be your cute, sassy, adorable self.\" I told her. \"You'll do fine and I'll be there covering your back all the way.\" \"Actually, darling, we need you to take out the guards from this corridor.\" Victoria said, pointing to the screen which flashed red at her touch. \"Once Sarah gets inside there will be these four guards who will in turn inspect down by where she will be extracting. You will have to take care of them before they reach her position and discover anything suspicious.\" Glancing to Sarah I nodded. \"No problem. Show me the patterns.\" Victoria talked me through what I would have to do until I had it all in my head. Nodding I looked out to the darkening sky then yawned. \"Get some sleep, darling, you look absolutely exhausted.\" Victoria said as she rubbed my back gently in large circles. \"Sure. Okay.\" I nodded my head then retreated back to a long sofa, stretching out before curling up and closing my eyes. After a while of zoning in and out I felt someone place a blanket over me. I could tell everyone else was asleep because dad was snoring and no one else was talking so I knew exactly who it was. Han. Plus, I could smell his really nice scent as he knelt down next to me then lifted my head, placing something soft underneath before placing it back down again. Before I could open my mouth to murmur a thanks I was asleep again. A few hours later I awoke properly, feeling a little better. The pain in my head was gone and only my side felt a little sore. I sat up, looking around. Sarah and dad were curled up together fast asleep and I couldn't help but smile. Victoria's head was resting against the back of the seat right next to me and Han was sleeping a little further away from us. I frowned, noticing he was still only wearing his vest top so I stood, shook out the blanket quietly then silently crept over to him. I placed it over him, making sure it covered his arms before turning back around. Victoria's eyes were on me. \"You and I need to talk, darling.\" She told me softly and I sighed. \"I figured as much.\" \"Your father will not be too pleased about this.\" She sat up as I sat down at the table opposite her, rubbing my eyes. \"I figured that too.\" She arched a delicate eyebrow, watching me carefully. \"But you do like him, don't you?\" Glancing behind me I gave a weak shrug before nodding. \"Bugger it.\" \"You been in this sort of situation before, with Ivan, tell me what to do Victoria.\" I whispered, leaning closer. \"Please?\" \"Oh darling, no two romances are ever the same.\" She chuckled softly, reaching across the table to hold my hand comfortingly. \"You've got to…let your own feelings guide your path. I can't tell you what to do or how to do it. It won't work the same way.\" \"But…you can impart on some really useful wisdom that you gained from your own experience, right?\" She smiled again. \"All I can say is that I chose the man I loved over everything else I valued, my career, my future and everything worked out in the end because I believed that no matter what happened, I would always love him.\" Listening to her I frowned. \"But I'm now sure if I, you know, love him.\" I whispered quietly. \"Of course not, those kind of feelings come in time. What's more important is that you actually like him first otherwise loving is completely useless. Do you like him?\" I nodded my head. \"A little.\" She raised her eyebrow. \"Okay, a lot. He's a really attractive guy and a kickass fighter. What's not to like?\" I was glad that he was sitting on the other side of the plane because if he had been awake, I would have had to shoot him to save myself from embarrassment. \"So if someone had knocked him out and was about to shoot him…?\" \"I'd shoot them in the eye.\" I instantly answered then blinked. \"I mean, what?\" Victoria chuckled. \"What if I was going to shoot him?\" This time I thought about it carefully, running the situation through my head. I had a bare millisecond to react, what would I do? \"I…would…probably…shoot you in the hand or somewhere that wouldn't kill you.\" I admitted. \"Or try to hit the gun. I'd prefer to hit the gun or I'd just stand in the way.\" \"You really do like this one, don't you?\" I nodded my head the looked away with a blush. \"I don't know how but it just feels different to how it's always been before. He's irritating at best but he still makes me feel good, in a way. Is that dumb?\" Victoria shook her head instantly. \"No, no, darling, it's perfectly normal. I would just be careful, alright? We can't trust him yet because he's still a threat to your father.\" \"Yeah. That's kind of why I'm freaking out a little. What the hell am I going to do if I actually fall for him?\" Leaning back in her chair Victoria tapped a perfectly manicured nail against the table. \"For your sake, I hope he changes his mind about killing your father. Because although it will tear you apart, I will put three bullets in his chest unless you do it first.\" And we all Victoria means it[Chapter 12] Just want to say a huge thanks for all the reviews, they really Make me smile :) It felt stupidly strange watching dad slap Sarah, I almost wanted to punch him in the face despite knowing it was all part of the play. \"She's going to get killed.\" \"If you were that worried about her you would have let me handle it.\" I murmured to him with a sigh as I pulled my black coat tighter around me. \"I'm sure Han wouldn't have minded slapping me to make things a little more even.\" He shot me a look. \"Who says we're uneven?\" \"I do.\" I answered without looking at him. \"I've hit you more times.\" \"Have not.\" He defended hotly. \"Quiet down kids, no arguing in the car.\" Marvin muttered from a few seats over. After a moment of tense silence I placed a hand on dad's shoulder. \"She'll be fine.\" \"It's harder when they leave the nest.\" Han mused aloud very quietly, looking at dad who still didn't take his eyes away from Sarah who was now getting a drink with our target. I smirked as she wiped her eyes and licked her lips with her tongue, instantly drawing the target's attention. \"Frank come on, a little trust? She has talents you and I will never have.\" Marvin said as he continued his Sudoku puzzle, I peered over his shoulder then pointed to a box. \"That one is nine and then these ones are eight and two.\" He filled them in with a nod of his head. \"What talents?\" Dad asked with a frown so Marvin sighed and looked up with a large shrug. \"People like her?\" Marvin had a point. \"Also she's really pretty, has a great body and she's shaping up to be a really good seductress.\" I flashed a grin at dad who narrowed his eyes at me. \"I'd watch out if I were you, dad.\" \"You are so grounded. For the rest of your life.\" \"You said that last time we were out on a job.\" I pointed out. \"Didn't really work out that way, did it?\" Before he could reply Han cut in. \"If she lives, this will be good for your relationship.\" I had to smile. It was funny seeing Han giving relationship advice to my dad when only a few hours ago they were trying to kill one another. \"Exactly. If there's one thing I know, its women and covert operations.\" Marvin agreed. Dad frowned. \"That's two things.\" When Han gave a dead blank look I looked up towards the trio. \"No grasshopper, it's not.\" \"Okay this is getting weird so I am moving out.\" I flung off my coat and tossed it to Marvin, shaking out my hair so that it fell in thick waves around my head. \"Don't be late boys.\" I tossed a grin over my shoulder as I moved my hips in the bright red cocktail dress I had bought back in France. It hugged and accented my curves so as I moved and I smirked once my face was hidden from view having caught Han's surprised and downright gobsmacked look on his face as he watched me go. Glancing over to Sarah I tossed my hair over my shoulder, tilting my head back slightly as I arched my back and stretched at the bar, smiling seductively as I turned and waved my fingers with a wink at Han. \"Au revoir ma cher!\" I called in a perfectly accented voice, drawing pretty much every eye in the restaurant to me as I swung my hips then clicked out of the restaurant, giving a distraction for Sarah so that she could inject the fake poison into the minister's body without anyone noticing. The moment I was outside I walked in my heels towards the taxi where Victoria was waiting. \"You look beautiful. Did Han react?\" I grinned. \"You bet he did.\" I said as I crawled inside the backseat then did a quick change, peeling off my dress and slid into my jeans, shirt and jacket. When I saw Sarah and the minister walking down the steps I grabbed my stuff together, glanced out the window then slipped out the other door onto the road, careful of oncoming traffic then sneaked away. Once they were setting off I shoulder the backpack, found the bike I had hired then pulled on the helmet that rested there. It was a pretty sleek black Kawasaki Ninja 300, not your best bike in the world but it was the best that came up on such short notice. Sliding the helmet on I flipped down the visor then followed after Sarah and Victoria. Once the path was clear I overtook, zooming through the streets and weaving in and out of the cars. At the Iranian embassy I put my bike around the back then hurried inside, sneaking past a couple of guards by climbing up the wall and slipping in through a window which only just fit me in. It was a bit of a tricky climb but I managed it fairly well. Swallowing I looked around then changed back into my dress, grumbling as I kicked off my boots, slid on my heels then pinned back my hair into a neat twist before heading towards the bathroom Marvin intended to blow up. As I heard some men approaching I tossed my bag behind a large plant pot then looked into the mirror, picking out a blush palette from the side pocket to apply some makeup as they past, taking my time. They hardly looked at me, not even bothering to look at the ID tag around my neck that Victoria had managed to forge for me. Once they were gone I tossed the makeup back into the backpack then hurried forwards with a confident walk. I tossed the back into the bathroom, hiding it under the sink as we had arranged then stepped back outside. As I passed a group of talking men and women in suits and smart dresses I picked up a clipboard as I passed, not breaking stride so that they did not notice me as I walked away then headed towards the corridor that I needed to sweep clean. \"Excuse me. You cannot be here.\" One of the guards said as he walked towards me from around the corner, noticing me. I smiled warmly. \" Sir, are you Jahan Hal'azir?\" He blinked, frowning slightly but nodded as I spoke in his language. His large name tag was a bit of a giveaway. \"I have something here you need to sign, for a package that just came for you?\" \" A package? What package?\" \" I do not know sir, I'm just doing my job. Would you please sign here?\" I marked a cross randomly on the page then showed it to him. The moment his eyes looked down I punched him hard in the face, grabbed his arm then flipped him onto the ground, grabbing his gun as he tried to yell for help but I smothered his mouth. \"Sorry, this might hurt a little.\" I said then knocked him out with the gun. Pulling him into a room I shut it behind him then continued. The other targets were just as easy as Janan had been so in no time, I was entering the large office where Sarah was just about to leave. \"There you are.\" I smiled then noticed her panicked face. \"Are you okay?\" She nodded her head but I looked around into the room and saw the body of a stray guard lying dead on the floor. \"Oh holy crap, alright, its okay Sarah. Just give me the gun, I'll look after it for you and we'll get out of here, okay?\" She nodded and let me place my arm around her waist to guide her forwards. \"You'll be alright, the first kill is always the worst.\" I led her through the corridors until we were climbing up the stairs. When I heard dad's voice we both looked up. \"Honey, are you okay?\" Sarah struggled to keep a calm face but when she lifted up the key, dad exhaled with relief and slight surprise. \"Huh! Awesome!\" \"You go girl.\" I winked then whistled. Marvin turned then tossed me my back. Having nowhere to change I shrugged then began to strip right there. \"Wait, baby, what are you doing?\" \"Changing. I'd look away if I were you dad. My body's changed a little since I was a baby.\" I grinned as I slipped out of my heels and dress so I was standing in only my nude coloured underwear. Sarah arched her eyebrows then turned around, grabbing dad's arm to turn him and lead him away. Shimmying into my jeans I grabbed my shirt then pulled it on. Glancing over my shoulder I saw Han hastily look away and I couldn't help but blush and smile a little. Boots and jacket on I followed the others, gun in hand. I followed behind Marvin, Sarah and dad behind me with Han bringing up the rear. I think dad was beginning to get a sense of what was going on and wanted to keep an eye on the both of us. We went down into the secure unit, which now wasn't so secure, and unlocked the door using the key. Dad went first, opening the door then aiming his gun but the room was empty. After he was in I stepped inside, glancing around the room before lowering my gun slowly. I walked over to the three bodies and rolled the one facing down over with my foot. \"Isn't that Horton?\" I frowned down at him then stepped back, letting him roll back onto his face. \"Is that it?\" Dad questioned and I turned then my eyes widened when I saw the bomb. It sat neatly in the case, four large tubes of bright red stuff sitting there waiting to explode with the numbers counting down from the hour. \"It's counting down.\" \"Yeah, we can see that Marv.\" I answered, looking around the room again for nothing in particular. \"Shut it off, right?\" Han asked, looking straight at Marvin. \"Shut-shut…yeah. With what? Acupressure?\" \"I don't know!\" Han answered and I sensed the friction rising so I stepped in between them. \"Okay, calm down the both of you, before I acupressure your asses until you can't move or feel a thing.\" I glared at them both. \"Uncle Marv, can you shut it off?\" \"Well, why is it my responsibility?\" I rolled my eyes. \"You are the bomb expert here, uncle, right?\" \"Just do something.\" Han suggested unhelpfully so I turned to shoot him a look and thrust my gun out at him pointedly. \"You are not helping.\" \"With what? My Mr Chemistry set? I don't know what I'm doing.\" As Marvin reached out to tug at a wire Han held out a hand. \"No don't…\" \"You want me to push the button?\" Han backed off with a raised hand. \"Marvin.\" I cut him off and he looked at me so I sighed. \"Just calm down and work it out. You're the best there is at this kind of thing.\" He took a deep breath then nodded, going back to look over the bomb. Now I turned to Han. \"And you keep quiet Mr Trigger-Happy.\" He arched an eyebrow. \"You're one to talk.\" \"I am talking.\" I answered back. \"What you going to do about it?\" He stepped closer with slightly narrowed eyes and challenging smirk but my dad interrupted with a pointed glare at Han. \"Hey you three, let's get going.\" Glancing back at dad I nodded then pulled away. We headed back upstairs, picking up Sarah who stayed close to dad and I. When two guards turned and aimed for us, we all lifted our guns and shot in unison. It felt pretty badass. When my spine began to tingle I called out a warning. \"Look out!\" Just as a gunman came around the corner behind us I rolled, pulling out my gun then aimed, catching him in the leg so that he cried out in pain then collapsed onto one knee. \"Kiss this bitch.\" I murmured then shot him again before pressing myself into a pillar for cover, just before two other guys came out and began to shoot us. Dad and Han began to shoot whilst Marvin retreated backwards with the bomb, using it as a shield. \"Get that bomb out of here!\" Dad yelled and I glanced over my shoulder. \"No! Sarah!\" I yelled as I faced Bailey drawing Sarah back into the elevator, smirking as he pressed a gun to her head. \"Sarah!\" I leaped forwards, counting on dad and Han having my back as I shot at the door then pressed the button desperately but it had already gone. \"Dammit!\" \"Baby watch out!\" Something slammed into me and I felt my body being turned in a spin before I lost my balance and I was completely hanging from Han's arm as he raised the other to shoot the last guard. I blinked softly up at him, my fingers trapped in his jacket as I clung onto him. \"Thanks?\" He gave a small smirk and arched an eyebrow at me but did not pull away, simply continued to look at me and I felt a rosy hue begin to spread across my cheek. \"Alright let's go. Hey! You two, this isn't the time and if I have anything to do with it, it never will be!\" Thanks a lot dad, way to go. Blushing furiously I pulled away and fiddled with the gun in my hands, making sure I had enough ammo before we all split up. \"Baby!\" Dad called and I turned around. He grabbed me into a quick, tight hug then kissed my cheek. \"Stay safe and,\" he shot a dark look to Han. \"Stay away from him.\" \"Dad, really? You're going to start this now?\" I groaned then pointed my gun behind me, not even looking as a guard ran out onto my bullet. \"Save this for later, okay?\" With that I turned and hurried away to get to my bike. I'll be back soon, promise![Chapter 13] And we're back again with Natalia, wonder what's going to happen in this one? You'll have to find out on your own because a writer never spoils her secrets! Thanks guys for sticking around, see you soon I threw on the helmet, hoping that Marvin still had my bag because I didn't really want to lose that dress, it was a really nice dress. Pelting forwards I shot a couple of guards, wounding them but not fatally, as they tried to shoot at the retreating form of an icy blue Lotus. \"That is one sweet ride.\" I murmured to myself, following after them. \"Darling can you hear me?\" Victoria asked as she activated our earpieces. \"Loud and clear aunty, where's Bailey and Sarah?\" \"Your father is just getting eyes on. Be careful, we have company.\" Looking into my mirrors I sighed. \"No problem.\" I dropped back, sliding behind a van then went up the sidewalk, cutting across to do a tight U turn in the road, waiting for the land rovers to go past. \"You got the one on your tail, aunty, machine gun in the passenger seat.\" I informed as I kicked my bike into gear then sped forwards, cutting in front of a car which honked angrily at me as I swerved low and manoeuvred in and out of cars like a snake. \"I see them.\" She answered then I heard the wailing of sirens up ahead. \"Show me something.\" I assumed she was talking to Han because at that moment the lotus suddenly squealed and turned sideways on, wheels sliding as Victoria pulled out two guns and shot out both windows. I have the most badass, kickass family ever. I love them. \"Holy mother…\" I murmured as the land rover swerved, the driver having been shot, then slammed into the front end of a car, flipping it up into the air. \"Did I ever tell you how awesome you are aunty Vic?\" \"It wouldn't hurt to remind me every so often.\" She answered with a hint of pride and laughter in her voice. After a moment I heard her hiss softly under her breath. \"Holy…it's fine.\" \"What's fine? Are you hurt?\" I instantly demanded as I weaved in and out of the police cars then sped after them. \"No, Han's been caught.\" Instantly my heart dropped and made a painful twist. \"What? Is he alright? How bad is it?\" Victoria chuckled. \"He's fine, darling, it's not too bad.\" I rolled my eyes. \"Tell him he's an asshole for getting clipped.\" Victoria relayed the message and I heard a faint chuckle. \"Your father says Bailey's heading for the M4, see if you can catch up.\" \"Not a problem.\" I grinned then turned up the heat, shooting forwards. As I passed the car I glanced to the side but was gone before I could really see inside. I overtook traffic, shot over a couple of red lights and may or may have not unintentionally made a van crash into a post. Maybe? Oh well, sucks to be them. I could hear the purr of the lotus behind me but I paid attention on trying to find the car that Bailey was in. How was I going to get to him without causing harm to Sarah? Come on girl, use that thick head of yours! I never had time to come up with something, however, as gunfire shot at me from behind at the lotus and my bike. When something hot and hard slammed into the back of my shoulder, I cried out in pain and almost lost control of the bike. It swerved dangerously until I brought back my balance. \"Darling! Darling, Natalia what happened?\" Victoria demanded as tears stung my eyes. \"I'm fine. I'm fine.\" \"Natalia if you've been shot then pull out!\" Victoria tried to tell me but I ignored her. \"It's nothing, I can still do this.\" I half whimpered then pulled off the gas, shooting backwards and the lotus overtook as I slipped in between two cars. I felt hot blood spilling down my back but the pain quickly subsided as the adrenaline took over, pumping me up so that I could focus. As Han did this really amazing manoeuvre to slide under a truck, I took the opportunity to dive out of hiding, take a gun and shoot at the rover. My bullets broke the glass and I shot the driver at the same time aunty Victoria shot the shooter so I rammed up the gears and sped away to catch up to Bailey. Making a quick turn I cut across several cars, forcing them to emergency brake as I roared down the slip road towards the airport. \"Damn it we missed him! He's going into the airport.\" \"I'm still on his tail, Vic, but I can't shoot with Sarah still in the car.\" I told her, easing off the speed as I tried to figure something out. \"Where are you Francis?\" Victoria asked in a dangerous tone, telling me she was getting really pissed off with all this chasing around. After a few moments she groaned. \"Oh please tell me you're not crashing with a weapon of mass destruction.\" \"What? Dad what's going on?\" I instantly lost concentration on the car for a moment as I panicked for my dad. Was he crashing? What was happening? In my momentary lapse of concentration I didn't see the BMW until it was firing at me. Flinching I instantly swerved to the side, looking behind me to see two men firing from the front and back windows. \"You've got to be kidding me.\" \"What? What's wrong darling?\" Victoria instantly demanded. \"What's happening?\" \"I got two tangos with badass guns shooting at my rear.\" I groaned. \"Can this day get any better?\" Slipping between the gap of two cars I cut across to the outside lane over the middle, making the car behind screech at me but I paid no attention. Without hesitation I pulled out a gun and slowed down a little, aiming for the BMW from behind as it shot ahead blindly, having lost my position. \"You know, I thought the English were meant to be all polite and offer you a cup of tea and biscuits!\" I scowled as my bullets smashed through the back screen and hit the guy in the back. Easing forwards bit by bit I aimed for a tyre but when a car suddenly pulled out in front of me I had to swerve to avoid getting hit. \"Moron! Can't you English people learn to signal?\" Turning back I saw the car suddenly drop back and I quickly snaked my way out, conscious that I was running out of time. As bullets shot at me from behind I swallowed the lump in my throat. What would dad do? When the car suddenly rammed into me side on, I let out an ear piercing scream as I was thrown off balance and the bike slid along the ground, throwing me off onto the grassy ground off road. I continued to yell and cry in pain, clutching my wounded shoulder as Victoria called out to me. \"Natalia! Natalia answer me! Han she's hurt, Natalia!\" Unable to answer I rolled onto my front, shuffling as I tried to look up. The car had pulled up and the two remaining men got out, guns in hand. Swallowing I reached behind me for my gun but when my hand met empty air, my eyes widened. Frantically searching the ground I spotted the gun a few feet away. I began to crawl. \"Natalia answer me, where are you?\" \"Just keep going. I'm fine.\" I whispered in short gasps of air as I continued to crawl. One of the men shot at me and I drew back my hand as it hit the dirt not too far away from my face. \"Victoria, if I don't make it…tell daddy I love him.\" I whispered. \"You're going to make it, tell me where you are and we'll come for you. I'll shoot any bastard that tries to hurt you. Just let us help you.\" \"No, you have to stop Bailey. Get Bailey.\" I breathed, trying to control my heartbeat as I went perfectly still. \"And tell Han, tell him…I don't know, tell him…\" \"I know darling. I know. Don't stop fighting. You can do this, you're Frank Moses's daughter, after all.\" I smiled as I went still, stopping my breathing so that not even my chest rose off the ground. \"I know.\" I murmured. As they soft footfalls of two men drew closer, I heard one of them snap back the barrel of their gun then aim it down as they reached me. Moving as fast as a cobra strike I whipped out my legs and knocked the guy off balance to the ground, leaping to my feet to grab the other by the wrist as he went for his own gun and slammed my knee into his gut, head butting him at the same time then turned, pulling out his gun with him still gripping it to shoot the first man then flipped the second over, tearing the gun from his hand then shot him also. Panting for breath I clenched my teeth together, biting down the pain before sighing. \"Piece of cake.\" Victoria had never sounded so relieved. \"Thank god! She's alright.\" She informed Han as I stumbled back to my bike. \"Darling, that was very brave of you but also very, very stupid ! Whatever it was, that is.\" I grinned as I reached my bike and pulled it back up. \"Just like dad then, right?\" Pausing I could hear Victoria smiling as I revved up the bike then shot off, changing from first up the gears until I was going at a steady but quick speed. \"Yes just like your father.\" With that said I dived into the airport. I found the runway, the lotus was parked in good view so it wasn't too hard. I watched as a plane took off, pulling up beside the lotus then took off the helmet with one hand, dropping it to the ground as I reached back to hold my shoulder seemingly together. \"What happened?\" Han demanded as Marvin approached. \"I couldn't disarm it.\" He answered simply and my mouth fell open as I watched the plane fly away with Bailey on it, Nightshade still in dad's hands but thankfully, Sarah was too. \"Oh crap.\" Victoria cursed then strode at Marvin. \"Marvin, it's going to detonate?\" Her face was slightly afraid. \"Yep.\" He answered, seemingly calm but I could see the slight panic in his eyes. \"Put your arms around me.\" She commanded and Marvin embraced her tightly. I felt my heart hammer in powerful terror as I inhaled sharply, flinching as I felt my shoulder continue to burn. \"So we're going to die?\" I whispered and Han looked at me as I came slowly closer to everyone. Biting my lip I blushed a little then sighed. \"Oh shut you asshole.\" I muttered then stepped into him, placing my head against his chest as his arms wound around me securely, carefully avoiding my right shoulder. \"Just hold me good and tight and don't let go.\" Pressing my eyes tightly shut I was somewhat calmed by his solid presence, the soft but relaxing smell that surrounding him consuming my attention as I leaned into him, his chin resting on the top of my head. When the explosion boomed into life I flinched and gripped onto Han tighter, expecting a quick but painful death but when I wasn't hit by a bigger blast of searing pain I frowned then opened my eyes, turning around but didn't step away from Han as I watched dad smirk silently to himself. As the brilliant cloud of fire rolled out in the sky like a seriously deadly ripple, I couldn't help but admire the bright myriad of colour as it burned brightly, illuminating our faces and washing them with the golden glow like sunlight at sunset. \"You put the bomb on the plane.\" Victoria guessed and I sighed, relaxing completely before laughing, reaching back with my left hand to slide through Han's hair as he looked down at me with a cocky smirk. \"Oh shut up.\" I murmured at him but couldn't help but smile as his grip tightened around me. \"You didn't think to mention that?\" Victoria glared heartily at dad who shrugged innocently then spotted Han and I. \"Hey, you two can separate, it ain't the end of the world yet.\" I rolled my eyes, shot a smirk at Han then walked at Sarah, opening my left arm to hug her as she smiled. \"You blew up my plane.\" Han accused hotly at dad and Sarah looked up, biting her lip. \"Sorry.\" \"So, I was wrong, we're not even going to die?\" Marvin asked, genuinely shocked at the revelation. I grinned, turning to face him with my arm slung over Sarah's shoulders. \"Not today uncle Marv, I still have college to finish and plenty of butts to kick in my future.\" I watched as Han stood in front of dad with a dark look in his eyes. \"And I was actually starting to like you.\" Well that's a massive leap forwards, don't you think? \"I was even thinking about not killing you. This is what happens when you try to save the world.\" Victoria came forwards to try and smooth things over. \"Hey, it worked didn't it?\" I pointed out. \"Han, Han…you can't put a price on these things.\" Victoria tried to say but Han shook his head and I grinned, leaning over to Sarah and whispered. \"I think he's going to try.\" Sure enough, he pointed at dad with a meaningfully serious charisma. \"You owe me…thirty mill for the plane and twenty mill for not killing you.\" He prodded his finger into dad's chest. \"You're a dead man, Moses.\" \"Ouch. The world's only worth fifty million? That's gotta sting.\" Dad simply smiled softly at Han then nodded at him as the bright glare of the explosion continued to burn like solar fire. \"Thanks for your help.\" He said in his soft and gentle voice. \"Really.\" As he began to walk away Sarah glanced over her shoulder. \"You think he means it?\" \"Nah he's a nice guy.\" Han rolled his eyes then turned. \"I mean it Frank!\" I grinned then placed a hand on my hip, arching an eyebrow. \"Oh, so he's Frank now is he? Well this is wonderful, you guys are actually getting along.\" Han took a step closer to me and I lifted my chin defiantly, still holding my wounded shoulder. He glanced over towards it then sighed. \"Didn't anyone ever tell you that when someone's shooting at you, you get out the way?\" He asked as he leaned forwards a little, our chests almost touching. I chuckled. \"Maybe. I'm a slow learner.\" I answered but before I could even think to reach up to him, dad's voice cut me off. \"Hey! Hey! I'm right here!\" I groaned. \"Don't I know it.\" I muttered under my breath and Han grinned a little as dad came storming back. He pulled me back behind him and pointed at Han. \"She is off limits. You hear me?\" Han shrugged. \"If you say so, Moses.\" Before they could begin a fight or an argument, I whistled. \"Hey, guys? Little help here? I'm kind of bleeding out and I'm not entirely sure I can keep on standing up for much longer.\" Dad instantly whirled around and was fussing over me. Over his shoulder I shot a wink at Han. Dad tried to carry me to the car but I objected definitely, not wanting to look like some stupid princess in need of a rescue. I took off my jacket and allowed him to look at it. \"You should be okay, it's not lethal.\" Dad informed me as he inspected it carefully, prodding the inflamed skin around the wound. I bit back a cry. \"Damn! You never told me getting shot hurts this much.\" I growled, shrugging my jacket back on. \"I liked this jacket.\" I frowned sadly at it. \"Now it has a bullet hole in it.\" \"Hey you could always take it in as evidence that you were out saving the world instead of being in college.\" Sarah pointed out as we all headed back to our vehicles. The bike was a total mess and I'd dropped the helmet, so it was probably not as safe to wear as it had been when I had first got it. Plus I'd also been thrown from the bike and hit the ground pretty hard so it was most likely cracked in a few places. \"I can fix it.\" Marvin said. \"Stand back everyone.\" We all did so and I frowned, watching as he leaned over the side, fiddled with something then began to walk away. When he lifted a button and pressed it, I tried to cry out in protest but the moment his finger pushed the button, the bike exploded. I stared in shock. \"What the…you…but…Marvin!\" I yelled. \"Now I won't get the deposit back at all!\" \"Bike was totalled. Might as well let it go with a bang.\" I glared at him. \"I liked that bike! Marvin you are so dead!\" Dad gripped my arm, holding me back. \"Calm down tiger, it's just a bike.\" I grumbled under my breath. \"It wasn't just a bike.\" But I let it go. I'd just put some salt in Marvin's tea later and pretend its poison or something. As we all walked back Han took my wrist and pulled me back, letting the others go. I arched an eyebrow at him. \"So just to double check, you're not going to kill my dad are you?\" \"I will have to think about it.\" He answered, stepping a little closer to me. \"Well, if you decide that you will, let me know.\" I smirked at him. \"So I can kill you first.\" \"Like you could.\" Immediately I squared my shoulders as best I could and stood up a little taller. \"Is that a challenge?\" \"Maybe.\" I was aware that the others had stopped and looked back for us but I ignored them as Han slowly smiled. \"But you couldn't kill me.\" \"You wanna bet?\" Instantly I was planning a sequence in my head that would kick his ass to the ground but when he leaned in close and whispered in my ear, all thoughts disappeared. \"You'd rather shoot someone in the eye, as I understand.\" My face paled dramatically then blushed a deep scarlet all the way to my roots in horrified embarrassment. \"You swine! You were listening?\" I pushed against his shoulder with my left hand, taking a step back as he grinned. \"I was very touched.\" \"You…you…\" I fumbled, trying to find the right insult but Han stepped in for me instead. \"Asshole?\" \"Yes!\" I shot at him then dragged my hand through my messy hair. It was spilling wildly out of my plait so I yanked out the band and snapped it around my wrist, dragging my fingers through so that it fell in wild waves around my shoulders. Turning back to Han I tilted my head then licked my lips slowly and meaningfully, smirking ever so slightly as his eyes snapped towards the movement. \"So how much did you hear?\" He blinked for a second before answering. \"All of it.\" \"Hmm…\" I parted my lips and stepped up really close to him, turning my shoulders at an angle slightly as I lowered my voice to a sultry, rich tone. \"So, what do you think?\" \"I think you're going to get me in a lot of trouble.\" He answered in a husky, silky smooth voice that sent shivers down my spine but I controlled them so that they didn't show. I was in the one control here. \"I thought you were the trouble attracting type?\" I murmured softly. He began to speak but I cut him off with my mouth. I heard dad begin to protest but Victoria and Sarah both clapped him on the back of the head at the same time. Me being in charge of that kiss, I kept it smooth, slow and seductive, just as Victoria had taught me. I also kept it short. His mouth felt wonderful, strangely warm against mine but I guess that could simply be because I've lost a bit of blood and I was a little cold. Before I could lose myself into that kiss like I so desperately wanted to, I forced myself to pull away and turned on my heel, flicking my hair over my shoulder then strode away, smirking smugly to myself as I climbed into the lotus, started up the engine then revved away with Han still staring after me. Through the earpiece I heard Victoria laugh. \"Han? She's just stolen your car.\" Over the link I heard a very loud Korean curse directed at me and I laughed, honking the horn as I sped away to find a hospital. Ha ha ha, I loved this last bit, very Natalia, don't you think?[Chapter 14] Ha, did you really think I'd leave you hanging? No of course not, the story is not yet over! Enjoy From saving the world one day and college the next…it sucked. I had a tonne of work to catch up on and my mind was constantly flitting out of concentration as a certain Korean contract killer filled my mind. Not good, my own seduction had backfired on me horribly. Dad called every other day now, with Sarah reminding him a couple of times. Finally we'd found our even ground. We went out for meals as a family or to the theatre, dad even found me a new job which I loved a lot, since it was working with children. I was a babysitter for a couple of old contacts that he knew. They wanted a nanny to look after their kids who could also protect them if necessary. Being Frank Moses's kid certainly looked good on your application. I felt a little bad for stealing Han's car but I soon found that I loved it. It certainly got me a few new \"friends\" at college when I drove up in it, with new wing mirrors and windows. I put them all down in their place though, making sure they knew I wanted nothing to do with them. I didn't need fake friends, I only had family and that was perfect for me because I could love them all with everything I was. Ivan and Victoria visited me in my apartment a few weeks after the near end-of-the-world death experience and I took them out to the best restaurant in town, after they insisted on treating me, and we had champagne, expensive food and a wonderful time together, reminiscing and catching up. As usual, Ivan brought me a little mint sweet and I laughed, wondering when he would decide I was too old for mint treats. He proudly informed me I would never be too old. Since Victoria wasn't exactly safe back in England she was moving out to Russia with Ivan, finally settling down into the life she had always wanted and deserved with him. As a parting gift I had given them both a little box which inside contained a snow globe of two figures skating on ice. \"I know it's not much but I thought they looked a little like you and the background has stars on it so…\" Ivan chortled with laughter at my blabbering and hugged me tightly. They loved it which made me relax greatly. Sitting alone in my studio with the music cranked up I hummed along, painting on the canvas. The paint slathered the last bit of paint on I left it to dry, carefully wiping my eyes since I knew I had green paint all up my arm and on my hands. When my mobile rang I smiled and used my clean hand to answer after turning down the music. \"Hey dad.\" \"Hey baby, how are things?\" \"They're okay, I've literally just finished another one of my paintings. I think you'll like it.\" I told him as I ran my eyes over the canvas, grinning. \"Really? What is it of?\" My eyes wandered over the guy carrying a gun, frowning deeply in conversation as the shadowed edges snaked in at him, glass shattered from behind with a bullet hole in front as if you were looking at him through a window. \"You.\" I answered simply and he laughed. \"Can't wait to see it baby.\" \"How's Sarah?\" \"She's great, actually, we just got back from that job I was telling you about. You know how she gets, can't stop talking about it.\" I chuckled, picking up a glass of water to take a sip, smudging paint all over it. \"Shame you couldn't come.\" I hummed shortly, swallowing the water. \"I have to finish college first. Only one more semester then I'm home free. I'll wait a while before I start a real career. I want to travel a bit.\" \"You do whatever you want, baby, I'll support you whatever you do.\" I grinned mischievously. \"Even if I want to be a prostitute and migrate to Spain?\" There was a deadly silence so I laughed. \"I'm kidding dad.\" \"You better be young lady, otherwise I'll put you under house arrest for the rest of your life.\" I laughed again as I began to clear up my paints, leaning my head into my shoulder to hold the phone. \"I'd find a way out, dad, you taught me everything you know. By the way, have you spoken to Marvin? He still has my bag with my dress.\" \"Yeah he's around, I'll get it back to you. Although I'm not too sure about that dress, don't you think it's a little short?\" Unable to hide my laughter I chuckled, smiling broadly as I tossed my paintbrushes into the warm water and began to clean them. \"It covered my ass, dad, if that's what you meant by short.\" \"Yes but still.\" Rolling my eyes. Over his end I heard Sarah call out. \"Is that Nat?\" \"Yeah honey, you wanna say hi?\" \"Sure I do! Hey Nat! How you been?\" Sarah's bright voice made me smile again. \"I'm good, thank you Sarah. I hear you just got back. How did it go?\" Instantly she was off. \"Oh it was great! This time Frank actually gave me a you-know-what and I we got the other you-know-what out of the you-know-where whilst Marvin did the thing with the thing he does and I even got to drive a really nice car whilst some guys were following us and I think I scared your dad half to death as I kind of drove off road and then…\" Her voice trailed off in my mind as I felt strong but gentle hands slowly slide around my waist and a mouth tenderly touch my right shoulder, placing a chaste kiss there before leaning forwards and the lips rested against the side of my neck. \"Han…\" I breathed a soft sigh as my body completely melted out of sensibility. His scent enveloped me and I finally figured out what it was. Peppermint and this really attractive cologne that I wanted to buy for myself, because it was so good I was sure I could eat it and it would taste just as amazing. \"…all before the you-know-what could you-know-what!\" I was vaguely aware of Sarah speaking so I blinked then cleared my throat. \"I'm really glad you had a great time, Sarah, it's good to see dad loosening the reins a little.\" One of Han's hands slid forwards to rest on my stomach as he nuzzled my neck, making me whimper ever so slightly. \"I'm afraid I'll have to go though, can I call you back? Something has just come up.\" \"Yeah sure. I'll tell your dad you said bye. Have fun! Don't drink too much at the parties!\" As she hung up I spun around and dropped my phone. Han's quick hand snatched it from mid-air and gently placed it on the table. I just stared at him. \"What are you doing here?\" I whispered, instantly glancing around, half expecting someone to leap out and try to kill him and then me. \"What…you…you're here!\" He chuckled and I blinked in surprised, opening my ears to drink in the sound. \"Payback.\" He whispered in my ear then turned his head to kiss me. My heart hammered and fluttered in my chest as my eyes slid shut of their own accord, my body naturally responding to his touch. It wasn't just me, his mouth really was warm and smooth. My hands lifted up and ran through his soft hair, forgetting that they were wet, to pull him closer to me as I turned my head into his to kiss him more deeply. Before I could really get into enjoying this kiss Han pulled away and stepped away from me. Opening my eyes I arched an eyebrow. \"Okay, what are you up to?\" I demanded and he shrugged, continuing to take slow, small steps back from me. \"You stole my car.\" Suddenly I grinned from ear to ear and I ran a hand over my hair, pushing back my long fringe. \"Your family seem set on stealing all my belongings.\" He accused and I laughed, turning back to the sink to finish washing up. \"It's a sweet ride, all of a sudden I'm really popular at college. The joy rides are great and once or twice, maybe more, I took it on a date with a potential love interest.\" I glanced up and could see he was trying to work out whether or not I was being serious. Either way he looked horrified at the thought. \"I'm kidding, I haven't let anyone else touch it. It's out back.\" I said as I flicked some water at him. \"You are just like your father.\" Han sighed, jerking out the way of the water as I put the last of my brushes in a pot to try, heads up, then dried off my hands. I finished putting away my paints, conscious of Han watching me but I did my best to ignore him until I couldn't stand the silence any longer. \"So what are you doing here anyway Han?\" I asked him as he flicked through some paper drawings of ideas, sketches and plans for my artwork. \"I didn't know you could draw.\" He mused, ignoring my question. Scowling at him I picked up a large rubber band ball and threw it at him. His hand snatched out and caught it with lightning fast reflexes. \"Don't ignore me jackass.\" I warned him, placing my hands on my hips. \"What are you doing here?\" He looked away and I frowned slightly. Was he…embarrassed by something? Damn, I think he's blushing. Ah he's blushing! \"I came to see you.\" He answered slowly, voice sexily accented and I could only stare at him. \"I wanted to see you.\" Slowly I smiled at him, this time blushing a rosy red. \"Thanks, I guess?\" He approached me slowly and I looked to his hair, reaching up to brush a few droplets off from where I had run my hands through the really soft locks. \"How long are you staying?\" \"A while.\" Oh that's really helpful. What the hell was I supposed to say now? Do you think he would mind if I ordered him to kiss me again? \"Do you…want something to eat?\" I offered weakly. \"I make a mean bacon sandwich.\" Han smiled softly, reaching up to twirl a lock of my hair around his finger before running it through, feeling it softly. \"Let me take you somewhere for a meal.\" He said and I almost chocked. \"Wh-what?\" \"Just don't tell Moses.\" Suddenly I smiled and nodded my head. \"Alright you're on. Just let me get changed okay.\" He nodded and stepped back. \"Just don't take forever.\" He warned me. I flashed him a smirk then headed into my bedroom. I scrubbed my hands, arms and face clean of all the paint then paused. Putting on a dressing gown I stuck my head out the door. \"Who's paying?\" Han looked up from another scrapbook with a small frown. \"What do you mean?\" \"Am I paying tonight or are you? Because if I'm paying then we're going to a fish and chip place and I'll wear jeans and jacket, because that's all I can really afford but if you're paying then I'll make some degree of effort.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Me.\" Flashing him a smile I ducked back inside then shut the door. Rubbing my hands together I frowned. This is the time I would need Sarah's help because now I was totally lost. What the hell do you wear on a first date with a guy who could literally roll around in millions of dollars? Shrugging I decided that I should probably wear the only dress I owned, apart from the red one. I slipped into the royal blue dress, tugging it into place. It was strapless with a heart shaped neckline and complimented me well. It was pretty plain but I dressed it up a little with strappy silver jewelled heels, a little silver necklace dad had bought me a few years ago then brushed my hair so that it was soft and neat. Being totally lost with the makeup department I put on a very tiny amount of foundation, some eyeliner and mascara before deeming myself presentable. \"Alright then Natalia, time to make a complete ass of yourself. Let's go.\" Grabbing a small silver clutch I strode out of my room. \"Don't you dare even think about making a sarcastic comment.\" I told him as I walked past towards the door, grabbing the car keys along the way. \"Wouldn't dream of it.\" He said then snatched the keys from my hand. \"My car.\" He informed me then kissed the tip of my nose before heading out to the back where his beloved lotus sat quietly. I followed him, a little dazzled but I snapped myself awake. \"You fixed it up?\" I shrugged. \"You owe me for the payments.\" I informed him. \"Dinner tonight doesn't count.\" I slid into the passenger seat then watched as he elegantly slid into the driver's seat. He glanced at me then started up the car. \"You weren't really serious about the fifty million dollars were you?\" I questioned him slowly and he smirked, watching the road as he waited for an opening. \"Deadly.\" He answered quietly then sped forwards. I hurried to put on my seatbelt. Han drove out of town and I wondered where he was taking me until he stopped outside a really, really, really expensive hotel and restaurant. \"You know you're quite a romantic for a government contract hit man.\" I told him as I stared up at the place, wishing I had a pair of gloves and some real diamonds. \"But now I just feel tacky.\" As the car was driven away by one of the doormen, Han slipped an arm around my waist and whispered in my ear. \"You look beautiful.\" Okay, I'll admit, my heart did a little dance and I blushed. A lot. He looked behind me at my right shoulder then back into my eyes as we walked up the steps together. \"How is it?\" \"Healed over. I think there's a bit of a scar still. I can't really bring myself to look.\" I admitted. \"Doctors pulled it out and patched me up, asking all kind of questions so I told them about this crazy guy driving a blue Lotus up the M4 being shot at by these other guys in a Land Rover and I got caught because I was on a bike and didn't see them in time to get out the way.\" I put on my British accent with a smile. \"Then I hightailed out of there. With said blue Lotus.\" I looked at his neck. \"What about you?\" \"Wasn't much of a hit. Those English have bad aim, a bit like you.\" I bumped him with my hip, shooting him a playful glare as we entered. We were led to a private table and I let Han order the wine seeing as I had no idea what it was he was ordering. Looking around me my eyes were filled with starry lights from the chandeliers, candles and low lit lamp, casting the entire room, as large as a stadium, into a beautiful and mysterious atmosphere that blended with the gentle thrum of the band that played quietly and poetically on the raised marble stage. I was so lost in awe of the architecture that for a while I did not notice that Han was simply watching me. \"What? I've never been in a place quite like this before.\" I informed him with a slight blush and he smiled softly. \"You looked like a child seeing snow for the first time.\" Chuckling I looked up as our waiter brought us the wine, a fresh white cloth draped over his arm as he poured my drink first then Han's. He left us alone to decide what we were going to order. I looked over the menu, frowning slightly. It all looked so delicious and amazing, I wanted to taste it all but it was also really expensive. \"Han?\" He looked up at me but said nothing. \"Are you sure this is alright? I mean I'd be just as happy ordering takeout.\" I bit my lip. \"Just choose something Natalia.\" I completely forgot all he said when I heard my name come from his mouth. How was it that with just his voice he can completely bewitch me by simply saying my name? It was so unfair. \"Say that again.\" He sighed. \"Just choose-\" \"No, just the part where you said my name.\" He raised an eyebrow at me but I leaned forwards expectantly so he spoke. \"Natalia.\" Tiny butterflies fluttered around in my chest and I blushed slightly. Why did I have to be the one who felt like a young schoolgirl falling in love for the first time? Wait, did I just say love? Oh crap! I hurriedly looked down at the menu and buried my nose into it. We ordered our meals and I sat there, continuing to gaze around me until Han's voice brought me back to face him. \"How long have you been an artist?\" \"Since I was little. I always used to draw as a kid. Sometimes I'd make pictures out of my food and it would take me so long that it would go cold by the time I had finished.\" I smiled fondly. \"My…my mom was an artist.\" Han gave me a small look of confusion. \"What happened to your mother?\" Shifting uncomfortably I sighed. \"She took off when I was around five. She couldn't deal with dad coming and going so inconsistently. I don't think she was always…right in the head. Some of the things she did weren't normal.\" I told him, reaching back to try and remember an example. \"Like one day she blocked up all the sinks and turned the taps on to flood the house both upstairs and downstairs. She told me she was cleaning.\" Swirling the wine in my glass I gazed down reminiscently at it, the dark red reminding me a little of blood. \"She'd often attack him whenever she got angry, there's a scar on the back of his head from one of their fights. Well one day he came back to find mom gone and me all alone in the dark, crying because I was hungry.\" \"She just left you?\" I shrugged, looking up at him with a hard expression. \"Could have been worse. She could have taken me with her.\" I shook my head then smiled. \"But what about you? Tell me your story.\" Han leaned back a little, drawing in a slow, deep breath. So he began his story, from the place and date of his birth through all the events of his life. Some of them left me in tears, desperately trying to hide them so that I didn't draw attention to us. He seemed so calm about it all, even when he talked about his parents hurting him as a child. Once he was finished our main course was here and I just stared at him. I couldn't believe half of what he said and I almost didn't want to but I knew that not a word had been a lie. \"Wow.\" I breathed, blinking to force myself to stop staring. \"You were one messed up kid, you know that?\" He laughed quietly as I turned my attention to my food. \"You do not intend to become an agent like Moses?\" Han asked after a moment but I shook my head, not looking up. \"I'm not much of an agent. My mouth is too big and I'm not all that discreet. I'm a specialist, I guess you could say. In butt kicking and seductions. Although I have got into protecting kids, recently. You know, rich parents who can afford half the world who sometimes need an extra pair of eyes on their kids?\" Han looked at me blankly. \"I cannot see you having the patience for children.\" I laughed, covering my mouth full of food with my hand before swallowing. \"You're right to some extent. I can't stand snobby kids but I do love them, I'm actually quite good with children.\" I gave a little shrug as I filled my fork again. \"Plus they pay pretty well. I was thinking of making that my business. Protection programme.\" Glancing around the room I found myself perfectly relaxed in Han's company. \"Either that or I'll go into journalism. I have doors open for both jobs.\" Han nodded his head, putting his cutlery down as he finished his food. \"I hate journalists.\" Han muttered. \"They are all too nosy for their own good.\" \"Why? Did one of them nearly catch you in the middle of a job?\" I asked with a smirk which he rolled his eyes at. \"No.\" \"You sure?\" \"Yes!\" \"I think you're lying.\" \"Stop it Natalia.\" I instantly fell quiet and he smirked victoriously as he found a weak spot with me. \"Don't you dare start manipulating me with that.\" I warned him as he leaned forwards. \"Natalia…\" He taunted in a low, husky whisper, making me groan. \"I hate you.\" Lacing my hands together I met his eyes evenly, wondering what his week spot was. I began to twirl a lock of hair around my finger as I thought, running through a list of possibilities but I stopped when I realised he was watching me fiddle with my hair. Score! Found it. I gave him a small smug look then looked up as the waiter came back. \"Will you wanting desserts this evening, sir, madam?\" I looked to Han who gestured to me, saying it was my choice. I thought for a moment before shaking my head. I was stuffed full anyway and I was starting to get a little tired. \"Very well then, thank you for joining us, has everything been satisfactory?\" \"Yes. Thank you.\" Han nodded as the waiter brought him the bill. I still felt a little guilty for letting him pay for everything. I picked up my silver clutch and slipped it over my shoulder, gazing around one last time before I felt Han touch my waist gently. \"Come. I'll take you home.\" We remained in a comfortable silence during the journey back to my place. After a while though I decided the silence was too deafening. \"Where are you staying?\" \"In a hotel.\" Han answered, glancing into his mirror before switching lanes. \"Three blocks from where you live.\" \"Oh.\" I nodded my head. Summoning my courage I continued. \"Will I see you again?\" He smiled then looked at me for a moment before returning his eyes to the road. \"Yes.\" I visibly relaxed. \"When?\" \"Soon.\" \"Oh that's really helpful. Are you going to do this every time? Just spring up randomly from time to time, take me out to some amazing place then not tell me how long I have to wait until next time?\" His silence told me that I was right. \"You're such an asshole.\" \"Just for you.\" He answered simply then slowed as we came towards some lights. Another sports car rolled up, I think it was a Lamborghini, and it revved its engines loudly at us, rolling down the window. \"Let's see what you got punk!\" The man shouted and I heard the blonde twig next to him giggling, obviously intoxicated. Han never even looked at them. \"I'll leave you in the dust you Asian jackass, your piece of junk won't be able to keep up with this bad boy!\" \"Wow, jeez, he's such an angel of manners.\" I frowned, wriggling in my seat. Slowly Han turned to look at me. A slow smile crept across my face and I turned to face the red light as it flicked to amber. The engine of the car next to us roared loudly and the blonde bimbo squealed, clapping her hands. Hey, at least I have a little more class than that . The moment the lights were green Han was tearing forwards, shooting out in front of the Lamborghini and cutting him off. I heard a long stream of very unpleasant curses following us. \"How rude.\" I mused bluntly then dug into my purse. \"Show me something.\" I gave Han a pointed smirk and he chuckled, grinning slightly before chancing gears. The car suddenly spun around as I rolled down the window, arm sliding out with my small gun in hand. Shooting a single bullet I pursed my lips as it hit the tyre, making both the driver and girl scream as the car suddenly jerked violently, swerving out of control as the guy slammed on the breaks. We turned a full circle then Han continued to drive. For a moment there was a loud silence before we both burst out laughing. We laughed all the way to the next light where I leaned back, grinning then looked over at Han who was still smiling with laughter. Taking off my belt I leaned across and as Han's head turned towards me, I closed my eyes and kissed him. I've never enjoyed kissing anyone as much as I did Han, it just felt perfectly normal and irresistibly amazing. My hands gripped the side of the seat as my hair fell forwards, tickling my face. He let go of the steering wheel with one hand and pushed my hair back gently, leaning into me as I made a small sound in my throat, wanting more of him. When I pulled away reluctantly to glance at the lights Han's hand slid around to the back of my neck and drew my lips back to his, shifting closer and tilting his head to the side to welcome me forwards. \"Han.\" I murmured into his mouth. \"Light's green.\" He sighed softly as we both pulled away. As he drove forwards I shifted back into my seat, pulling the belt across. \"I'm sorry.\" I said a little meekly. \"I don't know what prompted me to do that.\" \"I'm not complaining.\" I chuckled quietly as he reached across with one hand to trace the back of his finger over my cheek then tucked my hair behind my ear. Suddenly my eyes widened and I clapped both hands to my face. \"Oh god…\" Han looked at me with worry. \"What the hell am I going to tell dad?\" After a moment's tension we both began to laugh again. You can tell trouble is just around the corner. Natalia, good luck telling your dad. I would not want to be you.[Chapter 15] So we're REALLY close to the end...but I don't want it to be :( I've really enjoyed writing this story, I just hope you guys have enjoyed reading it as much as I have. Second to last chapter, see you soon! Although not entirely reliable, Han certainly knew how to make a girl feel special. Because of his work he was not always sure when he would get a break long enough to come and visit me but whenever he did, he always stayed for at least a week and spent every moment with me. We dated secretly for about a month before I summed up the courage to tell dad exactly what was going on. Sarah knew and she was completely on my side, which was a little comforting. I pulled up onto dad's drive then got out, running a hand through my hair as I inhaled a breath of courage. Then I went to the door. Before I even knocked the door flew open. \"Hey!\" Dad beamed happily then drew me into a crushing hug. \"How are you baby?\" \"I'm good, thanks dad.\" I answered, hugging him back with a relaxed smile before pulling back. \"We need to talk. Can I come in?\" \"Sure, you know you can just walk in.\" He informed me but I laughed. \"If I did that, you'd attack me as an intruder.\" I answered simply. \"Remember?\" \"That was an accident, it was early in the morning and I hadn't expected you.\" Dad replied defensively, chuckling as he led the way into the kitchen. \"Can I get you something to drink?\" \"No, thanks. Where's Sarah?\" \"Nat!\" Sarah called out happily then flung her arms around me as I turned towards the sound of her voice. \"Ah look at you, you get more beautiful every time I see you. Honestly, Frank, I've no idea how you managed to make such a pretty girl.\" She lowered her voice. \"I'm guessing you didn't get your looks from him.\" \"Hey! I can hear you!\" Dad spread his hands, knife in one and cucumber in the other. \"I'm pretty good looking for a guy my age.\" \"Yeah…\" Sarah teased with a grin, pulling up a chair for me to sit down at the table. \"You picked a good day to come over, I invited Marvin for a barbeque as well as Victoria and Ivan. They'll get here any moment.\" The bell rang. \"I'll get it!\" Sarah called then darted for the front door. \"Why didn't you invite me dad?\" \"I did, I left several voice messages on your phone but you never picked up.\" That would be why then. \"Yeah, my mobile kinda got smashed to pieces and I haven't yet managed to get a replacement for it.\" Dad instantly frowned. \"Do you want some money for one?\" I shook my head. \"No thanks dad, it's motivating me into finding another job.\" Dad blushed which made me smile at him. \"It's not your fault for what happened.\" \"It kind was.\" I paused before shrugging. \"Well, yeah, but that doesn't matter.\" I lifted up my head as I heard Ivan's booming voice. \"My little mint cake!\" \"Uncle Ivan!\" I beamed, leaping up from my seat to throw my arms about him, laughing as he tickled my side gently then drew back. \"Ah! Of course, we cannot forget…\" He dug into his pocket then held out a little chocolate mint wrapped in shiny foil. \"Thanks Ivan.\" I grinned, taking it from him then unwrapped it, chewing on the minty flavour slowly as I turned to Victoria. \"Hello darling, how have you been?\" \"I'm great thanks.\" I replied, kissing her cheek. \"I'm nearly free from college which means I can start my own life.\" Victoria laughed. \"Live it whilst you're young. That's the best advice I can give you.\" She said then went over to dad to greet him. I turned to Marvin who was looking around suspiciously before he looked to me. He smiled. \"Hey there.\" He drew me into a hug, patting my back softly as he did so. \"Did you grow taller?\" I shook my head. \"No Marvin, you've grown shorter.\" He pulled back then looked deeply into my eyes. \"What was Natalia's favourite toy when she was seven years old?\" \"Marvin, really? You think I wouldn't know my own daughter?\" Dad groaned but I laughed. \"It was wooden katana that you had carved for me. You used old wood you had cut down from an oak tree.\" Marvin nodded his head, satisfied so I hugged him again then helped dad prepare the salad as he started cooking the meat on the barbeque. \"I thought you already had a job though.\" He said to me as he flipped over a burger. \"You know, the one I arranged for you.\" \"Yeah but it's not consistent. Although they pay a lot and it covers my bills, I still need to work during the day to keep up with other things like groceries and a new phone.\" I explained. \"Oh and before you worry, I managed to save the chip so I can put it into my new phone so calls and message will remain on the ghost line.\" Dad nodded his head, satisfied. \"What was it you wanted to talk to me about?\" I stiffened slightly, halting in my chopping before continuing. I cleared my throat and tried to calm myself down from the worry. \"I uh…I have a boyfriend.\" Dad's entire body tensed and his charisma darkened considerably but he nodded his head. \"Okay.\" I blinked at him. \"Okay? What do you mean okay?\" I waved a hand in front of his face. \"Are you felling alright? You're not even screaming off your head.\" \"No, I'm fine. Sarah has been talking to me and I've come to terms with the fact that you're not three years old anymore. You're a grown woman and you need space to grow and, if necessary, make your own mistakes and choices.\" He gave me a slightly forced smile. \"Even if I hate it.\" \"I'll always be your little girl, dad.\" I informed him then bit my lip. \"But I'm going to warn you now. You're not going to like who it is. In fact, I'm pretty sure you're going to hate him.\" Dad narrowed his eyes slightly. \"Why? Who is it?\" \"Me.\" I whirled around, dropping everything in my hands as I stared at the voice which had spoken out. \"Han?\" Dun. Dun...DUUUUUUUM![Chapter 16] Here it is\" The final chapter! It's small I know but I'm hoping it's just a little bit funny, I did try :) I'm sad to be leaving this story now but wait...who knows? There might one day be a sequel...? Everyone was frozen in place as we all stared at Han, who leaned against the wall as if he had not a care in the world. I sensed dad shift, drawing up his shoulders. Suddenly I was very glad that he and Sarah had bought a very secluded house. At least there were no neighbours to call the cops on us. Han looked over to me and a flicker of a smile touched his face, making me relax instantly. \"Han…\" Before I could even move dad had grabbed the knife I had dropped onto the table next to him and hurled it at Han. With a strangled yell I grabbed the head of lettuce and flung it forwards. The knife buried into it and was thrown off course, the lettuce hitting the ground and splattering apart. \"Dad no!\" I yelled, grabbing his arm but he was already striding towards Han, shaking me off easily. \"Francis this is not necessary!\" Victoria yelled as Sarah screamed. Frank had grabbed Han and thrown him onto the table, shattering it completely. \"You're dating my daughter?\" Frank half yelled at Han who flipped back onto his feet and moved to defend himself, ducking under dad's blows. Dad punched so hard at Han that when he ducked under the blow, he pulled himself off balance, allowing Han to kick him down with an expertly placed strike. \"Stop it! Both of you!\" I leaped forwards and stood in front of Han as dad turned, making him pause. Han tried to pull me out of the way to protect me but I placed a firm hand on his chest and held my other hand up to dad. \"Now just calm down.\" I glared at him. \"Please.\" Marvin and Ivan both had their hands on dad's shoulders, pulling him back away from us as he slowly began to calm down. Victoria and Sarah were standing, preparing to join the fight but I waved them back to keep clear of the danger zone. \"You can't date him, baby, do you have any idea what he does?\" Dad jerked a finger at Han who remained still at my touch. \"I do.\" Nodding my head I sighed. \"I don't like it but I trust him when he says he does not kill the innocent. Han doesn't just kill anyone who offers some dollar, he takes down drug lords and terrorist leaders. Dad, please just listen to me.\" Dad shot Han a glare but nodded. \"I know you only want the best for me but Han…he makes me feel special. I've never felt the way I do about anyone than how I feel with Han but, if you're really so against it, I'll walk away from him. If you don't trust me enough to make my own choices then I'll do whatever you want.\" It was a risky move, playing the pressure points I knew made dad twitch. Han reached forwards and took my hand, winding his fingers in with mine and I drew in a deep breath, allowing his comforting touch to calm my nerves as I watched dad carefully. His eyes dropped to the movement Han had made and then to the place where Han now rested a hand on my shoulder protectively, preparing to fling me out the way of dad's fury. Finally he shrugged both Ivan and Marvin off of his arms then growled. \"You'd best stay for the barbeque then.\" With that he turned and stalked back over to the food which was beginning to crisp and burn. I exhaled with relief then fell back into Han's arms, letting him embrace me as I felt all tension go from my body. \"That went well.\" I mused then turned around to face him. \"But what are you doing here?\" \"You told me you were going to tell Frank.\" He shrugged. \"I didn't want you to do it alone.\" I flipping loved this guy. Smiling broadly I reached up with my arms and wound them around him, burying my face into his neck as he leaned his head into mine. \"Hey! You two hungry or what?\" \"Starving.\" I replied with a laugh at dad's slightly agitated tone then pulled Han over to the table as dad set out all the food. I sat on Han's lap, knowing I was pushing the boundaries but I was so glad to see him that I didn't care about dad's unhappy expression. He'll get over it. I knew that deep down he actually liked Han and had deep respect for him. Guess he was just still a little overprotective. Han reached up and tucked my hair behind my ear, gazing up at me softly as I leaned my head against him. \"Did you decide whether or not dad owes you that fifty million?\" I whispered to him and he chuckled, which instantly made me smile. \"I think I found a better alternative payment.\" He kissed my neck then brushed his lips against my ear to whisper. \"You.\" Arching an eyebrow at him I smirked then replaced my head against his shoulder, smiling dozily as his arms shifted me closer to him. \"You see Frank? They're absolutely made for each other.\" I could hear Victoria whispering. \"The way she looks at him is how I look at Ivan. When he's sober.\" Victoria added with humour, making Ivan laugh. \"And the look he gives to her is exactly how I always look at my bunny, even when she is angry with me.\" Ivan said as he held Victoria's hand and they both smiled lovingly at one another. \"See it's not so bad. If there's one guy in the world who could keep Nat safe it's Han. Apart from you of course. She's in good hands.\" Sarah added helpfully, kissing dad to appease him a little more. \"Yeah.\" Dad sighed. \"I always thought I'd be enough to keep my little girl safe and happy.\" \"What, stuck at home with dad when she's a thirty nine year old virgin? You really think that would make her happy?\" Marvin scoffed. \"You have to let the bird fly the nest sooner or later. Sooner makes it less painful.\" \"Thanks, Marvin.\" Dad answered sarcastically. \"Well, no stopping her now. I could never refuse her anything. Not even when she was a tiny little baby. I mean, I still remember having to change her…\" \"Dad, not at the table. In fact, not ever.\" I groaned, blushing bright red. \"We can hear every word you're saying.\" \"I'm just saying. This is going to be a little hard for me to adjust to.\" Dad held up his hands in surrender but then he leaned forwards with a pointed look to Han. \"But if you dare break my baby's heart then you better find yourself an army, because I will murder you.\" \"Understood Moses.\" Han nodded his head. \"Just think, in a few years' time, I could be your son in law.\" Watching dad's face pale to a colour paler than snow, I couldn't help but burst out laughing and everyone else did the same. All save for dad. \"Over your dead body.\" He growled, pointing warningly at Han who smirked. \"Whatever you say, Moses. Whatever you say.\" Couldn't put it better myself. Thanks Han. Well, this is it, goodbye people!

It was as though she was drawn to him, she could not turn him away. Though she didn't know who or what he was, she knew that something about him was ... wrong. He knew her. He knew what flowed in her blood, even though she did not. He knew what she feared and what she longed for, for it was the same thing. Him. Not in the same lustful way that most mortals wanted him, no. This was different. It was a raw and overwhelming need. It was new. It was why he came back again and again. If he could make her break, even make her budge just a bit, and then he'd have her. ------------------ CHAPTER 1: Dreamscapes She sat in a claw-foot porcelain tub. It had been a long day, and as she sank into the thick bubbles that enveloped her, she sighed. This was heavenly. The chill of the water cooled her warm skin. She closed her eyes and leaned her head back, letting the darkness take her. He stood in the shadows of her mind, watching in silence. He watched her during her waking hours much as he watched her now. Silently, hidden from view. None of his other victims had affected him this way. He had taken them without thought or effort. But her...he took out a cigarette as he watched her. There was a goodness about her. It both drew him and repulsed him. He would break her, oh yes. Then he would make her his. The sound of a match being struck pulled her back. She sat up with a start, splashing water over the edge of the tub. He was there. Leaning against the wall watching her. The skin on the back of her neck prickled. He pushed off the wall with his foot, taking a long drag on his cigarette. Slowly, taking his own time, he walked toward her. Natalia sighed. However, this time it wasn't out of relaxation. It was out of weariness. And annoyance. \"What do you want?\" He grinned and threw his cigarette away. Shrugging his shoulders, he continued forward. \"Don't get excited. I just came in for a friendly...chat.\" She eyed him warily as he approached the side of the tub. She was uncomfortable, he knew, but she hid it well. \"You know Nattie, you have lovely shoulders.\" He trailed a finger over the curve. She shivered. She was SO easy. He knew she was innocent, he could always tell. She was also strong. In reality, she would never allow herself to be in this situation. However, in dreams...well, dreams have a way of changing people. So he would have her here. Then, soon, he'd have her in reality. \"Why don't you just leave me alone? I've had a really trying day and I'm not in the mood for this sh--\" He cut her off when he chuckled. \"Tsk tsk. Such language.\" He circled the tub and stopped at the foot. \"Besides. I know you. And you,\" he said as he stepped into the water, \"are always in the mood.\" \"What the hell do you think you're doing?\" She sat up and tried to push him back. He caught her wrist in his hand and pulled her to her knees, one on each side of his legs. The wet denim of his jeans scratched her skin. \"Let me go.\" The fire in her eyes blazed, turning them a glowing gold. But there was something else there, much to his delight. There was fear. And there was hunger. But the fear is what drove him on. He tilted his head to the side, eyeing her closely. She struggled against his grip again. Water sloshed over the side of the tub. He tugged her hand, pulling her closer to him. With his free hand, he brushed her wet hair from her face and felt her tremble. He smiled inwardly. \"It's alright. I'd never hurt you.\" Liar, liar he thought to himself. He slowly brushed his lips over hers, and when they parted, he kissed her sweetly. He felt the burning that came from evil touching innocence. He deepened the kiss, and dared to taste her tongue. It was a delicious pain. She pressed her assaulted lips together and took a steadying breath. \"You…\" She was at a total loss for words. She was fascinated by the feeling of freedom, the feeling of raw passion that she had when he kissed her. Nevertheless, she could not let him do it again. \"I think you should go.\" \"You're probably right.\" He did not like the feeling that he had gotten when he kissed her. It was almost as if he lost control there for a moment. This was NOT acceptable. He had business to do didn't he? He could not just go around… He made the mistake of looking at her swollen lips and felt a driving bout of lust grip his stomach. Odd. That rarely happened. But the sleepy look that was in her eyes as they fluttered open snapped something in him. To hell with business. This was going to be strictly for pleasure. He grabbed a handful of her hair and kissed her, drinking her in like a man dying of thirst. The pain was there, but he pushed it aside. I have to do something. This is wrong. I have to do something, she thought. She let her head fall to the side as he ran hot kisses down the column of her throat. Think Natalia. You need to…oh wow. He was stroking her naked back with the tips of his fingers of one hand while pressing her closer with the other. He ran the tip of his tongue over the frantic pulse at the base of her throat. He kissed the line of her collarbone, then bit, and then brushed his lips over the reddened skin. \"Dammit, Nattie…\" he hissed. She twined her fingers in his short hair, pressing him closer. The hand that was stroking her back moved to brush at the thick bubbles that still clung to her. He smiled with devilish delight when her head fell back. He leaned his head down, running his tongue on the place above her heart. A new sensation swarmed through Natalia's blood. His mouth left her. She raised her head and was met with an equally fierce and passionate gaze. She leaned her head down and feasted on his mouth. Score one, Good guys, he thought. His eyebrows rose at the intensity of the assault on his mouth. Time to up the stakes a bit. He laid her back into the water, cursing all those damn bubbles. He ran a hand down her torso, ran his fingertips over her navel, going lower until--- \"GOOD MORNING NEW ENGLAND! It is now 6:32 in the a.m. so WAKE UP! We've got traffic coming up after this…\" Natalia shot up in bed. She pushed her hair back from her head and looked over at her cat who was watching her with a detached uninterest. She slapped her hand down on her alarm radio and lay back on her pillow. Blowing a dark red curl out of her eye, she sighed. \"Dammit.\" -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Chapter 2] CHAPTER 2: Reality Bites \"Dammit dammit dammit!\" Nattie cried as she kicked the vending machine. She hauled off for one more kick before turning and stalking down the hall. \"What's with you this morning?\" Nattie looked at her best friend and partner at the Starfish Diner. At 24, Deb Parker was the absolute picture of a young single woman in the 21st Century. Her long blonde hair fell in textured layers to her shoulders, while her clothes were superbly clean and well fitting. Nattie looked down at the cargo khakis and the tee designed like the British flag and pushed at the stubborn curl that always fell in her face. Yikes. \"Hello? Earth to Nattie!\" \"What? Oh.\" She started back to her desk. \"Nothing. The machine took my money--AGAIN--and didn't give me my stupid chips. That's all.\" She sighed as she sat down. \"That's all….\" she said again, this time with more of a whine. \"Uh-huh. Riiiiiight.\" Deb paused, giving Nattie a once-over. Then she grinned. \"All that sexual frustration is taking its toll, Nat. I keep telling you, find a guy you think is hot, do him, and you'll feel a lot more relaxed.\" Nattie shook her head at her friend, an incredulous look on her face. \"You have no brain.\" The sound of a throat clearing had them looking to the door at Gloria James, the perky new waitress and long time friend. \"Um, ladies. There is a, uh, gentleman here to see you.\" She mouthed the words 'oh my god' and rolled her eyes. Curious, Deb peeked out the blinds that separated the offices. \"Damn. I wonder if he has a license for that mouth. Sweet Mary, Nattie, you gotta see this guy.\" Amused, Nattie walked to the window. Deb thought that every male was a gift from the Almighty sent specifically for her to admire. Making her way past the two oglers, she peered through the blinds and her blood froze. She could not see his face; his back was turned to her. But it was him. Somehow…Jesus, somehow it was him. But how? He was a dream. He wasn't real. ------ He was standing behind the counter with his elbows propped, staring out into the mix of diner customers. Stupid mortal sheep , he thought to himself. What the hell? Why did he have to be stuck here just because he was a mean son of a bitch when he was alive? They couldn't put him doing something else. Nooo. He had to be here. In Mortal Land. Woo. He smiled sweetly at the little blonde girl who was eating ice cream and waving with her tiny sticky fingers and tried not to roll his eyes. God, this sucked. What was taking that dumb waitress so long to---ah, there it is. He saw the blinds part, felt the wave of lust from the blonde woman looking out. He put on his best casual look. Jeez, her thoughts almost made HIM blush. He turned back to the crowd. Nice person. Definite sinner. …And there she was. He felt her gaze and hated the fact that his blood stirred. What was wrong with him? ---------- \"Nattie? Hello?\" Deb waved a hand in front of her friend's face. \"You in there?\" \"Yeah. It's just…\" She looked at Deb. \"Nothing. It's nothing.\" \"See? People that foxy shouldn't possibly be allowed to wreak such havoc on the populous.\" Grabbing Nattie's arm she led her out of the office. \"Let's go see what he wants.\" -------- Ok. Here they come. Time to strategize. This was not her dreamscape. This was the real world. Alright, think. Time to be all smiles. Be nice, polite, and patient… He inwardly sighed. He was going to apply for a transfer as soon as this job was over. \"Excuse me. You wanted to see us?\" Deb tapped the young man on the shoulder and nearly drooled when he turned that silver-blue gaze to her. \"Hi. Yes, I am looking for the owner of this place. Ms.--\" He stopped to look at a piece of paper. \"Natalia Bennett. Is that you?\" \"Nope. But it's her.\" Deb practically threw Nattie forward. She did not want to look at him. It was too weird. What was going on? He was a figment of her suppressed sexual feelings. So why in the HELL was he standing in her diner, staring at her with those...amazingly...bright...eyes? No! She couldn't focus on that...she had to think. \"Are you alright?\" Nattie jumped like a rabbit. \"Yeah. Yes. I'm sorry. Natalia Bennett.\" She extended a hand and shook his. \"Ferriman. Jack Ferriman. Jack to most people.\" \"So, how can I help you?\" Nattie took a deep cleansing breath and brought her eyes to his. \"Well--ah, thank you.\" He took the coke that Deb offered, and raised his eyebrows when she didn't go anywhere. \"Thank you very much?\" \"Uh, Deb? Don't you have some work to do? Like, in the office?\" Gloria said pointedly. \"Uh, yeah. Yeah.\" Giving Nattie a wink and grin, she sauntered off to the office. \"I'm sorry. You were saying?\" \"Um, oh. I was wondering...do you want dinner? I mean, me? I mean...\" He drew a breath. \"I mean, would you like to have dinner...with me?\" \"I don't know you. You came to my diner just so you could ask me out?\" \"No. No, I uh, I came to your diner to eat. And talk to you about ... business. The asking you out thing was just kind of inspired.\" He cleared his throat and looked sheepish. Oh, for fuck's sake lady. Take the bait. \"Well, actually, I don't date.\" She bit her lip. She did not date because she had never wanted to date. However, there was a time for everything. \"…Usually. But, it's not every day that a complete stranger asks me to dinner,\" she said with a small laugh. She grinned a disarmingly sweet grin. \"Pick me up at 8.\" -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: The Turning of the Tide Back at the crappy little hotel room that he was renting until this was over with, Jack sat in silence. A date. Wonderful. His bosses were just going to LOVE that. He glanced at the clock. Quarter 'til 8. Where was he going with this? It was not like him not to plan. He thought EVERYTHING through, and when things went bad he just improvised. Granted, it hadn't turned out so well last time, but still... Images popped into his mind of the first few...days? years?...in the Corridors. The screams from other people's torment the smell of blood and burning skin and death that would never come. Jack shuddered. He was a badass, but no one could think about that and keep from getting the chills. He looked at the clock again. Time to go. ---- \"COMING!\" Nattie rushed down the stairs and threw the door open. \"Hey, hooker. Whatcha doing?\" Deb stepped in and shut the door behind her. \"Wow. Look at you all sassy in your red skirt. Do you know how long it has been since I have seen you this dressed up? Mary Fielder's bachelorette party at the Rage. That was 8 months ago. Honey, I'm so excited!\" \"I'm glad, because I think I'm going to throw up.\" Nattie put a hand on her nervous stomach. She had closed her eyes for a few minutes earlier but had been plagued by dreams of screams and blood. She took a cleansing breath and looked in the mirror. She tugged at her red skirt and black tank, pulled up her red and black striped knee socks. . \"Look at me. I look like a Lydia doll.\" \"A what?\" \"A Lydia doll. You know, Lydia. Beetlejuice? Nevermind.\" \"Nattie. Look at me. You are a beautiful and radiant 22-year-old woman. Tonight is your big night. Now I want you to listen to me. Are you listening?\" When she nodded, Deb continued. \"You are going to go out with this Jake guy--\" \"Jack.\" \"Right. Anyway...You are going to go out with Jack, and you are going to have a great time, and then, honey, you are going to bring him back here, and you are going to have some sex. For the good of the both of us.\" Nattie burst into a fit of giggles just as the doorbell rang. Deb tossed Nattie's red braids over her shoulders and tucked the stray curls back as she walked past. She took one more steadying breath and opened the door. He was wearing loose fitting jeans and a tight black tee shirt with the Zero skate company logo on it. His hair was styled with just enough carelessness to have it sticking up in places. Nattie smiled at his shoes. He wore black converse all-stars. He was quite a remarkable sight. His eyes raked over her. He took in the black tank top, the red skirt that showed off her long legs without coming off as sluttish (though it wouldn't have bothered him if it had. It would make his job easier.) He could not quite suppress the quick grin at the sight of her socks. Red and black knee socks. How….cute. He cleared his throat. \"Um. Hi.\" \"Hi.\" \"HI!\" Deb called from the foyer. \"You want to come in for a sec? I've just got to grab my purse.\" \"Sure. Take your time. I'm in no hurry.\" As they stepped into the foyer, Nattie's cat, Lorien hissed and ran from Jack as he bent down to pet her. \"Don't worry. She does that to everyone. She's sort of…\" Nattie searched for the word. \"Nuts? Possessed by Satan?\" Deb supplied. \"She's eccentric.\" Nattie insisted. She turned to Jack. \"Are you ready?\" \"Yes. You have a lovely house.\" Nattie flushed and beamed with pride. \"Thank you. I certainly like it.\" As they were leaving, Deb called to Nattie, \"I'll be gone when you get home. CALL ME!\" Nattie turned around and ran a finger quickly over her throat in the 'shut up' motion and smiled at Deb. Deb held up both hands, showing crossed fingers. Jack, reading the exchange, smiled to himself. --------- \"I had a really good time tonight,\" Jack said as he twisted a stray red curl around his finger. He had found that the 'I'm a shy and loveable guy' routine worked best with this woman. \"I don't suppose that I could maybe, um, kiss you goodnight?\" Nattie raised an eyebrow. \"I don't see why not.\" Don't freak out. Don't freak out, she chanted to herself. He leaned his head toward hers, his lips just an inch away from hers. She could feel his breath on her lips and was suddenly consumed by a bubble of giggles. \"Oh God. I'm sorry.\" She said as she struggled for breath. Jack was confused. He was not used to the feeling and did not like it. \"I'm so sorry. It's just …\" God, this was embarrassing. \"I've never been kissed before. I know I know….\" she said before he could say anything. \"It's highly abnormal, but it's true. I just got a little high strung is all. And look. Now I am babbling. That's just--\" Before she could think, Jack's mouth was fused to hers in a passionate battle. The kiss was both hard and sweet. Both tender and intense. It felt glorious. As he broke away, he was cursing himself. What the HELL was that? He looked at her. At the glazed look in her half closed eyes. He looked at her lips, usually a pale pink, now red and swollen by his mouth. Something was wrong with him. Nattie cleared her throat. \"Um. Well, that was…\" Hotter than I could have imagined? Mind blowing? She surprised both of them by saying, \"Do you want to come in?\" He looked at her. The hopeful nervousness in her eyes. He knew if he went in that the rest of his plan would soon be done. He should just do it. Do it, finish this job, and get the hell out of this town. He could get his old position back. Get back on the sea… \"I don't think that's a good idea.\" What? Are you fucking CRAZY! Where did that come from? \"Nattie, I've-I've got to go.\" He turned and walked down her sidewalk. When he got to her gate, he stopped and turned back to her. \"What are you doing for breakfast?\" he asked. \"Deb, Gloria and I eat at the diner,\" she said. \"Would you like to have breakfast with me in the morning?\" She thought about it for a minute. \"Ok. I go in at 6:30. The diner opens at 7:30 so the girls and I usually eat about 7.\" He nodded, then without another word, turned and walked into the night. ------------------------ Later, in his rented craphole, Jack lay on his bed in the darkness, thinking. What the hell was this about? Why didn't I go in, screw her, and then kill her? That's what I freaking' DO. It's what I am here for. I have been doing it for 70 years. He took out a cigarette and lit it, pondering. He closed his eyes and searched her out. She was at home getting ready for bed. She was lying awake much like him, wondering why he did not come in. Finally, she drifted off to sleep. That is where he met her. She was in her backyard, pulling weeds from her flowerbed and listening to The All-American Rejects. He tilted his head to the side, wondering at the driving lust that twisted his gut and stirred his blood at the mere sight of her. He walked behind her, placing his hands on her hips. She screamed and spun around, thumping a mud covered hand over her heart. \"Jesus Jack! Put a bell around your neck.\" She took her headphones off and put them on the ground. She was entirely too close to him. The way he was still holding her hips pressed them together like lovers. Which, she thought to herself, was just what you asked him to become earlier. \"Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.\" He continued to stare at her as if trying to find something. It unnerved her. \"What?\" She felt herself flush under his gaze. He kissed her before he could stop himself. She gripped his arms, ran her hands along the firm planes until she clung to his neck, her fingers winding in his hair. He pulled away and she nearly whimpered. \"You're beautiful.\" He said, and he knew that he meant it. Jack gasped and shot out of bed. He pulled a hand through his hair and it trembled slightly as he took out a cigarette and lit it. He took the glass of whiskey off the bedside table and downed it. Holy Hell, he thought. No. No, it wasn't possible. After 70 years, he was not going soft. Yeah, right. He threw the glass against the wall where it exploded into a thousand pieces. \"SON OF A BITCH!\" He actually LIKED her. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: 24 Going on 94 \"You WHAT? You went on a date with the creepy--albeit good looking--guy that was in here yesterday?\" Gloria was astonished. Never in all the years that she had known Nattie had she ever seen her do something so careless. She didn't like it. Not one bit. She spun to face Deb. \"Did YOU know about this?\" \"Yes mother, I did.\" She rolled her eyes. \"What's the prob? Nattie's about due for a bit of fun.\" \"Fun yes. But not with a complete stranger! Nattie-\" she turned to look at her friend. \"This isn't like you.\" \"I know it s not. I'm reinventing myself. Look Gloria, I'm fine. We went out, had a nice dinner and came home. He kissed me goodnight and left. That's it.\" \"Then he stood her up for breakfast.\" Deb put in. \"So I don't plan on Mr. Blue Eyes to be popping in any time soon.\" \"I dunno. I just got a weird feeling about him yesterday.\" Gloria said. \"Remember the last time I got that feeling?\" \"Oh for crying out loud, Gloria! He's not an alien.\" Deb said. She loved Gloria, but she was slightly odd. \"McDuff wasn't either. He was just a scumbag.\" \"Yeah. But still, my feeling ended up saving you from that scumbag, remember. At least let me talk to my friends. Maybe they'll know something about him.\" she said to Nattie. Nattie saw Deb hold up the Star-Trek 'live long and prosper' fingers, but managed to suppress her giggle. Barely. \"Uh-huh. And how would they go about doing that?\" Deb asked. \"I happen to have quite a few friends who are hackers. They can do a quick background check.\" \"I don't know about that. It seems kinda intrusive. I mean, guys, it was just one date. Like Deb said, he'll probably not show up again.\" \"Uh, I wouldn't be so sure about that. Mr. Blue Eyes, 8 o'clock.\" Gloria nodded toward the door. Jack Ferriman stood pacing outside her diner. He seemed to be in an intense battle with himself on whether or not he wanted to go in. Finally, he stood up, straightened his white t-shirt, and walked inside. He shoved his hands into the pockets of his loose cargo khakis and meandered over to the counter. \"Well, speak of the devil and he appears.\" Deb said as he approached. She looked at Nattie, who had gone pale but for the flush in her cheeks. He stopped and looked from cocky Deb, to suspicious Gloria, to hopeful Natalia. It was the spark in her eyes that had him turning on his heel and walking back out the door. They watched as he walked past the window, very upset, and screamed a very inappropriate four letter word. As he stalked off, lightning split the cloudless sky. \"Gloria, ask your friends if they can find out anything.\" \"I'm on it.\" \"Hey, Nat…\" Deb trailed off as she watched her friend watch this … guy … leave. A kind of light had come into Natalia's eyes. One that Deb had never seen in them before. She was falling in love with this complete and total stranger, and she probably didn't even know it. Well how about that , Deb thought. She shook her head and hopped off the counter to go see about table #4. ---------------- Nattie was unlocking her front door that night just as her phone started ringing. As she rushed inside, she stepped on Lorien's tail, causing the cat to bite her on the ankle. \"OW! STUPIDASS CAT! MOVE!\" she shouted as she kicked at the furball. \"Hello?\" \"Nattie? Gloria just called me. She called for an emergency meeting at her house. She sounded really freaked out.\" \"She always sounds freaked out.\" \"Yeah. Well even more so than usual.\" Nattie sighed. She was REALLY hoping she could just come home, get in the shower, and go to bed. She pressed her fingertips to her forehead, attempting to hold off the headache that threatened. \"Fine. I'll be there in a few minutes. Gimme time to change clothes, alright?\" \"Check. See ya in a few.\" Deb said, and hung up. Nattie made a quick change from her jeans and blue button down top to her black cotton pj bottoms and a shirt that was about 4 sizes too big. Once she was comfortable, she fed the hell-beast that was her cat, made a dash out the door, and drove to Gloria's apartment. ------- \"Ok, what's the big deal? I had high hopes of a long cool shower.\" Nattie said as she walked in to Gloria's apartment. She looked at Gloria, who was pale and wide-eyed. She looked at Deb, who looked much the same but for the cigarette that was shaking in her right hand. \"What? What's the matter?\" Nattie asked, worried. \"I think you need to sit for this. Jesus. I wish I had.\" Deb said as she took a shaky drag from her cigarette. \"I talked to my hacker friends, and they couldn't find anything on Jack Ferriman.\" \"Well, good. That means he's not a criminal, right?\" Nattie asked. Gloria shook her head. \"No Nattie. I mean they didn't find ANYTHING on Jack Ferriman. Like, at all.\" She blew at the short fringe of dark bangs that covered her forehead. \"I went to my forum-\" \"The paranormal activists forum?\" Nattie snorted. \"Gloria, you don't actually believe in-\" \"Listen! I went to my forum and crosschecked with some of the people there. I checked name, descriptions, stuff like that. Then this one guy sent me these.\" She held up two papers. \"So? What are they?\" \"This is a picture taken in 1967 of the Natslion Bridge. It was a bridge in New York that collapsed later, killing over 140 people. Someone had weakened the support structure. Investigators never found out whom. This,\" she indicated the other picture, \"is a picture taken on the day that the Morro Castle sailed from New York Harbor in 1934. The ship caught fire and everyone burned to death.\" \"I get it. Well, not exactly... Can I see those now?\" Gloria passed the pictures over to her and bit her lip. Nattie took the pictures and studied them. What does this have to do with finding out whether or not Ferriman was a whack job? That's all she wanted to know before-- What the hell? She peered closer to the black and white photographs. Her mouth fell open and all blood drained from her face. She looked at Gloria, then at Deb. \"What the…? How?\" \"I'm not sure, but if those photos are legit, and I've never had reason to doubt my contacts,\" she said looking at Deb, \"then Ferriman is somewhere close to 94 years old. And he's been around the same place and time of at least two accidents resulting in the death of over 275 people.\" ---------[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: Hello Soul, Goodbye Sanity \"Why haven't you taken this girl yet?\" Dennis asked, tapping his foot as he stood in front of Jack with his hands on his hips. \"Is she too tough for you, Jackie-boy?\" he said mockingly. \"I'll do it. I just need time.\" You little prick, Jack added to himself. \"Time?\" Dennis laughed. \"Well, bucko, time is just what you'll have. See, word from downstairs is this: You screwed up big time. You need punishment.\" \"Punishment?\" Now it was Jack's turn to laugh. \"What could you do to me that I haven't already done to myself? You can't send me to the Corridors. That was part of my deal. The Boss doesn't break his own contracts. So tell me, Dennis the Great,\" He leaned in close to the other man's face. \"What could you do to me?\" \"Jack, Jack, Jack…\" Dennis chuckled. \"You said you needed time? Well,\" he lifted his hands and placed them on either side of Jack's head. \"Time is what I'll give you.\" The scream that was torn from Jack's lips was like nothing that had ever been heard before. It was the sound of true punishment. It was the sound of life being given back to a body after decades of not feeling. It was the sound of 70 years of bringing death and torment to hundreds upon hundreds of people, both innocent and guilty. Dennis removed his hands and smiled as Jack fell to the floor in a heap. He looked down at the boy, with his blue eyes now swimming with tears of pain and guilt and misery. Go me, he thought. Job well done. \"Well Jack, you take care. Oh, and just so you know, you can try to kill yourself…\" He patted him on the back. \"But it won't help. You can't die pal! Now you got plenty of time to kill this girl. And when you do that, well, the Boss said he'd think about a new contract.\" With that, Dennis raised his hands and was consumed by a tunnel of flame. ---------- When Dennis was gone, Jack did something he hadn't done since he was a child. He cried. His body was racked with sobs. The voices, the screams, the faces of the men, women, and children he killed or had made someone kill were with him. For nearly 70 years, he had killed. It was a job. Nothing personal, just a job. \"Just a job?\" a little green-eyed girl with red curls circled him. \"Just a job? You killed me! I was a child and you took my life from me!\" A blonde man stood in front of him and laughed. \"Welcome to hell buddy! Nice to see ya again.\" \"Come now Monsieur Dodge. Don't be bitter,\" the beautiful brunette said as she ran a hand down Dodge's arm. She knelt and stretched out a hand to brush a tear from Jack's face. \"Dominique?\" He closed his eyes as the memory screamed into his head. The ship, the flames. Bodies burning. He gagged. \"Bonjour l'amor.\" She smiled at him. \"Do you know what you are now Jack? No?\" She giggled. \"You are dans enfer. In Hell, just like all of us.\" She stood up and placed a delicate hand on the little girl's head. \"No! I was just doing a job! I couldn't go back…\" Jack drew his knees to his body and put his hands over his ears, but still he heard the cries of despair. \"Remember me sir?\" A young boy, maybe 12, stood before him. Beside him stood a child of 6. \"You told me that you would give me food and a home. All I had to do was get rid of her.\" He nodded to the little girl beside him. \"So I did, and what did you do? You killed me. All I wanted was a home!\" \"And don't forget us Jack.\" A beautiful woman with honey blonde hair and a woman with raven black hair took their place before him. \"We were just making money the only way we could. You liked our skills. Six times wasn't it? Before you decided to make us eternally damned?\" the blonde said. \"Seven. You weren't in on one of them.\" The dark haired girl said. \"LEAVE ME ALONE!\" Jack screamed. Memories of all the things he had done, or made other people do so that he could keep their souls, came flooding back. He got up and raced out the door, trying to leave the spirits behind him. He ran down the hall of the motel. As he started around the corner, an arm shot out an clothes-lined him. \"Ouch. Shit. That had to've hurt.\" As Jack tried to clear his head, he looked up, and saw the face of Jason Munder staring back at him. Munder smiled and laughed. He tucked a lock of dark brown hair behind his ear. \"What? No hello? No 'sorry about that whole having you squashed like a rotten tomato thing'? Yeah, that hurt by the way.\" \"You are not here. None of you are really here!\" Jack got up and ran out the motel door and out into the rain. \"Well, I think that went well.\" Munder said as Dodge appeared beside him. \"You gonna follow him?\" Dodge asked. \"Don't see why I should. Why don't some of the older ones go after him?\" \"Because…\" In honesty, Dodge didn't know either. \"Are you going?\" Munder sighed. \"I'll shoot you for it,\" he said holding out a fist indicating a game of paper, rock, scissors. They played, and Dodge dropped his balled up fist on top of Munder's 'scissors' and laughed. \"Have fun,\" he said as he slapped Munder on the shoulder and disappeared. --------------------------- Ok. The guy that you have been having intense dreams about is over 90 years old. Ewww. And you kissed him. A lot. I think therapy will be in your future. How was he in her dreams before she met him. Holy shit. Maybe Gloria's whole paranormal thing actually has some substance. It was past midnight. She sat alone in her kitchen drinking coffee from a purple mug that said \"Rabbi: It's a heavenly job\" on the side of it. She had picked it up at some store or another because it appealed to her since of humor. She listened to the rain and thought. Is that why he had turned around this morning? Why he had left in such a hurry last night? Last night. Oh God. She scrubbed her hands through the thick mass of wild red curls. What if I had slept with him? I mean, the fact that he looks maybe 24 doesn't discount the fact that he's 90! Which means that he's got some sort of evil power, right? I mean, being around just before one tragedy is coincidence. But two…and that's only the two that Gloria's friend had photographic evidence of. A knock on her door jogged her out of her thoughts. She went to the front door and unlocked it, thinking it was Deb. She opened it and spun to go back to the kitchen, calling over her shoulder, \"You're out late Deb. Date go bad?\" \"Natalia.\" She froze where she was. The hair on her arms and neck stood on end. Her heart sped up and she wanted to believe it was just from fear, not from the sound of that pleading voice. Slowly, she turned to face him. He stood outside in the rain. She started backing away slowly. \"You stay the hell away from me.\" She said. \"I know who you are. Sort of. Well, I know that you are a hell of a lot older than you look. Just stay away from me.\" \"Nattie, please.\" His voice broke. \"I promise, I won't come in if you don't want me to. But please…don't leave me alone.\" She looked closer at him then. His eyes were red and swollen and wet with tears, not rain. They radiated like a silvery blue light. Against her better judgment, she walked back to the open door. \"You tell me one good reason why I should even consider not calling the police.\" She raised her chin. \"I can't.\" Jack lowered his gaze and closed his eyes. There were bodies floating before him. Dismembered, bloated bodies with dead, staring eyes. He shook his head as Munder appeared beside him. \"HEY! There you are! I was wondering-\" Jack fell to his knees. \"Leave me alone!\" \"Are you ok?\" Munder whistled in appreciation. \"Damn. That was your assignment? And you couldn't bone that? Funny world iddin it?\" Jack put his hands over his ears and began to rock. \"It was just a job. JUST A JOB!\" He screamed. \"You don't think I'm going to fall for that, do you?\" Nattie asked, hesitantly. The man was bowed over on her front stoop. She couldn't just leave him there, right? \"Ferriman?\" He spoke to himself, rocking and holding his ears. What are you doing, you idiot! Nattie scolded herself as she ran outside and grabbed his shoulders. \"Jack? Jack? Come on.\" She helped him up out of the rain and into her house. -------------- \"Drink this.\" She shoved a coffee cup into his hands. \"I'll be back in just a second. I'm going to get you a towel.\" He nodded, his teeth chattering together. He took a drink of the strong coffee and burned his tongue. The cat…Lorien, he remembered, was watching him closely from a nearby chair, as if wondering why in the name of God there was a man dripping water all over her floors and drinking from her human's coffee cup. \"Here.\" Nattie came down the stairs carrying a thick blue towel, a pair of boxers, and a multi-colored fuzzy blanket. \"The boxers are from one of Deb's…friends. But they should work as far as size goes.\" She went to him and dried off his face, then ran the towel over his hair. He stood there, watching her. He looked nothing like the guy she had gone out with such a short time ago. He looked defeated. His eyes were still wet from tears threatening to fall. Without thinking, she slid his flannel shirt off his shoulders and down his arms. She dropped it to the floor where it landed with a wet plop. She took the hem of his white t-shirt, now completely soaked, and pulled it over his head. She added that to the pile on the floor. She ran the towel over his shoulders and chest before it dawned on her that this was like holding a steak in front of a starving man. She cleared her throat. \"Get out of those wet clothes and then you have to talk to me. Deal?\" When he just nodded, she handed him the towel and the blanket and went to the living room. When he joined her a few minutes later, he held the pile of wet clothes with one hand and held the blanket around him with the other. \"I dripped on your carpet.\" He said, nodding toward the foyer. \"It's ok.\" She got up and took his wet clothes from him and threw them into the laundry room. When she sat back down on the couch, he was still standing in the middle of the room. \"Come sit down. You owe me a talk, remember?\" He walked over to her and sat on the edge of the couch. \"Tell me what happened. Why were you saying it was just a job? What job?\" \"You won't understand.\" He sighed and looked at her. She was so beautiful. So good. \"Look, I know that something isn't right with you. I've seen pictures of you taken in 1938 and 1962. Unless you, your father, and your grandfather all have STRIKING resemblances, then you were there then, looking not a day older than you do now.\" She searched his eyes. \"Make me understand.\" \"I died on August 2, 1933. I was 24 years old. I was vicious, and I was cruel. I did what I wanted, no matter who tried to get in my way. I killed my first person the day I died. They must've been waiting for that.\" When he hesitated, she encouraged him on. \"I was taken to the Corridors--the pits of Hell. Nothing that you can learn in church can prepare you for that. I don't know how long I was there, but I was brought out by Dennis. He's an Assistant Manager. He told me that the Corporate Boss was impressed with my resume when I was alive and wanted to know if I was interested in working for them now. I didn't want to go back to the Corridors, so I said yes. The contract was drawn up. I would go around forever collecting souls and they would never send me back to the Corridors. My first job was on September 8, 1934. The luxury liner Morro Castle.\" He swallowed slowly. \"133 people died in a fire. I had killed the captain before I started it. Actually, to be more accurate, I had the crew start the fire. Then they commandeered the lifeboats and left the passengers to burn. I got them later though.\" As he was talking, tears streaked down his face. He heard the screams of the passengers as they were engulfed in flame. He took a deep breath and swiped at the tears. \"I loved it.\" He sounded disgusted with himself. \"I only got worse from then on. They put me on boats, well traveled bridges, whatever. Kill the people, keep their souls. I had the highest turnover rate of all of my peers.\" He sniffed and laughed, but there was no humor in it. \"It appears that I have a way of making people trust me.\" He looked at her to gauge how she was receiving this. She looked disturbed, but not necessarily afraid of him… Yet. \"You heard of the Terma Bridge? The one that fell onto the interstate in '78? That was me. Unfortunately, it wasn't my assignment. Another collector was given that job, but I did it instead. Just to piss Dennis off. I wanted it so bad. All those people…209 dead. 400 injured. But, due to the fact that it was me that did it and not the assigned collector, we couldn't keep them.\" The muscle in his jaw worked as he thought about his past. \"I was taken off land assignments after that and put out to sea. I had a pretty good racket out there, ya know. Not much going on out on the Bering Sea. Everything was in order but my boat got a hole in it and I picked the wrong crew to fix it. I fucked up royally and my ship got blown up. So there was that many MORE souls we lost and management was not happy. They put me back on land, but on a single-subject basis. Kind of like probation. My next assignment was to take a single soul and make it sin so it could be kept under control. I was good at manipulating people, but this soul was going to be tricky because it was pure. It had a few little spots here and there, but nothing that we counted.\" Nattie knew by the way he was looking at her that he was waiting for her to become afraid. She knew where he was going with this. Somehow, she knew. \"I started watching you. In the shadows when you were awake, then later dream-walking on you. The other day was the day I was going to take you. But something--God, I don't know what--something happened to me. I couldn't hurt you. Dennis came today and did something to me. I can hear them… the other people I've killed. I can see them… They're haunting me.\" He looked at her with his blue eyes intense. \"I swear Nattie. I swear I won't hurt you. But I don't want to be alone.\" She believed him. She believed all of it. It was ludicrous, but she believed him. She took his face between her hands and brushed his wet hair from his forehead. \"You should get some rest.\" Nattie said. \"I can't sleep. They'll come. It's all I can see every time I close my eyes.\" \"Shhhhh… It's ok. I'll be right here. I'm not going to leave you like this.\" She sat back on the couch and took the blankets from his shoulders. She gently eased him down so that his head was lying in her lap and spread the blanket over him. She sat there, playing with his hair. Several times, he would start to fall asleep, but would wake himself up with a jump. Finally, he seemed to sleep deep enough that she was able to sleep too. ---------------------------------------------[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: Be All, End All When Nattie awoke the next morning, she was lying on the couch. Jack still slept soundly with his head pillowed on her legs. She sat up, rubbed at the crick in her neck, and eased out from under him. She went off to the kitchen to make some coffee. \"Jack. Wake up sleepy head.\" Jack stirred at the sweet sing-song voice that was calling him. He opened his eyes to find a pair that matched his own staring back at him. A grip of terror and pain clutched his stomach. He saw himself and this beautiful young woman standing in an alley in NYC. She was already bloody and bruised from him beating her. She was begging and crying, but that only drove him on. \"Jack, please, I love him. We are getting married. And I am keeping this child.\" \"Like hell you are. You think that I'd let you bring that kind of disgrace to me?\" He punched her in the face and she fell back against the wall. She raised herself back up and brought her eyes to his. \"You disgrace yourself more than I ever could.\" He grabbed her by the throat and pushed her against the wall. He took the knife out of his coat pocket and put it in front of her face. \"…please.\" \"Well, since you asked so nicely.\" He said and stuck the blade between her ribs. The warm gush of her blood mixed with the choking sound that she made sent a giddy shiver up his spine. \"Ah, yes. Thinking back are we? Remembering the good ol' days?\" \"Miranda?\" Jack said. \"I'm sorry…\" His throat closed as Miranda brought a transparent hand to it. \"Sorry Jack? Awww...are you?\" She laughed, a throaty sound. \"How sweet. Too little too late I'm afraid.\" Miranda brought her cold lips to his cheek. \"Miranda...\" he gasped out. \"Please...\" \"Well, since you asked so nicely.\" She laughed again. \"Sound familiar Jackie-boy? You know, I was thinking just the other day about our childhood. What was that rhyme that Mother taught us as children? About Monday's child?\" She placed a slim finger to her lips and thought. \"Oh well. Must not've been that important.\" She shrugged and squeezed his throat more. He brought his hands to his neck and tried to pull her hands from his throat. Time after time his hands slipped through her substance-less arms. He felt the world go dark and heard the blood rushing in his ears. \"Jack! Dammit, let go!\" Nattie was there, pulling his hands away from his throat. When they were free, he gasped for breath, the air racing to fill his burning lungs. \"Jesus. Are you ok? I mean, I know you're not but...\" Nattie trailed off as she started to examine where he had choked himself. His face was an unusual shade of purplish red and bruises were already starting to form around his throat. \"What was happening just now?\" Nattie whispered. He closed his eyes against the pain and memories of what he had been. Of what he still was deep down. He shook his head in refusal. He wasn't that anymore. He wasn't. His sister had just tried to kill him. No, not kill him. He couldn't die. She had done it to torture him. \"Jack, look at me.\" She placed her hands on each side of his face. \"Monday's child is fair of face. Tuesday's child is full of grace...\" \"What are you saying? Come on sweetie. Look at me,\" she said, speaking as one might to a small child. \"Wednesday's child is full of woe. Thursday's child has far to go. Friday's child is loving and giving...\" Nattie ran to the kitchen and got a glass of water. \"Drink this. Please...\" He turned his head away and kept mumbling. \"Saturday's child works hard for his living. And the child that is born on the Sabbath day is bonny and blithe, and good and gay.\" She ran the pad of her thumb over his bottom lip. \"Please. Open your eyes.\" He opened his eyes and fell into the golden depths of hers. He drew in a breath and brought a hand to his stinging throat. He sat up and swung his legs over the side of the couch. \"What was it? Were you--\" Should she ask? \"Were you remembering something? About how you...\" Now she stopped. He nodded and looked at her. \"My sister.\" When her eyes widened in surprise he looked out the window. \"I had made a name for myself. Cheated my way into it mostly. She was a few years younger than me. I didn't really care about her anymore. Hadn't for a while. Not since our mother died. Anyway,\" he cleared his throat. \"She hooked up with this newsboy in New York. Fell in love, got pregnant, was going to get married. But...\" He stopped. \"But because it would be a blemish on your reputation, you had her killed.\" He laughed, but there was only sorrow in it. \"To have her killed would have cost money. No,\" he turned and looked her dead in the eye. \"I killed her myself. After I beat the hell out of her. I killed her in an alley next to a pile of garbage. Then I left her there.\" He ran a hand through his hair. \"Go on. Call me a monster, a sick bastard, whatever. I've heard it. I've been it. I killed my sister and her child because I didn't want anything to come between me and whatever pissy little goal I had set for myself.\" He laughed again, somewhat maniacally. \"Ironic I think. The next day my partner decided to cut me out of the business. Literally.\" He moved the blanket and showed her a scar that ran from just under his ribs on his left side to his right hip. \"So, what you're getting now is like, flashbacks?\" \"Pretty much.\" He rubbed his temple. Each time he got a flash of memories it felt like friggin' bomb exploded in his cranium. \"Well, that's what we have to do then.\" \"And what's that?\" \"We have to find a way to stop those flashbacks.\" She nodded to emphasize her point. Jack just looked at her as if she was the biggest idiot he had ever come across. He was tired of crying at every turn. It bothered him that he cried so much yesterday. This last little episode had been the last straw. Now he was getting into the pissed-off sarcastic phase. \"Yeah. And why don't we just stop by the FDA and give them the cure to cancer while we're at it?\" \"Look, if there is a way to stop them, and I can't believe I'm going to say this, but Gloria's sugar high X-files friends would know. Come on.\" \"Uh...\" He held out the blanket, revealing his naked body clad only in black boxers with blue flames. \"Maybe if I had my clothes back.\" \"We'll stop by your room.\" ----- After Jack had gotten a shower and Nattie had called Gloria and told her to go back to her house, they got in Nattie's Jetta and set out for Gloria's. Along with a few of his entourage. \"I can't believe you. I know you've killed more than 700 people, and yet you can't find the urge to kill this one woman?\" Munder asked. \"That's kinda sad. You can feel it can't you. Like an invisible force. Pulling your hands to her throat and squeezing. Go on man. Just kill her.\" \"It'll make you feel better.\" Dodge put in. \"SHUT THE HELL UP!\" Jack roared. \"Jesus!\" Nattie slammed on the brakes and pulled over to the curb. \"I'm sorry. It just these two...\" \"What two? Here?\" She spun to look in the back seat. \"There are two of them here? Now?\" He nodded. \"They're trying to make me crazy. I think they're succeeding.\" He put his fingertips over his eyes and saw Munder's mangled body and Dodge's frightened and dying eyes, looking from his face to the bloodstain spreading across the front of his white t-shirt. Jack gritted his teeth and shook his head in attempt to clear it. Nattie pulled the car into the spot in front of Gloria's building. \"We're here.\" ------ \"Gloria? It's me. Open up.\" \"Hey. What's this about? You soun--\" Gloria let the sentence die as she opened the door and saw Jack. \"Nattie...\" \"It's ok Gloria. Let us in.\" Against her better judgment, Gloria stepped aside and let Natalia and Jack inside. She watched him warily. \"Gloria, we need your help. I need you to get in touch with that guy, the one who sent you the pictures. I need you to ask him what all he knows about Jack and who he works for.\" She held up a hand to stop Gloria's interruption. \"I know this is a load Gloria, but I need you to trust me.\" Gloria sighed. \"I do trust you Nat. It's him I don't trust.\" She glanced at Jack, who was sitting quietly on her sofa with his fingers pressed to his eyes. He looked almost pitiful. Gloria might have taken pity on him...if she hadn't known that he was old enough to be her great grandfather while looking like he could have gone to high school with her. \"Come on Gloria. Do this for me, please?\" Nattie begged. Gloria closed her eyes and sighed again. \"Ok. I'll see what I can get. But I'm not going to promise anything.\" Without warning, Jack rose from the couch and walked to the front door. \"Where are you going?\" Nattie asked. \"Um, I have to go out. I need a walk. No,\" he said as she started toward him. \"You stay here with your friend and do what you're going to do. I'll be alright. I'm going to be in my room. Come and find me there.\" He nodded to Gloria and left without another word. --------- Three hours later, Gloria and Nattie sat in front of Gloria's computer. They both had headaches. \"So basically, what we know is that in order to stop Jack's flashbacks, the manager of Hell has to agree to turn them off? Either that, or a trade.\" Gloria stated. \"A trade...\" Nattie said, thinking. \"Thanks so much Gloria. You are great.\" She kissed her friend on her cheek and started gathering her stuff. \"So, what's the plan? What're we going to do?\" Nattie hesitated. \"Well, right now I'm just going to go see Jack. Kinda fill him in, ya know. Talk later.\" With that, she rushed out the door. ------ Back inside his hotel room, Jack lay facing his tormentors. One by one they came to him, taunting, hurting, abusing him. His sanity. His newly reacquired soul. It had been hours since he left Natalia at Gloria's. He wanted to call her. To make sure she was ok. To know if she had found anything to make this living hell cease to be. ------ Nattie sat in the circle surrounded by candles. She didn't like this, but she had to do it. It was worth it. No one deserved the pain and misery that she had seen in Jack a few hours earlier. All she had to do was sit down and talk with this Dennis guy, trade off, and that'd be that. She poured the foul smelling mixture into the vial and set it over the candle. She recited the incantation and waited. Appearing in a tunnel of blue flame was a man that appeared to be in his mid 30s. His green eyes shone with a supernatural light. His dark hair was turning prematurely gray around the temples, giving him a distinguished look. \"You rang? Oh my...\" He leaned down to where Nattie was sitting in the circle. \"A pure soul. I can smell you from all the way over here. Vile.\" He waved his hand. \"What do you want child? This isn't a cell phone you know.\" He motioned to the candles and summoning spell. Looking closer at her, he smiled a wickedly charming smile. \"I know you,\" he said. \"You're Natalia. Ferriman's assignment.\" He chuckled. \"And how is our lovely little Jack these days? Has he had any unexpected guests?\" \"I'm here to offer you a trade.\" Nattie said. \"To stop Jack's flashbacks and make the souls of his victims leave him alone.\" \"A trade? And what would be in it for me, precious?\" Dennis asked. Nattie swallowed and took a deep breath. \"My soul.\" Dennis straightened. \"Come again?\" \"If you stop those lost souls from tormenting Jack, and stop his flashbacks from the things he's done, then I'll take his place and be a Soul Collector.\" \"How very bold of you cupcake. However, it doesn't work that way.\" \"It can.\" \"Yes, well. Only if I want it to. And you see, you have a pure soul. Which means that you'd be a bigger pain in the ass than Ferriman. Besides,\" he continued. \"He is still the same deep down. It'll take a few days to get past the initial shock of being capable of feeling again, what with the crying and anger and all that, soon enough he'll be back to his old murderous self and we'll give him his old job back. He just needed this little lesson.\" He leaned down and raised Nattie's chin. \"So, don't worry your pretty little head.\" \"I think you're wrong.\" Dennis studied this young woman. She would certainly have a nice advantage in manipulating people. Maybe he could work her stupid hero complex to his advantage. \"I'll tell you what. If you spot your soul up nice and dirty, then I'll take you and make Mr. Ferriman's flashbacks go bye-bye.\" It's no skin off my nose. He'll be back inside of a week anyway. \"Fine. What do I have to do?\" \"Well you know...murder an innocent, rob a charity, something along those lines.\" \"Um, isn't there a rather large difference between those?\" she asked dryly. He glanced at her, read her mind and searched until he found what he needed. Then he shrugged and studied his fingernail. \"It is all rather diversified really. Hell, some people can simply act on lust and boop! They're in. Here's where you can reach me. It's a hell of a lot easier than all this,\" he said waving at the candles. \"Morgan, Davis and Stalanski? A law firm?\" Nattie asked. \"What else?\" Dennis replied, and with a flick of his wrist, he was consumed by a tunnel of flame. Act on lust . Nattie tucked the business card into her pocket and cleaned up her candles. She then went upstairs to prepare. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Chapter 7] Chaptern7: Lust Action Hero Jacknwas awakened to the sound of pounding, and this time, it wasn't hisnown heart. Someone was at his door. He stumbled from the bed andngroggily walked to the door. He hadn't bothered to get undressednbefore going to bed. It wasn't like he was going to get much sleepnanyway. Hendidn't bother to look through the peep hole. He just openednthe door. \"Nattie?nWhat are you doing here?\" he asked sleepily. He hadn't seen hernsince he left Gloria's. \"Mindnif I come in?\" Without waiting for him to answer, she saunteredninside, the heels of her shoes clicking on the cheap tile. \"No,ncome on in.\" Jack said to himself after she had passed. He turnednand looked at her. She was wearing a black skirt that skimmed halfnway up her thighs and a long black shirt that fell barely an inchnabove the hem of the skirt. \"Whatndid you and Gloria find—\" Hisnsentence was cut short by her walking toward him like a lioness tonher prey. The same dangerous gleam was in her gold eyes. Shenreached him and ran her hands over his shoulders, down his chest,nthen up again to lock behind his neck. \"Uh,nNat—\" Hernmouth fused to his, stopping his protest before it started. He tooknher by her wrists and pushed her back. \"Whatnare you doing?\" He asked. Shenchuckled, and the sound sent shivers along his skin. Withoutnwaiting for another word from him, she undid the button of her skirtnand let the material slide down her long legs, where it pooled aroundnher feet. She stepped out of the black ring and closed the distancenbetween them, grabbing his hips and rising on her toes to kiss himnagain. Jacknwas thoroughly confused. Never in all of his years as a liar andnmanipulator had he been in this situation. He didn't know what tonmake of it. All he knew was that if he didn't do something, itnwouldn't be long before his control snapped like a piece of thread. Shenbit his bottom lip. \"I know what I'm doing Jack. Believe it ornnot,\" she said as she ran her tongue over the place she had justnbit, \"I've thought this through.\" She reached for the topnbutton of her shirt. \"All you have to do is stand by, and let itnhappen.\" Shenran her hands down his gray t-shirt and slipped her hands underneathnto feel the planes of his stomach and chest. She took the hem of thenshirt in her hands and pulled it over his head, making his hair sticknup even more. She pushed him back and looked at him. Henwas all firm planes and sinewy muscle. He was not bulky like manynmen, but rather his muscles were long and lean. She rubbed the palmnof her left hand along the chiseled muscles of his chest, down to hisnpale stomach. She placed her right hand on his side and smiled whennshe saw his skin quiver. She ran her fingertips along the pink scarnthat had ended his life so long ago. It ran from his left side,nacross his navel, down to disappear under the band of his boxers andnjeans to end at his right hip. Hensucked in a breath as her fingers played over his skin to dive afternthe trail of his scar. She tucked her tongue between her teeth andngrinned at him. She took his face in her hands and kissed his mouth,nher tongue delving inside to explore. Henhad taken all he could stand. He wrapped his fingers in the twistednmass of her hair and pulled her head back. She stared at him withnwide and excited eyes, silently challenging him to take as he hadnbeen taken. He plundered her mouth much the same way she had donenhis, using lips, tongue, and teeth. Shenpushed him back against the inexpensive and stained refrigerator. Shenmoved her hands down to the button of his jeans, all the whilenwatching his eyes go from deep blue to silver and back again. Shenpushed his jeans off his hips and pulled him to her once again. Shencould feel the heat of him through their remaining clothes. She rannher mouth over his throat and down his chest leaving a trail of hotnkisses that he thought would surely leave scorch marks on his skin.nHe gripped her hips and lifted her, slamming her onto the counter. Henassaulted her mouth. He took the thin material of her shirt andnpulled it apart, sending buttons flying. Hentook with his mouth as fiercely as she had done. He scraped his teethnover the sensitive skin at her throat. He attacked her breasts withnsuch ferocity that she knew that she would have bruises later, butnshe didn't care. Nothing mattered except that he continued on. Shenwrapped her legs around his waist. He pushed her back on the counter,nnone too gently, and continued down her body. Then he was still. Shenraised her head. \"What? What's the matter?\" she panted. Henjust stood staring at her with a puzzled smile on his lips. \"I'vennever seen anything as sexy as you look right now.\" Hengripped her thighs, pulled her more snuggly against him, and took hernmouth in a tender but hot kiss. Herneyes had heated to a glowing gold and they let passion take itsncourse. - \"Wow.\"nNattie panted. Thatnwas all she could say. She was sore and bruised, but she wouldn'tnhave traded one second of the...intense...mating of bodies that shenhad just been initiated to. Findingnthe energy to roll off her, Jack reached for the bedside table to getna cigarette. As he lit one, he heard Nattie chuckle, and was amazednthat he felt himself stirring again. He looked over at her. Shenlooked like a cat that just ate an entire family of birds. If she hadna tail, it would be twitching contentedly. \"What?\"nHe asked. Shenplaced a hand over her mouth. \"Sorry. I just got tickled. Thencigarette thing. You know, the whole cliché'.\" Hengrinned and finished his cigarette. Kissing her again, they driftednto sleep. ----- Laternthat morning, Jack was pulled from the first fit less sleep he hadnhad in...well, ever, by the smell of coffee. Henrose to see Nattie, clad in her black shirt, standing at the sink.nHer shirt was open except for the two remaining buttons, and exposednhalf of one pink and bruised breast. He felt himself go hard at thensight of her. \"Goodnmorning.\" Her voice was throatier than usual, and her eyesnlooked...different, but she was still the most beautiful creature henhad ever seen. Withoutna word, he walked up behind her and drew the shirt over her head.nGripping her shoulders, he spun her to face him with a dangerous glownin his eyes. \"Indon't think so buddy. Not before my cof--\" the protest died in anstrangled gasp as he lifted her from the floor and pinned her againstnthe wall. He wrapped her legs around his waist and braced his arm onnthe wall beside her. \"Jack!\" Henclosed his mouth over hers and almost went mad at the throatynwhimper. After they had both reached their peaks, he set her on hernunsteady feet, kissed her, and helped himself to a cup of coffee.[Chapter 8] Chapter 8: GetnGone By the time Nattienhad regained the energy to get in the shower it was nearly noon. Bynthe time Jack finished with her in the shower, it was closer to 1:30.nShe stumbled out of the bathroom, leaving Jack by himself in thenshower. She had just dropped her towel and was looking for somethingnto put on when a tunnel of flame shot up and Dennis appeared beforenher. \"JESUS!\" Nattienspun and reached for the blanket that was in a pile on the floor. Dennis just smilednhis charming smile. \"Not even close…\" Nattie looked bland.n\"Funny. I hope I get a super witty sense of humor like you whennthis happens,\" she replied sarcastically. \"What are youndoing here? Jack is in the shower but he could be out at any minute.nGo away.\" she said, shooing him. \"I only came tonlet you know that you're offer has been accepted. This isn'tnsomething we usually do, but you could prove to be very useful.\"nDennis said. Nattie glared atnhim. \"If I had my way, you'd shrivel up and disappear. I did thisnbecause Jack doesn't need to be in this kind of pain. He's paidnhis time. So don't give me the 'welcome aboard' speech. Inwouldn't be doing this if it wasn't for him.\" \"Yes, well. YounARE doing it. You made a conscious, living choice. Which is going tonbe trickier than if you were dead. So, let's begin.\" He stepped over tonher and placed his right hand on the back of her head. He grinnednwickedly. \"I feel I shouldntell you. This is going to hurt like a bitch.\" He took the blanketnfrom her hand and let it fall. He then placed his left hand low onnher stomach, under her navel. Leaning his head closer to hers, henstarted saying something under his breath. It sounded Latin. To the innocentnbystander, they would have appeared as lovers about to kiss. ThennDennis began to move his hand up her abdomen, stopping just below hernbreasts. He continued chanting as he spread his fingers wide on hernchest. The pain thatngripped Natalia had her gasping. She would have screamed, it was sonintense, but it was as if someone—no, someTHING—had made itnimpossible for her to breathe. She gagged and closed her eyes,nletting her head fall back in submission. As she did a strange lightngreen smoke started coming from her mouth. Dennis sucked it into hisnmouth, and seemed to inhale it. Then taking a small ornate vial fromnhis pocket, he opened his mouth and the smoke went from him into it.nOnce it was all in the vial, he started to remove his hand. Nattie caught hisnhand and pressed it against her naked breast. Her head popped up andnshe grinned slyly at Dennis. \"Leaving? Sonsoon?\" she asked as she pressed herself to him. \"Why, yes. I am. Indon't screw the help.\" He said with a smirk. \"And besides,nFerriman should be finishing up soon. Have fun.\" Raising his hands,nhe was once again taken away by a pillar of flame. \"Oh, I intend to.\"nNattie said, taking one of Jack's cigarettes. ------------ Dennis sat at hisndesk prepping the deletion of souls from Ferriman's territory. \"Is it done?\" Anvelvety and exotic voice pounded through Dennis' head as he sat atnhis desk. \"Yes. She'snours. She was going all noble, so I just went ahead and turned her.\"nDennis said. \"And it tookneffect?\" \"Yes sir. She hadnalready undergone the personality change before I left. It's mynprofessional opinion sir, that she'll be a very beneficialnemployee.\" \"Yes. So it wouldnseem. What is your opinion of Ferriman's status? How long before henis overcome again?\" \"I'd say…well,nsoon anyway. Ferriman has always been unpredictable sir, so it'snjust one of those things that we'll have to wait and see.\" \"I hate waitingnDennis. Patience is not one of my biggest attributes.\" \"Yes sir. I'mnaware of that. However—\" \"However Dennis, Inthink we can give our dear Mr. Ferriman a little push. Don't you?nGive the girl child an assignment. That whorey young woman that shenused to be friends with. She's nice, don't you think?\" \"As you wish,nsir.\" Dennis set about immediately preparing to link with Nattie tongive her first assignment. ----------------------- \"Were you talkingnto som—\" Jack stared in disbelief at the woman who stood beforenhim. She had fixed hernhair. It was gathered and pinned with carelessness so that severalnred curls flitted around her face and the nape of her neck. Othernthan the small garment of black and red hipsters, she was gloriouslynnaked and smoking one of his cigarettes. \"I came to realizenthat I had no clothes here. Well,\" she grinned wickedly. \"Exceptnfor these.\" She ran her hands over her hips. \"We'll find younsomething…later.\" \"Mmmm…as nice asnthat sounds boyo, I've got to go to work.\" She walked over to himnand pulled the towel from his hips. \"But I'll be back later.\"nShe pressed her body against his and pulled his mouth down to hers. She broke away,nturning and bending to scoop the little black skirt from the floor,nand giving him a nice view of her butt. Shenpulled the skirt up and sauntered over to the small closet. Choosingnone of Jack's black Zero t-shirts, she pulled that on as well. Itnwas a little big, but it clung to her breasts nicely. Once shenlocated and put on her shoes, she turned back to Jack, who was stillnstanding naked in the middle of the room, blew him a saucy kiss, andnwalked out the door. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Chapter 9] Chapter 9: Flameworthy \"Goooood morning precious. Wow! What's with the skirt? You look…\" Deb focused on Nattie, taking in her clothes, hair, and glazed eyes. \"…content. So you and Mr. Blue Eyes did the nasty?\" She asked. \"Yes. We did have sex.\" Nattie said. \"Nattie! Maybe you forgot, but he's—well, he's…I don't know what he is. That's the thing! You don't know what he is!\" Gloria cried. \"He's not evil. Trust me on this.\" Nattie gave a small humorless laugh. \"It's fine.\" Gloria went to serve Table 6. \"Well? How was it?\" Eyes glowing, Deb leaned closer to Nattie. \"Which time? One of the two times in the bed, the time on the floor, up against the wall, or in the shower?\" Nattie said, smiling wickedly. \"Wow.\" That was all Deb could manage. \"Oh yeah.\" A while later, Gloria called Deb to the front. \"I'll be back in a sec, then you can finish your story.\" Deb called as she ran from the office. Natalia smiled to herself. Suddenly Dennis's voice filled her head. \"Your first assignment just crossed my desk Nattie. Your first mark is Deborah Parker. Apparently she's quite the catch. Started sleeping around when she was 15, never stays in a relationship very long because of 'wandering eyes', swears like a sailor…\" His voice trailed off. \"You're in trial period Natalia, which means that you have 2 days until deadline. If you fail this assignment—\" \"I won't. Trust me love. This'll be a snap.\" Nattie replied. \"Let's hope so. For your sake.\" \"How sweet.\" she said snidely. \"Oh, and Natalia? Don't call me 'Love'.\" With a snarl, Nattie rolled her eyes as Dennis faded out. ------------ Back at the front counter, Gloria was busy filling sugar containers and talking to Deb. \"You don't find it odd?\" Gloria asked. \"One day she's Nattie Bennett, girl next door. Then suddenly, the day after she sleeps with someone who, as far as we know could be some sort of evil incubus, she's all…trampy.\" \"Fine. Ok. We'll talk to her.\" \"You talk to her. I'm going to go talk to Mr. Immortality.\" \"SSShhh! Jeez, Gloria. Do you want EVERYONE to think that you're cracked out?\" Deb glanced around. The last of the early morning crowd was just going out the door. She got up and flipped the Open sign to Closed. \"This isn't 'Highlander'. There aren't Immortals running rampant. Just say his frickin' name.\" \"Alright, sorry! Ok. You go talk to Nattie. Keep it normal so as not to tip her off.\" \"To what? I don't even know what the Hell you are getting at!\" Deb whispered fiercely. \"That's for the better then. Trust me Deb. Just tell her I'm running out for a sec. I'll be back soon.\" Gloria took off the spotted white apron and swept from behind the counter and out the door. \"Right. No really, I'll stay here…\" Deb said to herself. Shaking her head, she thought about how strange her friends were. ------------------------- Jack stumbled out of bed and made his way to the door. Whoever it was, they were quite determined to get him up. Running a hand through his already messy hair, he opened the door and was surprised to find Gloria standing there. Before he could say anything, she held up her hand and brushed past him. \"Don't think for a second that I trust you.\" She spun to face him, holding up a silver crucifix. He suppressed a grin and passed his laugh off as a cough. \"Ok. So you don't trust me. Mind telling me what you are doing in my room?\" \"Something's wrong with Natalia. I want—\" \"What's wrong?\" Noting the concern in his silvery blue eyes, Gloria quickly calmed his fears. \"No. It is nothing like that. I just mean that she's…different. I want to know what you did to her.\" Jack grinned wickedly as Gloria blushed and hurried on. \"Well, not what you DID, did. What you did to change her. She's not herself. It's like she's…like she's empty or something.\" \"Wait. Wait. What are you talking about? Start from the beginning.\" As Gloria recounted everything that she considered odd about Nattie, a feeling of dread began to build deep in Jack's chest. He knew the cause. He had gone through it. Been it. But how could they have gotten to Nattie? She hadn't died. \"What? What is it? Dammit, Ferriman, what happened to Nattie?\" Gloria asked. \"She's been taken.\" He said simply. He shook his head. \"You wouldn't understand.\" \"Try me. Is it what you are? Why you were in all those places before those terrible things happened? Please tell me!\" Her voice was raised in a near shout. \"I made those things happen. I killed those people and took their souls. It was a job and I was damn good at it. I think—\" He stopped, ran a hand through his hair in a gesture she was picking up on as agitation. \"I think that's what happened to her.\" \"Because she slept with you? Is it like, contagious?\" \"No. I don't know how…\" The sentence died on his lips. \"What?\" Gloria asked as Jack got up to pace around the room. It was only then that she noticed the scar running from one side of his body to the other, in one slim pink line. \"Dennis.\" The name was spat out with such venom that Gloria blanched. \"That's it. That's how they turned her. It was a trade.\" Nothing that he was saying made sense to her. Something about a trade? Nattie had talked about a trade. A trade for what? And who the hell was Dennis? \"Jack, slow down. What are you talking about?\" He acted as though he hadn't heard her. \"That's why the souls are gone. She gave hers…\" He laughed, but the sound sent chills along Gloria's skin. He was on the verge of hysteria. She had to pull him back. She went to him and spun him by the shoulders to face her, and slapped him. Hard. He put a hand to his stinging cheek. This soft spoken girl was full of surprises. \"I'm sorry. You were raving, and I cant have you freaking out now. We've got to get Nattie back.\" \"I think I know how to do that,\" he said. Gloria nodded. \"Alright. What do we do?\" \"You go back to the diner. I'll be right behind you, but first I have to try to get in touch with my former employer.\" \"Your former…\" Gloria's eyes widened. \"Oh, hell no. Just come with me now!\" \"It'll be fine. Go, before Natalia gets suspicious of where you are.\"[Chapter 10] Chapter 10: Old Habits Die Hard Something was wrong. He couldn't get in touch with Dennis—couldn't get in touch with anyone from the office really, and that bothered the hell out of him. Jack opened the door of the diner, holding the bell so it wouldn't make noise. Closing the door quietly behind him, he went in search of Gloria. It didn't take long to find her. He couldn't tell if she was dead or alive. Her limp body was on the floor and she had a large cut on her forehead. He ran over to her and turned her head toward him. She moaned lightly and he released the breath he hadn't known he had been holding. Placing a finger to his lips, he helped Gloria into a sitting position. She gently touched the gash on her head. \"It was Nattie. I came in and she hit me with something. I saw Deb…she was on the floor in the office.\" Gloria whispered. \"I don't know if she was dead.\" Jack nodded. Wondering if he was too late, he slowly stood and peeked over the counter. Deb was on her knees, blood covered her shirt. Nattie stood behind her with a dangerous looking knife, the blade pressing hard against Deb's slender neck. \"Natalia, stop!\" He vaulted over the counter in one fluid movement. Natalia turned around, clearly furious with this interruption. She made Deb stand up and then with a flick of her wrist, sent her slamming into the counter top. \"Nattie. Listen to me. I'm not going to fight you. All I want to do is help you.\" Jack said, his hands up. Nattie chuckled, a sultry sound indeed. \"My dear Jackie-boy. Do you really think I'd give up this power? This feeling of freedom? I don't think so. All my life I've been taking care of people. I've been the one to come to if anyone had a problem. People took advantage of my kindheartedness. Do you know how good it feels not to care about these pathetic mortals?\" She tossed her head, sending her curls over her shoulder. \"Come on Nattie. You don't like this. You're too good for this.\" \"Are you trying to negotiate with me, Lover?\" She laughed and shook her head. \"Who knew that you were such a sissy.\" She was right in front of him. He looked into her eyes. They were cold and empty. She put her hands on his hips and pulled him closer. \"I'll…never…go…back.\" She kissed him between each word. Without warning, she pushed him back and sent him flying over the counter. Gloria hustled over to Deb's unconscious body and pulled her as gently as she could from the counter. She huddled under the counter. Jack slowly rose to his feet. His anger had reached it's boiling point. He was sick of being beaten on, tired of being the whipping boy. This was bullshit and he was finished playing. Damn it, it was time to kick some ass. He charged and vaulted the counter once again. He grabbed Nattie by the hair and rammed his fist into her face. She caught his fist and twisted his arm until he could practically feel the bones beginning to break. He spun to his right and elbowed Nattie in the stomach. She released the pressure on his arm just enough for him to break free. She punched him in the face several times before kicking him in the stomach. She leapt for the knife that had fallen from her hands when the fight began. Anticipating her move and summoning the strength he had left, Jack grabbed Nattie's hair. Spinning her around, he slammed her head down as he brought his knee up. Blood spilled from Nattie's mouth as she fell to the floor in a heap. He stood and rolled his shoulders. He was surprised to find that he did not feel guilty about beating on Nattie. He tried to tell himself it was because it wasn't Natalia anymore, but he knew the truth. He still loved a good fight. The sting in his hands, the crunch of bone, the spray of blood. He breathed deep and flexed his fingers. Jack was so caught up in his own thoughts that he didn't see Nattie get up and get her knife. He heard her as she moved in behind him. Without thinking, he grabbed her wrist, spun her around and placed the knife against her throat. \"Tsk tsk tsk. You shouldn't do that. That's rude,\" he said against her neck. She struggled against him. \"I'm going to kill you. And this time they won't be sending you on assignments. You are going to the Corridors.\" Jack chuckled. He was feeling better than he had felt in days. Stronger, more like himself. He wrapped his arm around her waist, pressing her closer to him. She had her head tilted to the side to keep the blade of the dagger from piercing her skin. Not that it would kill her, it would just hurt like a bitch. He had never been a man of great willpower. He kissed the side of her neck and felt her tense. He ran his tongue over the sensitive spot just under her jaw. \"What are you doing Ferriman?\" Nattie asked. Her voice was throaty, and not just with anger. He was turning her on and he knew it. \"Isn't it obvious?\" He asked against her ear. He moved the knife blade down her throat, down farther still until the tip pointed just above her heart. I'm killing you. Though he hadn't spoken the words out loud, he knew she could hear them. \"Do it. I'll have you then. Go on Jack.\" She said in a taunting voice. \"You'll belong to me, and you will go to Hell.\" He tightened his hold on her. Resting his head on her shoulder, he grinned. \"Yeah, well…Been there, done that.\" She screamed as he plunged the knife into her heart. ---------------[Chapter 11] This chapter is kinda short. Sorry...I just needed a link between the last chapter and the next chapter. Chapter 11: Fight the Good Fight Her chest was on fire. She felt her legs tremble as shock ran through her body. He stabbed her. He had actuallystabbed her. That bastard! Jack gave Natalia a hard shove away from him and smirked as she fell to the floor and struggled to rise. \"Sweet little Nattie,\" Jack said. He sucked his breath between his teeth and clucked his tongue in a mock grimace. \"You forget, duckie. I've been doing this for quite a bit longer than you.\" \"But you…have a soul now,\" Nattie gasped out. She clenched her teeth against the burning in her chest. Jack walked over to her and knelt beside her, gently rolling her onto her back. He wiped away a drop of her blood that had splashed onto his bruised cheek. \"Yeah,\" he whispered. \"The thing is they gave me my old soul back, and let's face it...\" He shrugged and absently ran a hand through the back of his hair. \"I was just never really one for being a nice guy.\" He gave a dry laugh. \"But you on the other hand were like, crazy nice. I mean, giving up your soul? Yikes…\" Nattie moved her mouth, but the words were barely audible. Jack leaned closer to her. \"What was that?\" he asked. \"I said… Things. Have. Changed.\" Jack's eyes widened in surprise as Natalia pulled the knife free of her chest and stuck it in the middle of his torso. Such a quick recovery from the wound he had dealt her was something he hadn't been expecting, as new as she was. Knocked off balance, he fell back onto his butt. \"We'll be at this all day…\" Jack said, glaring at her. Nattie stood and spat a mouthful of blood onto the floor. \"You arrogant, pretentious, egotistical son-of-a-bitch!\" she shouted, kicking him between each adjective. Jack grabbed her ankle and jerked, sending her sprawling on the floor in front of him. He pulled the knife out of his stomach and threw it over the counter to ensure that it didn't end up in either of them again before pinning her roughly by the wrists. He pressed his hips into hers to keep her still. \"I gave up my soul for you,\" Nattie said as she struggled against him. \"What do you want? A medal?\" Jack replied. She reared up and popped him in the mouth with her head. Taking advantage of his loosened hold, she rolled him over and used all of her newfound strength to keep him down, pinning one hand under her knee and gripping his other wrist. \"A frigging 'thank you' would be nice,\" she said hotly. Jack spat off to the side and ran the tip of his tongue over his lip. \"Thanks a-million,\" he said snidely. Natalia found the wound in his stomach with her free hand and punched him. His breath left in a great whoosh. Jack was able to get his hand from beneath her knee and used it to grip a handful of hair. He jerked her head backward, knocking her off balance and sat up once again pinning her to the floor. \"ENOUGH!\" Jack and Nattie both turned their attention to Dennis, who appeared less than thrilled to see them beating the shit out of each other. Dennis tossed his hands to the sides and both Jack and Natalia went flying in opposite directions. \"Did either of you—for one second—consider that there are two living, breathing mortals hiding behind this counter and one is watching everything you do?\" He pressed his fingers to his forehead and sighed. \"You two have really put me through it over the past few days.\" Dennis whirled to face Gloria as she held onto Deb's unconscious body. She flinched away and closed her eyes as tears rolled down her cheeks. \"Fortunately for you, these two have assed around so much that I don't have time to kill and mark you.\" He turned back to Jack and Natalia, who were now on their feet. \"You two. In my office, NOW .\"[Chapter 12] Chapter 12: Refresh and Renew One minute Nattie was standing in the diner and the next she was grabbing onto the corner of Dennis's desk to keep from falling over. She blew her hair out of her eyes as she looked over her shoulder to Jack, who was slouching comfortably in a chair. \"I take it you've done that before,\" she asked. Jack was still dabbing at his lip, but the swelling in his cheek was already beginning to recede. \"Sure. I always think of it as a trip to the principle's office,\" he said with a shrug. \"You'll get used to it after a while…assuming you get to stick around.\" \"Blow me, Ferriman. I'm not going anywhere.\" \"We'll see.\" Their verbal sparring was interrupted as Dennis appeared behind his desk. He tossed the stack of red folders he had been holding onto the desktop and sat in his chair. \"Fine mess you've got me in,\" he said flatly as he flipped through the first folder. Jack sat up abruptly as Dennis held a stack of papers aloft. \"That's my contract,\" he said, trying to keep his voice calm. What was Dennis up to? \"This was your contract,\" Dennis amended as the papers burst into flame and disappeared with the smoke. \"Unfortunately, you've forced me to make a few adjustments due to your actions over the past few days.\" \"Dennis, you can't just void my contract,\" Jack said. He felt drops of sweat gathering on the back of his neck. \"I didn't say I was voiding it, Jackie-boy. I said I made adjustments. Don't get antsy.\" Dennis rifled through the folders and pulled out a new stack of papers. He took a black feather quill and began making notes before glancing up at Natalia. \"Miss Bennett, do sit down. I'll get to you momentarily.\" Nattie sat, casually draping one leg over the arm of the chair that appeared next to Jack. She was watching his reaction to Dennis's actions, noting he was trying not to appear nervous. The fact that he was nervous in the first place set her on edge. Ferriman was a seasoned Soul Collector, so anything that got him sweating could not be good. Jack glanced at Nattie, surprised to see her watching him so intently. He turned his attention back to watching Dennis write. What? he asked Nattie telepathically. Why are you so scared? she asked. I am not scared. But if I were, it would be because we--and by we, I mean mostly you--have gotten ourselves in deep shit. How deep? Nattie's voice had a distinctly panicked tone. Jack met her eyes and looked solemn. Real Deep, he replied. \"Ah, there.\" Dennis said as he finished writing with a flourish. \"So what's up, Dennis?\" Jack asked, trying to look bored. \"Why the dramatics?\" Dennis laced his fingers together and leaned forward. \"I've managed to pull a few strings and get you your old position back. Shoving you back out to sea spares me the extra work you've managed to pile up since your probation. So, you're back on nautical collections effective immediately.\" He passed over Jack's new contract and pointed a finger at him. \"Sign it at the bottom. You have one shot Ferriman. Screw up again, and I would imagine the Corporate Office would be less than thrilled.\" Jack visibly relaxed as he took the contract and pen that Dennis offered him. Using the tip of the quill, he pierced his fingertip and signed at the bottom of the paper with his blood. \"So is that it or are there other cliches that we can have a go at?\" he said, handing the paper back over the desk. \"How refreshing to see your arrogance back in place,\" Dennis said dryly. \"Miss Bennett, you've been rather subdued for the past few moments,\" he said, turning a icily charming smile on Nattie. \"Would you like to discuss your future in front of Mr. Ferriman, or would you rather discuss it privately?\" Nattie straightened in her chair and crossed her legs, attempting a calm facade. \"What is there to discuss, Dennis? I work for you now.\" \"Hmm, yes. But unfortunately you failed to complete your trial assignment. Add to that the fact that you didn't sign a contract and I'm afraid there isn't much call for your employment.\" Jack watched Nattie as Dennis delivered that news. He could feel the tension radiating off her in waves. She was broadcasting her feelings as loud as a nightclub DJ on a Saturday night. \"Fortunately for you, Miss Bennett, I absolutely detest New England and therefore I am prepared to put this whole incident behind me.\" He passed a stack of papers over the desk to her and rose. \"Just sign there at the bottom and we can all be on our merry way.\" \"This says I'm being terminated due to 'technical interference'. What does that mean?\" \"Is she going to the Corridors?\" Jack asked. He was strangely opposed to that decision. \"Due to the fact that Miss Bennett was still very much alive when she came into our service,\" Dennis said with a thanks-to-you look at Jack, \"then she will be returned unscathed and with her soul intact.\" He walked across the room to a bookshelf and removed a bottle. Nattie recognized it as the vial that Dennis had been holding when she had undergone the change. \"Our damage control team has already serviced the diner. Your friends remain unharmed and unaware that anything out of the ordinary happened. They remember nothing of Jack, except that the two of you went out a couple of times.\" \"Why have them remember him at all?\" Nattie asked. \"Future reference,\" Dennis said. Nattie wasn't sure what exactly that meant, but it was likely not a good thing. \"I don't want to go back, Dennis. I do not accept this pink slip,\" she said, tossing the paper back on the desk. \"Sorry,\" she said snidely. Big mistake! she heard Jack say in her mind. Natalia gasped as her chair slid across the room to Dennis. He placed his hands on the arms of the chair and leaned in until he was nose-to-nose with her. His irises burned a deep emerald green as his pupils dialated. Nattie was captivated by those eyes and was unable to look away or even blink. \"You obviously confused my decision for an open negotiation, for surely you would not be so idiotic as to argue with me,\" Dennis said. His voice was deep and slightly accented. It also sounded as though more than one person was speaking, which really freaked Nattie out. \"I will spell it out for you in terms that even the simplest of fools can comprehend. You sign that fucking paper, or I will walk you to the Corridors myself, after I've had a bit of stress therapy,\" he said. Nattie didn't feel like giving thought as to what Dennis would consider stress therapy. She gave a nod, her golden eyes still locked on his and a small gasp escaped her when the paper and pen appeared in her lap. Dennis straightened and tugged on his suit jacket before smoothing a hand through his hair. As Nattie finished signing, the paper rolled up and disappeared. \"Now then,\" Dennis said, his voice once again normal. \"One little trip back to your house and I'll give you your soul back. Jack, I'm sending you out now. Say your goodbyes and be quick. I have other things to do today.\" \"I have nothing to say to him,\" Nattie said flatly. \"You're sure? I mean, you were lovers,\" Dennis pointed out nastily. He smirked and had a dimple in his left cheek winking. \"Jack? Anything to say to the lovely Miss Bennett before you go? It could be quite a while before you run into each other again.\" Jack took out a cigarette and lit it, taking a long drag. Dennis cleared his throat and Jack smiled before putting it out in the jade ashtray on the desk. \"Yeah, I got something to say.\" He walked to Nattie and cupped her face, leaning her head back and kissing her. Her tongue slipped out automatically, seeking the taste of him. Jack broke the kiss and his cold silver eyes held her golden ones. \"Thanks for the sex. Best I've had in, oh, ten years or so.\" He laughed as her eyes flashed and she shoved him away from her. \"You motherf---\" The room disappeared before she had finished and Jack was kissed by the smell of a salty breeze as he appeared on the deck of a cruise ship. Natalia gaped at Dennis. \"Are we going now?\" The words were scarcely out of her mouth before she fell to the floor in a heap. Her floor. More specifically, her cold concrete garage floor. She rubbed her now throbbing elbow and glared at Dennis. \"A little warning would be nice, ya know.\" \"I know. But is so much fun to see the newbies fall out every time you shift somewhere.\" He surprised her by helping her to her feet. He withdrew the vial from his coatpocket. \"Take off your shirt,\" he said. \"What?\" \"Your shirt. Take it off. This is pretty much a reversal of the extracting process,\" Dennis explained. \"So I am going to have to have physical contact in order to make sure everything goes in its proper place.\" Nattie grinned mischiveously and pulled the t-shirt slowly over her head, tossing it carelessly over her shoulder. Dennis uncorked the vial and breathed in the stream of green smoke that snaked out. He then placed his fingertips on Nattie's chin. Leaning so close that their lips touched, he gently blew the smoke in between her parted lips. As the smoke entered her mouth, he lightly trailed his fingers down her throat, flattening his palm and pressing a bit harder as he smoothed his hand over her chest. The last of the smoke crossed his lips, and he let his hand rest over her heart. He began whispering words of unknown origin and a sharp burning pain streaked through Nattie's body. She cried out weakly, and just when she began to think that she would die from it, the pain subsided to a dull ache. \"This soul swapping thing is for the birds, man,\" she said hoarsely. She sat on the hood of her car and bowed her head. \"You'll have a bit of guilt, but you didn't do much. All should be back to normal in a day or so,\" Dennis said. \"Ok then, now that everything is taken care of here for now, I'll be off.\" \"Whoa. What do you mean 'for now'?\" Nattie asked. Dennis just smiled and flicked his wrist, disappearing in a tunnel of blue flame.[Chapter 13] :EPILOGUE: 2 months later Dennis sat behind his desk pouring over mergers and acquisitions. He glanced up briefly as his secretary appeared before his desk. \"Yes, Deluca, what is it?\" he asked, turning back to his paperwork. \"Well, sir. You said you wanted to be notified when it was verified.\" Dennis leaned forward intently. \"And has it been?\" \"Yes sir. The girl got confirmation just today.\" Dennis clapped his hands, startling Deluca. A grin split his face and his eyes lit with evil glee. \"Brilliant. Thank you,\" he said, rising. \"Sir? Might I ask…\" Deluca hesitated. \"Speak freely girl, I have to be off. The heads of the corporate office will want to know about this,\" Dennis said as he threw on his suit jacket. \"Why are you so excited that this mortal is pregnant?\" \"Because, Deluca my dear, this baby was sired by one of our Soul Collectors. On the child's fourth birthday, if the father is present, then a portal will open allowing our people to come and go in the mortal realm as they see fit.\" He grabbed his folder and a stack of papers before continuing. \"Also, as an added bonus, every soul—innocent or jaded—will be sucked into said portal and become our property.\" Dennis grinned again and disappeared with the usual whoosh of flame.

Thoug"},{"Movie":"Jumanji","Title":"7um4n71","Author":"PKClarine","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13007817","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer : I don't own anything from Jumanji. Note: Hello, I'm back with another Jumanji fic. For \"Hold on\", I wrote it quite quickly and, even if I enjoyed writing it, I am not fully satisfied with it :). So, I took my time for this one. I hope my English won't be as dry as last time, and that you'll like it. The story takes place after Jumanji 2. For the plot, the game didn't stay dormant between the first movie and the second. If you remember well, when Alan Parish threw the game in the river, at the end of the first film, it was circled with chains and rocks but it was free when it was shown in the sand. So maybe something happened in between. I included that detail to my timeline. That said, I didn't read the books (yet ^^) and I'm just based on the movies. Today is the prologue and the first chapter. Prologue The night was silent and cloudy. Outside Spencer's house all that could be heard were the discrete owls' ululations and the summer breeze playing in the leaves. Inside, the house was just night breathings. Suddenly, on Spencer's desk, his phone started up and briefly lighted up. Even if he was sleeping soundly, the young man mumbled in his sleep when the initial vibration resonated against the wood of the table. Unaware, he turned in his bed, and hid his head under his pillow. As if the device knew it was now safe to activate itself without being witnessed, the screen flashed a few times before turning dark again. Several seconds later, it finally lighted up again. The interface was completely glitched. Bars of colourful pixels were dancing randomly on the screen, forming a strange mosaic while what seemed like the contact list was scrolling fast in the background. Then, as quick as everything had begun, it froze. After quite a long period of inactivity, the phone began to emit a distant drumming sound. It wasn't loud but it was clearly audible; at least in Spencer's room. As the rhythmic sound went on, the teenager began to move as if it had caught him in his dream. Soon, his heart beating fast, he woke up. Breathing hard, he sat up quickly on his bed. During the second of confusion that preceded his full consciousness, he could swear he heard a drum, but it stopped almost instantly, so for a second, he was not sure if it was real or not. He took a deep breath and passed unconsciously his hand in his hair, as he would often do when he was nervous. He couldn't remember what he was dreaming about but it should have been quite a nightmare to wake him up like that. He looked around and then realized that his phone was on. He glanced circumspectly at the slightly glowing device on his desk. He was pretty sure he had shut it down before going to sleep. So, he got up and approached the table. He frowned when he saw the mess the interface was in. He took the phone and touched the screen. The pixels slid fast. There was something behind. I could almost see a photo. He touched it again and again until he could discern a shape. He squinted eyes and tilted his head. He was in his contact list. The contact picture on which the screen was frozen was almost unrecognisable behind the glitches but he could distinguish blond hair. - \"Bethany?\" he asked out loud, as she was the first person that came in his mind. He blenched when his phone suddenly vibrated in his hand. Unfortunately, his movement made him drop the device. Reaching again his hair with his hand, he took a deep breath to ease his racing heart. He was way too nervous... Then he sat down at his desk and he watched in disbelief his phone shutting down and slowly restarting. He was pretty sure it was just malfunctioning but a part of him couldn't help thinking about the drumming sound that awoke him and an insidious feeling of dread was gaining him as that reminded him of Jumanji.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer : I don't own anything from Jumanji. Avatars from the past The next day, Spencer couldn't stop thinking about Jumanji and the adventure his friends and himself went through. It was several weeks ago, but that small incident with his phone the night before had put it all back on the table. So, in the morning, as he walked down to the campus with Fridge, he took the opportunity to ask him: - \"Do you think we really got rid of Jumanji?\" - \"We crushed it down with a bowling ball, man! Sure, we did.\" laughed the tall football player. \"Why?\" - \"Well, I had a strange experience last night and I kinda heard the drums. You know... Those drums…\" he replied emphasizing the last word. - \"Maybe that's just some traumatic resurgence. You know, even if it wasn't our body, we lived some pretty rough moments...\" Fridge got suddenly serious. \"You've been eaten alive by massive jaguars. That's tough, man. I had some nightmares from the rhino thing, you know. But now I'm ok. Maybe, you needed more time to really deal with it.\" - \"Yes, you might be right.\" said Spencer with a crisped smile. He had those nightmares too and like Fridge he got over it. And until now he felt ok. He was pretty sure that what happened last night wasn't just bad memory resurgence. However, the fear was crawling its way back and he didn't like it at all. They separated in front of the school. Spencer chose to keep his concerns for himself. When he met Martha and Bethany, later that day, he didn't tell them anything. They all seemed to have moved on and he didn't want to bug them with his own late fears. But as soon as he came back home he decided to put on some researches. He didn't have the slightest idea from where to start. So, he tried some keywords randomly: Jumanji, jungle video games, jaguar statue... Nothing. The rare results he found led him dead ends. He tried to read some articles about virtual reality and things like that, but nothing built nowadays seemed to approach the realism that they were confronted to. So, he went dry quickly and he found himself looking blankly at the cursor blinking in the search bar of his browser. Suddenly, Spencer heard a knock at the door. Lost in his thoughts, that little sound scared him and he couldn't help but jump. With a slightly exasperated face, he turned round and saw his mother entering his room. - \"Don't give me that look, sugar. I did knock on the door first.\" She said. - \"Yeah. I know. I wasn't expecting it, that's all.\" He said with a shy smile. \"What do you want?\" - \"I was just saying goodnight to my little boy.\" She looked distantly at his screen. \"You should not use the computer that late, sugar. You know, screen light is bad for the sleep. Besides, be careful on the net, on TV they talked about a new virus. They said it does bad stuff to your files and things like that... Well, that's just gibberish too me.\" - \"Really? How it's called?\" - \"Oh, I don't remember. It was some complicate name. Just be careful, ok?\" - \"Yes mum. Don't worry. Good night.\" - \"Ok, sugar. You too. Bye bye.\" When she closed the door, Spencer leaned back in his chair. He was a little bit annoyed by the intervention of his mother. Since he returned from Jumanji, he didn't like much the childish names she used to give him. He felt a little bit too old for that. He wasn't against nicknames but he aspired at something more badass than \"sugar\". If only he could find something as cool as Dr Smolder Bravestone to entitle himself. - \"Spencer the Great.\" He said playfully then he laughed. \"Oh god, this is ridiculous. Nobody can actually be called Smolder Bravestone.\" He added in a mockery. But he stopped short. What if his avatar was a real person? What if the brave doctor had existed? Without high expectations but a sincere curiosity, he wrote the name in the search bar. It was kind of a stab in the dark but to his surprise, he had some results. For the most of them, the name was just quoted in old registries, but he did find a small paragraph on a misty website that sparked his interest. - \"Doctor Xander Bravestone...explorer.\" He read out loud leaning toward his screen. \"The origins of his nickname 'Smolder' aren't quite established. He disappeared in the late 18th century during a mission to Peru with his valet Finbar.\" This last sentence sent shivers down his spine. Normally, he would have discarded the website because it didn't seem legit, but the mention of Finbar was more than coincidental, so it encouraged him to continue. He tried the others' names. For Bethany's avatar, Sheldon Oberon, he found some similar results. The guy was a cartographer from the early 19th century. Like Bravestone, he mysteriously disappeared on a mission in South America. The details were thin as those persons were from a distant past. However, he found himself luckier as he had more results for Martha's avatar, Ruby Roundhouse. She was a self-defence teacher from Brantford and, like the others she had disappeared but it happened in the eighties, so he found some old newspaper articles on the subject. There was a long investigation before her disappearance was finally classified as cold case. The leads Spencer had found left him with more questions about Jumanji than before. The game seemed to have travelled a lot, and it seemed that it existed for a long time too. He let himself fall back in his seat and sighed, then plunged his hand in his hair and began to think out loud. - \"So those guys were possibly our avatars. There were real persons. What did happen to them? How could they even be trapped into the same game? There were no video games at their times... Well, maybe for Rube Roundhouse...but how had the others been trapped?\" He definitely needed answers. He thought almost instantly at Alex. Like them, he had been trapped into the game, but it was a long time ago. Spencer was curious to know how it happened for him, back then. From the group, he was the only one to have kept contact with him. Martha and Fridge just didn't seem to have the desire to do so. And regarding Bethany, she still had some strong feelings for him but the age difference and the fact that he had a family made her feel quite uncomfortable so she decided not to stay in touch; at least until she felt free from her sentiments. Spencer was about to write Alex an email but he heard his mother's steps in the stairs. He quickly shat down his computer, switched off the light and almost jumped in his bed. The moment she reached his room, he was already silent. He heard the steps slowed down, passing near the door, but they continued forward. The teenager sighed in relief. He waited a few minutes before grabbing his phone. When he was sure nobody would interrupt him, he began to write. He could have waited till the morning to do it, but he knew he wouldn't be able to sleep if he didn't send that email. Spencer didn't detail the reasons why he wanted to learn more about his correspondent's experience but he wrote a pretty long message. He was a little bit nervous about the possible answer but he slept well that night. I hope you like it. See you soon :)[Chapter 3] Disclaimer : I don't own anything from Jumanji. Thanks Defender31415 for the follow :). Here's the new chapter with a bit of Martha POV. Things are getting complicated :) What matters Her hands plunged in her pockets and dragging feet, Martha was walking down to the campus. She was preoccupied. Spencer had become more and more nervous and quite secretive during the last few days. She tried to speak with him but he was not really cooperative. Martha wasn't jealous by nature - she though - but as Spencer was now her boyfriend she began to experience this terribly unpleasant feeling when he chose to ignore her. So, she began to be more attentive and to look for details. That was how she found the mail he sent to Alex, and the things went in a direction she didn't anticipated. They had their first real argument that day. Spencer was turning a bit paranoid about all things that had happened in Jumanji and the theories he thought out were just pure craziness to her eyes. While she came close to the principal gate of the school, she suddenly saw Bethany scampering joyfully in her direction. She couldn't hide a wince. Her friend had this kind of joie de vivre and exuberance she didn't want to witness today. She was not in the mood. However, she couldn't do as if she hadn't see her and try to avoid her, so she let her approach. - \"Hi there!\" Said the blonde girl with a big smile on her face. - \"Hi…\" Martha replied more shyly. - \"Are you ok?\" Asked Bethany noticing immediately the lack of cheerfulness of her friend. - \"Yeah… What's up?\" added quickly the redhead girl with her best neutral expression. The blonde glanced at her critically. - \"Hmm… You're not a good liar.\" She smirked. \"Is it about Spencer?\" Martha flashed red. \"Oh I see. You know, we can talk. Girl to girl.\" Added the blonde more seriously. - \"Well...\" The redhead girl hesitated. \"Yes, it's about Spencer, but I don't want to bug you.\" - \"Don't worry, you won't.\" Bethany smiled genuinely. \"I won't force you to tell me, but I'm here if you need, ok? Don't be shy.\" Even if she was reluctant at first, her friend's goodwill was infectious and Martha smiled back. To tell the truth, the proposition tempted her. There weren't much people whom she could talk to about Jumanji and Bethany had quickly become a good friend after the events. Some weeks ago, she would never have imagined getting close to the pretty girl. The problem was that Spencer had involved Alex in the equation. Martha knew how Bethany felt on the subject and didn't want to hurt her by evoking him. - \"Ok. Thanks.\" She simply replied. Before leaving, the blonde gave her an undesired but very welcome hug. Martha couldn't help but smile at the affectionate gesture. But as they separated, she felt a strange tickling where their skin touched, like a light electric residual pinch. The sensation vanished quickly so she almost instantly forgot about it. ### Spencer had hope the week-end would help but Martha and he hadn't talk to him since they had their first serious argument. Neither a call nor a text. He knew from the beginning that was a bad idea to let her know but, since she had read the mail he had sent to Alex, he had no choice but to tell her the truth. Usually he wasn't the kind of guy who was not capable of express his thoughts but in front of Martha's incomprehension he found himself gabbling. Then, he said something stupid that triggered her and everything went off road. They both camped on their positions and they separated on that angry note. Right now, he didn't want to make the first step. In fact, he was a little bit afraid of her reaction if he did... The day went pretty fast as the lessons distracted him enough of his own problems, but as soon as it was time to quit the campus his anxiety skyrocketed. He knew Martha finished her lessons at the same hour but she was in another part of the school. As nervous as he was, he was afraid to meet her and to do it wrong all again, so he tried to reach the exit as fast as he could. He already knew that was not a good idea but the fear to make it worst was stronger. There was a lot of people in the hall and he was slaloming nervously, looking everywhere at the same time. But as he wasn't looking in front of him, he crashed into someone. The girl he just hit almost fell but she managed to recover. - \"Hey!\" She protested. \"Look out!\" Her expression softened when she recognized him. \"Spencer? You're in a rush?\" There was definitively a bit of wariness in her tone. The teenager frowned. - \"I'm sorry.\" He replied quickly. - \"What's the matter, you look terribly nervous.\" she told him with an inquisitive look. \"Well, it looks like you're trying to avoid someone.\" Bethany smirked. - \"You spoke to Martha.\" He asked in alarm. - \"She seemed quite upset this morning and you, Mister, have a curious behaviour, I have to say.\" Added the blonde girl with a faked seriousness in the tone. Even if he got the light-hearted side of her act, Spencer couldn't help but feeling nervous. He watched above Bethany's head, searching in the crowd a possible redhead. The blonde noticed it immediately. - \"Ohhhh, I see. Is Mr Bravestone afraid to have his ass kicked by a certain killer of men?\" she kidded. Incidentally, her joke triggered him. He took her by the arm and guided her outside the campus afar from the crowd. - \"What's the matter with you?\" She asked angrily when he released her. - \"She told you about my researches and the emails I sent to Alex, right?\" Spencer realised too late that he had just said the thing he shouldn't have. Bethany's expression darkened as he mentioned Alex. She seemed quite upset. - \"No, she didn't, but you just did…\" She replied with a severe look. \"So now…Spill the beans. Can you tell me what's it all about?\" At first, he was nervous because he was afraid that she would react like Martha, but the blonde girl didn't. She listened at his explanations without saying a word. She demonstrated an unexpected great patience with him. He could tell her all about his strange experience with his phone to the discoveries of the real persons behind their avatars. He tried to stay as laconic as possible but, as she was the first real attentive ear he got, he got carried away and was speaking freely by the end of it. - \"When I discovered that our avatars were from different time, I asked myself how they could have been trapped in the same game than us. That's why I contacted Alex. To ask him how it was for him twenty years ago. He told me that the game had changed. At first, his father had found the game on the beach and it was a board game, not a video game. So, the thing can mutate. That's why I'm afraid. Maybe we didn't really destroy it. Maybe it can change again and do people wrong. What do you think?\" He was almost out of breath. - \"I think you should talk to Martha and forget about all this.\" She replied with great calm. Spencer frowned. - \"But this is important!\" He exclaimed. \"Jumanji could be still active somewhere, and …\" - \"Yes, it could be. You said it. It could. But tell me. What's the most important thing to your heart? The one you love or that freaking game?\" She touched his hand. Suddenly, Spencer felt like an electric surge. It sent shivers down his spine and for a few second his mind went fuzzy. He couldn't remember what was bugging him lately. He knew that there was a problem but it wasn't important anymore. He looked down at Bethany. His vision was blurry. Though, for a brief moment, he swore he saw her left eye becoming glassy. He blinked several times and when he could see clearly again, her face was back to normal. He felt a little bit confused and strangely Bethany seemed also. But, soon the troubled sensation vanished and, with it, all his doubts. Everything was fine. Everything was right... He never felt that relieved since a long time. - \"Thank you.\" - \"No problem. Now, you know what you need to do. Talk to her. Apologize. And everything would be fine.\" Bethany said, visibly trying to keep her composure. Ignoring – not by choice but because he wasn't able to care at the moment – the discomfort his friend was trying to hide, he nodded in agreement. She smiled at him and gave him a shy goodbye sign before turning heels. Spencer didn't know how long he stayed there looking in the distance, but he almost jumped off his feet when he heard Martha's voice behind him. - \"Spencer? I saw Bethany talk to you. What did she...\" She stopped when she saw his strange look. \"Are you ok?\" She added worryingly. Just seeing her made his heart beat faster. Without warning, he hugged her and landed a soft kiss on her lips. Martha smiled through her confusion as he caught her unprepared. - \"I shouldn't have talked to you the way I did last time.\" He quickly said. \"She just showed me that I was losing what's really important. You... Would you forgive me?\" Martha flashed red. - \"I was a bit harsh on you too.\" She confessed, a bit mousy. \"I over reacted.\" Spencer smiled. He couldn't have hoped for a better resolution to their former quarrel. It was almost too simple to be true, but right now he didn't care. He was sincerely happy and that was all that mattered. - \"Wanna walk back home with me?\" He asked almost shyly. - \"Sure.\" She replied, equally mousy. They interlaced hands and they quitted the campus, leaving any bad thoughts behind. ### Back home, Spencer was still on his cloud. Though, the fogginess that had blurred his mind was slowly dissipating. He was gradually growing nervous. Something was missing or just wrong. He couldn't put a finger on it. More by habit than real need, he sat at his computer and opened his mail box. The most recent email was the reply Alex had sent about Jumanji. Spencer broke in a cold sweat as he began to remember what happened lately. What scared him the most was that he seemed to have forgotten some parts of the day. He closed his eyes and he tried mentally to rebuild everything he did. He attempted several times and he realised soon that the missing part was the discussion he had with Bethany just before he reunited with Martha. - \"I know I talked to her... I know she helped... But how?\" He murmured to himself. That incident bugged him profoundly but he muted his concerns. He looked at the screen for a long time and then sighed. There was definitely something odd about all this, but he just regained the trust of his girlfriend and he didn't want to blunder that close to their reconciliation. The best way to do it was not the go in front of the troubles. He swore to himself that he will find the truth somehow but it will wait another day. Spencer reluctantly closed his mail box. He got up and left his bedroom without much enthusiasm. As soon as he closed the door, hidden in his coat, far from any curious looks or attentive ears, his phone activated. For a few seconds the interface glitched severely. A muffled drumming sound resonated. The same glitches appeared on the computer screen. Behind the dancing pixels, the web browser partially emerged. The pages seemed to pass high speed in the background. Suddenly everything stopped. The glitches froze. The drums went silent. The computer screen flashed several times before displaying the desktop as it should. And in the pocket the phone's one went black. ### It was dark outside, as in Bethany's room. The blonde girl was sitting on her bed. Her face was lighted with the cold gloom her phone emitted. She was looking at the screen but she didn't seem to be aware of the glitches that were dancing on the interface. Suddenly the pixels froze and she began to speak with a strange monochord voice. - \"Compatible host found. Target acquired..\" The screen went black and the blonde girl suddenly jolted. The next second, she went slack and felt back on her bed. The phone restarted, vibrating against her leg, but she was totally unaware of it.[Chapter 4] Disclaimer : I don't own anything from Jumanji. Thanks bre18710 for the follow and Defender31415 for the review. Shorter set up chapter this time. Communication issues Despite the recent events, Spencer sticked to his own promise not to search further about the game. At first, he really did it just to avoid troubles with Martha. Though, he tried to keep discreetly an eye on Bethany, searching for clues of an odd behaviour from her. Unfortunately for him or maybe hopefully, the blonde girl was back to her normal self – which was always quite a lot – and, as nothing strange occurred to feed his concerns, his anxieties got progressively tamed. To his own surprise, he found himself gradually forgetting about what ignited his fears and beginning to tell himself he just had been paranoid in the first place. After all, maybe Fridge was right. Maybe that was just the manifestations of his late dreads coming from the experience he had in the game. Everything went quite smoothly till the end of the scholar year... ### Spencer was seated at table in the kitchen, grumbling at his phone. He was trying actively to get the last message from Martha, but the device wasn't very cooperative. Since the last few days it happened frequently. Most of the time, it was an excessive loading times for mails or texts and a very annoying noise on the line. On the worst cases, messages were unreadable. Focused on his task, he didn't pay attention to his mother return form the grocery. It was the third attempt at loading Martha's text and it begun to upset him. She was away for the first two weeks of the summer vacations, and their main tool to stay in touch was defective. Fortunately, the problem appeared lately so, for the most part, they could communicate normally. He first thought the technical issue was her side, as she was far away but then he noticed he had the same problem with Fridge who hadn't quit Brantford. The message finally loaded. \"Today, it rained so we went visiting museums with my parents. I hope the weather is good here. I miss you. Kiss\" . It was nothing, but he couldn't help but smile. As he began to write an answer, his mother called him: - \"Hey sweetheart, don't mind helping me here?\" He looked at her, arms full of packages. - \"Oh sorry!\" He got up and took one of the bags. - \"Still on your phone.\" She said as a gentle reproach. - \"Yeah, that was Martha. I have some difficulties to get her messages. It's been at least two or three days now.\" - \"Poor child.\" Mocked his mother. - \"It's the same with Fridge.\" He added quickly, feeling that she wanted to tease him about his relationship with Martha. \"Do you have any problem with your phone?\" He asked, extracting some fruits from the paper bag. - \"Where you've been? You're always connected, and you didn't read or see the news?\" She laughed. Spencer frowned. \"Brantford telecommunication centre is overload. They have electrical surges that disturb the network, they said.\" - \"Oh, I see...\" - \"You know the story: they don't know what can cause the troubles, but they do as fast as they can.\" Spencer smiled at the teasing, though he wasn't really pleased by the news because, even if his mother was joking about it, he really felt the need to talk to Martha. For him this telecommunication issue had happened at a bad time, but at least now he had some explanations. He just had to be patient. - \"What's that?\" Asked his mother while putting some purchases one the kitchen table. She took his phone. - \"That what?\" - \"I don't know. There was black tiny and... Oh! You've got another message from...\" She smirked. - \"Give me that!\" He exclaimed grabbing quickly the device from his mother's hands. She was clearly amused by his reaction. \"Mum... That's Fridge.\" He complained. - \"Yeah. You're cute.\" Ignoring her, he tried to load the message. As expected, he had to try several times, but it finally showed. It was a grouped text. \"Guys! What's up? Wanna do some pick-nick Sunday? \" Spencer grinned. He had hoped to invite Martha that day as she was due to return just the day before. His grimace strengthened as a notification from the red head girl came. \"Great idea! Count me in. See you soon.\" He would have preferred to spend time with her alone before, but she had made the decision for both of them. He sighed in defeat. He was about to text back when his mother soundly cleared her throat. He looked up. She was pointing at the stuff on the table. - \"The tin cans won't find the shelves themselves.\" - \"I just...\" - \"Tin cans. Shelves.\" He pouted but obeyed. He shoved his phone in his back pocket and helped her with the purchases. ### To escape his mother's \"big brother\" eye on his phone use, he waited till the evening to be alone in his room to answer the message Fridge had send. Sure buddy. I'm looking forward to see you all.\" He replied, a bit insincerely. Soon, he had another message. From Bethany this time. He had some difficulties so see the message because she had joined a picture, but after several attempts, it worked. The blonde girl had sent a picture of her smiling all teeth in front of an impressive mountain panorama. \"Sorry guys, I won't be back on time. By the way, sorry for the delay. I've got bad reception here. See you next time!\" He smiled. He had forgotten about the trekking she was doing. To tell the truth he was impressed of her doing that king of stuff on her own – as her friend Lucinda didn't want to join. He had been Bravestone for a time but in the real world his courage extended just enough to be able to ask for Martha to be his girlfriend, not doing trekking in the wild. Bethany had quickly become quite fearless. \" Have fun! See you soon.\" he replied. He jumped in surprise as his telephone vibrated almost instantly after his message was sent. \"I sure will. You too.\" was Bethany's answer. For an instant, Spencer thought it should had been impossible for her respond that quickly, but he was interrupted by his mother calling him from this other side of the house, yelling some unintelligible requests. During the short second he turned his head to scream back a loud \"coming\", his phone glitched. When he looked back, his conversation with Bethany was on screen as if nothing happened. He locked the device and left it on his bed as quitted the room. ### Several miles north, in the mountains, in an empty camping tent, in a side pocket of a trekking backpack, a phone flashed open. It slowly began to irradiate a green glow. Then a drumming sound resonated… it was quite muffled at first but then grew stronger and stronger. The raging drums suddenly stopped, and the phone shat down. Yeah, it's happening.[Chapter 5] Disclaimer : I don't own anything from Jumanji. I'm a bit early with the chapter but there will be something else Friday. 7um4n71 It was a sunny Sunday. It brought people out. Park was full of strollers. When Spencer arrived at the meeting spot, Martha was already there. - \"Hey.\" He said to catch her attention, as she looked the other way. She turned round. - \"Hello.\" She responded with a big smile. She stood on tiptoes to reach him for a kiss, but they were interrupted by a familiar voice behind them. - \"Hey guys, I don't want to be the third wheel here.\" Said Fridge smirking. Spencer laughed as he let go off his girlfriend. Martha blushed a little bit and chuckled discretely. They chose a place near a large pond shaded by massive trees. That beautiful sunny day seemed to have attracted everybody out. They were surrounded by several other groups, families or friends just like them but there was enough space for enjoying some privacy. The three had come with different food and utensils. They all unpacked their stuff and the joyful reunion began. Between two bites and laughs, they talked a lot. The subjects were diverse, but a big part was dedicated to the school. They shared great time reviving fun memories of the past year, and soon they found themselves looking at their future. If Fridge was pleased to tell the others about in sportive projects, Spencer and Martha were a little bit reluctant to evoke their college ambitions. They already had talked about that but the possibility of being separated from each other for long periods of time was darkening their mood. While they were discussing about their future scholastic orientation, their three phones rang at the same time. Martha was the first to look. She frowned. - \"What's up?\" Asked Spencer. - \"That's strange. I've received a text from an unknown sender. The number is 7um4n71.\" She spelled slowly. - \"Same here.\" Confirmed Fridge. - \"What? That isn't even a number.\" Pointed out the brown teenager worryingly. - \"Oh, that's from Bethany!\" Stated Martha, a smile growing on her face. - \"You opened it? Are you crazy? It could be a virus or something...\" Said Spencer while trying urgently to pick up his phone from his pocket. - \"Well... Obviously it's not, and she seems to have a blast.\" Argued the redhead girl rolling eyes at him. - \"Where do you think she is?\" Added Fridge ignoring Spencer's concerns. The worried teenager opened the message in turn, but he didn't share their joy. First, he hadn't caught it when it was spelt by Martha but reading it could clearly see that the coded sender was \"Jumanji\" written in an approaching \"leet speak\" alphabet. Secondly, he had already received this picture of the blonde girl, and the message felt strange to him. \"I'd like to be with you, but the park doesn't match this view.\" - \"She already sent that picture.\" He stated. - \"When?\" Asked Fridge confused. - \"Two days ago, when you proposed the pick-nick. She sent us that picture.\" Insisted Spencer. The two others looked at him with incomprehension. He quickly searched for the original message. He found it in the group thread but when he opened the details he noticed that he was indeed the only receiver. - \"You didn't... What the...\" Questions rushed in his mind. He wanted to tell the others everything that felt wrong at the moment, but he couldn't find an angle. Even if for a few seconds, he was arguing with himself silently, he finished out loud. \"Anyway, since when Bethany talks in rimes?\" He asked while reading the message, hoping that his friends would make the connexion. And they did. - \"Jumanji…\" Whispered Martha, using the word no-one wanted to hear. He shuddered. - \"How is this possible?\" Asked the tall footballer. The question triggered something latent in Spencer's mind. Snippets of memory rushed back but in a very disturbing way. More than being suddenly unlocked, he had the uncomfortable impression that those souvenirs were kind of pushed back by something. He remembered the incident with his phone and his researches on Jumanji in great details. Then, he experienced the strange conversation he had with Bethany weeks ago but from both their points of view simultaneously. He relived the moment of confusion he had when she touched his hand. There was something coming from her that, for a moment, reached him. Was it still there? Was that thing that numbed his vigilance till then? The dread rushed inside him like a cold river. - \"Spencer? Are you ok? Spencer?\" He realised that Martha was calling him. \"You know something?\" She asked when he focused on her. Before he could even answer, their three phones rang simultaneously again. That was another message from the same sender. \"Help me!\" A second later, glitches appeared on their devices. - \"What's that?\" Asked Fridge in alarm, touching his screen in order to disperse the myriad of black squares. - \"That's what happened to my phone months ago.\" Replied Spencer with an unexpected composed voice. \"That's why I was spooked out. I... No Bethany…\" He said confused. \"She did something… She was acting weird that day and…\" - \"What are you talking about?\" Martha frowned. - \"It's hard to explain but I think she is in deep trouble and so are we...\" As soon as he finished his sentence they heard the sadly familiar drumming sound. They had just the time to look at each other. Their figure distorted as they were sucked into their phone. And, as the world was fading around them, all they could hear were screams. ### Spencer felt the terrifying sensation of falling off the sky, but this time he didn't see anything. He just suddenly felt the ground connect with his feet and when he opened his eyes, he was back in Jumanji's jungle. The young man looked around him. Everything seemed less real than the last time, not because of the visual aspect itself but everything else was like dead. No living sounds. No smells. In a way, the environment seemed even more hostile. Then, he looked down at himself. He recognized immediately Bravestone strong figure. That made him smirks, but his smile vanished when he stretched his left arm and realized there was no tattoo on it. That wasn't the same Jumanji of which they were players, months ago. Just to confirm his theory, he pressed his left pecs. Nothing... Spencer gulped. Soon, his friends materialized in front of him. It was just like a cloud of particles that came from nowhere swarming back together to rebuild them. He frowned. Was that the way he came here too? - \"Spencer?\" Asked Martha in the body of Ruby Roundhouse as soon as she was aware of her environment. - \"Yes! That's me.\" He replied. - \"How can we be back?\" - \"I don't know, but be careful, there is something very odd…\" He said. - \"Odd, like we're back in a creepy video game that wants us dead!\" squealed Fridge in the tiny frame of Mouse Finbar. - \"I don't think we're a video game this time.\" His friends looked at him with concern. \"I don't have any tattoo or ability screen. You?\" Martha and Fridge tried in turn. Nothing. - \"Even my backpack is empty.\" Said the black man confounded. - \"So, what's the matter this time? What are we supposed to do?\" Asked the redhead heroine. - \"I have no clue… But here is another mystery to be solved… Where is Bethany?\" Spencer realized that the blonde girl or, as they were all in their Jumanji selves, her rotund avatar was missing. - \"You think she is there?\" Spencer took the time to think before answering. His new recollected memories were an advantage over the others for the comprehension of what may have happened, but he had no way to explain it without be labelled \"crazy\" on spot. He had to be methodical. - \"I think the last message we received was from Bethany.\" He finally said. - \"How could it be?\" Retorted Martha. \"I'm sure the sender was that creepy game. And as you said before we were sucked in, since when does Bethany talk in rimes?\" - \"I'm talking about the last one.\" - \"I know but how could she use the same id than the first message?\" - \"First things first.\" Interrupted Fridge, almost saving him from a convoluted explanation he knew he couldn't deliver properly right now. Almost... \"What happened with Bethany? You said she was acting weird.\" Spencer gulped. - \"Martha, do you remember that argument we had because I was obsessed with Jumanji?\" - \"Yes...\" The girl blushed a little bit. \"Now, it seems your concerns were well-founded...\" - \"Well… I hope that it upped your confidence because I don't think you would believe me if I told you.\" Taking their silence as an invitation, he continued. He tried to describe the strange encounter he had with Bethany that day. He was fighting to find the right words and to make the whole thing believable, but when he came to the part of his partially erased memory he lost them. - \"You're beginning to talk nonsense.\" Alerted Fridge. - \"I know, I know… But really, it's a very hard thing to tell. And now that we are here I think you can believe me.\" Both Martha and Fridge displayed the same frustrated expression, but they didn't argue. \"I think we should find Bethany and ask her about everything. Maybe she knows better.\" Spencer knew he wasn't much convincing but for the moment he couldn't do better. He had some theories, but his friends weren't in the best disposition to hear more crazy stuff. He really hoped that Bethany had the answers and that finding her was the best way to make his point. - \"So where do we start?\" Asked Fridge, filling the blank. Spencer shrugged. \"Okay… Let's take a look around, shall we?\" He proposed. The small guy readjusted the backpack on his shoulders before turning heels. Without a word Martha and Spencer followed him. Even if Fridge had shorter legs the other two walked a few feet behind. They consciously slowed their pace to let a certain distance between them, so they could talk in private. Spencer was a bit nervous, but he asked: - \"You seem a bit a bit upset. Is that …\" - \"No.\" She interrupted. \"I'm not upset. I'm confused.\" She replied quickly without looking at him. \"I mean. You were right, and I didn't listen to you. I feel bad about that. But now, in a sense, what you said seems even more unbelievable. I don't know what to think. I'm not sure if you're crazy or not.\" - \"Wow! That was straight.\" She nervously snuck a pick at him. \"I like that.\" He added with a big smile. She blushed. \"You know I'm not sure myself. I wish I could explain but I have to admit that I'm confused too.\" - \"You really think she is there?\" - \"I kinda hope.\" From afar, Fridge called them. - \"Hey love birds, I think I have found something!\" He screamed. Martha and Spencer joined him running. As they approached he pointed the tree next to him. \"What was the sender code, already?\" From up to down, on the tree peal was carved: \"7um4n71\". The strangest thing was maybe the artificial way those marks looked. Spencer got nearer and touched the naked wood. The shape changed under his fingers. It darkened and then slowly distorted. The three teenagers jumped out in surprise as it suddenly erupted in a myriad of tiny black blocks. The propelled blocks flew few inches from the tree and then just stopped in the air. A second later, the surface recomposed itself as fast as it had exploded, in a perfect reverse movement. - \"What was that? What is happening down there?\" Asked Fridge slightly alarmed. - \"I wish I had a proper answer to that…\" Replied Spencer frowning. - \"It looks like glitches… like those we had on our phone just before we ended here... but in 3D.\" Said Martha looking obliquely at him. - \"Yeah, you may be right…\" He simply stated. \"Sincerely, I'm not sure about the signification of all this and it creeps the hell out of me. Let's move. Maybe we'll find more on our way.\" In silence, the group moved forward.[Chapter 6] Disclaimer: I don't own anything from Jumanji. Thanks echonic for fav the story :). Here is the new chapter where dangers are crawling. Shadows As they were progressing through the jungle, their surrounding was changing. The place seemed progressively darker and sinister. The canopy was thick and the sun light hardly penetrated, however some trees seemed to generate their own light. The darkest ones had strange glowing and pulsing vines running through their peel. Soon they arrived in a small glade. Strangely the place was even darker than the forest itself. - \"What is this place?\" asked Fridge looking suspiciously around him. \"I don't understand how it works.\" - \"It looks like something his darkening the sky in this very place. Look! I don't know what it is but it's moving.\" Said Martha pointing at the sky. Observing closely at the darkness, the two boys saw the movement too. - \"I don't like it. I mean, could it be worse? That thing is just over our head.\" Exclaimed Fridge. As soon as he said that, the ominous drumming sound reverbed through the forest. \"Well I am beginning to think that I'm a jinx.\" He said almost to himself. Spencer crooked a smile at that comment. From the edge of the surrounding trees the ground began to radiate in a bluish light. The three teenagers looked with a mix of anxiety and curiosity the soil lighted up within a multitude of luminescent vines that were quickly crawling to the centre of the glade. A bright spot appeared at the junction node and a shape formed into it. When the light dimmed, they all could see an emerging black pedestal. Some strange writings were dancing on the apparently smooth surface. Intrigued, Spencer approached to look at it closely. Martha and Fridge joined him but staid few feet behind. The pulsating symbols were sliding an inch from the surface on what looked like an energetic field. As he stretched his arm in order to touch the strange block, his eyes caught a movement in the distance. - \"What's that?\" he asked, whispering like he didn't want to disturb a shy animal. - \"Where?\" Fridge looked around nervously. - \"There! Behind the trees, there is something moving!\" Exclaimed Martha pointing at a slight shifting shadow.\" As her voice pierced, the shadow stopped and seemed to turn in their direction as it noticed their presence. - \"There is more than one.\" Said Fridge in alarm as he spotted new forms sliding in the shadows. Soon there were many of them swarming at the edge of the forest. The erratic movements made it hard for the teenagers to identify their real shape but, as far as they could see, the creatures seemed humanoid. However, they seemed to uncannily crawl in a reptile way onto the ground. - \"Why don't they come closer?\" Asked the red hair girl as she noticed that none of the strange creepy creatures was approaching. - \"The light.\" Replied Spencer few seconds later. \"Look. They seem to avoid the glowing spots.\" He added, pointing at some of enlighten threes in the distance that the creatures seemed to skirt. - \"So, as long as we stay in the light, we're ok, right?\" The footballer was growing nervous. Spencer chose not to answer and looked back at the pedestal. The drums beat suddenly louder. It always had been a signal that meant danger but this time, he felt it like an encouragement. Hesitantly he stretched his arm. - \"Spencer! They're moving forward!\" Screamed Fridge as some creatures slid past the light. At that very moment, all the shadows rushed toward them like an indistinct swarming dark cloud. Simultaneously, Spencer touched the stone. Suddenly, the writings shined brighter. Then there was a big flash and a detonation. The three teenagers closed their eyes as the light surrounded them and all the creatures screeched in unison as they were engulfed by it. When they could see again, the pedestal was emitting from its top a powerful beam to the sky. The strange clouds were slowly dissipating around it, in concentric waves. That bright new light that shined the glade made it less ominous. The vegetation seemed healthier and the blue veins that ran on the soil and trees radiated now in a soft green. Spencer looked back at the pedestal. The writings were now fixed but it still couldn't read the symbols. He flinched when Martha's hand touched his arm. - \"Spencer. Look.\" She said quietly, pointing at the edge of the forest to their right. A well-known roundish silhouette was slowly getting out of the shadows. - \"Bethany?\" Asked Spencer in disbelief as he recognized her avatar. He scanned her as she approached them. He noticed quickly how worn out she seemed, even if she was smiling. She had some dark circles under the eyes and her outfit was a bit dirty and, in places, rudimentary patched. - \"Hey guys. You took your time.\" She said with a soft voice and a corner grin. From the first words, he knew it was their good old Bethany and he was happy to see her, but a part of him couldn't trust her totally. His instincts were telling him that there was something odd about her. He wanted to ask her a million things, but he was afraid to arouse suspicions. He quickly looked back at Fridge and Martha. Like him, the footballer seemed puzzled and a bit on the defensive. On the other side, his girlfriend just seemed to be thrilled to see her friend again. Before Spencer could stop her, she ran toward the cartographer and gave her a big hug. The two boys exchanged a concerned look. - \"I'm so happy to see you too, but easy girlfriend. I'm not in the best shape, as you can see.\" Bethany said. \"Hi there!\" She added, waving at the boys, as Martha broke the hug. The red-head girl took a step backward to look at her. - \"What happened to you?\" She asked with concern. - \"Wooo, long story, but this may not be the best place to talk. This is the first phase of repel, so the shadows may still come back. If we stay here, it will be harder to get out the glade.\" She passed round Spencer and Fridge and looked at the pedestal. \"Good. You have activated it.\" She looked intensively at the writings, like she was trying to learn it. - \"Can you read it?\" Asked the red-haired girl intrigued. - \"Yep.\" She quickly replied. - \"How?\" - \"Archaeology, I guess.\" She tilted her head and formed the victorious V with her left-hand fingers near her face. She kept the pose for a second and winked at him before releasing and adopting a more serious behaviour. \"That good old Shelly must know, so I can read it. I don't know what those glyphs are though. It says: Teamwork .\" - \"Wait a minute.\" Interrupted Spencer suspicious. \"We don't have our special skill this time, how can you? And by the way, how did you find us?\" - \"For the skills, I don't know. You're the smart guy who knows all about video-games stuff. Not me.\" She said, flashing a dark look at him. \"For the rest, I'll show you.\" She said, slightly irritated. Then, she sighed deeply before regaining her composure. \"Anyway, we must hurry. I have safe place where the shadows don't come near much. I'll tell you more when we'll be there. Now be quiet. They hunt by the sound we make.\" She invited them to follow her. Martha went with her without asking any question. They took the lead. Fridge and Spencer followed suit a bit more reluctantly. The guys didn't talk but Spencer found it reassuring that his friend seemed to share some of his misgivings about their freshly found friend. ### Bethany seemed to perfectly know where she was going. They soon quitted the forest and she led them to a large pool supplied by a high waterfall. She pointed out a rocky path before taking it with a dynamic pace. The three others weren't as assured as she was, and she quickly distanced them. They saw her disappear behind the roaming wall of water. Spencer took the opportunity to talk to the others. - \"Hey!\" he interjected half screaming half murmuring. \"Listen. There is something odd about all this and I'm not sure about Bethany.\" - \"What are you talking about? You wanted to find her. Now that she is there, you're suspicious?\" Said the red-head girl on a slightly disapproving tone. Martha was frowning and growing upset, Spencer could tell. He wished he had some good explanations to share with her to justify his strange behaviour but, for the moment, it was just an intuitive feeling. He offered a crisped smile which, in his current incarnation, was a bit ridiculous. That had the auspicious advantage to release some of the tension. Martha couldn't help but giggle. - \"Look, I just ask you to be vigilant. That's all, ok?\" He concluded with a more relaxed expression. Fridge didn't say a word, but he discreetly nodded back at him. - \"Alright.\" Martha finally conceded with mischievous smirk. Spencer sighed in relief. Then, one by one, they followed the same path Bethany took a moment ago and entered in her lair. Notes: - For those who are interested in the answers I gave Defender31415, here are some for everybody: 1) Yes, Alex will show up - The OS \"The name I gave you\" is his first appearance. He will appear again later on but I won't tell when or why or how lol. 2) This is not a phone app :). - For the record, I haven't based the \"shadows\" on the \"A quiet place\" monsters. The movie came out in late June in France and I heard about it just the week before (by the way, I enjoyed that movie a lot :D). I had almost finish writing this story at that time. Anyway, I hope you like it. See you next week for the next chapter![Chapter 7] Disclaimer: I don't own anything from Jumanji. To JOHNHAMMOND1993 : Sorry I cannot answer that now without giving too much about what's really going on... Yeah, I know that may be a strange answer for a simple question, but you'll discover soon enough why lol. Mystery... mystery... XD. The truth is out there (X-Files theme playing in the background). Well, back to the chapter. This one is quite talkative. The cloud The rocky path led to a hidden cavity behind the waterfall. The sun coming from the outside lit the entrance, but it was pretty dark. Their friend was waiting several feet away at the threshold of the shadows. - \"Welcome to my hidden palace. We are safe here. It's far enough from the dark spots and the noise from the cascade covers us so, the shadows usually don't come near.\" She looked back in the dark and added. \"The first few meters are a bit dark but, don't worry, you won't get lost.\" Without waiting for them, she stepped backward and disappeared in the shadow. The group quickly followed. As she said, the portion of the gallery that was plunged in the dark was small and they arrived soon in a large natural space tailed into the rock. It was lit by some artificial torches placed against the walls that gave a smooth blue colour to the place. In a corner there was a big pile of wreckage: different kinds of pipes, wires and metal bits. With some of those pieces, she had kind of McGyvered some furniture. There were a sort of table and stools in the middle of the room and a bit further there was a rudimentary bedding. For an unknown reason, the place made Spencer nervous. Next to the entry, Bethany was waiting, hands on hips. - \"Please, have a seat.\" She said, genuinely smiling. \"I know it's a bit rustic. I'm not that good at crafting objects. But even if it looks precarious, it holds. I have personally tested them.\" She laughed. - \"You made fours stools?\" Asked Spencer. Not that he really wanted to find something against her, but he couldn't help being suspicious. - \"Yeah.\" She replied with a bit of sadness in her voice. \"I didn't want anyone to fall down there but a part of me wanted badly somebody came. I guess, doing it, I thought about you, guys. To tell the truth, I made those quite early. Having the impression that somebody will come helped a lot. I thought about Alex and how he managed to stay twenty years all by himself and I was quite terrified to live the same.\" Spencer felt suddenly bad. - \"How long have you been there?\" Asked Martha dreading the answer. - \"Weeks probably... Maybe a month or two.\" Bethany looked down. \"Time passes strangely in there.\" - \"What is the last thing you remember before getting sucked in?\" Tried Spencer, now curious. - \"I don't remember being sucked in. And it's been a long time for me.\" - \"Please, try. this is important.\" Bethany frowned. She was clearly experiencing some difficulties to recollect her memories. - \"That's strange.\" She finally said. \"It's like the past year is foggy. I vaguely remember things like going to school, doing stuff but it's like a fading dream.\" Spencer glanced at her. The sensation she was describing was exactly what he felt that time she unintentionally kinda messed up with his head. The whole afternoon his head had been numb. And even after recovering his senses, he couldn't remember clearly what happened to him, until now. - \"You know that's weird... I feel like this IS real and everything else was not.\" Spencer gulped. - \"Are you sure you don't remember anything from the time before entering Jumanji?\" He asked. - \"Well, you tell me. Clearly, you seem to know better.\" She stated with a shade of accusation in her tone. - \"We know or believe some things, but the important thing is what YOU remember.\" insisted Martha, not sure about what Spencer was searching exactly but curious to know what happened to her friend. Bethany grimaced. Obviously, she wasn't getting at all the purpose of all this. But after a bunch of loud sighs, she seemed to finally focus in order to answer his question. - Well... The last thing I remember is... trekking.\" - \"Yes!\" Exclaimed Martha, kind of relieved that their memories matched. Encouraged, Bethany continued. - \"I took a two-days hike and camped in the forest. I put the tent for the night and then I was there.\" - \"Did you have your phone with you?\" - \"Sure!\" She replied with a sarcastic laugh. \"I may have ease off on the phone but I'm not blonde enough to go on a trip like that without it. By the way, didn't I send you a text when you ask for a pick-nick, or something?\" - \"That you remember!\" Joked Fridge. Without paying attention to the mouthed insults Bethany was addressing to the black man, Spencer thought out loud. - \"Then, it's been just a few days. Two at most.\" Then, he realised that a bit a finesse could have been used to reveal that to their friend as her expression was now reflecting a mixture of surprise and shock. - \"So, you didn't even know I disappeared? It's been so long for me!\" Bethany wailed. \"I could have died way before anyone would have noticed my disappearance. Nobody knew...\" As she was suddenly afflicted, she let herself fall on a stool and, elbows on the precarious table, she plunged her head in her hands. Martha sat down next to her and put a recomforting hand on her shoulder. - \"Hey. We are all back together now. Remember how strong we were when we fight the last time. It's going to be ok.\" She said softly. Bethany look back up at her. - \"Yeah... But you were the strongest, girlfriend.\" Martha giggled. \"And Spencer said you had no skill this time. To be honest, I don't know why I still have mine. One thing is sure though, my specific talents are not the best use in our case.\" - \"Don't underestimate yourself. You managed to survive on your own till then.\" - \"Two days... What a performance!\" She dryly joked. - \"Surviving Jumanji is always a challenge. You did great.\" Corrected Martha. Bethany smiled but she didn't seem fully convinced. Spencer sat down in turn. He was facing her. - \"You know, it may have been just days, but I'm sure your longer experience in game was real too.\" He tried. She nodded in agreement without looking at him. \"And as you were here for a long time, do you have any idea of what is happening this time?\" - \"I'm not sure.\" Bethany replied shily. \"Though, I have since covered a lot of ground down there and found some clues. I think we must restore Jumanji one more time. The shadows gangrene the world and the pedestals seem to have to power to repair it. At least, they seem to repulse the shadows and prevent them from swarming. I activated one myself, but I couldn't approach the others until you came.\" - \"So, it looks like a key quest this time. There was a message on our pedestal. What was written on yours?\" - \" Stay sharp .\" Bethany replied with a corner smile. \"I am not sure it means anything else but what it looks like it is: pieces of advice... But what I'm sure about is that those pedestals are good. I mean, everything that can repulse the shadows seems to be a positive thing to me, right?\" - \"Yeah, that seems good to me too.\" acknowledged Fridge, participating from afar. He seemed quite uncomfortable. \"By the way, what are those creepy things?\" He squealed. - \"I don't know. They are made of those tiny square thingies. There are just billions of them in the cloud. They ooze from it.\" - \"What cloud?\" - \"The thing that darkens the sky.\" She paused as she saw their mixed expression and then she realised: \"Oh yes, you just saw them from under. It's better to see them from above. Let me show you.\" Even if she seemed to embrace her natural enthusiastic self again, Bethany couldn't hide her tiredness when she stood up. Martha exchanged a worried glance with the two boys, but no-one said a word. They promptly followed their friend into the cave as she showed them a narrow passage in a corner. If she had to twist a bit to help her roundish shape to pass the first rocks, that was Spencer who was the tallest and the most build up who had troubles to follow. Fridge didn't miss the opportunity to taunt him a little bit as he had no problem to sneak in. The path was lightened with the same artificial torches that procured light in the living space of Bethany's place. Even if the passage was larger, the teenagers were forced to walk in single file. Soon the curvy and uneven path raised drastically, and they almost had to walk on all four to progress. When they finally saw the natural light, they literally had to climb their way out. They arrived on a large and inclined rocky platform that overhung the forest and the waterfall. A pedestal, similar than the one they had newly activated, sat in state at the edge of the cliff. It was also emitting a strong beam of light to the sky. - \"There is... the cloud.\" Bethany said out of breath. A dark mist was floating and slowly moving over the forest underneath. Some places were literally coated, and it was impossible to see what was under. The movement of this strange mass was odd. It defied the laws of physics and it was clearly animated by something else than the wind; almost like it had its own will. - \"What the heck!\" Exclaimed Fridge, looking all around with a growing feeling of uneasiness. \"This is sick.\" - \"See, your pedestal is there.\" Pointed Bethany, still breathing hard from the recent effort. The other beam was clearly visible in the distance. \"The shadows are receding. In a few hours we'll see how much is cleared. And maybe we could scout a bit.\" Spencer took a few steps backward and scanned the place. The cliff platform was large and slightly inclined. Then, within a large hundred yards it dived toward the forest. The ground was rocky for the most part, but it had the same slightly green glowing veins on it. Those strange vines sprang from the pedestal and then forked in all directions, melting with vegetation. Some of those were sinking into the ground through cracks. It was quite odd. Everything looked familiar but totally different in the same time. It was like something had scrambled the distinctive patterns of the Jumanji they knew to form this new world. The cliff they were on overhung the rest of the land like the jaguar statue did when they came the first time, but it kind of looked like the waterfall they jumped from to escape Van Pelt minions. Spencer looked back at Bethany who was now joyfully chit-chatting with Martha. He smiled. Even if she was trapped in the body of the roundish cartographer he recognized her mannerisms. But, his smile slowly vanished as his wariness kicked in one more time. As he gazed at her, he suddenly realised what was bugging him about her appearance. She had the same sick expression as Van Pelt or, at least, the dark circles under her eyes gave that impression. He felt his blood turn cold ice as a strange idea was slowing working in his mind. What if their friend had been scrambled out, just like the rest of Jumanji? Could something else have been mixed up with her? Maybe she felt that he was observing her because she flashed a glance in his direction. The eye contact lasted just a few seconds, but he clearly saw that she knew he was suspicious about her. He gulped. Any idea about what's going on now? :) See you next week. [Edit] After Defender31415's remark, I just want to say that, in general, I can give answers and explanations as authors notes when I'm not spoiling. I don't mind to give a little bit more in PM, as long as it's not just telling what's coming next lol. For JOHNHAMMOND1993, it seems like a simple question to answer and It looks like I'm dodging it. I understand It could be frustrating... I'll give explanations on the subject in exactly 2 chapters. Then, it will be spoiler free.[Chapter 8] Disclaimer : I don't own anything from Jumanji. First things first: thanks to the reviewers. I'm happy you're asking yourself questions about the plot. Also, thanks Cato Yugi for the multiples favs and follows :-) JohnHammond1993 : All I can say is that this chapter will comfort you in your theory. I'll give explanations next chapter :-). But, for the \"him\", I'am sorry there is nothing there but a common french mistake... In french \"game\" is a masculine word, so I used \"him\" instead of \"it\"... I corrected the description. Thank you. Matt : you're asking yourself a very good question :-). The chapter is the first step to understand what hapenned. Defender : thanks for your patience. I'am happy to share some details with you. As this chapter is quite small, I initially planned to publish it earlier this week but as I'm on vacations with only my tablet and hotel wifi, that was not that easy lol. So finally I sticked to the calendar :-). Corrupted Spencer needed desperately somebody to talk to. He knew that he shouldn't hide his thoughts like that - he remembered too well now how bad things went when he was obsessed with Jumanji and he tried to keep Martha aside – but he was one kind of safe proofing everything before sharing his theories. And as his girlfriend was currently talking to his main concern he turned to Fridge who seemed more on the same page. He was standing near the pedestal and looking to the distance. Spencer got closer. - \"Are you ok?\" he asked seeing his friend preoccupied look. - \"I don't know... Everything seems odd. I mean last time was weird, but It was not that creepy.\" He clarified. \"Look at this cloud. This whole land seems corrupted.\" The word \"corrupted\" strangely clicked in Spencer's mind. He knew that what his friend meant was slightly different of what he understood but the idea was quite the same. He remembered vaguely about a virus intricately named that was infecting some computers in Brantford lately. He blamed himself for his lack of attention at that time. Maybe there was an obvious link there that he was missing. - \"Hey man, you look like a some-one who just had an idea.\" Said Fridge smirking as he caught his shifting expression. \"I guess it's a bad one.\" - \"Well... It could be.\" Spencer looked over his shoulder, where the girls were. - \"Come on! You still wary about Bethany?\" - \"Don't tell me you are not. I saw your look before we entered her place.\" He whispered, hoping that his friend would keep his tone down too. He didn't want to be heard. - \"Yeah, at first, I was suspicious. To tell the truth, she spooked me out a bit when she appeared from nowhere earlier. And, I don't know, she seemed a bit off. But man... She had to survive alone on this creepy land. She said, for her, it was like weeks. Who wouldn't be changed by that?\" - \"That's part of the problem Fridge. We are in avatars and this is a virtual place. We shouldn't be changed. Remember Alex? He was trapped twenty years and he looked perfectly fine. He didn't even realised he was trapped for that long. It's been there just a few days and look at her. She seems worned out. Even her outfit is patched. Something is not normal. Either her or Jumanji is not right.\" Fridge frowned. - \"So, what are you thinking about?\" Spencer hesitated few seconds, but he really needed some-one to share with. - \"A virus.\" He whispered, trying to behave as casual as possible. He waited for his friend to follow his line of thoughts, but Fridge seemed confused. \"You said it yourself. It looks like corruption.\" - \"You mean like a disease that makes things decay?\" - \"No, I talk about an informatic virus, but the metaphor stands. If you think of Jumanji as a video game or something else virtual, it's like it's been altered. You've seen that before, on old games, when you do something that is unexpected, and the game doesn't know how to compute so the interface glitches. Sometimes, the sprites are scrambled out but the game is still running.\" - \"You know that you're talking almost in a foreign language to me, right now...\" conceded Fridge with a slight pout. Spencer rolled eyes at him. - \"Please try to link dots here. Look around you. Everything is familiar but completely different in the same time, as if pieces of Jumanji had been put together in the wrong order. And then, they are the glitches. Call them cloud or shadows or corruption if you like, but that's what those tiny black thingies are to me. The same appeared on my phone weeks ago and then again when we got trapped in here. I think Jumanji has been altered by some kind of virus and it called us back to try to fix it. The problem is that Bethany got here first. We still don't know what happened to her. This is not her fault, but she emanates something as uncanny as this place. To be honest, she reminds me a bit of Van Pelt. What if something has merge with her avatar like the rest of Jumanji?\" He concluded. Uncertain and clearly trying to assess everything what was just said to him, Fridge was looking at him with a mixed expression. Waiting for his friend to answer, Spencer passed nervously his hand on his bald skull. He didn't mean to deliver that much but, once he began, he got carried away. Suddenly, he realised that he didn't hear the girls anymore. Fridge seemed to acknowledge the situation at the same time. The petit man glanced past his big frame before looking back at him with an uncomfortable grin. - \"They are right behind me?\" Asked Spencer. Fridge nodded. - \"You think I'm infected?\" The question came with this uncontrolled high-pitched male voice that Bethany had when she was on stress, but she sounded sad and shocked at the same time. Spencer turned to face her. He felt bad when he saw the hurt expression on her face. Confused, Martha was standing shily a few feet behind and looking in turn to everybody. - \"Maybe...\" finally conceded Spencer shamefaced. To his bad luck, the girls had obviously caught most of the conversation. Bethany looked down to her feet. Her jungle hat was now hiding her face, but they soon understood that she was silently crying as her shoulders were agitated by a small tremor. Martha approached and put a comforting hand on her back. - \"Man, you did bad.\" whispered Fridge. - \"That's exactly what I wanted to avoid.\" Replied Spencer tight jaw. The red-haired girl suddenly squealed. She quickly moved away from Bethany and ran toward the boys. - \"What's wrong?\" Asked Spencer, welcoming a distressed Martha at his side. For answer, she just pointed at Bethany who was now quickly shifting between her real appearance and her avatar's. The blonde girl was seemingly freeze frame in a silently screaming posture. The blinking intensified as her roundish counterpart seemed to have some difficulties to fully form again. - \"What the hell?\" Exclaimed Fridge, frightened. \"What is happening to her?\" - \"She's glitching...\" Replied Spencer, surprised by his own self-control. Then, the avatar's shape stabilized. He slowly raised his head, revealing his dark if not menacing expression. Progressively, his left eye turned white. Ignoring Fridge and Martha, he eye-locked with Spencer. - \"You might be right, my dear Braverstone.\" He said in a deep baritone voice. Well, here we are :). See you next week for the next chapter. I'll be back home by then, so it will be easier to edit.[Chapter 9] Disclaimer : I don't own anything from Jumanji. JohnHammond : I like the character too, but more from the first movie, personally. Matt : Corrected :). Defender : The real Bethany is still in here. \"Van Pelt\" wasn't impersonating her. Just a little warning for this chapter : here comes one of the darkest parts of my story. The voice of the dead The shady figure that was standing in front on then wasn't their friend anymore. It was disturbing how much transformed the cartographer was. It was like even the light played differently on his face. He was emanating evilness. - \"I have to thank you for breaking her mental barrier a little bit. It's hard to sneak in that close to the pedestal.\" He said, smirking with malevolence. - \"Are you Van Pelt?\" Asked Spencer. - \"Van who? No.\" He replied with a strangely upset expression. \"I'm from your world. I'm longing to return.\" He added with a certain glee. - \"Who are you then? What's your name?\" Tried Martha. - \"I... I'm...\" The avatar seemed confused, like he was searching for an answer he didn't have. Then, focusing once more, he said : \"I'm what I do.\" - \"Which is?\" asked Fridge almost ironically. - \"Consuming.\" replied the avatar with a disturbing smile. - \"Leave our friend alone.\" attacked suddenly the red-haired girl, ignoring the menacing glare he was landing on each one of them. - \"I can't do that.\" He stated as if it was patent. \"I'm stuck here too. The game tricked me in there. I have to find the way out...\" Suddenly, he grabbed his head with both hands and walked a few steps backward, slightly stumbling. - \"No no no... Don't! Not yet!\" He screamed before slacking. It was like his body was maintained upward by invisible strings. When he regained his posture, the evilness seemed to have left his body, but he still didn't look right. - \"Bethany?\" Asked Spencer, stepping forward carefully. The cartographer seemed a bit lost and was watching with a critical eye his progression. - \"Who is Bethany?\" He finally said with an odd British accent. Spencer stopped as he was guessing the name of the person they were facing now. Things were complexifying at an alarming rate. - \"Professor Oberon?\" - \"How do you know my name?\" The man replied suspiciously. \"Who are you?\" - \"Oh boy! When you said you thought she was mixed up, I couldn't imagine you meant that messed up.\" Exclaimed Fridge. The professor was visible shocked by his intervention. He was now staring at the petite black man with an outraged face. Spencer had to restrain himself from swearing. If he had told Martha everything he had found about the avatars, Fridge didn't know that Oberon was from a very different time. A giant mixed man with a natural menacing stature, then, to the standards of his time, a black man who seemed too free to talk, and a half-naked red-haired woman: it was not the best starting point to engage conversation with some-one from the 19th century. - \"It's a long story.\" Spencer said, trying to appear friendly. - \"Who are you?\" Repeated Oberon, detaching each word and scanning him head to toes. Even if the professor didn't seem as menacing as before, he was clearly on defensive. Spencer didn't know how to react or how to explain what was happening. The fact that guy was from another century was a serious handicap. Cultural differences apart, he wasn't sure the cartographer could apprehend modern technology. He had to find another angle. To his surprise, the answer came from Martha. She had this special look saying I know what I'm doing even if I'm terrified. She joined him and with all the confidence she could put in her voice, she asked: - \"Sir, are you familiar with the concept of avatar?\" At first, the man looked back at her with condescension, even grimaced when he eyed scornfully at her outfit. By reflex, she put her arm in protection around her waist. - \"It's a mythical concept from the far East.\" The cartographer finally replied. Martha nodded. - \"From Hinduism.\" She added. Oberon was surprised and visibly pleased. He showed some interest. - \"Lady, I see that you seem to have some education.\" The red-haired girl smiled and was about to thank him but the cartographer attitude shift suddenly to a more condescending demeanour. \"However, I hope you're not suggesting that you are reincarnations of oriental gods. I know this place makes no sense, but don't make a fool of me.\" He let out, with a dry and contemptuous laugh. - \"Of course not, sir. That was not my intention.\" Gabbled Martha, flashing red. Though, she quickly recovered and added with a steadier voice: \"But still, the comparison stands. We are trapped in bodies that aren't ours, like avatars.\" The moment she said that, Oberon grabbed his head both hands, eyes squinted in pain. His body began to glitch again, but instead of Bethany frame, he was shifting with his evil self they talked to minutes ago. It was like looking at a cubic painting were the perspectives were mixed. When, it finally stabilized, the cartographer was breathing hard. - \"Avatars you said?\" He asked, jaws tight. He was now quite leery and was suspiciously staring them. Rather dumbfounded, Martha nodded. \"So, you are telling me that the evil soul that is trying to dominate me is one of you?\" There was a flash of anger in his voice. - \"Oh God no!\" Exclaimed the red-haired girl. \"We have nothing to do with this.\" - \"Explain then!\" The man barked, angry and confused at the same time. - \"We played that strange game and it trapped us...\" She gabbled, feeling the pressure to answer correctly. \"Jumanji lured us into its world. We are just trying to figure out how we can get out.\" Releasing the name of game kind of defuse the explosive situation. Oberon calmed down immediately. He was still clearly confused but the anger had vanished. He studied them for a long moment before looking back at Spencer. - \"Bethany? That's the name you used. Is that your friend?\" - \"Yes sir.\" replied the teenager. The cartographer grimaced as he realised that there were more than one unwanted guests in his head and that this plus one was a \"she\". But then he seemed more intrigued than revulsed. - \"Blonde? Blue eyes?\" He asked. - \"Yes, but how do you know?\" Inquired Martha. Oberon looked at her quite intensely but didn't say a word as he seemed to analyse in depth the implications. Spencer was deeply intrigued but also really appreciative of his girlfriend and the way she had led the conversation. Taking advantage of the relative calm and the fact that the avatar seemed to have forgotten their existence, Fridge came next to him and elbowed him. \"Bethany\" he mouthed with a concerned look. Spencer replied the same way \"I know but...\" and then shushed him. It was not the moment to bust everything by making their interlocutor nervous again. Oberon's expression progressively softened but there was more of a growing sadness in it. When he spoke, his voice was low. - \"I always thought it was a dream...\" He stated almost for himself. \"I thought it was just a figment of my imagination that helped me to keep at bay the monster that crawls in my mind. So that means she is really there when my conscience falters... What does that make of me? A vessel?\" - \"I'm sorry.\" Replied Martha compassionate. \"We didn't choose to end up in other people's body. And to be honest with you, this is the first time we have the opportunity to talk to an avatar... shell.\" She couldn't find another word to describe it. The cartographer grimaced once again. - \"This is wrong in so many ways.\" He said, almost to himself. \"That game is evil.\" Then, he adjusted his outfit and upped his chin. \"The souls should be allowed to rest when their time is done.\" His voice was full of bitterness. - \"Sir? What ...\" Tried Spencer, but the cartographer interrupted him. - \"I know what happened to me. And now, I know that I'm no more.\" He said loudly, anger growing in his voice. \"I lost the game. I died.\" Spencer grimaced. Was that what happened to those who lost the game? To those who died? Was he listening to the voice of a dead man? He broke in a cold sweat... The perspective of being trapped forever and used as vehicle for other people was just terrifying. He looked briefly at his friends to find the same expression of dread on their face. Oberon closed his eyes as he was trying to remember more things. When he opened them again, he looked down and began to talk in a low tone. He was full of bitterness and sadness. - \"When I first regained consciousness – if I can still say that – I thought I was in some afterlife place. Neither hell nor heaven. Somewhere in between, waiting to be judged. I was lying on the ground in a strange mechanical city, surrounded by those swarming shadows.\" He pointed vaguely at the cloud. \"They were waiting... observing... I thought it was my trial to gain my place in heavens. What a fool I was?\" He snorted. \"When I approached this place, the shadows began to show some aggressiveness. I ran as fast as I could. I... no, maybe it was her by then. Anyway... The drums were beating. It was like an invitation. We were surrounded and we had literally just one option. So we rushed to the pedestal. When we touched it, there was a screeching noise and there was light... The shadows were repelled but still there, at the edge of the influence of the pedestal. We had to learn how to survived them. And we did.\" He had a sad smile.\"It's strange because, I rarely came back to my senses like I currently am, but I kind of remember everything we've done. It's like figments of a dream that last long enough to be remembered. Foggy and quite clear at the same time. Now, I realise that what I remember must be your friend's journey. I saw through her eyes in my own body... I lived it all.\" He grimaced. \"And, until now, I think she wasn't aware of it... I can feel what she feels. And, right now, she is as horrified as I am.\" The roundish man kept quiet for a long time. The silence plunged everyone in deep thoughts. Spencer felt sick. When he first became Bravestone, he enjoyed being in that strong body. He was even ready to abandon everything to stay here, living adventures in Jumanji. But after what Oberon just said, he was outraged. Like the professor said, it was wrong. That poor man should have never experienced that horrible feeling of being dispossessed of his own body. In a corner of his mind, he was hoping that none of their avatar were aware of what was happening. Spencer began to shudder. He never wished to quit this body as much as this very moment. When Oberon spoke again, his voice was softer. His British accent was subtly fading. - \"We ran through that strange jungle countless of time. We returned to the mechanical city sometimes. But most of the time, we stayed here, on this cliff, for hours, watching the cloud, waiting for something to happen or... somebody to come.\" When he lifted his head, his look was milder and bright from the tears he was trying to hold back. There was obvious fear in his eyes. - \"What is happening to me?\" Bethany was back. So, here we are. My answer for the Van Pelt or not Van Pelt question :). Is it Van Pelt? Yes and no. Technically, it isn't. This is something else, but! In a way, it shares the same purpose in terms of story telling. I mean, for me, Van Pelt is the obstacle for the players that makes them grow : In the first movie, he was the father figure Alan had to confront to learn courage. There are a lot of symbolisms attached to the character. In the second movie, he has not such a depth but he is still the obstacle that makes the four teenagers evolve. If it's not Van Pelt, why does it seem like him? Well, it's because the game wants to warn the teenagers about the danger that lurks inside Bethany's avatar. And Jumanji has no other way to communicate clearly for the moment. I hope my answer clarified things a little bit and I hope you liked the chapter :). See you next week![Chapter 10] Disclaimer : I don't own anything from Jumanji. JohnHammond : You nailed it :D. For Van Pelt, yes, I imply that it could have been a player that died in the game. From that point on, you can imagine whatever story you want :). Stay sharp They all needed some time to recover from the odd experience; Bethany more than anybody. Yet, she was the first to engage the conversation. - \"I want to know everything you know, guys.\" Her voice was shaking a little bit, but she seemed resolute. So, Spencer began to narrate in detail what they witnessed: from the evil unnamed incarnation to the uncanny discussion they had with her avatar. - \"Were you aware of it?\" He asked but Bethany balked to answer. - \"Yes, but I don't want to talk about it.\" She said, pinched. - \"I understand, but maybe if we understand it better, we can prevent it from happening.\" He tried. - \"It won't happen again if we finish the game. If we activate the last pedestal then...\" - \"How can you be so sure there are no more than three?\" cut Fridge. - \"I scouted a lot and I can extrapolate. After I activated the first one, the cloud concentrated on two other places and, underneath, there was this strange roots net, like the one that lead to my pedestal, or yours. And if you want another proof, you just cleared one of those two dark spots by activating your pedestal.\" she pointed with a sharp movement of her head to the light beam that emerged from the forest. - \"What makes you think that will end the game?\" asked the petite man, with a bit of anxiety in his voice. He didn't want to down her but he had to tried to show her the realistic options she seemed to ignore. Obviously, it didn't go very well, as her expression darkened and she replied with a flash of anger. - \"I don't know. Ask mister video games. He may know better.\" She crossed her arms. - \"I.. I think she is right for this part.\" Gabbled Spencer. \"Jumanji encouraged us to activate the pedestal, during the shadows' charge. The drums were beating. I know it's strange but I felt it like an invitation to touch the stone. And Oberon told us he had had the same feeling. So, I guess that's Jumanji telling us to activate the pedestals.\" - \"I tell you guys, I won't stay any longer here if it means that...\" She couldn't finish her sentence as her voice was choked in tears. She took a deep shaky breath. \"We have to quit this game or at least try... We have to do something... anything...\" There were all moved by her distress. Martha took her friend's hand and squeezed it kindly without saying a word. Her friend squeezed back. Spencer was torn apart. He wasn't sure that activating the pedestal was the right solution – even if it looked like the obvious move – but, as Bethany seemed quite traumatised by the last events he decently couldn't push her and say no. - \"So, how do we proceed?\" He asked, looking back to the cloud underneath. Bethany dried her tears and composed herself the best she could. She came next to him. - \"See that part of the cloud that is thicker than the rest?\" He nodded. \"That's where the last pedestal is.\" - \"Is it safe?\" asked Martha worryingly. - \"No, but we can still manage to get closer and take a look. We will decide the right course of action depending on the situation down there.\" The red-haired girl grimaced, obviously not thrilled by the idea. \"I did that a lot and I am still alive.\" Tried Bethany with a thin smile as she caught the expression of her friend. - \"Isn't it too risky for you to go?\" Asked Spencer. Intrigued, Bethany frowned. - \"What do you mean?\" - \"I don't want to upset you more, but the bad guy said it was harder for him to get free when you were near the active pedestal. If you get near a deeply glitched zone, I'm afraid you could lose control. And to be frank with you, it creeps me.\" - \"Maybe it's time to take my pedestal's advices literally then. Stay sharp . Keep an eye on me. You did that very well till now.\" She said smirking. \"If I begin to act weird, we back up. Agreed?\" Spencer smiled. He was quite impressed by her determination to keep going. - \"So, where do we start?\" He asked. Boosted, she invited them to follow her. She took back the narrow passage from where they climbed up there and that led to her lair. The way back was way harder than the outward journey. The rock was slippery, and the slope was steep. During the descent, Bethany gave some instructions for the trip to come. Mostly, it was advice to avoid confrontation with the shadows. - \"Remember.\" She said. \"The less noisy we are, the safer.\" She was standing next to the entry of the cavern and her voice was slightly covered by the roaring waterfall. \"If you are ready, we can go.\" She waited a second and as nobody said a word she took the rocky path next to the wall of water. - \"Martha. Can you stay with her please?\" Asked Spencer. \"I have the feeling she takes everything better when it comes from you.\" - \"Well, in her defence, you lacked on tact a few times.\" - \"True that.\" He admitted, looking shamefully to the ground. Martha elbowed him. - \"Don't worry. She's usually good sport. She won't hold it against you.\" - \"Hey guys! What are you waiting for!\" They all jumped in surprise as Bethany screamed from the exit, her head protruding out the rocks. - \"Coming!\" Yelled back the red-haired girl. \"I'll keep an eye on her.\" She added low voice to Spencer. Then, she trotted toward her friend. They passed the corner together. - \"What a day, huh?\" Asked softly Fridge, coming near the tall avatar. - \"Yep.\" Replied Spencer absently. - \"You look concerned.\" - \"I really am.\" The two boys exited the cavern too. The girls were waiting near the pool, on the way below. They were seemingly chatting, but they were too far for them to understand what they were talking about. Spencer sighed. - \"I have a bad feeling about all this.\" He finally said. \"It's not her fault but I have the curious impression that we are running into a trap of some sort.\" - \"Maybe, but do we have a better choice?\" The tall man shook his head slowly. \"Let's go then. If we stay here longer, it will look like we are plotting or something. Bethany is pretty tense, and, considering what happened, I don't blame her. So, I think we should get loose and let Martha do the magic with her, ok?\" Proposed the petite man. - \"Yeah. Seems good to me too.\" They both took the rocky path descending to the pool and joined the girls. As soon as they approached, Bethany moved forward. Martha looked over her shoulder and gave them a sympathetic smile. Then she trotted to catch her up. Silently, they followed their friend through the forest. As this chapter is a quite short, I surely will update twice next week. And, just for information : we are now in the third part of the story. There are 5/6 chapters left. The 5/6 is because, it has two endings that I'll post back to back. See you soon.[Chapter 11] Disclaimer : I don't own anything from Jumanji. JohnHammond : you're welcome. Here is the new chapter. Everything is darkening. Trust As soon as they had quit the waterfall area, Bethany stopped talking. Martha found herself growing nervous in this quiet environment. The nature was oddly silent and menacing. Sometimes, she would look back at the boys who were keeping their distance, just to be sure they were still there. They were quite silent too and just far enough for their steps not to be heard. Though, she knew it wasn't the thing to do, the more the time was passing the more she felt the need to talk; to break the heavy shell of silence that once installed, because she had the disturbing impression she was alone in this grim jungle. Then she began to glance more often at Bethany who walked quietly but actively by her side. Her friend was looking expertly around, searching for any sign of the shadows. She was very focused on her task and way more serious than Martha had ever seen her before. This more grave expression was reinforcing the impression that Bethany - or at least her avatar - was damaged in some way. There were those circled eyes that evoked Van Pelt but also strain. And since the glitching incident, she seemed even more tired. Suddenly, Bethany broke the silence. Though she kept her voice very low. − \"You know, you don't have to watch over me like that.\" She said with a slightly accusing tone. \"Please, don't do your Spencer.\" Martha flashed red, ashamed. − \"Sorry. I don't want to search for things if it's what you were inducing by 'your Spencer'\" She replied on the same volume. \"It's just... You seem very really tired. I'm just worrying a lot. And this place makes my very nervous. I didn't mean to hurt you.\" − \"That's sweet of you, girlfriend. I won't lie to you. I don't feel very well but not like I'm going to switch to another guy.\" She quickly added. \"It's more like something has sucked out my energy. But, that must be an avatar thing. Oberon had stamina issues after all... You know, I'm not mad at any of you.\" She said after a short pause. \"It's just... I want my life back. I'm tired of this sick game. Frankly, it's going too far...\" Martha understood perfectly but she didn't know what to tell. The avatar thing was way too disturbing and – she wouldn't tell it out loud but – a part of her was glad it didn't happen to her. - \"And for Spencer.\" Bethany added just above a murmur. \"I don't blame him, considering what happened, but it's hard to handle his level of wariness. I mean... I sincerely try my best here. I hope he will trust me again.\" There was a small tremor in her voice. As Martha placed a comforting hand on her shoulder, a shy smile found its way on Bethany's lips. \"I'm glad you are here.\" She whispered. Further behind, Fridge was growing nervous too. As the group was venturing deeper into the forest and environment was slightly darker, the petite man was looking around, scrutinizing every suspicious shadow. Next to him, Spencer wasn't overconfident either but not for the same reasons. He was looking straight ahead to the girls who were walking in front. - \"I revise my judgement. Any other choice seems better than what we are doing now.\" Mumbled Fridge. \"Are we even sure she knows where she's going?\" He squealed a bit too loud, pointing at Bethany. - \"Not that loud!\" Opposed immediately Spencer. Obviously vexed to be shush, the black man eyed him obliquely. \"I'm pretty sure she knows well. I mean, technically Oberon is a cartographer. She has his skills.\" He added ignoring his pouting friend. - \"I never imagined saying that one day, but: I miss mine.\" - \"What? The backpack superpower.\" Mocked Spencer. - \"Yeah, the one that can give you weaponry to kick asses, mister Bravestone.\" Retorted Fridge. They continued arguing along the way. Their low voice banter distracted them long enough to ignore their own fears and the changes in the scenery too. However, when the darkness densified suddenly around them, they naturally stopped talking. Around them, the trees were as dark as coal and some bluish veins were discreetly glowing on the strange surface they were made of. Spencer look up. He couldn't see the top. He gulped when he realised that the quasi absence of light was provoked by the cloud and it was dangerously low. He flagged Fridge to move faster. They quickly joined the girls. - \"The cloud...\" Whispered Spencer, pointing upward, when he arrived near Bethany. - \"I know\" She mouthed. Then, she put a finger on her lips, enjoining him to keep quiet. She looked to the ground and designated the veins. Then she mimicked with her hand the walking process. They all understood perfectly what she was trying to say but no-one seemed to want to go any further. \"Pedestal\" She breathed, as an unnecessary clarification. \"We can do it.\" Fridge shook his head swiftly and pointed over his shoulder the direction from where they came. Spencer seemed quite doubtful too, even if not as demonstrative as the petite man. Seeing the reluctance in her friends' eyes darkened Bethany's mood. Her shoulders slightly lowered. She eye-locked quickly with Spencer just to found the suspicious look she couldn't bear anymore. The fear in his eyes made it just even worse. She turned toward Martha searching for her support, but the red-haired girl seemed as hesitant as the others. Normally she would have understood their mixed feelings but at the moment, Bethany just felt kind of betrayed and she blamed herself to have hoped for the best. - \"I'm sorry but I don't want to stay here any longer. I can't... I have to take my chance. If none of you wants to help me, then be it. I'll do it alone like I did for the last weeks.\" She whispered before quickly turning heels. - \"Wait!\" Exclaimed Spencer trying to keep low voice, but Bethany didn't listen and moved forward. They looked in disbelief their friend disappear behind a line of dark trees. The shock effect lasted a few minutes, during which no-one said a word. Martha was thinking fast. She was trying to understand what just happened. She couldn't quite get why Bethany had just fled that way, but then the guys talked. - \"What do we do now?\" Asked Spencer uneasy. \"We have to find her. We cannot...\" - \"Are you crazy?\" Squealed Fridge, as low as he could but definitely too loud. \"I don't mean to abandon her but, hey Spencer, you were the one talking about traps. I think she just has put us into a big one. I'm telling you, I'm not gonna run into it.\" He added gesticulating. - \"Traps?\" Martha frowned. \"That's what you two were speaking about while you asked me to keep an eye on her? Do you realise that she was aware of your suspiciousness?\" She attacked suddenly. \"What is happening is not her fault.\" - \"I never said it was her fault.\" Tried Spencer to his defense. - \"She is trying very hard to fix things.\" - \"Yeah but she made things worse, leaving us alone in this place. She let us down.\" Fridge said out loud. Suddenly, the cloud above their head agitated. Spencer was the first to notice the movement. Immediately, he grabbed his friend and covered his mouth to shush him. Fridge began to protest and tried to free himself from Bravestone' strong grip but, even without his skill, the muscular avatar was too strong. Above, the opaque mass began to clearly wave. Fridge calmed down immediately. Spencer freed him. Soon, there was a bigger distortion in the cloud and a dark bubble formed. It dropped heavily on the ground a few meters from them. After a quick period of stagnation, it shaped itself one of those uncanny creatures Bethany called the shadows. It looked around, obviously searching for them, but it didn't seem to see them even if they were not that far. The teenagers waited, unmoving. Then the creature slowly disintegrated in a myriad of tiny black squares flying wildly to finally reintegrate the cloud. Spencer frowned. It reminded him the way they had materialised into this world but in the exact reversed process. As soon as she was certain the creature had fully disappeared, and no others were in vicinity, Martha start talking again. Her voice was so low, she was almost miming. - \"I'm going after Bethany.\" She stated. Considering what just happened, even if Fridge didn't dare to vocally protest, his look told everything, and he clearly disagreed. \"I'm not going to let her down.\" Added the red-haired girl, as she saw the expression of the petite man. - \"That surely wasn't the best way to say it, but Fridge is right. She let us down. We were afraid, and she didn't wait...\" Softly argued Spencer. - \"She just ran away in fear.\" - \"In fear?\" - \"She is not afraid of the shadows, like us.\" Retorted Martha. The boys frowned. \"She's been here for a long time. She can manage better than us those things. She is afraid to be trap in the game forever, like her avatar. She just wants the game to end... I imagine that she thought we just didn't trust her anymore, so she ran toward what she thinks is the only way to escape.\" As if it wanted to remind them the kind of threat they were exposed to, the cloud moved slightly above their head. They looked at each other intensely, gauging their courage to push forward. See you Friday :)[Chapter 12] Disclaimer : I don't own anything from Jumanji. JohnHammond: Sadly, the curse of the not guessing right is above you again... I'm kidding :). But, Bethany really ran away in fear. The lack of trust was just the trigger. Here some angst and action. Enjoy. The third pedestal Bethany was following the glowing net on the ground with a blind resolution. Suddenly the cloud above agitated. She stopped at once and observed. She knew that somewhere the shadows were oozing from the sky, but she had no way to know where exactly. She just hoped it wasn't near her friends. For a second, she felt a flash of guilt as she had let them behind, exposed, but she quickly repressed that feeling and tried to focus on her environment. She couldn't let herself being distracted for too long. The shadows were sneaky. As the cloud regained its former stillness, she continued to progress in the dark forest. She had just one goal: to find the pedestal. If she could activate the last one, Jumanji would be hopefully restored, and they could all get out of this creepy game. Soon, her surrounding became more and more sinister. The cloud was so thick she couldn't distinguish its shape anymore. If not because of the soft light radiating from the roots and some of the trees she couldn't see a thing. She had never been in a place as corrupted as this before. She slowed down and began to take shallow breathes as she tried to mute every sound she could produce. Gradually, the forest thin out. There was more and more space between the trees and the ground was almost covered of glowing roots. She tried to look at the soil underneath the net. There was nothing but darkness. She had the strange impression that she was walking on nothingness. She had to repress a terrible feeling of dread. Everything seemed so different, so artificial. She didn't remember clearly the first pedestal because – she knew now – it wasn't totally her own memories, but in the dreamy figments of what she reminded the place was much more alive. The jungle was still there. Every part of the land she had scouted was not as corrupted as this place. It was like the cloud had totally converted this part of Jumanji. The sky above her seemed not to exist anymore and, as the ground seemed to have disappeared too, it was like the place in its whole could engulf her at any moment. She needed something concrete to focus on, so briefly she kneeled down and touched the ground. It was strangely soft and cold, like polish steel. It was unexpected, but it reassured her a little bit. − \"Ok. You can do it.\" She murmured to herself. She stood up, resolute, and moved forward. Even if there was no direction to follow anymore, she knew where to go instinctively. It was one of odd side effect of being in Oberon's body. Even if Jumanji didn't look quite the same, after days of scouting, she had a perfect mental image of the land. She could almost blindly walk in there. She continued to progress in this strange bubble of darkness where the light emerged from the ground, and then, she saw it. She smiled. The pedestal was there, sitting in its nest of light. She approached silently and stopped a foot from it. The strange symbols were sliding slowing on its surface, like a blue lava lamp. Suddenly, Bethany felt dizzy. Her head was spinning a little bit but most of all she felt really disoriented. Nervously, she looked around. Why was her mental image of Jumanji vanishing? - \"You should have listened to your nosy friend. The darker the place is, the stronger I am.\" replied a sinister voice to her inner interrogations. She turned round as the voice seemed to come from behind, but she was alone. She frowned. - \"What the ...\" - \"You're not looking at the right place.\" Cut the voice, mockingly. Bethany broke in a cold sweat when she realised it was inside of her head. That was the evil persona to which her friends had talked to. She couldn't let that thing take control. She tried to move forward but she soon discovered she was petrified. - \"I can hear your thoughts, you sneaky girl. You cannot outsmart me.\" The tone was full of resentment. - \"What do you want?\" She thought, as no vocal communication was necessary. - \"Freedom.\" The voice growled. - \"But the pedestal is freedom, why don't you let me touch it?\" She asked mentally, looking at the dark block. It was so close and frustratingly out of reach at the same time. - \"You're not attentive enough, human child. Jumanji talks to you and you don't listen. But even if you had understood earlier, there is no-way you could stop me.\" replied the thing inside her. Confused and trying to understand the meaning of what it just told her, Bethany was absently looking at the lightened glyphs that were slowly moving on the pedestal surface. Suddenly, she saw it. Her eyes opened wide as she realised she could read the message floating in front of her. The words or the letters - she couldn't really tell what those glyphs represent - were kind of scrambled but like in an anagram she began to see a pattern and then she understood the meaning. But before she could manage any coherent thought on the subject, she felt something snap in her mind and everything went dark. ### Martha was leading the way through the forest. The red-haired girl was scrupulously following the glowing roots, as pointed out by Bethany. Even if they were reluctant, the boys had finally consent to join her. The alternative wasn't better anyway. The environment was quickly changing. The phenomenon was similar to their approach of the first pedestal, but the corruption was way more important. The darkness was overwhelming. Soon the forest thin out and the path was disrupted by more veins coming from other places, but the general direction was still clear. They finally reached their destination. The pedestal was waiting for them. It was almost too good to be true. Spencer ran toward his girlfriend and grabbed her arm to stop her. He murmured: - \"Martha, that's too dangerous.\" - \"Yes, but what do you want us to do?\" - \"I'm sure it's a trap. Bethany said she couldn't approach the remaining pedestals before. Why could we now? And, where is she anyway? I mean, we may have wasted some time before going after her but she is not there and she should be. Something bad could have happened to her.\" The red-haired girl stared at him. She could tell, this time, he was sincerely worried and not just overly suspicious. - \"Maybe but we're too far now. I mean, the pedestal is right here. We can finish this. I refuse to think she has lost. So, if we win, she wins too, right?\" Spencer smiled. Martha's determination was always something he loved to witness. She was a warrior at heart, for sure. - \"Ok.\" He conceded. \"But we have to plan carefully first. We...\" Spencer didn't carry on as Fridge appeared in his peripheral vision. He muted some swears. The petite man was already halfway to the pedestal. - \"Fridge!\" he tried to call as low as he could. Clearly, that wasn't loud enough for his friend to hear but the cloud reacted to that. It suddenly agitated and soon it oozed hundreds of dark drops all over the plain. The shadows were quickly forming. - \"Fridge! Shadows!\" Spencer yelled this time. The petite man looked around. - \"There are everywhere! What do I do?\" He screamed. The shadows turned all at once in his direction. \"Oh my god!\" He exclaimed, releasing he just became the canter of all attention. - \"The pedestal! Just touch it!\" Yelled Spencer back. Fridge began to run. Hopefully, as the rest of his skills, the disadvantages of his avatar were not active. Even with shorter legs, the football skills kicked in and he was pretty fast. Spencer and Martha followed. The shadows seemed to ignore the couple as they were still converging toward their friend. It was like they knew he was the one that could really change the course of events. Out of breath, Fridge stopped one foot from the pedestal and stretched his arm. But before he could reach the dark surface, his hand was blocked mild-air by a strong grip. Surprised, he turned round. As if she had just appeared from the nothingness, Bethany was looking back at him with a mixture of determination and anger. Her left eye was totally white. - \"Oh no you won't.\" Growled the evil incarnation. - \"What are you doing? We were about to win!\" Fridge squealed. - \"I won't let you stop me.\" The petite man realised who he was talking to. - \"What are you talking about? What do you want?\" He asked in panic as he could see the shadows still converging towards him. - \"I want to get out...\" - \"I don't know who you are, you inside, but you're stupid. If you really want to get out, you would let us do what we want. Jumanji is a game. If we win, it will let us go. We did it once. Let us purge the cloud.\" The grip tightened around his wrist. He grimaced as it became slightly painful. A sinister smile grew on the evil incarnation lips. He leaned toward the petite man and murmured in his ear: - \"Funny that your friend thought the same. But your victory isn't mine... I am what you call the cloud .\" In a reflex movement, Fridge stretched his free arm in order to touch the pedestal. Immediately, the avatar pulled him back with an unexpected force. The petite man fell flat on his back, a few meters away. The backpack absorbed a bit of the impact, but it cut his airways. When he regained his senses, he felt a strange sensation where Bethany's avatar had touched him. He lifted his arm to take a look at his wrist. Dark tiny square where multiplying on his skin. - \"Spencer!\" he yelled. \"That thing got me! I think it's converting me.\" All the shadows stopped at once. For a moment, Bethany's avatar glitched badly, almost freeze framed. Spencer didn't wait, he ran toward his friend and helped him on his feet, carefully avoiding the contaminated zone. He kept an eye on Bethany who was now waiting near the pedestal with an uncanny stillness. - \"What is it waiting for? What's happening?\" asked Fridge - \"I don't know. She glitched and they all stopped. Maybe she is fighting back and holding them.\" he replied. Then, he grimaced. \"By the way, why on Earth did you go to the pedestal alone.\" - \"I thought you and Martha were going to chat forever and it was just there...\" - \"Are you ok?\" Asked Martha joining them. - \"It's spreading...\" said the petite man, looking back at his arm with concerns. - \"We have to act quick.\" The red-haired girl added, glancing over her shoulder. Spencer look at the same direction. It was too dark to see what was happening above but there was definitely movement on the ground. Somewhere behind the pedestal and Bethany, the light from the roots was wavering as things were slowly sliding over it. The shadows didn't seem to notice their presence anymore. They knew that if it was really Bethany holding them back, they may had not much time. They kept low voice just to avoid triggering the shadows still in their vicinity. - \"If they circle the pedestal, it will be too late. We won't be able to approach.\" Stated Martha. - \"Spencer, if we win, what will happen?\" Asked Fridge, deadly serious. - \"I'm not sure because the game is so corrupted, but I guess it should reset.\" - \"Like the last time, just one of us has to win, right?\" - \"Yeah but none of us should lose.\" Corrected Spencer. \"I don't want any of us to share the fate of Oberon or our any of our avatars. What do you have in mind?\" - \"A Fridge special.\" The black man replied, smirking. ### Fridge had explained his strategy. It was dangerous, as they had just one try. But, they believed in the message of second pedestal: teamwork . If they did it together, they would have a chance. They knew they didn't have the superpowers of their avatars but physically Spencer and Martha were athletic. They counted on that in order to win. Around them, the shadows were randomly wandering. The three teenagers took their position for their final assault. Martha slowly walked backwards as Fridge was moving forwards. The petite man stopped a few meters from the pedestal. Between them, Spencer was observing the shadows, waiting for the good moment to give the \"go\". He was nervous. His friend had given him a really physical task. He knew Bravestone was naturally strong but, as himself, he never brought down anyone, football player style. He tried to focus on his breathing to calm down his racing heart. Suddenly, he saw the opportunity. Without hesitation, he yelled: - \"Now!\" Then, he charged in Bethany's direction. As her avatar was shorter than his he had to bend over to catch her in her mind section. The impact was strong, and she fell heavily on her back. Led by the momentum he fell over her. At the same time, Martha ran towards Fridge who kneeled down and did round back. For a second, the shadows seemed confused as they couldn't decide which one of Martha or Spencer they should go after. But the confusion didn't last. They split in two groups. The first one slid back to the pedestal and formed a quickly growing barrier around it and Bethany. The second one rushed towards Martha, but she was fast enough to outspeed them. - \"What are you doing?\" growled the evil incarnation blocked by Spencer's mass. - \"Winning.\" He replied. In the same time, Martha reached Fridge and used his back as a springboard to do an impressive jump over the dark swarming barrier. The moment, she leaped the chasing shadows covered the petite man. Martha landed precariously near the pedestal. She didn't take the time to recover properly so she literally stumbled onto the dark block. The next second, it began to vibrate. - \"Stupid humans!\" Bethany's evil avatar roared. The shadows that where converging towards the two teenagers overwhelmed them. They were engulfed by the multitude. There was no pain but the scary sensation that their body was slowly disappearing. Then, everything stopped when the heard a huge bang. The energetic blast was the last thing they were aware of.[Chapter 13] Disclaimer : I don't own anything from Jumanji. JohnHammond: Yes explanations on the \"how\" are coming but the group has something to do first :). I won't introduce new characters that I haven't mentioned before. The coming chapters are quite talkative as the characters are slowly figuring out what happened. Reset When Spencer open his eyes, everything was bright. The light from the renewed sun was too intense. It took several seconds for him to adjust his vision. Martha and Fridge were standing next to him, obviously in the same state of confusion he was in. - \"What happened?\" Asked Fridge. - \"I think your plan worked.\" Replied Spencer with a corner smile. \"The pedestal is activated. We are safe.\" They looked around. They still were in the glade but it was not a dark place anymore. Jumanji's jungle was back, lighter and healthier than they've seen it since they were called back by the game. Further, the pedestal was sitting in a green nest of roots and leaves. Next to it was standing Bethany, or at least her avatar. They couldn't tell as she was turning her back on them. Martha initiated a movement in her direction but Spencer stopped her. - \"We don't know, if she is herself.\" He murmured. - \"There is not a million way to find out...\" - \"Martha, I don't want to hurt you, but she was the cloud. That's what she told me.\" Added Fridge in Spencer's defense. The red-haired girl sight in defeat. - \"That was not her.\" - \"They shared the body... What makes you think she is herself now?\" Asked Spencer. \"She is so still...\" He added, looking back at Bethany. - \"The shadows got us and we are still there. The pedestal worked, right? Why wouldn't it work for her?\" tried Martha hesitantly. Fridge looked at his arm; the one that was infected. It seemed untouched and, to his surprise, he found a tattoo on it: three black bars. - \"I think she's right!\" He exclaimed. \"Look, I have my life count back. It's like nothing happened! The game has reset.\" The others checked their arms too and found the same volatile tattoo. That proof was enough for Martha who joyfully called her friend. - \"Hey Bethany! We did it. You're safe, now. We can go home.\" She exclaimed. But as her friend slowly turned round, her alacrity vanished. The evilness seemed to have left her avatar but she seemed far from ok. The exhaustion seemed to burden her. - \"Bethany?\" Asked the red-haired girl worryingly as she slowly approached. - \"She's not there.\" Replied tiredly the avatar with a subtle British accent. - \"Professor Oberon?\" He nodded. The tree teenagers joined him. The cartographer was looking obstinately to the ground. His expression was a mixture of anger and despair. − \"What am I still doing here?\" He finally asked with languishment. They all stayed quiet in front of his resentment. What could they tell him anyway... They had no explanation to the current situation and, even if they empathized with him, they couldn't tell him that they were mainly worried for their friend. Suddenly, Bethany's avatar glitched, but unlike the previous glitches they witnessed it was not a shift between two appearances. It was more like he was shifting to nothingness. − \"God! Why is he still glitching?\" Exclaimed Fridge, pointing at him. − \"Gli...tching...\" Repeated Oberon, deeply frowning and finally looking back at them. − \"Hmm... It's hard to explain...\" Began Spencer, quickly glaring at his friend. \"Mainly because we are not from your time.\" The remark was more for Fridge but the cartographer jumped in. − \"Ancient East gods' reincarnations. Now time travellers. What are you exactly?\" He said dryly. − \"We are not...\" mumbled Spencer. − \"I know... I was kidding.\" The roundish man clarified, as he saw that his interlocutors had missed the irony. \"I was trying to lift my mood. But still. What are you?\" − \"We are just teenagers.\" He replied. Oberon raised an eyebrow. − \"Teenagers, huhu... And what is 'glitching' from 'your' time?\" Clearly, at first, the man wasn't receptive to any kind of explanations, but he patiently listened to them anyway. They began the hard task of explaining him what a video game and virtual worlds were. Then, they tried to relate what happened to Jumanji. Spencer and Martha did the heavy lifting in therms of raw explanations but that was Fridge who ultimately made him understand the concepts with his personal interpretations. Oberon seemed even interested by the footballer's commentaries. − \"So, you are telling me that Jumanji was infected by some kind of illness that machine from your time can catch. Those black things oozing from the sky were the virtual representation of that illness... And... Glichtes are the manifestation of an unstable state due to that illness. Am I right?\" The teenagers looked back at the cartographer with amazement. They truly believed he wouldn't get it all, but he surprisingly nailed it. − \"Wow! The guy is a smart ass.\" exclaimed Fridge, saying out loud what everything thought. Oberon eyed him critically. The black man saw it and quickly added. \"Well, our times are different, man. I can speak my mind freely.\" Obviously, the cartographer had been caught off guard by the remark, but he replied promptly with a mischievous smirk. − \"I think I can adjust to that. If I can manage to be in presence of a half-naked woman, I think can handle your sassiness.\" − \"I like you.\" Said Fridge, smiling. An impressive glitch interrupted their joyful banter and it took a long time for Bethany's avatar to stabilize this time. Even if he wasn't fully aware of it, he understood what just happened by the look on the teenagers faces. − \"I did it again, right?\" − \"Yes... And it was a big one.\" Said Spencer worryingly. \"I would have thought with the reset you would stabilize but it seems that the opposite is happening.\" − \"Why is that?\" − \"Maybe because you shouldn't be conscious at this point.\" Proposed Martha. − \"The game is resetting to his original configuration and you're in an incorrect state.\" Completed her boyfriend like he had a big revelation. Oberon frowned. − \"Don't worry, I don't get it all either.\" Said Fridge to the cartographer, which made him snigger. − \"The reset process is still occurring. The pedestals are cleaning the virus. When it will be done, the game will return to his former stable state in which you are not conscious. Our avatars did it already but they weren't damaged or, at least, not as much as you .\" Spencer stretched his arm to show his life count. \"As you were infected to the core, it may take longer for you.\" The cartographer sighed deeply. − \"What about Bethany?\" worryingly asked Martha. \"You said she was not there. What did you mean?\" Oberon closed his eyes for a brief moment, as he seemed to recollect his memories. − \"She was angry and quite crestfallen when she left you. She blindly went in there.\" The teenagers quickly looked at each other. There was guild in their eyes. \"She was about to activate the pedestal and... nothing. The next thing I remember is you talking to me.\" He opened his eyes. \"I just don't feel her presence. Maybe she is still in there... dormant.\" The professor was obviously not at ease. Speaking of oneself like being a simple vehicle for another wasn't pleasant, but he tried to reassure them. − \"So, what do we do now?\" asked Fridge. − \"The pedestal!\" Exclaimed Spencer. \"It gave us advices. Maybe there is some clue on this one too.\" He turned toward Oberon. \"Bethany guessed that she could decipher the glyphs because of you could. What does it say?\" The roundish man looked back at the strange letters on the pedestal. − \"I don't know this language, but yes, curiously, I can read it. It says: kernel .\" − \"If we consider Jumanji a video game, the kernel surely means where is coded the operating system.\" Proposed Martha. − \"Yes! Good deduction!\" Complimented Spencer. The two teenagers began a technical conversation that left Oberon and Fridge aside. They looked at each other with the same expression: a profound lack of understanding. - \"Does it happen often?\" Asked the professor to the petite man. - \"Since they are in couple, quite often unfortunately.\" He sighed. \"Excuse-me!\" He interjected, as he knew the conversation would take forever if he didn't stop it. \"Could you share with us?\" - \"Oh sorry!\" Said Spencer. \"We think that Jumanji want us to find his kernel. Maybe there is something more we should do in order to complete the reset process.\" - \"And where is that?\" - \"I don't know, but it may be hidden or unrecognisable, like protected files on a computer. Most of the time, the interface is user friendly but hides the internal machinery which could seem alien for those who don't speak its language.\" Oberon grimaced as it was again gibberish to him. \"I mean... The kernel is the heart of Jumanji. This could be just a strange place in Jumanji we didn't explore. But, the game has no reason to expose its heart. It's surely hidden and protected.\" Tried Spencer in a more metaphoric way. - \"So, how do we find it?\" Insisted Fridge. - \"It's hard to tell. I have no idea of what we have to look for. I mean if the thing is hidden, we have just a tiny chance to find it just on luck. We have to know exactly what we are looking for.\" They stayed quiet for a long time as the task seemed too hard to achieve. Oberon was especially very pensive. He was fixing the pedestal. Spencer observed him. The cartographer was a curious man too him. He had a strong will and a sharp mind. The state he was in was not covetable by any means and anyone in his position would have tried to find a way to live but his expression was clearly showing darker lines of thoughts. Spencer joined him. − \"Are you ok?\" The man jumped, as he was dragged out of his thoughts. − \"Yeah... I was just thinking about what you said about those machines; the video games things.\" − \"You had quite a hard introduction on that. I'm sorry.\" joked Spencer, but the professor didn't even smile. He was too focused. − \"Why can I read this?\" He asked, pointing at the pedestal. − \"I don't know. Are you sure it's not some old languages you learned?\" Intrigued by the conversation, Martha and Fridge joined them too. − \"Yes, I am certain. I know how to read this instinctively, like everybody knows how to breathe without thinking about it... It's so disturbing for me to say this but... what if I'm a part of the machine?\" Spencer eyes widened. − \"You could speak its language.\" He completed. − \"And see things that shouldn't be seen...\" Added the professor. − \"You know where the kernel is?\" − \"Maybe... You said the kernel could be a strange place. I know a very peculiar place in Jumanji.\" − \"The mechanical city.\" Said Martha. \"Boys, remember! Bethany told us that she used to scavange stuff there for her hiding place.\" Spencer nodded. Fridge was a bit lost. \"And you, you said that you regained consciousness there too.\" She quickly added, speaking to Oberon. − \"Exactly...\" − \"So, you know how to go there?\" Asked the black man. − \"Like I know how to read those glyphs.\" Oberon smirked. There is one more chapter before the two endings : a good one and a bad one. Like in video games ;). See you next Friday![Chapter 14] Disclaimer : I don't own anything from Jumanji. Note: (For those who are interested...) Now that there is almost no spoiler to fear any more, with each chapter I'll leave notes to give as much informations as possible on the story. Because, once I'll mark this as complete, I won't come back to add comments for those I can't answer by PM. So, be prepared for the big endings notes :). Anyway... Here we are. The mechanical city is straight ahead and the answers are there too. Warning : it's a bit dark... Enjoy! The mechanical city Oberon was leading the group through the thick jungle of Jumanji which seemed almost restored to its former splendour. From time to time they still could see some trees with dark marks but as they were progressing the traces of the corruption were fading. The professor seemed to know every hidden path and didn't hesitate one second on the directions to take. Fridge, who seemed to have found in the roundish man a new friend, was walking next to him. Sometimes, the cartographer was glitching badly, but it didn't seem to affect him much. Martha and Spencer were a few feet behind, just enough to enjoy some privacy. − \"Do you think we could save Bethany?\" Asked the red-haired girl, low voice. − \"I really hope so.\" He glanced at her. His girlfriend seemed bothered. \"You still feel guilty?\" − \"Yeah...\" She confessed. \"Earlier, she opened to me about her fears and I didn't support her.\" − \"We were terrified. There was no way we could have reacted in brave heroes at that very moment. And from all of us, you where the bravest. I'm glad you pushed us to move forward. We couldn't do it without you.\" Martha blushed. − \"I could kiss you, right now. But that's for my geek hero only.\" Spencer smiled. Soon they arrived at a very well known place. Around them, half hidden by the vegetation, were some big animal statues and a path drawn by two lines of braseros. Far away, they could see the giant jaguar statue overhanging the land. Its one eye was shining so bright that even in the full light of the day they could see it. − \"Here we are.\" Declared the cartographer. − \"So, that's the jaguar again.\" Said Martha. \"In a sense, we could have guessed it. After all, it's the heart of Jumanji.\" − \"Indeed, but we couldn't have gotten too it without the help of professor Oberon.\" − \"Wait a minute. You said it would be some unusual place in Jumanji. I don't see anything strange here.\" Demurred Fridge. − \"What are you talking about? There is no place stranger than this one.\" They all looked back at Oberon in confusion. \"This is the mechanical city.\" He began to describe what they couldn't see: big columns of polish dark steel, green electricity running randomly on it and forming arcs between them. For him this place was still plunged in darkness, even if he could perfectly see and where they saw the jaguar statue, he could only see the light it was emitting. − \"Why don't we see the same thing?\" asked Fridge. − \"He is part of the game. He can read its language. He can see its kernel.\" Suddenly, Oberon glitched so bad that for a moment he almost totally disappeared. This time, he seemed to be aware of it. His expression darkened as he intrinsically understood what it meant for him. − \"I'm not sure how long I will continue to exist. I'm pretty sure I don't have much time left. But we may still can do something for you friend that is trapped inside me. No-one should be sacrificed to oblivious... less a young. Let's hurry up.\" He proposed. − \"I'm sorry that you are ...\" Began Spencer. − \"This is not your fault.\" interrupted the cartographer. \"That's that crazy game's fault.\" He said with a tiny smile. Then, he sighed deeply. \"What I am now may be just an artificial reconstitution of what I was, but it seems real to me. I feel real.\" Then, he looked at them with a certain intensity and an unexpected lack of assurance. \"You seem to know a lot of things about the strange reality. I have questions I want to ask before it's too late.\" He seemed to search the courage for a few seconds and then just let it go. \"Is there heaven for those who died like me? Like echoes in a machine? Are my final acts as this ghost of myself count in this unreal world in the judgement balance? Would my soul reach the heaven if this me does something good? It may sound selfish, but... I need something to hold onto... Even if it's a lie.\" A heavy silence followed the cartographer's monologue. It tore them apart. Martha lowered her head to hide the tears that were menacing to form at her eyes. Fridge turned slightly away too. Spencer, throat tight, was the only one able to reply. − \"I'm sure you would...\" − \"Thank you... \" Oberon smiled and cleared his throat before continuing with a more steady voice. \"We have not time to waste any more. Let's save your friend. That will be my final human act.\" Heavy hearted, the group silently moved forward. ### It seemed to take forever to reach the foot of the jaguar statue. Last time, they had to run and fight their way through it and the life-threatening menace made the time pass faster. Now, it was just a boring and long tortuous path. They didn't have the opportunity to slack off, though. Their progression was quite a nervous wreck as there were slowly racing against time. The stake was the life of their friend trapped in the defective body of their guide. The glitches he was victim of were now rarer but worryingly stronger. Sometimes, he would almost disappear. It was like looking at a blinking neon, knowing that at some point it would definitely break. And they couldn't go much faster as the men was quite exhausted. The professor was trying to keep it together as the horrifying process occurred. The rest of the times, he would just talk to distract himself. Fridge, whom was still walking ahead with him, seemed to have a calming effect on him. Most of the time, they were joking all along. It helped the man not to think about his precarious condition. From time to time, Oberon would describe some changes on the scenery that they couldn't observe. As they progressed, more artificial structures were emerging from the ground. For the cartographer it was just nonsense machinery steaming randomly and linked by numerous cables. As they came closer, traces of the corruption were visible at some places. Some trees were still completely black or small patches of dark mist was floating just above the soil. They were quieter when passing nearby. They wouldn't risk triggering it by making too much noise. They finally arrived at the bottom of the jaguar statue. It was almost like they remember it was, except it had a large dark patch on its base that was slowly resorbing. − \"What does it look like for you?\" asked Spencer to their guide. − \"I don't know. I have never seen anything like that before.\" He replied. \"This is an insane construction. There are cables running down it surface like wines. It's a tangle of crooked pipes.\" He squinted eyes and approached the base where, for them, the dark patch lied. \"There is a strange and large device here.\" He said, touching the dark surface. Vaporous glyphs appeared and slowly formed letters. It wrote a word vertically. − \"7um4n71\" read Spencer out loud. \"It looks like it's the same mark that we saw on a tree when we arrived here.\" He added. − \"Could it be the same place?\" asked the petite man confused. − \"Could be, yes. I mean, Jumanji was upside down. The directions meant nothing.\" He touched in turn the dark patch. The mark didn't react at all. \"Oh, I see!\" He exclaimed suddenly. Fridge elbowed Oberon: − \"Gibberish storm coming full force...\" he murmured with a mischievous smile. The cartographer giggled. − \"Remember when I touched it last time?\" he asked to his friends. \"It was dispersing in tiny black cubes and it reverted. It was like a localized version of the cloud except it was still consistent. Like it was trying to keep its shape. I think Jumanji's heart was beginning to be converted when we arrived, and it was still fighting it, trying to save its integrity. It materialised us in the safest place still under its control.\" − \"I got half of it, and you?\" whispered Oberon to Fridge, smirking. The black man shrugged. − \"Please follow me on this.\" Said Spencer, ignoring the two men joking. \"I think I figured it all.\" He was clearly excited and began to speak with enthusiasm. \"Imagine the virus that attacked Jumanji as a virus that attacks a human body. It infects small parts first using the cells of its victim to grow and multiple. That was the cloud... If a body already knows the virus, it can counter it and destroy it before the damages are too big. But if it doesn't, the virus will ultimately kill its host. The only way that he can continue to exist is if it finds a way to spread.\" − \"The thing inside Oberon. It wanted to get out. It said it was the cloud.\" Told Fridge, remembering the terrifying encounter. − \"It said it was from our world too...\" Added Martha. \"Could it be the virus?\" The cartographer didn't say a word but he was listening attentively. − \"This is where I want to go.\" Said Spencer, happy that his friends were joining his line of thoughts. \"Jumanji transformed from a board game, like Alex or the professor here knew, to a video game. When we entered in it was an old school game for us because time had passed. We physically crushed the console and the cartridge, but it seems that we didn't it completely destroy it, so it was able to evolve once again. Nowadays, most of the games are connected to internet, but for a program, it could be a dangerous place to be if you have no protection.\" − \"A newly transformed Jumanji infected by a strong internet virus. That's what you are talking about?\" asked Martha. − \"Yes.\" confirmed Spencer. \"There were those news on TV, repeating that a virus was infecting computers, phones and so at Brantford. Remember?\" The teenagers nodded. \"Maybe if affected Jumanji too and it was unable to fight the virus because it was the first time it encountered such a thing and it didn't have to proper protection. That's why it called us back. To help it.\" − \"But we didn't have the cure. And why Bethany first?\" − \"A body can make its own cure. That's principle of vaccines. But if it's too weak to fight, it's useless. Maybe it had found the counter agent - the pedestals - but was too weak to activate it. It needed somebody else to do it for it. And for Bethany, it may have been the first try. She activated the first pedestal and as she got infected herself it called us too to finish the job. That's my theory. That's all I've got.\" He concluded. Oberon frowned. − \"I think I understood what you said. Well most of it... But there is something I am not sure about.\" − \"What it is?\" − \"The fact that we were infected 'after' activating the first pedestal... The thing was inside of us all the time, as much as I am aware of.\" − \"Your program was maybe already corrupted when it called her back.\" The cartographer grimaced but he didn't take outrage. − \"I don't get it then. Why and how did we survive all this time without the vaccine like you said? If we were just a tiny part of Jumanji and the whole thing was falling apart, how could we find the strength to resist?\" − \"For what you showed us, I can tell you are a tough man, professor.\" Said Martha. \"And the Bethany I know has a strong will too. Maybe that thing couldn't match your two fighting souls...\" − \"I'm not real...\" stated Oberon coldly, just before glitching badly, as to illustrated what he was saying. It took some time for him to stabilize again. The experience seemed to have shaken him pretty badly. He took a few steps and found a rock to sit on. − \"I'm not sure I can hold it together much longer. How do we save your friend? How do we get her out of me before it's too late?\" − \"We don't have any instructions. Normally, we won the game. We should be able to return our place and time. Last time, that's what happened.\" − \"Guys, the writing has changed.\" Interrupted Fridge. They all looked at the dark patch on the base of the statue. − \" Those who win will find their way, those who loose will stay to play. \" − \"But we all won! We saved Jumanji! We saved you!\" shouted Spencer at the statue as if it could hear him. The writing slowly morphed into another sentence. − \" Can be saved those who live. The corrupted ones we cannot retrieve. \" − \"What stupid game are you? What game could put innocent people at risk like that? What's the purpose?\" asked Martha angrily. − \" To live, to grow and die. Life is the same. Everyone plays. That is the game. \" − \"What?!\" Exclaimed Fridge, outraged. − \"That not fair!\" Cried Martha. \"She helped you... Oberon helped you... They do not deserve what you're doing to them!\" Letters vanished one more time to form new words, but it was just glyphs. They all looked at the professor who was the only one who could read it. His sad expression was familiar. A little bit softer. − \"Don't leave me here.\" He pleaded in a more high-pitched voice. − \"Bethany!\" Exclaimed Martha as she recognized her tone. She ran toward her and hugged her. − \"I'm scared...\" She wailed in her arms. The boys joined her quickly. − \"We cannot let you here.\" Said Spencer, resolute, but he had no idea how to stick to his own words. − \"But it won't let me go.\" She said looking back at the letters on the rock. − \"What does it say?\" − \" The vessel is not the one you think. If released, the world you know would sink. \" The last patch of darkness was rapidly reducing now. Then, there was a flash and they were all suddenly experiencing the same fogy flashbacks. They witnessed Jumanji raising from the destroyed carcase of the console they had smashed and mutating into a more abstract form. They saw its wild journey through bits and octets, adjusting to its new environment. It was scary to see how quick the game adapted to its new dematerialized form, absorbing internet knowledge, connecting with social medias, investing phones and computers, searching for victims to trap. In a matter of days, its net had grown large and was covering a big part of Brantford's network. Unfortunately, that's when it was infected by the virus. The contagion was fast and strong. The system was slowly crashing. The virus progressively merged with it, infesting the same parts of Brantford network which the game connected with. The flashback became disjointed as Jumanji wrestled with the electronic invader, but they could witness the strange mutation of the virus. Like the support it grew on, it became highly adaptable till it gained a will of its own. It wasn't clear if it was just emulating a persona from already integrated characters of the game or really became conscious, but it surely wanted to escape, because as, it couldn't pass its basic programming, it knew it would inevitably destroy its host. The virus searched inside Jumanji a way out and it found it in the materialisation process. The next thing it needed was a body to jump into. It investigated the badly damaged memory banks of the game to find hosts that had already been absorbed. The last victims of Jumanji were the perfect targets. So, it scanned the net searching for the four teenagers that last played. It had no difficulty to find them and infiltrated their phones and computers. Because of her intensive use of social media – even if it was far from what it used to be - Bethany became unfortunately the preferred target. She was connected long enough for the virus to observe and adapt to her. And, one day, it jumped in... The next fragmented memories switched on Bethany's point of view, as the virus had invested her mind. As long as she was awakened, it had almost no control on her, but in her sleep, the virus was quite active and was planning the next steps. In between days of school memories, Spencer recognized the strange encounter he has with her the day he made peace with Martha. For a brief moment, when she touched him, the point of view switched on him. He understood that the virus tried to jump on him too but that didn't work as expected. The last memories were merely just fixed images. They briefly saw Bethany's trek and the last night under the tent. Jumanji called her back, but the reintegration turned wrong as the game was already badly damaged. − \"She is the host not Oberon...\" concluded Spencer in a shocked whisper as the last images vanished. − \"Don't leave me...\" Bethany said with a tremor in her voice. \"I don't want to be there. I don't belong.\" Finally, the dark patch on the stone disappeared. The light from the jaguar's eye was suddenly stronger. The green glow was pulsating in an accelerating rhythm. Jumanji was restored. Bethany's avatar glichted one last time before disappearing before their very eyes. Martha had clenched on her till the last second but soon her hands were just holding thin air. − \"No!\" They screamed in unison. Then, they heard it. The drums... It seemed to come from the ground itself. It sounded like a death sentence beat. Spencer looked at Martha who was openly crying now. His girlfriend was turning into vapour and slowly being absorbed by the eye. The same thing happened to Fridge who disappeared without a chance to say a word. Spencer looked at his hands. He was dematerialising too. − \"I'm sure you can save her!\" He screamed to the statue. \"I'm begging you!\" The last thing he saw was a flash of light and disappeared too. Authors notes: I took a very long time on the exposition on this story, but the first chapters have clues of what's going on and what's going to happen. And I can tell you, I found this exercise quite hard to do for my first multi-chapters story in English :D. It took 6-7 months to write but I loved doing it! Here are some guides: - The avatar research at the beginning is key for the story after. - Bethany possessed during the night. - The glitches behaviour on Spencer's phone and computer, and the use of sounds. - Spencer's mother talking about the virus. - Communication issues (see after). - Bethany freeze framed in the avatar. - The colours in Bethany's lair (see after) The misleading: - The glitches and the drums : I use them to initially correlate the glitches with Jumanji. As the virus merged with the game, at first, it looked like that Jumanji was the virus. - Van Pelt characteristics on Bethany's avatar. The cloud/virus The pivotal point of the story was the virus that infected Jumanji. Its purpose is just what it is programmed to do : collect data, convert the host (encryption) and spread. The fact that Jumanji is a conscious entity made it evolve but it couldn't go over its own programming. Hence the damage it was doing to the game would ultimately be fatal and the virus would have died too in the process. That's why it needed desperately new hosts. Corrupted Bethany: It was pretty obvious, early on, that Bethany was in trouble but I wanted to distil the fact she was the vessel of the virus. - The colours. Blue was for the virus and green for Jumanji. That, I think, was quite clear :D. But I tried to induce that the virus was inside Bethany with those colours. She made herself comfortable in her lair with deactivated pieces of corrupted kernel (the blue braseros especially). In fact, she was lead by the virus trying to corrupt the pedestal she had activated from underneath but I didn't develop the subject afterwards. - The time. For Bethany time passed longer. She lived a computer time period. As computer go faster than human brain she did a lot of things in a short among to time. - The electric touch Spencer experienced was in fact the virus trying to jump onto him. It failed but left some side effects (I'll tell you more in the endings ^^). - Also Bethany decline from activating the pedestals. She grow exhausted. Her avatar is badly damaged and corrupted. So, as each pedestal activated destroy the virus, the shell becomes more and more unstable and fragile. The only thing that hold it together in the end is Oberon's will... Communication issues: It was a subliminal intention from me :D. I wanted to induce that the process of understanding would be compromised for all the characters at some point. First, its Spencer and Martha for human reasons. Then, the technical issues in Brantford due to the virus (original). Then, the glyphs that couldn't be read. Then, the misunderstanding of Bethany's intentions by the teenagers. And finally, Jumanji's intentions. (more to come after the endings ^^) For me, Jumanji communicated its intentions through the narrative process of the game (the riddles, the environment, the quest, the pnj...). As it was scrambled by the virus it was unable to do it clearly this time. The only things it had control over was the graphic representation of the environment and it glitched badly so the protagonists had to decipher everything - as for you dear readers :D. Jumanji: I don't know the book(s), so I don't know how Jumanji is \"personified\" in it but my personal interpretation from the movies is that the game is an entity neither good or evil. But what happens inside can be terribly amoral. That's why I chose to display what could be so wrong to be in one other's body. So, I raised the voice of Oberon for that. Where the movie made fun of it, I took the serious tone about it :). Next week preview :) Ok, as we're at the end now, next week, I'll post the two endings. - The bad ending is the real one and it's really not a fun one. I think you can already guess what's going to happen... - The good ending is lighter and has a very light touch of Alex/Bethany. I can't help... I love them too much :-]. So yeah, this is where Alex come back. Have a nice day and see you soon![Chapter 15] Disclaimer : I don't own anything from Jumanji. I discovered that Jumamji is actually an illustrated book of 32 pages -_-. Maybe, it's really atmospheric but well... I thought it was a kind of fantastic story for kids like Bridge to Terabithia... ** sigh ** I guess that settles it for my discovery of the original material haha. I'll stick to the movies ;D. JohnHammond : Because we are bad persons :). Joke aside, that's a good question. In my case, my answer would be : the real ending is where the message of the story lies. Here, it happens to be in the dark side of my story. To be honest, that's because I wrote this story at a dark time in my personal life and the story itself reflects some parts of the things that I was wrestling with. I chose to write a angst/drama thing of a comedy movie so... yeah I had a lot of 'fun' in this early 2018 :D. But ultimately, I'm an optimist person, and after writing this bad ending I felt the necessity to write something lighter, that's why the good ending exists. Lucky you :). Well, that said, here is the first ending. Rewritten When Spencer woke up, he felt a little bit off. He wasn't fully aware of his surrounding as he felt like he was still one foot in his dream. There was an annoying repetitive sound coming from his bed table. By rote, he smashed a hand on his alarm clock but, as the sound persisted, he was forced to open his eyes to address the problem. His phone was flashing intermittently at the rhythm of a strange muffled drum beat. Spencer sat up and took the device. The light and the drums stopped at once. The screen glitched before turning black. The teenager started it again. Everything seemed fine, except one thing. The date. It was one week after the last thing he remembered. He jumped in surprise as his bedroom door opened suddenly. His mum was in the frame, worryingly looking at him. - \"I heard some noise. I guessed you had woke up.\" She said with a soft voice and a shy smile. - \"Huhu... I'm just a bit confused. Is my phone malfunctioning? The date seems wrong.\" His mother approached and sat on the bed next to him. - \"It's alright. They said you would be quite disoriented the first days.\" Spencer frowned. - \"What? They? Who?\" - \"Don't get upset, honey. You and your friends had a traumatic experience. The doctors said you are fine, but your memory can be a little bit fuzzy. It will pass.\" - \"Traumatic...\" - \"Please take your time. Don't try to rush it.\" Nothing of what his mother just said made sense to him, but he tried to keep a neutral expression. She seemed genuinely worry about him and he didn't want to accentuate this feeling. - \"I just don't get it.\" He said with a composed voice. \"What happened?\" His mother hesitated for a moment but as he seemed perfectly calm she opened up. - \"You and your friends Martha and Fridge had... disappeared last week during a pick nick.\" She was obviously searching for the good words. Spencer didn't interrupt her. \"Two days ago, you were found unconscious in an alley behind your school.\" She waited for his reaction, but he just looked back at her with incomprehension. \"The doctors said your all perfectly fine though.\" She repeated. To him, it looked more like she was trying to persuade herself. - \"Why don't I remember anything of the path few days?\" He tried. - \"Whatever happened to you is memory locked, they said. It happens sometimes with traumatic events. Your memory would eventually come back later.\" - \"Even yesterday? This makes no sense.\" - \"I don't know, sweetheart. You were pretty groggy. Maybe it'll come back later. Give yourself time to recover.\" She had tears in her eyes. \"I'm just glad you are here. I can't imagine losing you, like...\" She didn't finish her sentence. She hugged him with all the strength and love of a mother who had almost lost her child. When they separated, she was smiling but looked still a little bit emotional. - \"I'm going to prepare breakfast, ok?\" - \"Sure.\" He replied. Spencer watched in disbelief his mother getting out of the room backwards, like he would disappear if she didn't look. After she left, he quickly grabbed his phone and texted Martha \"Are you ok?\". He didn't have to wait too long for an answer. She called him back. - \"Yes, I am and you?\" She was whispering. - \"Yes, I think so. Why do you talk like that?\" - \"My parents are on my back. I don't want them to hear me.\" - \"What happened? My mother said that we disappeared. Do you remember anything?\" - \"No... I just remember the pick nick and then blackout. I asked my parents, but they didn't say much...\" - \"Same here...\" I marked a short pause. \"Anyway, I'm glad you're ok.\" - \"Me too...\" - \"I have to go. I'll try Fridge and Bethany. Maybe they know something.\" - \"Bethany? Bethany Walker?\" - \"Yes, the one and only. She must be back from her trip in the mountains by now.\" He replied. \"My mum said that they found just the three of us, so that means she wasn't with us when 'the something we don't remember' happened. Maybe she can tell us something that our parents don't want to speak about.\" - \"Spencer... Since when do you have her phone number? And since when do you know where she is?\" - \"Since Jumanji of course. You have her phone number too. You two have become friends.\" - \"Well, whether you remember more than I do, whether you are more confused than I am, but either ways I'm not friend with miss Instagram.\" She replied a bit dryly. \"Sorry, I must go now.\" She added quickly. \"I hear my mum coming.\" She hung up, leaving him more confused than ever. He didn't wait a second and phoned Fridge. Unfortunately, it didn't help much, except to know that his friend was good too. He had quite the same strange conversation he experienced with his girlfriend. - \"Man, I don't know what happened to us, but definitely you had a bonus on the side effects.\" Said the footballer after Spencer told him about Bethany. - \"Do you remember Jumanji?\" - \"Sure, I do.\" - \"She was there with us. She ended in Oberon's body... The cartographer.\" As there was no response from his friend, he tried to give more details. \"She was eaten by a hippo at the beginning. Does it ring any bells? - \"I'm sorry Spencer but I don't remember the same things as you.\" - \"This can't be... I mean you even teach her how to pee in a man's body. You were embarrassed as hell. How can't you remember that.\" - \"Hey, would you calm down please? What you are telling me is even crazier than the fact that you would become friend with her.\" - \"That's absurd. She was there. We couldn't have finish the game without her. Alex wouldn't be alive if she hadn't been there. Why am I the only one to remember that?\" - \"I don't know man, but take it easy, would you? You seem on the verge of a nervous break.\" Spencer wasn't keen to pursue the conversation as he was know quite upset and worried about these mysterious memory losses. He shortened his call and quickly looked at his contact list. His blood turned cold as he discovered that Bethany wasn't registered. - \"No, no, no...\" he mumbled. \"I'm not crazy.\" He searched in his messages any traces of conversation he could have had with her. Nothing... But then he found a couple of messages from a strange sender id: 7um4n71. The first one was strange verses that remind him of Jumanji riddles and the second one just said, \"help me\" . Suddenly, he remembered something. It was just like a flash, but he saw Bethany touching his face and felt like an electric surge. The sensation vanished as quickly as it appeared. The next second, his phone vibrated. It was a text from 7um4n71. \"Thanks for trying. Don't forget me.\" A sneaky feeling of dread was slowly growing in him. With trembling fingers, he replied. - \"Bethany, is that you?\" - \"Was.\" Came almost immediately the answer. - \"What happened? Where are you?\" He waited but there was nothing more. With apprehension he searched Bethany Walker on the internet. He found several articles about her recent disappearance in the north mountains. He read them all in almost a morbid interest. They were all telling the same story. The girl was trekking in the wild and she had vanished. Her materiel was found in a small glade, untouched even by animals. The searching dogs didn't find her scent anywhere around, nor near the village she had an anchor with. The kidnapping theory was preferred by the authorities even if there was no evidence. - \"Spencer?\" He jumped as his mother called him from the frame of the door. \"Are you ok?\" She asked when she saw his expression. - \"Bethany Walker. The news says she had disappeared too...\" he replied, showing his phone. - \"Yes, poor girl...\" - \"When?\" - \"Last week. Before you were missing. Trekking alone in the wild like that... That was unwise at her age.\" - \"She was resourceful.\" As he said that, he had like a resurgence of foggy memories of Bethany as Oberon talking around a strange table made of metal pieces. Then, he had very dense flashbacks and he felt sick. There was too much information at the same time. He didn't get it all, but he remembered clearly that it has something to do with Jumanji and something even darker. His mother took his brief uneasiness for something else and looked at him with sympathy. She sat next to him. - \"I didn't know you knew her that well. I thought she was not the kind of person you like to spend time with.\" Spencer felt heavy heart. Except for his new relation with Martha and Fridge, he hadn't tell his mother much about Bethany after they first came out of Jumanji, as his girlfriend was the one spending the most time with her. No-one except him seemed to acknowledge the fact that she was once part of their group. - \"She was... \" He looked back at his phone with a sadly. Before, he could continue, his mother put a gentle but firm hand on his, hiding the screen. - \"Your memories are fragile. You shouldn't look at all those things right now. It could just confuse you more...\" She took the phone and put it on his desk. Then, she stood up and moved toward the door. \"Breakfast is ready.\" She added softly when she reached it. - \"I'm coming in a minute.\" He replied by rote. His mother left the room. Spencer got up and followed her suit. Just as he reached the door, he looked back at his phone lying on his desk and spoke to it like it would hear. - \"I won't forget you. Whatever happened to us ALL I would find out. I would remember. I won't let you become one of those anonymous disappearance. I promise.\" He left too, joining his mother in the kitchen. As soon as the room was empty, the phone lighted up and glowed green. The texts conversation with 7um4n71 displayed on the screen. The next second, the messages were deleted. With them were erased the last remnants of the virus that infected Jumanji... and the last link Bethany had with this world. ### Somewhere on the sand of an unknown beach, Jumanji materialized. The board game was identical at what it had always been, except for a tiny invisible part of it. The virus had been defeated but it had left something behind that the game couldn't erase: unlike all those who lost the game before, in his belly, a soul refused to vanish and was fighting oblivion. Suddenly, its two-parted top broke open like something was trying to escape from the inside. For a moment, nothing happened, but then the drums resonated and on its central dark oculus, green vapour shaped letters appeared. It slowly formed sentences that no eye would witness but that the lost soul would hear. With no malevolence but the cruelty of an inhuman and insensitive mind, as always, it spoke in rhymes. Time will tame your temper. In the end, no-one will remember. Like breath on a mirror or waves on the shore, memories fade, and history alters. The boy will forget like the others. Don't listen to his futile promise and accept your own demise. The game knew it had won as the crushed soul came silent in its entrails. The drums raged once more, and the two-parted top closed itself shut in a loud and dry clack. Then, the beat stopped. Under the sun of the unknown place, Jumanji would wait for a new curious person to come. It would play with them the game of life, as traitorous and wild as reality could be. THE END ** Hide behind my desk ** Yes, I killed off Bethany... I guess the next question would be, WHY? The answer is : bad luck for her lol. From the characterisation, she was the perfect victim for the virus, hence for this ending, she is the one who disappears. To be honest, after I wrote the good ending, I hesitated a long time to post the bad one, cause I had the feeling that it was too harsh. But well, that's where I was going all along, so I assume it. Authors notes: - I used Jumanji as a mirror of life. That's a 'game' that plays you and challenges you. You don't know the rules in advance and sometimes you have to fight your way through. That's what meant the last exchange between Jumanji and the teenagers before they were sent back in the real world. - The defense mechanism the teenagers activated (the pedestals) are a sort of antivirus. It restored the corrupted data and destroyed the virus present in the programs. In this ending, if the vessel would have been Oberon, Jumanji would have let Bethany go. Oberon would just have reset as a playable character. But, as she is the vessel, there is a risk some part of the virus would survive in her. If it released her, the virus could spread into the real world. So Jumanji chose to absorb Bethany, like the one who usually looses the game. This way she becomes a program it can control. So, in a way, even if the actions of Jumanji are cruel to Bethany, it saved the world. - Normally, Jumanji would have released the teenagers the moment they entered but, in this ending, I consider the fact that the cleaning process of the game took a long time. So that's why there are release few days after. - I'm not sure I was successful on this path but I tried to connect the grieving process and the 'acceptance' (I don't find a better word, sorry) of death to the story. Oberon has the terrible experience to live his death twice. His fate is really horrible... Bethany fights her own death too and the moment she lost hope, she died. Jumanji rewrote the memories of Bethany in the teenagers' mind to ease the pain of the loss for them. It didn't quite work for Spencer due to the virus touch on him (that was the residual side effect of the virus on him), so he is the only one that will go through the path of grieving. In my point of view, those who won't remember are those who are to pity, 'cause even if memories hurt at first, by the time we are in peace with our pain, we can cherish those memories and keep those who died a little bit alive in our heart. For those who forgets, there is just emptiness. Now, you can decide if Spencer will keep his promise to Bethany or if the game was right... So, even if cruel, I hope you liked this ending :). Turn the page for the good and lighter ending![Chapter 16] Disclaimer : I don't own anything from Jumanji. First of all, thanks to those who read and commented. Special thanks to JohnHammond ^^. Here is the happy ending! Enjoy! Restored When Spencer first opened his eyes, the world was a blur mass of spinning colours. It was like watching the landscape through a train window but so much faster. He could get a fixed point to look. He had to create one. So he moved his hands in front of him to block the dizzy vertigo . He looked in disbelief the strong hands of Bravestone slowly disappearing in a myriad of tiny squares to reveal his own frame underneath. The vision was uncanny but he didn't feel bad. In a blink of an eye, everything changed around him. He found himself looking at his phone. There was the message from 7um4n71 - or Bethany - they all received before getting sucked into the game. Help me! Spencer lifted his head. Martha and Fridge were there, looking at their phone. He called them but they didn't move. He realised then that there was no sound, no wind. He looked around and saw that they were indeed in the park and that everything was freeze framed. It was like the time had paused. Then, a shredding sound tore the silence apart. People around them began to move slowly first but backwards. Spencer understood quickly that the time was reversing. Things began to move faster and faster till he couldn't see. He felt nauseous as the world was spinning again. He closed briefly his eyes and when he opened them again, he was in his room. His phone was still in his hand but the screen was black. He took a few seconds to reconnect with reality. Had Jumanji send them back to the past? He activated his phone to see the date. It was Saturday noon: the day before they went to the pick-nick. He frowned. How could it be? He was about to phone Martha when he heard to front door bell ringing. Few seconds later, two feminine voices were chatting downstairs. Then, there were heavy steps on the stairs as someone was running up. His bedroom door opened on his frightened girlfriend. − \"Tell me this was not real!\" she said out of breath. − \"We were back in the game...\" he said. − \"Oh god!\" she wailed. \"Bethany...\" she let herself fall onto the next chair. − \"This can't be... We were sucked in later. Why are we there now?\" − \"I don't know.\" Spencer was trying to think fast but it was hard to recollect all that happened. There was too much information to proceed. - \"How did you come here so fast?\" he suddenly asked. - \"I materialized near your house.\" replied the red-haired girl still partially in shock. - \"Were you supposed to be there?\" - \"No, but it was not far from where I remember I was at that time.\" Spencer jumped as his phone rang. Fridge was calling. − \"Are you ok? Good... Martha is with me... No just the two of us...\" He put on the speakers, so Martha could join the conversation. − \"Is Bethany with you?\" She asked. − \"No...\" came the muffled response from the device. − \"We're one day before our jump. So, if the game has released her, she must be somewhere in the mountains.\" Martha took her phone and tried to dial her friend. No response. She looked worryingly at Spencer who was nervously passing his hand in his air. − \"I think I remember she said she had bad reception when she replied to my invitation for the pick nick. Did it ring?\" − \"Yes, but she didn't answer.\" − \"We have to find her.\" Said Fridge through the telephone. − \"Right but how? Asked the red-haired girl. Spencer was pacing back and fork in the room. What could they do? They weren't even sure that Bethany had come back with them. She just had disappeared in front of them. − \"Guys are you still there?\" asked Fridge as no-one said a word for a while. − \"Yeah... I just try to find a solution. I mean we can just count on ourselves for this. Nobody would believe us if we told the truth.\" He sighed. − \"Alex would believe.\" Said Martha. − \"I don't want to deceive you but we don't know where he lives. Is he even in Brantford?\" argued Fridge. − \"I have his email. It's worth trying.\" Said Spencer rushing toward his computer. \"I call you back, or if you want you can join us to my mom's house.\" − \"On my way.\" just replied the footballer before hanging up. Spencer made the message short for Alex, escaping the details but emphazing the urgency of the situation. The word Jumanji alone was a sufficient threat. ### Fridge made it to the house before they got any reply. The teenagers exchanged about their experience of the last hours. It appeared quickly that, from the group, Spencer was the only one that was aware during the rematerialisation process but they couldn't find any reason why it happened that way. After a few moments, they were just waited nervously the reply of Alex or Bethany whose Martha was trying to reach regularly. Finally, one hour later, the notification came and they were all relieved to read the quick message. \"I'm on my way. I'm picking you up at my father's house. 20Min.\" They all packed up in a rush and ran through Brantford to the rendezvous point. Soon after they arrived, the black break parked in the lane. Lowering the window, Alex invited them to get in the car. He looked genuinely upset. Spencer couldn't tell if it was because of the situation itself or any other reason. He silently sat in the front while his friends took place in the back. − \"Thank you for coming. It means everything.\" He said shyly. − \"Just tell me where we are going.\" replied Alex a bit drily. − \"The only place we can think of are the north mountains. Bethany was trekking.\" Spencer dropped a name as he vaguely remembered where their lost friend was going. Alex entered it into the GPS. The man grimaced when he saw how long the travel would take but, without saying a word, he backed off and drive them out of the city. For the first few minutes, the car was really silent. Everybody was in a seemingly lost in one's thoughts, but it was just a latent uneasiness. Alex finally broke the ice. − \"I'm sorry if I appear a little bit distant. I'm in a very uncomfortable place here. I had to lie to my wife in order to come. To be honest with you, I'm not sure she would understand and I don't blame her... And you know... that age difference, all that... It makes things a little bit awkward. But don't get me wrong, I would have come anyway... I would always come...\" He added softly, almost for himself. Then, he spoke clearly again. \"Please, tell me what happened.\" As they had plenty of time, Spencer related in detail their odd journey. Alex' concerns grew as he learned more. For time to time, Martha was trying to call Bethany but her phone was still ringing empty. − \"When you contacted me, weeks ago about Jumanji, I was worried, but I couldn't even imagine something like that happening.\" − \"Neither do I...\" − \"Oh my God! Bethany!\" Suddenly exclaimed Martha in the back, cutting their conversation. She put her phone on speaker. − \"Hey...\" Replied their friend. Her voice was a little bit sleepy. − \"Are you ok?\" − \"I don't know. I must have fainted or something like that. I just woke up and I have a hell of a headache. I saw you tried to call me several times. What's up?\" − \"Why doesn't she remember?\" asked Fridge. Spencer made a quick gesture to shush him. − \"Guys, you're there too?\" Asked Bethany as she heard the footballer's voice. − \"Yeah! They are with me. We're coming to pick you up. Where are you exactly?\" She gave them the name of her chalet without really thinking and then realised: − \"Wait a minute! Pick me up? What? How? And why do I think I'm not where I should be...\" − \"Hmm, Alex is driving us to you.\" replied Martha dodging the last part. Though, she was a big nervous for her friend's reaction about Alex. As expected, there was a long pause. − \"Hi there...\" Finally came the timid reply. − \"Hi there...\" Said Alex equally shy. \"We're almost there. Around half an hour.\" He precised as casually as he could. − \"Ok... But, is there something I should know?\" − \"Well, preferably we'll explain everything head to head.\" − \"Ok...\" She said. They could hear the doubtfulness in her voice. \"I'll wait in front of the chalet. See you.\" She hanged up. The small conversation with their friend released a lot of tension. − \"Has she lost her memory?\" Asked Fridge. − \"Reboot.\" replied Spencer. − \"What?\" − \"Jumanji was restoring itself. It has reboot to a former state. As Bethany was almost a part of it, when it released her, she may have reboot to. She lost her memories from what she lived in the game.\" − \"To be honest, I'm glad she doesn't remember. What a hell she's been through...\" Said Martha. ### Like she said, Bethany was waiting for them in front of the chalet. Fists on her hips, she was wearing short shorts and a large white T-shirt that was partially sliding on one of her shoulders. She had locked up her hair inside a large cap. They all got out the car and ran toward her. − \"I'm so happy you're here!\" said Martha joining her in a hug. − \"I'm happy to see you too girlfriend, but can someone tell me what's going on?\" She released her hair. She was unexpectedly dark brown with some lighter reflects. They all looked in chock at her. Alex just smiled and looked away. − \"Alex? What is it?\" Asked Bethany, noticing his reaction. − \"You remind me of a certain map expert.\" He just said, blushing a little bit. The others giggled. The ex-blonde frowned. She wasn't quite sure about how to react to that. − \"I think that's a souvenir from Jumanji.\" Replied Spencer to her silent question. \"We have a lot of things to tell you. A lot!\" She raised a quizzical eyebrow in a very Oberon's way. Spencer smiled. Either way the game had been kind to a long time lost soul or had just failed to correctly restore their friend, but Bethany had now a little piece of an ancient cartographer in her DNA. Was it just a hair colour and mannerisms or a more profound change? It was too early to tell. But their friend was back, safe and sound, and that was all that mattered. ### Somewhere on the sand of an unknown beach, Jumanji materialized. The board game was identical at what it had always been. Under the sun of this unknown place, Jumanji would wait for a new curious person to come. It had no other need nor purpose than to be played and for that it could wait as long as it takes. THE END I think I almost said everything that I needed in the last authors notes, so I won't be long there. I hope you enjoyed the story. Personally, I think I'm done writing on Jumanji - till the next film I guess :) - , so maybe see you next year! Have fun! Authors notes: - I this ending version, Jumanji released Bethany repairing the damaged done by the virus as it could. As she was mixed up with Oberon, it used a little bit of him to complete the blanks ^^. Like the frog DNA in Jurassic Park haha! - The fact that Spencer was aware of the time reboot from Jumanji is because of the virus touch. This is the side effect for this version :).

I hope you enjoy! :) Prologue - The Ghost of Brantford High It all happened so fast - one moment she was there, and the next she was here. Brantford. It took some investigating to find out exactly where she was, and as soon as she did it didn't take long for her to realize she was in fact out of the game. It was frightening, to say the least, having only ever lived within the parameters of the game before and now, suddenly, her world was much bigger and much more vast. She had been confused when suddenly, she had arrived in the bedroom of a boy, a green flicker still coming from the game console, the controls on the ground where the boy had dropped them, before being sucked away into the game. It took a while for her to realize this was what had happened, but as soon as she saw the word JUMANJI on the game in big, bright letters, she knew something had gone horribly, horribly wrong. Pretty soon there came a knock at the bedroom door and it had opened - she had frozen, searching desperately for somewhere to hide. But when a middle-aged man peeked his head in the room and looked right at her, she realized he had looked right through her. In other words, he hadn't seen her, she was invisible to him. \"Alex,\" he said. \"Time to get up, Buddy.\" He came inside the room, looking puzzled when he found the bed was empty, and even more so when he saw the console. \"Alex?\" He stepped back out of the room and called down the hall, \"Alex?\" She followed cautiously while he checked the hall and bathroom, but that was empty too. He went downstairs to the kitchen where his wife, she guessed, and Alex's mother, was sitting at the table reading the newspaper. \"Honey, have you seen Alex?\" \"He's not up yet.\" \"Well he's not in his room.\" \"What?\" She had taken her time exploring the Vreeke house, a warm, welcoming family home. There were family photographs everywhere, many of a young boy, who she guessed was Alex, the photos stopping at his teenage years. So teenage Alex had been sucked into the game. Seeing all these pictures of this happy, loving family only rekindled her want to have a family like this of her own someday. She was there for it all, as confusion quickly grew into panic, and phone calls were made asking if anyone had seen their son. Finally, after many unsuccessful searches of their own, they called the police and Alex Vreeke was officially reported missing. She was there for their heartbreak and fear, clinging onto that little bit of hope that their son would return to them, that he was safe, wherever he was. But she knew that if he really had been sucked into the game, as was becoming more and more apparent to her as time passed, he would be far from safe. But if he really had been sucked into the game, how then, had she come to be here? Sure, the game was complex and complicated, she knew from living in it, often like it had a mind of its own and never kept anything consistent. But how? She eventually settled on it being a major glitch of some sort. She stayed with Mr. and Mrs. Vreeke for a while, wishing she could be a source of some comfort and support to them in this difficult time. All of their heartbreak and pain only added to her own - she was far from home, in an unfamiliar place where she did not fit. She was away from everything and everyone she loved and everything familiar to her, and she had no way of contacting anyone or no way to go back. At night, when she would curl up alone and close her eyes, thinking back to her old life, she would always settle on an image of those dark yet warm eyes that she could easily get lost in, his eyes, and she would instantly feel better, at least for a little while. Each time she thought of him it brought a smile to her face and filled her with warmth, followed quickly by a painful ache of longing to return to him and their life within the game. She was homesick, desperately so. Did he feel this same way when he thought of her? She hoped so. But then she would recall their last conversation, before she had been sent here, all they had said, and she wished that they had been on better terms before she vanished. She would replay that conversation over and over again in her head, feeling worse and worse about it the more she thought of it. She had basically accused him of favouring his work over them and she wholeheartedly regretted it. She knew that wasn't true - yes he had been busy and engrossed in his work lately, borderline obsessed - no, he had crossed that line, he was obsessed with it. And despite being as fed up and angry with it as she was, she hadn't meant what she said. Now she would give anything to see him again and tell him how she had not meant it. She tried wandering around town, exploring it like she had the Vreeke house, and could around the neighbourhood, until she would become faint. After a few times of this she came to the conclusion that as she was a part of the game, she could not stray too far from it. So when the Vreekes packed up to move away and donated a bunch of their belongings to the school, the console included, she was brought to her next place, and where she would remain. She felt like a ghost, present but not really seen. She would occasionally slam locker doors, brush papers from a desk onto the floor, and flicker the lights, just for fun, for her own amusement. And soon enough, rumours of the school being haunted and various stories of how the 'ghost of Brantford High' came to be. But pretty soon, even spooking and pranking the students grew tedious and boring. Still, every year there were new students pouring through the doors, so she tried to learn their names and get to know them the best she could. What more could she do? In the school she spent most of her time in the basement where the game console had been carelessly placed, someone unsure of what to do with it so they had just set it amongst a pile of other mixed items: old clothes, a bowling ball, a football helmet, and many others. It was a messy storage space for lost and unwanted things. She was lost, but she hoped she was not unwanted. Maybe here she was, but not back home. If she wasn't in the basement she was usually in the biology classroom, pouring through the high-school level textbooks on different animal species, the closest to her familiar zoology. She clung onto hope. That was until the memories began fading, and she started to grow desperate. Someone just play the game already! Someone send me home - please... She needed to go back, to feel the warmth and welcome of their cozy London flat, to stand again in the bright classroom she taught in at the university, steeped in knowledge, to feel his comforting arms around her... She tried to scout out potential players, brave and curious souls daring enough to try out the game. But time passed, and so did her memories. She clung to those memories - they were all she had. Time passed, slowly, and it seemed to take her old self with it. She had been here for so long that she was now becoming a part of this world, this reality, different from her own, her old life rapidly slipping away from her. She was becoming real . And with no way to return, she was stuck, trapped. And she couldn't play the game herself, she had tried, many times. She always thought maybe this time, maybe this time . But it never worked, no matter how much she hoped. It was becoming harder to hide, the more real she became, less a game character and more a real person. But people didn't ask too many questions, for she was becoming embedded in this world. So, she started working at the school. This was her world now. She became Ms. Ross, teaching assistant, Professor Ross was gone. By then, all of her memories were gone too. For twenty years she watched and waited, hoping someone would find the game and venture far enough to play it - after all, they knew no better, they would think they were just playing another video game. But no one did, and so she remained. That is, until five students in detention finally unearthed the game. Hello and welcome to 'My Jewel'! :) This story will be pretty different from my other 'Jumanji' story and I'm really excited about it! Hope you enjoyed the prologue - I was originally going to start it with the chapter coming next, but then had this idea and decided to roll with it, kind of starts it off on a more ominous note :) Thanks so much for reading, more coming soon![Chapter 3] Welcome back! I hope you enjoy this chapter! :) Chapter One - It All Started in Detention... \"Welcome to detention.\" The principal eyed the five students before him, none of who made eye contact. Spencer raised his hand. \"I just wanted to say I'm sorry.\" \"Thank you, for that.\" \"Principal Bentley, all I did was make one quick call-\" Bethany tried to explain. \"Bethany please.\" The principal held up a hand for silence. \"You're all here for a reason, you know what that is. What you really should be thinking about is who you are and who you want to be. Luckily, there's no better place for that reflection than detention.\" He then gestured to the young woman who the five noticed for the first time, standing off to the side. \"This is Ms. Ross. You might recognize her as a teaching assistant here. She will be supervising you.\" Ms. Ross gave them a small smile in greeting. \"Now let's go.\" All with a sigh, the five hauled themselves to their feet and followed him downstairs to the basement, Ms. Ross following behind them. \"We're in the process of making this a new computer centre,\" Principal Bentley explained. \"But we need to clean it out first. These magazines-\" He gestured to the large bins full of them. \"-Need to be prepped for recycling - it seems that all the staples must be removed.\" The five gawked. \"Whatever you don't finish today, you'll finish tomorrow.\" He held out a basket of staple-removers. \"Choose your weapons. Ms. Ross, they're all yours.\" There was a bit of an awkward silence following the principal's departure between the five students and their supervisor. \"Well-\" Ms. Ross broke the silence. She spoke with an English accent. \"I suppose we could begin with introducing ourselves. Do you all know each other?\" This was answered by silence filled with a mix of nodding and shaking heads. \"Well, I'll start I suppose. I'm Ms. Theresa Ross.\" When no one followed suit, she nodded to the boy standing at the far end. \"And you?\" \"Fridge,\" he mumbled. She nodded. \"Thank you - Fridge.\" An interesting nickname. She turned to the other boy. \"Spencer - Gilpin.\" He waved. \"Thank you, Spencer.\" She turned to one of the two blonde girls. \"And you?\" \"Samara, but I go by Sawyer.\" \"Thank you, Sawyer.\" The red-head was looking at the floor and mumbled so softly she missed it. \"Sorry, I couldn't quite hear you?\" \"Martha,\" she repeated, lifting her head this time, but only slightly. \"Thank you, Martha.\" She turned to the last girl, who was too busy staring down at her phone. She cleared her throat to get the girl's attention. Her head snapped up. \"Hmm?\" She appeared completely oblivious. \"We're all introducing ourselves. Will you please tell us your name.\" At this, the girl seemed surprised. You don't know me?! Her eyes seemed to scream. \"Bethany Walker.\" Ms. Ross nodded. \"Alright, well now we all know each other.\" She smiled. \"Now I know you'd all probably rather be anywhere but, like Principal Bentley said, it's a good place for reflection.\" With that she sent them off. She sat off to the side with a book while the four began removing staples. Bethany stood by the bin of magazines, but remained on her phone. Fridge started off by doing work, but quickly lost interest and became curious about everything else the basement held. Spencer, Martha, and Sawyer were the only ones actually accomplishing the task. \"Hey, what's this?\" Fridge came back holding what looked like an old video game console. \"Hmm, I've never seen one like this before.\" Spencer inspected it. He saw that there was already a game cartridge in the slot. As if both thinking the same thing, the two boys looked to the old TV sitting on a table with wheels parked off to the side, then looked back at each other. \"Hey Ms. Ross? Can we play? Uh, Ms. Ross...\" She appeared to snap from a trance - she had been staring at the console. She closed her book - one on animal species. \"What is it?\" \"A video game.\" \"How are the staples going?\" She raised her eyebrows. The boys looked down sheepishly. \"Just for a few minutes?\" Spencer tried. They had been at it for over half an hour. And Spencer had been one of the ones doing most of the work. She saw no harm in it, she'd watch the time. \"Alright then, for a few minutes I suppose.\" Excited now, it took Spencer no time to get the console hooked up to the TV. When he turned it on, a name flashed across the screen. \"Jumanji,\" he read aloud. This caught her ears, and caused her to look up sharply. Jumanji . She swore she'd heard of it before, but just couldn't place where or when. It gnawed at her, and she knew she wouldn't be satisfied until she remembered. \"'A game for those who seek to find a way to leave their world behind',\" she heard Spencer's voice faintly say. During her pondering, the boys had recruited Sawyer and Bethany to play along with them, and were now trying to convince Martha. Finally, the red-head gave in and the five selected their players: Doctor Smolder Bravestone, Spencer; Franklin 'Moose' Finbar, Fridge; Dawn Dars, Sawyer; Professor Shelly Oberon, Bethany; and Ruby Roundhouse, Martha. Spencer hit one of the buttons on the controls to start the game, but nothing happened. He hit it again, but again, nothing. Suddenly, everyone jumped as what sounded like drumming filled the room, as though coming from overhead. It seemed to be growing louder and louder with each beat of the drum, more intense... \"W-what's going on?\" Bethany cried. \"I don't know,\" replied Spencer. The screen started to flash like there was some sort of malfunction. Spencer raced over to try and solve the problem - it seemed to be getting worse. \"Unplug it!\" He did so, and as abruptly as it started, the drumming and flashing stopped - all except for a single green flicker of electricity coming from the cord. It felt hot, like it was overworked and using too much power... All was silent. Suddenly, a blast of light shot from the console. \"Uh - M-Ms. Ross-\" \"Ms. Ross!\" The book fell from her hands when suddenly, she disappeared in a green flash. The five students didn't have long to wonder, only staring blankly at the spot where just a few moments ago their supervisor had been standing, before they too, vanished. And so the game begins... So, what did you think? :) I'm afraid for my fellow Russel Van Pelt fans that he won't appear for a couple more chapters still, but I'll try and update soon! ;) Thanks so much for reading and I hope you enjoyed![Chapter 4] Hello! Here's chapter two! Chapter Two - Familiar and Unfamiliar Faces Suddenly, she was no longer standing in the dark basement, but outside, in the bright sun, her hand instantly going to shield her eyes from its intense rays, despite already being partially shielded by the hat she was wearing. She appeared to be in a jungle of some sort. But how? And where? All she remembered was being in the basement, and then, well, suddenly not being there... Hmm, this was all starting to feel oddly familiar... The strange thing was, while the basement was rapidly fading from her memory, this place, wherever it was, seemed familiar, and strangely so. She just couldn't place it... But where were the others? She was certain there had been others with her. She couldn't remember who, just vague outlines, but she was almost certain that she hadn't been alone... Or had she been? She couldn't quite recall now. She was dressed in a comfortable button-up shirt, beige khaki vest, capri pants, calf-high lace-up boots, and with a little scarf tied around her neck. A belt was buckled around her middle with a little bag at her hip, and a wooden staff with intricate carvings along it was held in her gloved hand. She traced the carved lines with the tip of her finger. She suddenly, almost too suddenly, became aware of the sounds carrying through the trees: faint voices, and the sound of sharpening metal - she wasn't alone here. And whoever it was was pretty close to her, or she was close to them. This reassured her though - other people. She could ask for help, directions maybe. It was worth a try. With that, she gathered herself and headed off, following the sounds. Meanwhile, miles away, five people fell from the sky, some with a relatively safe landing, others not so much. \"Ow!\" \"Where's my hair?\" \"What the hell?!\" \"Where am I?!\" \"Uh, guys - whoa, why do I sound like that?\" \"Who are you?\" \"Who are you ?!\" \"Oh my God I'm totally suing - what's wrong with my voice? Where am I?!\" Now five unfamiliar adults stood in a circle staring at each other. \"My God - I think we're in the game,\" the tall, muscular man said. \"What?!\" \"Excuse me?!\" \"Somehow, I don't know how, but I think we got like, sucked into the game, and now we're the avatars we chose.\" \"W-where's the rest of me? And what - what is this on my back?\" the smaller man was muttering to himself. \"Fridge?\" asked the tall man. \"Yeah, yeah I'm Fridge. Who are you?\" \"It's me, Spencer-\" \"You're Spencer?!\" \"Yes!\" There was a moment of shocked silence before Fridge blurted, his voice high-pitched from disbelief, \"YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT YOU'RE SPENCER?!\" \"Yes, I'm Spencer. And yet I look and sound like Dr. Smolder Bravestone - AHH!\" A cawing bird overhead made him jump. \"Yup, that's Spencer,\" Fridge declared, now convinced. \"And Fridge, that means you're Moose Finbar.\" He turned to the red-headed woman who was standing awkwardly. \"Martha?\" \"Yeah.\" \"You're Ruby Roundhouse.\" Next he turned to the young blonde woman. \"Sawyer? You're Dawn Dars. Nice glasses by the way.\" \"Uh, thanks.\" She adjusted them. He turned to the last member of the group. \"And Bethany, you're Professor Shelly Oberon - only 'Shelly' must be short for Sheldon.\" \"What are you talking about?\" She looked around at her companions who all remained silent. Who was going to break the news to her? Looking nervous now she ran over to the bank of the nearby lake. \"No! Bethany, don't look at it-\" But it was too late- \"NO! I'm an overweight middle-aged man!\" Then she began frantically patting her pockets. \"Wait a second - where's my phone?!\" \"Oh my God-\" \"Really?\" \"That's your biggest concern right now?\" cried Sawyer. \"We're literally in a jungle!\" \"We're in different people's bodies!\" groaned Martha. \"That doesn't seem like the most pressing concern right now,\" Spencer mumbled. \"Ugh, why am I wearing this ridiculous outfit in the jungle?!\" cried Martha. This was met by a, \"hey! I think I look amazing!\" Martha's hands flew to cover her mouth. \"Yeah, you do.\" Now Spencer did the same. \"Sorry, I didn't mean to say that - not that you don't look good, you do, I just - that wasn't me talking. I mean, it was, but not really me -\" \"Me too.\" Martha nodded. Sawyer counted herself lucky with her outfit: she was wearing shorts too, hers overalls, but not nearly as short as Martha's, and a button-up shirt. She wore tan gloves and ankle-high boots which were really quite comfortable. She too carried a backpack, smaller than Fridge's, and there mustn't have been much in it cause it was very light. She was also thankful for her hair being pulled back in a ponytail. Very practical. There was a moment of confused silence before Bethany cried, \"and I look like a living garden gnome! Where is my phone?!\" \"Well I don't have my Claritin, and all I see around me is pollen.\" \"Oh no, you have some allergies Spencer?\" said Fridge, feigning concern. \"I'm missing the top two feet of my body!\" \"No, no this can't actually be happening-\" Bethany gasped with sudden realization. \"You guys! Maybe we're all in a coma.\" This was met by silence. \"A coma? All together in a coma? Really?\" cried Martha. \"Well I don't know! That old game machine must have-\" It happened so fast, almost a blur: a hippo popped out of the water behind her and devoured Bethany whole. The others screamed. \"OH MY GOD!\" \"Bethany!\" \"You'd better get in there and save her,\" Fridge told Spencer. \"I'm not getting in there! You get in there!\" \"I have a backpack on! You don't get in water with a backpack everybody knows that!\" \"Oh for goodness sake-\" Sawyer was just about to throw off her own backpack and dive in after Bethany, when there was a loud ringing from above, followed by a scream, and Bethany came crashing down to the jungle floor. \"Bethany!\" The others rushed over to her. \"Ow!\" \"Are you okay?!\" \"That was so intense! I like, can't even with this place!\" \"What happened?\" \"Uh, I got eaten by a rhino, and then I fell like a thousand feet from the sky.\" \"Yeah, that's what it looked like,\" remarked Spencer. \"I'm still an old fat guy right?\" \"I'm afraid so...\" \"That was a hippo,\" Fridge corrected her. \"They're omnivorous. They're as fast as a horse...\" He began listing off facts about hippos, until he cut himself off. \"How do I know this?!\" \"You're an expert in zoology,\" Sawyer reminded him. \"At least, Moose Finbar is.\" \"Uh, guys-\" Martha's voice made them all look up to see another hippo coming through the bushes towards them. \"AH!\" With a cry, Spencer took off running, the others quick to follow, in both the screaming and the running. They hadn't gone far before they emerged through a thinning in the trees, a muddy road in front of them. Beep beep! A Jeep was just making its way along the road then. It drew to a halt before them and a man wearing a large hat poked his head out of the window. \"Ah, Dr. Bravestone, welcome to Jumanji! Well don't just stand there, in you go!\" Yay Nigel to the rescue! ;) I love Nigel so he will feature more in this story than he did in the movie. There's chapter two (yay, now we're in the game!) I hope you enjoyed, thanks so much for reading! :) Oh, and can you guess who Terri is going to happen upon? ;)[Chapter 5] Hello! Welcome back! Hope you enjoy! :) Chapter Three - A Warm Welcome The five climbed into the Jeep, Spencer in the front and the others in the back - there was barely enough room. Sawyer found herself squished between Fridge and Bethany. \"Ah, Dr. Bravestone!\" the man flashed Spencer a wide and cheery grin. \"Legendary archaeologist and international explorer! Known across the Seven Continents for your bravery and courageous exploits!\" \"You know this guy?\" asked Fridge. \"No, of course not! How would I know him?!\" cried Spencer. \"Well he seems to know you.\" \"I can't tell you what an honour it is to finally meet you! I'm a huge fan of your work! And I'm not embarrassed to say that you're even more dashing in person!\" the man continued excitedly. \"Uhhh...\" Spencer didn't know what to say. Then he suddenly blurted, \"that's right!\" Once again, he slapped a hand over his mouth. That was just so weird! And not to mention embarrassing. \"Uh, who are you?\" asked Martha. \"Oh of course! Forgive me for not properly introducing myself - Nigel Billingsly at your service, Ruby Roundhouse, killer of men! Welcome to Jumanji! I've been so anxious for your arrival - thank goodness you're here! As you know, Jumanji is in grave danger.\" \"It is?\" \"We're counting on you to lift the curse!\" \"Curse?\" \"What curse?\" \"There's a curse now?\" \"Excuse me, have you seen my phone anywhere?\" Bethany cut in. \"Ah, Professor Sheldon Oberon! Welcome to Jumanji! Nigel Billingsly at your service - I've been so anxious for your arrival!\" he repeated yet again, just as cheerily as the last. Bethany looked perplexed. \"What's with this guy?\" she whispered, eyes narrowed in confusion behind her glasses. Sawyer adjusted her own glasses - they were so annoying! She tried taking them off. Nope, nothing. She was pretty much blind without them. \"I think he's an NPC,\" Spencer tried to explain in answer to Bethany's question. \"A what?\" \"English please!\" \"A non-player character. So anything he says is limited to a set of programmed responses.\" \"Yeah,\" said Fridge sarcastically. \"Got it. It's all clear now. Thanks Spencer.\" \"Ah, Franklin 'Mouse' Finbar, welcome to Jumanji!\" Nigel chirped, smiling at Fridge through the rear-view mirror. \"'Mouse'?\" repeated Fridge. \"Uh, I think you mean 'Moose.' It's Moose.\" \"My good sir, I do believe it's 'Mouse'. A nickname given for your diminutive stature, and adorable manner-\" The girls turned to each other and shared a chuckle over this. \"-I knew you'd be here, Dr. Bravestone never goes anywhere without his trusty sidekick! After Dr. Bravestone rescued you from the clutches of a warlord in the jungles of Peru, you've never left his side since!\" Fridge just stared back. The girls continued to chuckle. \"You must have read his name wrong,\" said Sawyer. \"Ah, and Dawn Dars, excellent mechanic and companion to Seaplane!\" She had to admit, despite the suddenness and ridiculousness of their situation, the field guide's chipper demeanor lifted the tension, even if only by a little. \"Seaplane?\" she repeated. \"Wait, wasn't that the other character?\" \"Yeah,\" said Spencer. \"The one we couldn't choose.\" \"Who is Seaplane?\" she asked Nigel. \"Nigel Billingsly at your service! Welcome to Jumanji - I have been so anxious for your arrival! Thank goodness you're here,\" Nigel cried, turning back to Spencer, once again repeating himself. \"Jumanji is in grave danger. We're counting on the six of you to lift the curse!\" \"But there's only five of us...\" This was becoming stranger by the minute... \"What curse?\" \"It's all documented in the letter I sent you, Dr. Bravestone,\" Nigel informed. \"Letter? I don't have a let-\" He held it, the letter, in his hand. Whoa... Nigel chuckled. \"Perhaps you should read it aloud.\" \"Uh, right. 'Dr. Bravestone, I am writing to you urgently-'\" Nigel's voice jumped in: \"- Regarding the desperate situation in Jumanji. We need your help at once!\" Suddenly, the scene around them was sucked away and they were surrounded in darkness before a new clip began playing. \"Uh, guys...\" \"What's happening?\" \"What the hell is going on?\" \"I think it's a cut-scene,\" Spencer said. \"A lot of games have them. It's like a little movie to tell you the backstory of the game.\" \"My name is Nigel Billingsley, Jumanji field guide. I was recently hired by your former partner, now nemesis, Professor Russell Van Pelt...\" \"Oh no,\" blurted Spencer again, again speaking unwillingly. Then he added, himself this time, \"uh, that doesn't sound good.\" \"No shit,\" said Fridge. Figures slashed at the dense plant life to pave a path for the group, in Jeeps, on motorbikes, and on foot, to follow. A man stepped down from the front Jeep - he had dark eyes framed by shadows cast by the bangs of his dark hair falling over his eyes. A smirk twitched across his lips. He wore a long coat that practically brushed the ground. One of his gloved hands held the silver handgun that rested at his hip, ready to withdraw and shoot if necessary. He looked very intimidating. \"...You see, Professor Van Pelt had come in search of the fabled Jaguar shrine, resting place of the sacred Jewel of Jumanji, the Jaguar's Eye. After years of research, he believed he had finally discovered its whereabouts. Now, Van Pelt had not been alone on his quest - he had brought his wife along with him, but she, I regret to say, disappeared. Simply vanished. He was absolutely devastated. In the beginning, I felt sorry for him, poor chap. But that was before he stole the jewel...\" The scene continued, revealing a great statue rising up above the jungle, the head of a jaguar. \"You see, Van Pelt told me that he wanted to find the jewel in order to document it, and perhaps that was originally his intention. But after his dearly beloved wife was snatched from him, swallowed up by the jungle, he made up his mind to steal from Jumanji as it had stolen from him...\" Van Pelt, now at the top of the statue, brushed away some vines to uncover a bright green jewel. He drove his knife into the stone surrounding it and carved out the sparkling green jewel. He held it up, high above his head, declaring his victory as darkness descended over the jungle. Oh yeah, he's the bad guy, thought Sawyer. \"Legend tells that the jaguar watches over Jumanji, and that anyone who dares to blind it shall be consumed by a dark power. Van Pelt gained dominion over all of Jumanji's creatures, possessing them, controlling them. And just like that, a terrible curse befell this once peaceful place. I begged him to put it back, but now that he had it in his grasp, he could never let it go. He said only if his wife would be returned to him would he then return the jewel. But I am afraid she is lost, but I didn't dare say so. We searched and searched for her, but all in vain. And the longer we searched, the worse Jumanji's state became. Without the jewel, it ha s started to whither. So I made up my mind: I was going to take it back. I waited until they slept and made my move...\" The scene showed Nigel tip-toeing through the group's camp, successfully taking back the jewel before being caught in the act. \" Bring me that jewel! \" roared Van Pelt. \" And slaughter anyone who tries to stop you. \" \"Right then - here you are-\" The cut-scene was gone now, and they were back in the Jeep. Nigel produced a green jewel - the jewel! He handed it to Spencer. \"B-but he just said-\" \"W-what-\" \"This is bad, like really bad-\" \"We're gonna die!\" \"Working together as a team you must use your complimentary skills to return the jewel to the Jaguar's Eye. And don't let it fall back into Van Pelt's hands! I fear all is lost for Jumanji if that were to happen. And I imagine you'll want to get started right away!\" \"Uh, actually-\" \"W-what-\" The doors opened with an almost cheerful pop ! \"On you go! The fate of Jumanji is in your hands!\" Nigel prompted. \"Now remember, the goal for you I'll recite in verse: return the jewel, and lift the curse. If you wish to leave the game, you must save Jumanji and call out its name.\" \"He says it like it's easy...\" Nigel repeated the verse again as they all climbed out of the Jeep. \"Here you go, Dr. Bravestone, a map of Jumanji. Go to the bazaar and find the missing piece.\" \"O-okay...\" \"The missing piece of what?\" demanded Martha, but Nigel was already pulling away with one last, 'cheerio!' \"You can't just give us a ride to the statue?\" tried Fridge. \"And remember: if you wish to leave the game, you must save Jumanji and call out its name!\" Haha, such great comical timing with Van Pelt's last line and Nigel giving them the jewel! Hope you enjoyed, thanks so much for reading - and Van Pelt will be in the next chapter! ;)[Chapter 6] And we're back! I'm excited for this chapter ;) Hope you enjoy! Chapter Four - the Dark-eyed Man As she neared the camp, she saw that it was actually quite busy, lots of men working on various weapons, sharpening knives, loading guns, or fixing up motorbikes. It was rather intimidating, to be perfectly honest. Hmm, maybe this wasn't the best idea... However, something told her that this place was okay, despite its intimidating first impression. Something urged her on. Shaking off any further uncertainties she stepped out of the trees and entered the camp, clearing her throat. All at once, about a dozen heads shot up and looked at her. She felt her grip on her staff tighten in response. \"Um, hello.\" She smiled a little - she wasn't sure what was more intimidating, the vast array of weapons, or the men themselves. \"I was just passing through and seem to have gotten lost, and then I came across your camp and I was wondering if you might be able to tell me where I am?\" she asked politely. The only answer she received however, was the same blank stares from all the men. No one said anything. How very odd. Maybe there was a language barrier, maybe they didn't speak English. But she'd heard them speaking before, and knew that at least a few spoke English. She was just opening her mouth to speak again when there was the sound of hurried footsteps and the entrance to one of the larger tents was thrown open to reveal another man. He didn't look like the others. Less intimidating perhaps but with an extremely intriguing aura. He wore a long, dark leather coat that brushed the ground as he walked. He wore tones of brown, good for blending in with the forest, except for his white shirt, bright against the rest of his appearance, dark clothes, tan skin, dark hair, dark eyes. She saw a flash of silver and saw that it was a gun at his hip - these men were heavily armed. His dark eyes immediately fell on her. He stared at her, eyes wide. Eyes that seemed so familiar and yet she couldn't place them. No one answered her still, they all just continued to stare, including the newcomer, who almost looked as though he might burst into tears. When he spoke his voice was deep and he had an English accent like hers. \"Terri?\" The fact that he knew her shocked her, but his use of her nickname shocked her even more - not only did this man know her, but he knew her well. And yet she had no idea who he was. He came forward, looking dazed almost. He stopped and stared down at her. \"Oh,\" he breathed, a smile gracing his lips. \"I thought I'd lost you.\" Then he reached out, cupping her face gently in his gloved hands. For some reason, she didn't pull away, at least not right away. The gesture was welcoming, and comforting almost - familiar. That was until he leaned in, aiming to kiss her- His lips were just hovering above hers, almost brushing hers, when she realized what was happening and shoved him away and jumped back away from him. \"Oh I don't think so, Mate!\" With that she turned and took off running, hurriedly fleeing the camp and heading back into the trees. \"Terri wait!\" he called, but she wasn't about to stop. Perhaps the camp hadn't been the best place to go, but it was almost as if she had been drawn to it, and by something more than just curiosity... She just manged to catch the man shout, \"bring her back!\" which only made her quicken her pace. He even sounded familiar. She quickly scampered up a tree - slightly awkwardly with her staff - but she managed to find a perch, from which she could also see the camp. It was pretty spread out, tents scattered about, a fire at the centre. She saw now that the tent the dark-eyed man had emerged from was the largest, and she guessed that he was the leader of this group - whoever they were. One of the men searching for her appeared beneath her, circling the trees. She froze, not daring to move a muscle. That was until the staff slipped from her shoulder and - BONK! It struck the man right on the head, knocking him down. A hand flew to her mouth as she watched him crumble to the ground at the base of the tree. \"CAW!\" \"DAH!\" A large black vulture seemed to appear out of nowhere, perched close to caused her to lose her footing and she fell, with a scream, to the ground - landing flat on her stomach. Curse her clumsiness and its absolutely terrible timing! She pushed herself up so that she was kneeling, while spitting bits of leaf and grass from her mouth. \"Terri!\" The dark-eyed man burst through the trees, totally disregarding the unconscious man beside her. Now she leapt to her feet, snatching up her staff and pointing it at him. \"Back off! You want to be next?\" She nodded to the unconscious man at her feet. Sure, she hadn't exactly taken him down herself, but they didn't need to know that. \"Terri-\" \"Stop it! Stop calling me that!\" She gripped the staff tighter. \"Who are you?\" she demanded. \"Terri, i-it's me-\" \"That's not helpful!\" \"Russell-\" \"Well 'Russell'-\" The name felt familiar on her tongue - she'd said it before. \"-You must be mistaken, because I don't know you-\" She was getting lost in his eyes, dark and mysterious, intriguing. He was rather handsome... Stop it! She shook her head to dismiss such thoughts. Now he looked more hurt than confused. \"Oh my dear, what's happened to you?\" \"Who are you?\" she demanded again. Eyes not leaving him, she began inching her way back - she had a clear path behind her. \"Terri-\" \"I said stop calling me that! Only people I'm close to call me that.\" \"B-but I'm-\" \"Answer my question!\" \"How about you come back to the camp-\" \"Oh I'm not going back there! And I'm not going anywhere with you!\" There was a moment of stunned silence. \"Uh, I don't think she remembers, Boss,\" said one of the men. Well that confirmed her thought that this guy was the leader. The dark-eyed man gave the man who had spoken a look of, 'idiot' before turning back to her. \"Terri, it's me, Russell,\" he tried again. When that did nothing, he added, \"your husband.\" Terri felt her jaw drop, literally fall open, and her eyes very nearly popped out of their sockets. For a moment she was too stunned to say anything, shocked speechless. Finally, she found her words. \"I beg your pardon?\" \"It's me, I'm your husband, we're married.\" She just stood there, jaw still agape, lips moving but no words spoken. Finally, she spoke. \"Get away from me!\" And with that she took off running again, this time sprinting like her life depended on it. She didn't care that she was alone in an unfamiliar place, or that her staff made running awkward and kept bumping against her hip painfully - she just had to get away from that guy! She could hear shouting and commotion behind her, so she could only guess that they were chasing after her. This only pushed her harder. Beep beep! She whirled around to see a Jeep driving towards her. It slowed to a stop directly in front of where she stood. \"Well I'll be!\" A rather jolly man stuck his head out the window and beamed at her. \"Professor Ross is that really you?! Oh thank goodness you're alright, I can't tell you what a relief it is to have you back! Please, hop in, I have much to tell you - and it's not all good I'm afraid.\" Nigel to the rescue again, haha! So I came up with this idea that when the NPCs are talking to each other they have a wider set of responses :) Also, in this version, Van Pelt's eyes only turn all green when he's controlling animals. Did you guys make the connection right away? ;) I figured that when you read about his wife disappearing in the last chapter, you knew who my character would be! Thanks so much for reading and I hope you enjoyed![Chapter 7] Hello! Hope you enjoy this next chapter! Chapter Five - Getting into Character \"It's okay, everything's gonna be fine. In real life you're hot and you can hook up with anyone you like,\" Bethany was mumbling to herself. \"Is that what you tell yourself when you're upset?\" asked Martha. \"Oh my God can you not judge me for like two seconds?! I split up with Noah, I turned into a guy, and now I can't find my phone - I'm allowed to be upset okay!\" They were trudging through the tall grass, already hot, sweaty, and frustrated. \"Ugh, can't we just leave? Like why do we have to do all this other stuff?\" Bethany complained. \"Nigel said if we want to leave the game we have to save it,\" Spencer reminded. \"Yeah, he didn't say we could just leave at any time,\" added Sawyer. \"The game sets the rules, we've got to play by those rules. I think we have to save Jumanji,\" Spencer declared, and continued on. \"It's okay, it's all going to be okay,\" Bethany went back to trying to calm herself. \"We, we just have to save Jumanji-\" \"Just?!\" cried Fridge. Spencer continued to lead. He seemed to be talking to himself to cope with his nervousness. \"We're trapped in a video game. I play video games. It's literally the main thing I do... A game like this, there's going to be levels. In order to finish the game you have to complete all the levels. The levels are going to get harder as we go along-\" \"Spencer do you actually know where we're going?\" demanded Fridge. \"Kinda...\" \"Kinda? Oh, oh that's good then. We're in good hands... We're doomed!\" Spencer looked down at the map Nigel had given them. A corner was missing. \"The missing piece, I'm guessing?\" \"That must be what we're looking for at the bazaar,\" Martha gasped. \"The missing piece of the map.\" \"The problem is, there's nothing here.\" He flipped the map over, but it was blank. \"How are we supposed to get to the bazaar?\" \"You weren't even following the map?!\" cried Fridge. \"I can't there's nothing here!\" \"What do you mean there's nothing here?\" Bethany asked. \"It's a map just like he said. A map of Jumanji.\" \"Cartography!\" Martha cried. \"Uh, what's that?\" asked Bethany, now appeared worried. \"The study of maps! It was one of Professor Oberon's skills.\" \"Oh, so you can't read this but I can?\" Bethany took the map. \"That's right. The characters we chose, we all have special skills,\" said Spencer. \"So there must be a way to access our skills-\" He gasped when, all of a sudden, a bright green box listing strengths and weaknesses appeared before him: Dr. Smolder Bravestone Legendary Archaeologist and Explorer Strengths: Fearless, climbing, speed, boomerang, smoldering intensity \"Smoldering intensity?\" he read. As soon as he said this he turned and stared off into the distance. There was silence. \"What the hell are you doing?\" demanded Fridge, snapping him from the trance. \"Uh, what just happened?\" \"Uh, you just smoldered...\" Bethany grinned. Spencer went back to the list: Weakness: none \"None?\" He nodded, impressed. \"How did you get that list?\" Martha asked. \"Oh, uh, I think I just pressed my - enormous left pec.\" \"Yeah, like here. Here, let me show you-\" Fridge reached out towards her chest. Slap! She smacked his hand away. \"Get the hell away from me!\" He appeared startled. \"At least press it in front of us so we know what to do.\" Martha turned away and tried pressing her own chest. A bright red box appeared when she did: Ruby Roundhouse Killer of Men Strenghts: Karate, T'ai Chi, Aikido, dancing fighting Weakness: Venom \"Dance fighting? Is that even a thing?\" she asked. \"Seriously?\" The others turned to look at Bethany who had a yellow box displaying her skills: Professor Sheldon 'Shelly' Oberon Curvy Genius Strengths: Cartography, archaeology, and paleontology. Weakness: Endurance \"Pale-ee-on-tol-\" She tried to sound it out, but gave up. \"What does that even mean?\" \"Um, study of fossils, I think. That's pretty cool,\" Martha told her. \"Says the gorgeous karate bad-ass to the old fossil guy with no endurance.\" Sawyer tried next. Her box was blue. Dawn Dars Excellent Mechanic, Companion to Seaplane Strengths: mechanics, engine and plane fixing, speed Weaknesses: heights, glasses, alcohol No wonder her glasses were so annoying. Last was Fridge. His skills were listed in a bright pink box: Franklin 'Mouse' Finbar Dr. Bravestone's Loyal Sidekick \"Oh, they couldn't have told me the sidekick thing before,\" mumbled Fridge. Strengths: Zoology, weapons valet Weaknesses: Speed, strength, cake \"I hate this game!\" he declared. \"Everybody else got all the good stuff!\" \"Weakness: cake?\" read Martha. Sawyer held back a laugh. \"Yes, cake is my weakness. Along with speed and strength. How is strength my weakness?! And speed? Why would I need to be fast when I'm being chased through the jungle by a giant killer zebra or some shit in this dumbass hat?!\" \"Well, you're also a good weapons valet,\" Martha tried. \"What's that?\" he demanded \"Well I think it means you carry my weapons in your backpack and give them to me when and if I need them,\" Spencer told him. This didn't seem to help, and Fridge only looked even more upset. He looked as though he was about to snap back when Bethany suddenly cried, \"you guys! It's changing! The map its changing!\" The others rushed over to see; words and pictures were appearing, as though being drawn by an invisible hand. \"See, it didn't say this before and now it does-\" Bethany pointed. From the Deep and The Mighty Roar . \"'From the Deep ...' \" Spencer thought for a moment. \"The hippo, it came from the deep. \"You know, the one-\" \"Yes, the thing that did the thing,\" Bethany cut him off. \"Moving on.\" \"So if 'From the Deep' is the first level, then 'The Mighty Roar' must be the second. Which way Bethany?\" \"Um-\" She inspected the map. \"This way, it looks like.\" \"Okay, lead the way-\" He smoldered again. \"Let's do this.\" \"Why do you keep doing that?\" demanded Fridge. Spencer snapped out of it. \"I-I don't know, but it wasn't me, like with the talking, you know, how sometimes, words will just come out of our mouths without us meaning to talk. It's like that.\" \"Weird,\" mumbled Sawyer. \"This game is sure full of surprises.\" \"Sure is,\" he agreed. \"Now let's get going, it's starting to get dark.\" Hello, hope you enjoyed, thanks so much for reading! :) And thank you for all the comments! :) I love seeing your reactions![Chapter 8] Hello! Welcome back :) Hope you enjoy! Chapter Six- Into the Jungle Nigel! Oh thank goodness, someone familiar! His kind and chipper demeanor was impossible to forget, and very welcome at that moment. As if on cue, the passenger side door swung open. She climbed inside and had barely sat down in her seat before the door closed and Nigel was speeding away again. Nigel to the rescue! \"You look well, Professor Ross,\" he called to her as they drove. \"Thanks, Nigel. Who were those guys-\" She kept throwing frantic glances over her shoulder to make sure they weren't being followed. \"We were all very distressed by your disappearance. But here you are! I'm afraid things have taken a rather dramatic turn since we last saw you.\" \"How do you mean?\" \"I'm afraid Jumanji has been cursed.\" \"Cursed?!\" \"I thought that if anyone could put an end to this, it would be you-\" \"Me?!\" \"-But now I fear that not even you could.\" \"What could I possibly do?!\" \"It's your husband, Professor Ross,\" Nigel told her, turning serious. \"My what?!\" But he was now the second person to say that - that couldn't be a good sign. \"He found the jewel, but after your disappearance he became devastated and stole it, thus cursing Jumanji and putting it in its current state. Now he originally said that he would return it if only we found you. However, I fear its power over him has become too great, and that he doesn't want to give it up, not even for you. As you know better than anyone, the jewel is his great obsession.\" \"I hate that stupid jewel,\" she muttered. The words were out of her mouth before she even realized it - she didn't even remember this jewel, but just the mention of it had sent anger boiling deep within her. She didn't know where this information came from, but she knew for certain that it was correct - it was like it was buried deep in the recesses of her brain, and only now surfacing without her realizing it. She had thought all her memories would come flooding back, or at least she had hoped, but guess not. \"But fear not, Professor Ross, for I have sent for Dr. Smolder Bravestone - your husband's former partner and now nemesis - and his team to come and help us return the jewel.\" Nemesis? Great. \"You sent for Bravestone?\" \"Yes, seeing as he once worked with your husband-\" \"Could you please stop saying that.\" He, Bravestone, never been a fan of her, for reasons she had never been able to figure out, so she was quite sure that he wouldn't be so happy with having to work with her, and to stop her - her husband as everyone was calling him - no less. \"-He seemed like the obvious choice. Now, Dr. Bravestsone, along with his sidekick Franklin 'Mouse' Finbar, and team Ruby Roundhouse, Professor Sheldon Oberon, and Dawn Dars - I believe you are already familiar with them?\" \"Uh, yes-\" The names sounded familiar, she just couldn't match a face to the name. \"They have only just arrived, but the sixth member, Seaplane McDonough, was already here. Just go through the trees here and you'll be sure to find him.\" \"What-\" Suddenly, the Jeep lurched to a halt. She jumped when the door beside her popped open. \"The best of luck to you Professor Ross! I'm sure I will be seeing you again very soon! And again, I am so glad you are alright.\" She took that as her sign to get out of the Jeep and so she stepped down. \"Thanks Nigel.\" \"Good luck!\" The door closed, and with one last cheery wave, Nigel drove off. Ah Nigel, what a sweetheart. She had instantly warmed to him and had loved hearing all his facts and legends about Jumanji... Huh, so she was remembering, only a little, but it was still some progress. She hoped this man they called her husband hadn't caused the poor field guide too much trouble, but based on his story the opposite was the case. And she was still in denial about the whole husband thing. \"So he said just go through there and I'd find this Seaplane fellow,\" she muttered to herself. Sighing, she trudged onward. Despite having driven far from the camp, she kept alert for any sign of the dark-eyed man and his men who might be lurking nearby in search of her. Back at the camp, the men, heads hanging in shame, were avoiding eye contact with their boss, who stood there, expectantly. The men exchanged a glance - who among them would be the brave bearer of the bad news? However, the fact that Ms. Ross was not with them spoke for itself. Van Pelt's jaw tightened as he suppressed a growl. \"She got away.\" \"Afraid so, Boss,\" one man said. Van Pelt cursed under his breath and turned away with an agitated sigh. \"S-sorry, Sir-\" \"You let her get away.\" \"W-with all due respsect, Sir, she didn't seem to remember-\" The man was cut off when his boss spun around and seized him by the front of his jacket, bringing his face close to his. \"I lost her once,\" he hissed. \"I'm not going to lose her again.\" Terri was still trudging along through the trees, exhausted, confused, and alone. There was no sign of this Seaplane fellow she was supposed to find, and she kept jumping at any sudden noise, thinking that she was being followed. Suddenly, she heard a rustling behind her; again, she jumped. Then she froze - my God I am being followed! Mind racing, her first thought was dark-eyed man and his creepy associates! She gripped her staff tightly in both hands, ready. Then, with a great swing, she spun around. So I recently realized that Bobby Cannavale is Paxton in Ant-Man and so I had to watch that movie again and it's too good! I bet you can guess who I'll be cheering for when the sequel comes out ;) Haha! And back to Van Pelt - he will return soon, I promise! He and Terri are in for another reunion soon! Thanks so much for reading and I hope you enjoyed![Chapter 9] Chapter Seven - Margaritas and Memories SMACK! Her staff hit whoever it was behind her - a young man in a pilot's jacket she soon discovered, who crashed to the ground with a groan, holding his now bruised jaw. \"Ow! Yikes!\" \"You snuck up on me!\" she defended. \"Fair enough.\" Staggering, he got to his feet. \"Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. You're Terri, aren't you? Terri Ross.\" This alarmed her, like it had with the dark-eyed man. It was scary, all these people knowing her and knowing what was going on when she didn't know them or what was going on. \"Theresa, yes. Terri for short.\" \"You're her!\" His excitement then quickly fell away. \"Wait, you're not on his side, are you?\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"Van Pelt, are you working for him?\" \"Who?\" \"Van Pelt,\" he repeated. Nothing. \"Uh, the game's villain. Tall, long leather coat, controls all the animals and his eyes turn this creepy green when he does so? He's always talking about you, and he has a picture of you-\" \"Why?!\" That creep! \"And how do you know this?!\" \"Cause I snuck into his camp once and looked around, stole some food.\" \"Does he have these dark, intriguing eyes? Does he have a silver gun that he's so proud of? And the chain around his neck - does he wear that?\" Now he appeared confused by her attention to detail - even she was surprised. \"Uh, yeah...\" Then it was the same dark-eyed man from the camp, the one who recognized her and who tried to kiss her, and she almost let him... \"No, I'm not working with him. I was actually just running away from him, and luckily Nigel showed up.\" \"Oh, okay, good. Glad we're on the same page then. I just thought, you now, cause you're married and stuff, but that's cool.\" She winced. \"Why does everyone keep saying that?\" \"Saying what?\" \"That we're married? My husband-\" Wait a minute... When she had been talking with Nigel just before this they had been speaking of him, her husband - she knew who he was, but she hadn't had a clear image of him, only a vague one,only known that he existed. Her memories were coming back, in no sort of easy pattern, and slowly, but they were returning nonetheless. And now this fellow also seemed to be telling her that her husband was the man from the camp. It was becoming harder and harder to deny it... Well, that explained a lot, everything clicking together in her head like the pieces of a puzzle, the whole recognizing her, the almost-kiss, the picture... Now the young man looked even more confused. \"Wait, are you telling me that you don't remember?\" \"No - I mean yes, I mean - I don't know-\" There was a pause before he spoke again. \"Nigel said you disappeared. Where did you go?\" \"I don't know,\" she answered again, and truthfully. \"Well, wherever it was, and whatever happened, it must have done something to your memory.\" \"Y-yes...\" Now she spoke shakily. She suddenly felt very small and insecure, unsure and vulnerable. He sensed this. \"Hey, hey,\" he said gently, comfortingly. \"It's gonna be alright, yeah? I'll help you.\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah, yeah of course.\" \"T-thank you.\" \"I'm Alex.\" \"Terri.\" Alex - she could have sworn there was someone else named Alex that she knew... She just couldn't put her finger on it... Alex started walking. \"Here, my hideout's just through here. And do you like margaritas?\" \"Uh, guys, it's really starting to get dark-\" \"Oh really Spencer? I couldn't tell.\" \"Cut it out, Fridge.\" \"I think we should make camp for the night,\" Spencer said. The others agreed. It had been quite the eventful day. \"Should one of us stay awake and keep watch?\" Sawyer asked. \"I vote Spencer.\" \"Why me?!\" \"Cause you're Bravestone!\" \"You can wake me in a couple of hours and I'll take over, if you want,\" Martha piped up. \"We'll take turns, like they do in the movies.\" \"Fine, I'll do it-\" This was followed by a scream as another bird startled him. \"Spencer, chill,\" Fridge hissed. \"This jungle is making me very uncomfortable,\" Spencer muttered. \"Join the club. Now shut up and keep watch!\" \"Fridge!\" the others scolded. \"Stop being such an asshole,\" Bethany told him. \"Oh I'm the asshole, huh? Am I? Who's the one who got us into this mess?\" \"We all did, okay. Now can we please try to get along and get some sleep?\" said Sawyer. The others agreed and they settled down for the night. \"So, you're a part of the game, right?\" Alex asked her as they sat in his crafty hideout drinking margaritas. \"Yes, I'm apart of the game, I just don't remember. Everything seems vaguely familiar though, or is starting to.\" She took another sip of her drink before asking the question she had been dying to ask. \"Who was that man? The dark-eyed one?\" She just couldn't seem to get him off her mind... She knew now, who he was, but maybe Alex repeating it would help jog her memory. It was silly, but worth a try. This was also her chance to learn more about everything here. \"Who, Van Pelt? Well, he's the game's main antagonist, besides the game itself. The task to complete the game is to keep the jewel out of his hands and return it to the jaguar statue...\" Jewel, jaguar, antagonist... It all blurred together in her mind. It was getting rather frustrating, the recognizing but not recognizing, like when you knew what you wanted to say but couldn't remember the word, even though it was on the tip of your tongue. \"Ringing any bells?\" \"Not exactly, but vaguely I suppose.\" She took another light sip of her drink. \"Sorry, I suppose I'm not very helpful.\" \"No, that's alright, I'm still learning too.\" \"And you say he's my - that we're - that he and I are-\" She didn't really want to say it, for she still didn't quite believe it yet herself... Oh who was she kidding? Alex was the third person to say it, one being the man himself, so that was conformation. She was married, and her husband was, according to Alex, the main villain of the game, and he was trying to find her. Brilliant. \"Yeah...\" Alex nodded. Fantastic - of course it just had to be the villain, right? She wished she would just remember. That would make this all so much easier. She was a character in a game, so maybe that had something to do with it. Maybe the game was just messing with her - it was probably snickering at all it was putting her through. \"How long have you been here?\" she asked him. \"Well, it's hard to say. Time's kind of funny here, so I'm guessing a few months, at least.\" She nodded. Then she began twirling the ring on her finger thoughtfully - wait, ring, what ring? Removing her left glove she was met by a cute little diamond ring. It was very pretty, but simple, didn't draw too much attention or stand out too much. She didn't know how she hadn't realized it before - that or it was just such a familiar part of her from wearing it all the time that she just didn't think about it. Well, there was even more proof. She found herself admiring it. Alex stood. \"It's getting dark. You can stay here if you'd like. It's safe.\" \"Oh thank you, that would be lovely.\" \"And well-hidden too. Van Pelt and his men haven't found me.\" \"Yet. I hope I don't get you caught.\" \"Don't worry about it. We'll figure that out if it comes to it. Goodnight Terri.\" \"Goodnight Alex. Thank you, again.\" \"Yeah, no problem. Night.\" He was just turning to head to bed when he stopped. \"I have all my memories, you have none. I'm not sure which would be worse.\" Yay, Alex is here! And sooner than in the movie ;) thank you so much for reading guys, I hope you enjoyed! And thank you for all the comments - I love hearing what you guys think! :)[Chapter 10] Chapter Eight - The Chase Continues \"If you're going to remember any place here, it'll be the bazaar,\" Alex told her the next morning as he led her through the jungle along a mountainside. She had slept late, having been exhausted from all the excitement and confusion of the previous day. The bazaar. Sounded interesting. Alex was easily the most helpful person she had met here so far. Nigel was helpful, of course, and welcoming, but with her lack of memory it was hard to understand what he was telling her. And well, the dark-eyed man and other men at the camp had only confused her more, so Alex it was. \"Oh wow,\" she breathed when she saw it. Alex grinned. \"Yeah, cool huh? Come on, you've only barely seen it.\" He led her inside the bustling, colourful marketplace, where you could find just about anything: clothing, food, weapons. \"It's brilliant.\" And it too seemed vaguely familiar, just as he had said, so that was a good sign. \"See that grate there,\" Alex said, lowering his voice and nodding to one down a narrow side street. \"There's a tunnel beneath it. If we ever get separated here, you can go through there, it's a shortcut back out to where the hideout is. There are some obstacles, but it's hidden.\" She nodded. \"Good to know. Now come on, I want to explore!\" And that was how they spent most of the afternoon, wandering through the many booths. \"So let me get this straight: your name is Alex, but you're stuck in the game as Jefferson 'Seaplane' McDonough?\" He chuckled. \"Yeah, I know, it's confusing. And you're a professor?\" \"Yes, Professor Theresa Ross, aspiring zoologist.\" They were cut off then by the humming of motorcycles - that could only mean one thing. \"Split up!\" cried Alex as the men appeared. \"You know that creek close to the hideout we passed on our way here?\" Terri nodded hastily. \"Let's plan to meet back there in a couple of days.\" \"A couple of days?!\" \"Let them lose our trail, less risk of them finding us both and the hideout.\" Okay, she saw his point. \"What if one of us doesn't make it back there?\" \"Then the other goes back to the hideout and tries to find the others before helping the other person.\" Again, she nodded. \"Okay, see you there and then. Good luck.\" \"You too.\" With that, they both took off in opposite directions. \"Hey!\" She could hear the men shouting after them. She frantically ducked behind booths and people. \"Rations! Get your rations!\" The old man selling food stepped right in front of her path. \"Sorry, can't right now!\" She sprinted past him. The grate! The method of escape Alex had told her about. If only she could find it - in her frantic state she felt so turned around that everything looked the same, and she was overwhelmed by the noise, colour, and the crowd. It was like a maze in here. But she had no time to stop and think - she couldn't make it to the escape, so she could only hope Alex could. So she did all she could do - she kept running. A gateway! Up ahead - the chase had led her all the way to the other end of the bazaar, and an open gate like in one of those medieval castles was straight ahead. She was quite impressed with herself managing to get through all these obstacles with her clumsiness - but she thought this too soon, for just a few moments later she flew over a stack of crates. The toe of her boot got caught on one of them, sending her crashing to the ground face first. She cursed herself. Looking up, she found she had been surrounded by the men, one standing between her and the open gate thus blocking her escape. Oh well done, Terri . One man with throwing knives at his belt stepped forward. \"Hello Ms. Ross. Your husband will be glad to see that you're safe.\" She jumped to her feet, snatching up her staff. \"I don't know what you're talking about-\" It wasn't exactly a lie, but it wasn't quite the truth either. She frantically searched for an escape. How was she going to get past them and slip out the gate? Then she realized the gate was being held open by a rope and pulley system. \"You're confused, you're scared. We can help you.\" \"Yeah, thanks for the offer but-\" With a swing of her staff she hit the pulley system and dove beneath the gate just as it fell, closing and separating them. She didn't look back, but heard a lot of shouting and cursing. Hmm, she was pretty good with this staff. It certainly came in handy. She didn't stop running until the noise and music from the bazaar was long gone. She knew that being all the way on the other side of the large and vast market, she was even further away from the hideout now. Alex had shown her markers along their way to the bazaar so she would know she was in the right place if she ever got lost. Good old Alex, thinking of everything. A couple of days. She had a couple of days before she had to meet him, a couple of days alone to try and get around the jungle and avoid the men. She didn't know how long it would take her to reach the hideout, now being even further away from it. She had better start walking. Unhelpfully, night was beginning to fall. She had to walk all the way around the outskirts of the bazaar, which only added more time. She was exhausted, and decided that she would only go a little further and then make camp for the night. At least with the coming of nightfall the intense heat from the day was withering, as it had begun to make her drowsy and make her head spin, and with her exhaustion and already confused state that wasn't a good mix. She was becoming so delirious that it looked like that fat vine hanging from that nearby tree was moving. She stopped walking. Wait, that wasn't a vine... She froze, growing rigid as her gaze began to follow the long, grey body until she was turning around to meet the head of a giant snake. With a cry she stumbled back, landing hard on the ground. She scrambled back as the snake lowered its head closer to her, jaws open wide, fangs bared, eyes narrowed, and tongue flicking towards her in a hiss. Then, suddenly, the snake drew back slightly, though looked as though it were fighting against it. Turning, her eyes were met by the shadow of a tall figure at the edge of the trees. She would recognize that figure anywhere - the dark-eyed man. He stepped out of the shadows and his eyes flashed emerald green, which seemed to overpower the snake for it gave one last warning hiss before it slithered away. It was only when its scaly tale disappeared that Terri's heartbeat started to slow again from its racing pace. Slowly, cautiously almost, as though he feared another outburst from her, though nonetheless concerned, he approached. \"Are you alright?\" Her gaze went from him and then back to the spot where the snake had been just moments before. \"Y-you controlled it. How?\" He reached out a gloved hand. \"I'll show you.\" She hesitated - what if she were making a great mistake? But she still had so many questions... Plus, he had just saved her, so she figured that she would be safe with him. So reaching out, she put her hand in his and held it tight. Putting those animal control skills to good use! ;) And meanwhile, the others are still wandering through the jungle lost, haha! ;) Just kidding, we'll catch up with them in the next chapter, but I wanted to get this chapter out! Hope you enjoyed, thanks so much for reading and for the comments! :)[Chapter 11] Chapter Nine - A Long and Tiring Journey They hadn't exactly gotten an early start. Their first day in the game had exhausted everyone, and with the five of them switching off sleeping and keeping watch, they wanted to make sure everyone had a turn for both sleeping and watching. The start of a long day. Now they were walking again. Bethany was in the lead with the map while the others walked behind her at varying paces. Sawyer decided to try and make conversation to pass the time. \"So, how did you get in detention?\" she asked Spencer. He cast a look behind them at Fridge. \"Uh, I did Fridge's essay for him, and we both got caught.\" \"Yikes,\" she winced. \"Yeah. He's still mad at me cause he got cut from the team, as you can probably tell.\" \"Well he's the one who had you do his homework for him. I don't think it's your fault, Spencer.\" \"Thanks. What about you?\" \"I was spray-painting graffiti in the gym.\" He gawked at this. \"That's so dangerous!\" She chuckled a little. \"Only if you get caught - which I did.\" \"Yikes. What happened?\" \"Besides detention, I have to re-paint over it. I didn't paint too much though, so it won't be too bad to clean up.\" She turned to the red-head. \"What about you, Martha? How did you get detention - if you don't mind us asking.\" \"Oh, no, that's alright. And Spencer already knows-\" \"Oh, I do? No, I mean, I do, I know that, but - you noticed me?\" \"Yeah, we're in the same class.\" He seemed touched by this, being noticed by her. \"Well, I didn't want to play football, and talked back to the coach and well, now here I am.\" \"Yeah, I heard what you were saying - overheard, like I wasn't listening in or anything. And I wasn't watching you, I mean, we're in the same class-\" Spencer told her awkwardly, stumbling over his words. Sawyer smiled, sensing that they were having a bit of a moment, and stepped back. \"Ugh, we've been at this all day,\" Fridge whined from behind them. \"It's so hot and muggy and the sun's in my eyes-\" he complained. \"Hey, at least you have a hat,\" Martha said, holding a hand over her eyes to shield them from the sun. \"Yeah, this dumbass hat. And I'm walking really slow, like painfully slow.\" \"We're getting there, don't worry,\" Bethany called from up ahead, still pouring over the map. \"Bethany are you sure you're reading that map right?\" Fridge asked. \"Uh yeah, it's one of my skills. We're getting there.\" \"Ugh, why's it taking so long?\" \"Well the game sets the pace and the rules. We've got to play by it's rules,\" Spencer said. \"It doesn't seem in any rush to have us finish. It seems to be getting us familiar with our surroundings and characters.\" \"Great, taking it's own sweet time.\" \"Maybe it's just lonely and wants friends,\" Bethany suggested. \"A game wants friends?\" \"I don't know it was just a thought.\" She shrugged. Fridge shook his head. \"Besides, what kind of 'friend' has their friends lost in a jungle and eaten by a hippo?\" \"Hey, I heard that!\" Beth called. \"Says the guy who made his friend do his homework and got them both in trouble,\" Sawyer shot back. Fridge stared at her for a moment before sending a death glare towards Spencer, and Sawyer regretted saying it. \"Look, I don't like it either, but Jumanji needs us, needs our help,\" Spencer stated. \"But why us?\" \"Well, we started it, now we have to finish it. We have to do this. And there's no one better...\" His voice grew all deep and slightly husky and he smoldered, staring past the others and off into the distance. \"Damn, that is a man right there.\" Bethany stared. \"Okay, okay, it's starting to get weird,\" Martha hissed. \"What? I can't help it.\" Bethany continued to eye Spencer. \"Why do you keep doing that?\" cried Fridge, once again breaking the trance. Spencer shook it off. He thought for a moment. \"Wait, guys, I think it's our avatars talking through us.\" \"What, now that's just stupid-\" Fridge was quick to dismiss this. \"But think about it: I keep saying things that I have no control over, and Martha, the same happened to you when you were talking about your outfit. And the smolder-\" To finish he smoldered again. \"I'm not complaining,\" mumbled Bethany. The others pondered this for a moment. \"It does kind of make sense,\" agreed Sawyer. \"That would explain why we keep talking and saying things without meaning to,\" Martha also agreed. \"Guys, the map's changing again,\" Bethany updated. \"It's getting clearer - we're getting close.\" \"That's what you keep saying,\" mumbled Fridge as the group trudged on. I know not a lot happens in this chapter, but I wanted to get some plot points across, such as it's taking them longer to complete the game than in the movie to keep their storyline aligned with Terri and Van Pelt's (who we will reconnect with in the next chapter!) and the avatars talking through them which I'm hoping will be comedic :) Hope you enjoyed, thanks so much for reading![Chapter 12] Chapter Ten - Back Where We Started Terri followed close behind him as he led her through the trees and back to the camp. It was ironic almost, that she was so willing returning to the place she had just hastily fled from. Much like the rest of the jungle, it looked very different at night, while shrouded in shadows and firelight. But still it was pretty much the same - the men bustled about, working on either their weapons or bikes. Some marched around the perimeter, keeping watch. They all paused in their work to glance at her as she walked by. \"Back to work,\" the dark-eyed man ordered, and they obeyed. Terri was thankful - their stares made her slightly uncomfortable and she found herself inching closer to him. Their arms brushed through the leather sleeve of his jacket and cotton sleeve of her shirt - heat flared up her arm at the brief contact and she was thankful for the cover of night to hide her suddenly blushing cheeks. Soon she was seated before the fire. Night had just fallen, so it wasn't late but she still felt exhausted - all this trying-to-remember-and-piece-everything-together was truly tiresome, and tedious. She hugged her knees to her chest, soaking up the warmth of the flames. It was kind of funny how during the day it could get so hot that it felt like your skin was melting off, and then at night the temperature would drop and the jungle would be plunged into a chill. She hadn't noticed she was shivering a little, though some of it was still from the encounter with the snake. She evidently wasn't the only one to notice her shivers, for moments later she felt something soft and heavy go around her shoulders and looking up found that he had removed his long leather coat and had draped it around her. \"T-thanks.\" She was touched and comforted by the gesture - although she still had her uncertainties, she knew that as long as she was with him, no harm would come to her, and that much was comforting. She pulled the coat tighter around herself and breathed in its scent, his scent: leather, smoke from the fire, jungle, cologne. It smelled - familiar. She breathed in again - maybe it would jog her memory. But then she realized she must appear rather funny, nose buried in his coat like that, so she stopped and tried to focus on the scent as it lingered in her nostrils - yes, familiar, and comforting. He asked if she was hungry, and she thanked him but declined - almost being devoured by a giant snake had cast aside her appetite. She removed her gloves and held her palms up before the flames which stung her skin with warmth. Her eyes were drawn to the flicker of the flames across the diamond on her ring. It kept surprising her, each time she looked at it, as she guessed it would have after first getting married. But she also kept forgetting about it, like she was used to having it, used to wearing it all the time. She stared at it for another moment more before concealing it again with her glove. \"Terri.\" Turning, she saw that he was gesturing for her to follow him. He led her inside the largest tent. It was quite spacious: there was a desk stacked with books and papers, a large map and compass, and lantern. There was a cot, a chair, two large trunks, and there was still lots of room. He picked up a leather-bound journal from the desk. \"This is how I can control them, the animals.\" He held the journal out to her and she flipped it open, scanning the neat handwriting: The Jaguar's Eye, jewel of Jumanji. Location: Jaguar Shrine, Jumanji \"Jaguar's Eye,\" she whispered. That was familiar. Then she noticed the framed picture sitting at the corner of the desk. It was of her - must be the one Alex was talking about. \"Well I certainly look a bit better there than I do now,\" she joked, thinking she must be a sight to be seen all sweaty, with her dirt-smeared skin, tangled hair, and wrinkled clothes - well, she was comfortable enough around him to make jokes, so that was a good sign. He remained serious. \"No, you're beautiful.\" This comment made her blush and she didn't quite know what to say, so she uttered a small, \"t-thank you.\" \"You look tired,\" he observed, watching her rub her eyes. \"Yeah, it's been a long day. A long couple of days.\" \"Go ahead, lie down, get some rest. You can take the cot, I'll sleep on the ground.\" \"Oh, is that how we did it before?\" Did they alternate perhaps, one sleeping on the cot and one on the ground, and then switching the next night? \"Well, no, but with you not remembering, I don't want you to be uncomfortable...\" \"Sharing the same bed,\" she finished. He nodded. There was a slightly awkward silence. As thoughtful a suggestion as it was, it was strange, both could feel it. She shook her head. \"Thank you, that's sweet, and thoughtful, but it's not really fair. I mean we are married, I know that now, I just don't remember. I'm fine with us sharing, I don't mind.\" \"You're sure?\" \"Yes.\" He nodded. \"Alright.\" Then he nodded to the trunks. \"Your trunk is there, if you want to change.\" Going over and kneeling before the trunks, she opened hers. Inside she found a limited selection of clothes - she had packed lightly. She found a tank top to sleep in and removed her hat from where it hung by the string around her neck, as well as her gloves, scarf, and boots, and his coat. She was just about to remove her shirt when luckily, she remembered she wasn't alone. She glanced over to see that he was still there, sorting through some papers on the desk. She guessed that, being married, they didn't mind changing in front of each other. But now was different. \"Um, would you mind stepping outside for a moment while I change?\" He looked up, he too becoming aware of their slightly compromising situation. \"Oh, yes, of course - sorry.\" \"N-no, that's alright,\" she said, just as he ducked out of the tent. Well done, way to make it brilliantly awkward between you two! But it wasn't her fault, it was her bloody memory's. It didn't take her long to change - she was glad to wrap his coat around her again. Then she began wandering around the tent, curious. Then she realized he was probably still standing outside waiting to come back in so she peeked her head out. \"You can come back now.\" He followed her back inside. \"What side do you usually take?\" she asked, nodding to the cot. \"Uh, the right side, but it doesn't matter.\" \"No, that's alright.\" She climbed onto the left side. He removed his boots before blowing out the candle, plunging the tent into darkness and silence - the only sounds that could be heard were the jungle noise outside. The cot dipped a little when he climbed onto it from the other side. She scooted over until she was lying right at the very edge - if she rolled slightly, she would fall off. The cot was just big enough for the two of them, just . She guessed from this that they usually slept close, and not spread out like they were now, both lying right at the very edge, almost falling off. Should she say goodnight? Should she say anything? She tried to adjust her position - as she did, she kicked him. \"Sorry!\" This was followed moments later by her elbowing him. She winced. \"Sorry...\" She heard him chuckle. \"It's alright. Goodnight Terri.\" \"G-goodnight.\" She still had his coat wrapped around her. She fell asleep wrapped in its warm embrace. Careful Terri, there might be some bugs in that coat ;) haha! Awww, the start of some slightly awkward but nice moments to come! And don't worry, I know it's super awkward right now, but it will get less so and more flirty between them soon, I promise ;) Thanks so much for reading and I hope you enjoyed - oh and remember how I got excited that Bobby was in 'Ant-Man'? Well I couldn't help it and started writing a story with his character, so if you're interested please check it out, thanks![Chapter 13] Chapter Eleven - Help Me Remember The next morning she awoke to sunlight and sounds of a bustling camp. Rising to a seated position she found that the other side of the cot and rest of the tent were empty so she guessed he was already up and about. She hesitated for a moment before reaching out and laying her hand on the empty side of the mattress - a warmth lingered, signalling he hadn't gotten up long ago. Part of her wanted to get up and about as well, but another part of her wanted to be left alone. She went outside and she would have all the intimidating men to face, as well as him. Part of her was nervous about facing him again, but the other part was strangely eager. Her curiosity eventually got the better of her. That, and she figured that he would eventually come in and check on her, so she got up and changed back into her shirt and vest and left the tent. She actually felt she had slept rather well, despite being in a still unfamiliar situation and lying next to a man who she was married to but didn't remember. The camp was a busy place this morning, lots of chatter and tinkering about. This time, the men all seemed too busy with whatever they were doing to pay attention to her, for which she was thankful. She wore his coat now, didn't just have it draped over her shoulders. He was taller than her so if it brushed the ground when he wore it it must look like a wedding dress train on her. That, and the sleeves sagged over her hands. Despite this though, it was comfortable. Comfortable and comforting. She searched the faces for his and eventually found him sitting off to the side, isolating himself almost from the rest of the group. He was sitting at a small table, watching a few bugs skitter across the tabletop. He had a content look on his face, concentrated, almost like he was sharing a connection and conversing with them. Then she remembered the animal-control. She had to admit - but only to herself - that it was pretty cool. This was her husband: intriguing, handsome, and had the ability to control animals, and she loved animals. Really, he was kind of perfect. She almost felt strange interrupting and was about to turn away, her nerves suddenly getting the better of her now, until he looked up and saw her. The bugs skittered away and he rose to his feet. \"Terri. Good morning.\" \"Morning.\" \"Did you sleep well?\" \"Yes, very well actually, thanks.\" She took a step forward but stumbled when she stepped on the hem of the coat, tripping slightly. He reached out to steady her, but she regained her balance. \"I-I realized I never said 'thank you', for saving me. From the snake.\" Thank goodness he had come along, if not, the snake may very well have devoured her! This thought made her shudder. \"I also wanted to give this back.\" She removed and held out his coat. \"Thank you for letting me borrow it. It's a bit big on me.\" She chuckled and handed it back. \"Thank you.\" He took it back. \"Are you hungry?\" It was then that she realized she hadn't eaten since yesterday. \"Starving, actually.\" Soon she was settled with a breakfast of biscuits and strong coffee, which she practically inhaled she was so hungry. It was still early morning and already the heat hung heavily over the camp. \"I think I might explore a bit around the camp, if that's alright,\" she said. \"Try and refresh my memory.\" He nodded. \"Of course, take your time. Would you like me to come with you, or would you prefer to be alone?\" He must have sensed her hesitance, for then he added. \"I won't be offended if you'd rather be alone.\" \"I think I would, for now. Thanks. I think I need to do this on my own.\" He nodded. \"I understand. Don't hesitate to come find me if you need anything.\" \"B-but m-maybe after you could tell me a bit about us...\" Her voice grew soft. At this, he smiled, which made her heart flutter. \"I'd love to.\" Judging by the look in his eyes, he had some stories to tell. It was settled then. She first went back into the tent - their tent she realized - to resume the exploration she had begun last night. She figured that was a good place to start. She went over and opened her trunk again, taking everything out and examining it all carefully. There was mostly just clothes, but a few books, mostly on zoology, as well as a journal. Opening it, she found that it was like her diary. Perfect! She eagerly began to read: My application was rejected again, I got another letter today. That's the third one. They still say the same thing: I don't have enough experience in the field to teach zoology. As always, Russell says not to let it discourage me. Sweetheart. Russell and Bravestone are no longer working together anymore, and I honestly feel a little guilty - they had an argument today, Russell finally confronting him about what his problem towards me is. We've never gotten along very well, I've made an effort but he hasn't, and I don't know what or even if I did anything to make him dislike me. Russell says that's impossible, for anyone to dislike me. Easy for him to say, but it's sweet nonetheless. Apparently Bravestone's begun his own lone search for the jewel, and now Russell's all anxious about it. He believes that since he started this search, he should finish it. Bravestone doesn't care about the jewel, he says, he just wants to try and beat Russell to it. It sounds rather competitive to me, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little nervous. Russell worked late again today, spent all day at the university. I'm getting a little worried about him, I think he's working himself too hard. He says he has a lead on the jewel - he's been researching it for years, even before we were married and before that. I'll keep a close eye on him - it's either he stays at the university, or he comes home and locks himself away in the study. It's not healthy. I guess it really was a lead - Russell now believes he knows the location of the jewel, and he's hurriedly arranging an expedition to the jungles of Jumanji. He's hired a Jumanji field guide to lead the expedition. I'm actually rather looking forward to it - it'll be an adventure! I don't know how long we'll be gone, but it will be good for us to get out of the city and have a change of scenery for a while. It also might just be the perfect opportunity for me to get my field work requirement for becoming a zoologist - finally! Let's see them reject my application after that! And I hear that Jumanji is home to some rare species - maybe we'll encounter a few of them. It's about a week until we're scheduled to leave - Russell suddenly expressed a concern about me coming along, says he's worried something will happen to me. I think he's overreacting. And besides, we've already made all the arrangements, and I don't want to give up this opportunity. And obviously I don't want to be stuck at home while he goes adventuring! She paused there, already feeling a bit overwhelmed. She'd read each entry slowly and carefully, fearful of missing something important. She decided to take a break and read the rest another time - better to take smaller steps and try and remember smaller pieces than everything all at once. Again, she found herself rather eager to be in his company again, that and she eagerly awaited hearing what he had to say about them, he, her husband, the perfect source really. So with that, she left the tent in search of him. When she found him he was staring at her - she'd caught him doing so all through breakfast. She lifted her hand in a little, shy wave which snapped him from his trance. \"Sorry, I didn't mean to stare. I hope I didn't make you uncomfortable.\" She smiled. \"No, quite the opposite actually. You've made me feel very welcome here.\" \"You are welcome here, this is our home away from home on this journey.\" \"I hope I'm not in the way.\" \"You're not,\" he assured her. \"Will you tell me about us now?\" \"Gladly. What would you like to know?\" \"Everything.\" He chuckled. \"Alright.\" \"I hope that's not too bold of a request.\" \"Not at all.\" They chatted for hours, over dinner, and then continuing on into the evening. By the end he had her laughing and joking along with him, and she felt much closer to him that she had. He told her that they had been together for six years, married for three of those years. They both taught as professors at the university in classrooms across the hall from each other, and that was how they had met. She wished she remembered. He told her about his work studying the jewel and how it had brought them here. She didn't want him to stop, just wanted him to keep speaking fondly of their time together. Mostly, his words made her blush and smile - she was sitting with a man who evidently loved her very much, and she was beginning to see why she loved him too, and she felt like that was a great accomplishment. \"Well, that was certainly very informative,\" she said at the end of his story. \"Thank you, that helped a lot.\" \"You're welcome, I'm glad.\" \"It is rather tiring though, trying to keep it all straight and remember, so I think I'm going to go to bed now.\" \"Alright, I'll be there in a little while.\" He leaned in to what she guessed was to kiss her goodnight, but then drew back again when he realized. She found herself to be almost disappointed, but she understood and accepted his thoughtfulness. Instead he said, \"goodnight Terri.\" \"Goodnight - Russell.\" Raises eyebrows, haha! ;) See, I told you it would start getting more romantic! ;) Whew, that chapter took me a little longer than I thought, and it was also longer, but that's alright! I didn't want it to feel too rushed between them, but then again they are married, she just can't remember, so I think it's okay! I hope you enjoyed and thanks so much for reading! :)[Chapter 14] Chapter Twelve - In My Heart, But Not In My Head The next morning when she rose from a deep sleep she found that she had shifted over considerably. She was rather comfortable and gave a content, groggy sigh as she snuggled closer. Glancing upward, she was met by his face, content in sleep, just above hers, hers which was pressed into his chest, her hand resting against his neck, fingertips slipped beneath the collar of his shirt. Oh God... She had rolled over in her sleep and right into his embrace without even noticing, and she guessed that he in his sleep had wrapped his arms around her. It had felt so natural to them both that neither even realized it. With a yelp that startled him awake, she jumped out of his arms and, being the ever clumsy person she was, she fell back off the cot and onto the ground with a thud . He sat bolt upright with a start, looking confused and disoriented, just as she was stumbling to her feet. \"What happened?\" he cried. \"We were sleeping together!\" she blurted. \"Well not really - well, yes, but not like - oh never mind! I mean - we were cuddling...\" Sure, she was definitely more comfortable around him now, but this was moving a little too quickly for comfort... \"Oh...\" \"Yeah... I'm sorry, that was probably an overreaction. I just, wasn't expecting...\" Stop talking, stop talking right now! You've embarrassed yourself enough! The cuddling was kind of nice, to be perfectly honest, she just hadn't given herself much time to enjoy it before freaking out. \"I-I'm sorry...\" \"For what?\" \"Uh, waking you...\" Shut up! She was only making it worse. \"And startling you... Sorry.\" Good Lord she was awkward. \"Am I always this awkward around you?\" She had to ask. He chuckled. \"No.\" \"Oh. Good.\" This was true though, she hadn't been this awkward last night when he was telling her about them. She would even say she had been a little flirty at times. They met eyes for a moment before both laughing a little. \"Well, now that we're up-\" He stood. \"Yeah...\" He was staring again. \"Sorry. It's just - I'm worried you're not really here, that it's just my mind playing tricks, or the game messing with me.\" \"No, I'm really here. Well, mostly, still working on the memory part. And you were just holding me, so I'd say that's proof.\" \"True.\" They both left the tent at the same time this morning. After both trying to step out at the same time and bumping shoulders, he gave a sweep of his arm and let her go first. \"AH!\" As soon as she stepped out she was met by the vulture perched right above the tent. \"I don't think that bird likes me.\" It squawked in reply as if to say \"no.\" After another simple breakfast, though this one filled with multiple shared glances between the two, Terri resumed her reading from yesterday, curling up with her journal by the fire pit. After his stories everything she had written now made a lot more sense, and she went back and re-read the previous entries as well. We left for Jumanji today. Russell hired a band of mercenaries to assist us on the journey - there's a whole lot of them, easily fifty. Heck, he's got a whole army of them! I think he's overreacting, but he seems a little paranoid that something's going to happen on this quest. I'm not sure how I feel about this - they all seem pretty intimidating to me. We arrived in Jumanji today - it's beautiful! As soon as we stepped off the ship I couldn't wait to begin exploring. We met our field guide, Nigel, who's lovely. We've already seen evidence of or actually seen so many different animals, I got so excited! I've made sure to have my pencil and notebook ready to record everything! Russell surprised me last night and took me to the bazaar where we spent the night at the inn there. He said he wanted to have some 'us' time, time to ourselves. Although she couldn't remember what it was she had written about, she was pretty sure she knew how that night had gone. She felt her entire body grow hot and she quickly turned to the next entry. I'm really starting to think this jewel doesn't exist - I haven't written in a little while and it's because it's all the same: frustration and arguments. Russell keeps getting more and more frustrated which isn't good, he doesn't need all that stress. Not to mention it's putting a strain on us; we keep getting into arguments, and I'm becoming awfully homesick. He just won't accept that it's not real - I think it's safe to say he's obsessed with finding it. Luckily we have Nigel, who's as chipper as ever. Though I think even he's beginning to get discouraged. That was the final entry. It must have been right before her disappearance. Terri sat back and thought about all she had read, trying to turn the words into images. Come on, remember, you can do it. \"Did the reading help?\" Russell joined her. \"A little, I think. I still only have blurred, vague images, nothing's clear - yet. I'm trying not to lose hope.\" Then she thought of something. \"Can I see your ring?\" He removed his glove and showed her - it was a simple silver band. She held up her own hand next to his. \"They go nicely together.\" \"Yes, they do.\" \"Will you tell me more about us?\" He thought for a moment. \"I think I've told you everything, I'm afraid.\" \"Tell me something again.\" He was more than happy to oblige and launched back into his storytelling. Soon though, she found that she had tuned him out and was lost just looking at him. It got dark pretty early here, so they lit a fire - the way the flames flickered across his tan face, casting shadows across his hair, and those eyes... She hoped that even when her memory returned she would still get lost in his eyes, but something told her she would. She didn't know where it came from, this feeling, but suddenly she wanted to- Kiss him. She blushed with this realization. Something deep inside her was urging her. All these feelings for him she may not recognize, but they were starting to feel right. She knew in her heart, just not in her head. And wasn't that what mattered? Running with it, she began to lean in, and the next thing she knew, he had stopped talking and his lips met hers in a kiss, one full of passion, of longing, one that was only becoming more and more heated. The thrill was like experiencing your first kiss all over again, or, what she imagined of course. He cupped her face in his hands, deepening the kiss. She was just reaching up to hold his hand when the realization of what she had done struck her, and she pulled away mid-kiss. \"I'm sorry,\" he said after a moment, thinking he had made her uncomfortable. \"No, no it's not your fault.\" Now she was ashamed. That had been so cruel of her. \"I-I'm so sorry. That was thoughtless of me, I don't know what came over me.\" First the morning cuddles, now this. Was it her memory, desperately trying to make her remember? Or was it just the game wanting her to make a fool out of herself for its amusement? She glanced around - thankfully it seemed that the men were too busy going about their own business to have seen them snogging. Good, she was already embarrassed enough. She was on her feet before she even realized. \"Perhaps I should go...\" She didn't want to, but - ugh, she just wished she would bloody remember! What made it worse was that she felt she was so close to remembering, so close, but she still couldn't. \"I feel like I'm taunting you by being here and I'm just sort of a burden, and-\" He jumped to his feet. \"Please, don't go. Don't leave. I don't know what I would do if I lost you again.\" \"It's not fair though-\" \"I would rather have you here, trying to remember, than not at all. At least then I know you're safe.\" She nodded slowly. \"I feel safe here.\" \"You are safe here.\" There was a pause. \"How long was I gone for?\" \"Months. Long, excruciating months.\" Months. To him, she'd been gone months, for her, she'd been gone years. That familiar painful ache settled again deep in her chest, that longing to be here. But now that she was here, she couldn't remember, and she could no longer tell what that ache was for. But she was pretty sure she knew now. \"It just seemed like that kiss had been long waited for.\" \"It was.\" \"I'm sorry, again.\" \"Please don't be, it's not your fault.\" She smiled a little. \"Thank you. Goodnight.\" She pressed a gentle kiss to his cheek before disappearing inside their tent. Yay, they're making progress! ;) What do you think so far? We'll catch up with the others in the next chapter - whew, this parallel storyline thing is fun but tricky, trying to keep everything aligned in time! Thank you so much for reading and I hope you enjoyed! And thank you for all the reviews too! :)[Chapter 15] Chapter Thirteen - What is This Game?! The next morning they got a bit of an earlier start - if the game wanted them to play by its rules, they had best not waste any time. \"Anything Bethany?\" Spencer called. \"Almost there.\" She was in the lead once again, pouring over the map. \"Yeah, sure,\" muttered Fridge. \"No, really! See, it says, The Mighty Roar- \" The drums started then, drawing everyone to a sharp halt and snapping their gazes up to the sky. Then they cut out as suddenly as they had started. \"I don't like that,\" declared Fridge after a beat of silence. \"I'm done!\" Spencer ignored him. \"Okay Bethany, which way?\" \"Uh, well, right here I think-\" BOOM! CRASH! The whole group jumped and yelped as something flew past their faces and exploded only mere meters away. \"What the he-\" Sawyer began, but was cut off when a motorcycle appeared out of nowhere and drove straight at them. And it wasn't alone - at least a dozen more came roaring down the hill after it - all towards them. \"What is this game?!\" yelled Fridge. \"RUN!\" But everyone was already way ahead of Spencer. Soon the whole group was tearing down the hill as fast as their legs would carry them. \"Come on legs!\" cried Fridge as everyone passed by him. \"WHY AM I RUNNING SO SLOW?!\" \"This sucks!\" yelled Bethany as they ran into the trees, the motorcycles still in hot pursuit. \"Split up!\" Bethany and Martha went one way, and Spencer, Sawyer, and Fridge all went the other. \"Those guys have huge guns!\" Spencer hissed as the trio ducked behind some bushes for cover. \"Oh really? Is that what those are Spencer?\" Fridge hissed back. \"Hey, your backpack!\" \"Yeah don't remind me-\" \"No, you have my weapons!\" Now Fridge understood. \"Oh, oh yeah. Let's see what we've got-\" He reached into the pack and withdrew a wooden object. \"What the-\" \"Boomerang!\" Spencer grabbed it out of his hand excitedly. \"It's one of my strengths! Here, watch this.\" Drawing his arm back he then launched the boomerang at the group of bikes who had followed the three. It sailed smoothly past them, disappearing into the trees and alerting the bikers of their presence. \"Now what?!\" Fridge cried as the chase hastily resumed. \"Now what Spencer?! You want me to look in here and see if I have a hacky sack that you can do absolutely nothing with-\" \"DUCK!\" Sawyer's shout saved the group as, right then, Spencer's boomerang appeared again, whipping over their heads and taking out the group of bikes. Spencer couldn't believe it. \"Whoa! It worked!\" Sawyer laughed. \"It sure did! Think you can do that again?\" They ducked behind another patch of bushes when more motorcycles appeared. They just kept coming! \"Come on, we've gotta go-\" Spencer began sneaking away. \"I can't outrun those guys!\" cried Fridge. \"You two have speed on your side.\" Right. The two exchanged a glance. \"Uh - oh, here, get on my back,\" Spencer offered. Fridge just stared back. \"Oh hell no!\" \"I'll carry you, come on-\" \"I would rather die!\" Fridge declared. \"Just get on his back!\" cried Sawyer. \"Oh nope, I'm gonna die-\" The bikers were coming. The two took off again, Spencer throwing Fridge on his back and piggybacking him despite his protests, which didn't stop. \"Ahhh! SPENCER PUT ME DOWN!\" \"There's Martha and Bethany!\" called Sawyer. Why had they stopped running? They were still being chased. It quickly became clear though: the chase had taken them to a cliff's edge. It wasn't extremely high, and there was water below, but it still wasn't an appealing option. It was, however, their only option. \"We have to jump,\" Martha cried. \"Are you crazy?!\" screeched Bethany. \"I would literally rather do anything else right now,\" said Spencer. \"We don't have a choice!\" \"No!\" \"We have to - JUMP!\" With that, Martha was gone. She fell down into the water below with a splash! \"MARTHA!\" Bethany followed suit. Sawyer went next. \"Spencer jump!\" yelled Fridge. Spencer tried to protest, but the next thing he knew Fridge had pushed him off the cliff and both went plunging down, Fridge still on his back. It turned out that this had been a successful way out of the chase, for the motorcycles finally left them alone. As they sped away back into the jungle, the shaken group was hauling themselves out of the water. \"Guys, I've taken in a lot of water-\" Spencer was spluttering while Fridge yelled at him. \"That was the most humiliating moment of my life! Don't you do that again - ever!\" \"Oh my God - Martha-\" Sawyer cried when she caught sight of Martha's bloody chest. She'd been shot. \"T-they got me-\" Sawyer jumped when, suddenly, Martha vanished from her side. \"W-what?\" No one knew what to do or say. \"What just happened to her?\" \"Did she die? Is she dead?!\" \"Wait a second-\" Spencer looked up to the sky. There was the ringing sound again and moments later Martha made a swift landing - right on top of Fridge. \"HEY! Get off of me!\" \"Martha! Are you okay?\" \"Yeah, I think so-\" She stumbled off of Fridge. \"Hey! Anybody care if I'm okay?!\" demanded Fridge as he awkwardly got to his feet from where Martha had knocked him down. \"What am I, a human landing-pack?\" Spencer reached out to inspect Martha's wrist. \"That's what I thought. These tattoos on our arms are our life count. We each have three lives guys.\" \"W-what happens if we lose all of our lives?\" Martha asked. \"Well usually in a game that would mean game over...\" \"Game over? Wait, are you saying we can actually die in here?!\" cried Fridge. \"I-I don't know...\" \"You don't know Mr. Video Game Genius?!\" \"Well I've never been stuck in one okay! But yes, I think, if we're not careful, we could die here. That's my main concern right now.\" \"Well we'd better find the missing piece then,\" Martha announced. \"It looks like there's a village a ways up ahead,\" Bethany said, once again consulting the map. \"That must be the bazaar.\" \"Let's go then.\" \"Wait,\" called Fridge. \"I've got to take a leak first.\" There was silence amongst the group until Bethany sighed. \"I've been dreading this all day, but so do I.\" Haha, we all know how that goes ;) I realized I forgot to mention the life-tattoos before - sorry guys! And sorry for the delay - I'm back now from my summer course so (hopefully) there will be more regular updates now (we have another Van Pelt and Terri chapter coming up next ;)) As always thanks so much for reading, hope you enjoyed! :)[Chapter 16] Chapter Fourteen - Memories The memories wove themselves into her dreams, a jumble of non-linear memories all following a different timeline. At least at first. Soon however, they became linear... It was a rainy London morning. The university campus was speckled in umbrellas bobbing as people made their way across the courtyard. The two walked hand-in-hand to work like they always did. \"I will see you later, Professor,\" he said. \"Yes, have a good morning, Professor,\" she replied. They chuckled and shared a kiss before parting and both going their separate ways into their classrooms. Time for another day. Both were highly-acclaimed professors at the university - there were long lists of students waiting to get into the already full animal kingdom and animal biology classes with Professor Ross, and there were lists just as long for classes on archaeology and exploration with Professor Van Pelt. Their classrooms were right across the hall from each other, which was how they had met. The head of the department introduced them and they were instantly charmed by each other. It had taken a great amount of courage for him to cross that hall and finally ask her if she would like to go out with him - now, six years later, he was still convinced it was the best decision he had ever made. She may not be his beloved Terri otherwise. ... \"This arrived for you.\" Russell brought a letter for Terri to her classroom. \"Thank you.\" She took and inspected it. \"Oh! It's about my application. Let's see, I've a fifty-fifty chance: acceptance, or another rejection. Which will it be this time around? What is it they say? Third time's the charm?\" Both waited expectantly as she tore open the envelope and produced the letter. She cleared her throat before reading aloud. \"'Dear Professor Theresa Ross. Thank you for your application. After careful consideration of your application-'\" Here she trailed off, and her voice notably changed. \"-'We have decided, due to your lack of field experience, that we will set your application aside for now and search for someone who better fits our requirements. Thank you again for applying, and do try again next time.'\" There was a silent moment of defeat as she folded up the letter again and returned it to the envelope. She chuckled half-heartedly. \"Well, I guess it's not always third time's the charm.\" \"I'm sorry, Love.\" She gave him a small smile. \"Thanks.\" \"Don't let it discourage you.\" \"That's what you say every time.\" \"And every time you try again.\" ... Bravestone was just leaving Russell's office when Terri appeared in the doorway. \"Oh, hi Bravestone,\" she greeted. He responded much less cheerfully, giving her a brief nod before brushing past and leaving the office. Terri stood for a moment before going to join Russell over at his desk. \"I don't think he likes me very much.\" Russell looked up from the papers he was marking. \"Nonsense.\" \"Well, it seems that way.\" \"Impossible.\" He remained firm. \"You're sure you're not just saying that because you're my husband?\" \"Of course not! Maybe he's just jealous that for once a woman favoured me over him.\" \"Russell!\" \"What, it's true.\" He smiled, but she still looked unsure. \"Hey, don't let it bother you. His loss.\" ... The partners were in the middle of having an argument when there came a knock at the door and a smiling Terri peeked her head in. \"Am I interrupting something?\" \"Yes-\" \"No Darling, come on in.\" Russell waved her in. The argument ceased, but now Bravestone gave a frustrated sigh. Anger from the argument fueled Russell's next words. \"You might try to be nice to my wife for once.\" This was met by tense silence. Terri's face fell. \"Oh no, please, I don't want to be a source of dispute between you-\" \"Well it's too late for that,\" said Bravestone. She was about to retort, but Russell jumped in ahead of her. \" What did she ever do to you? You haven't been nice to her once.\" \"She's distracting you-\" \"Distracting me?\" Russell scoffed. Terri was quickly growing uncomfortable. \"Well I'm sorry you don't have a home life to go back to.\" \"Russell!\" she cried. \"Okay, now you're stepping out of line-\" \"Unlike you, I don't let work consume my life.\" Now both men were approaching each other. Despite Russell being rather tall himself, Bravestone towered over him - he seemed to tower over everyone. Terri could see his fists clenching at his sides - he looked ready to throw a punch and the victim would surely be Russell. \"Stop, please stop-\" She jumped in between them and turned to the taller man. \"Bravestone, maybe it's best if you leave-\" \"She's right,\" Russell agreed. \"Get the hell out of my office.\" Glaring down at the couple once more, Bravestone turned and left, for good this time. \"Good riddance,\" Russell mumbled under his breath. Terri had one hand on his arm and the other on his chest, and she could feel the tension coursing through him. It faded some once Bravestone was gone, but not all the way. \"I'm sorry, Love.\" He shook his head, placing his hand over hers on his arm. \"It was growing increasingly tense between us. Maybe it's for the best.\" ... A few months later, Russell came home from work in a panic. \"He's going after the bloody jewel-\" He practically threw off his coat and didn't even bother with his shoes as he dashed into his study, zipping past Terri who almost dropped the plate of their dinner she had just pulled out of the oven. Leaving it to cool and removing her apron and oven mitts she followed him to his study. He was already seated at the desk, frantically flipping through papers. \"What happened?\" \"He's after the jewel!\" \"Who?\" \"Bravestone.\" \"Oh-\" \"He's putting together a team - this is my work, I started it. I'm not going to let him finish it and take credit for it like he did with everything else.\" A few weeks later there was an article in the newspaper: WORLD FAMOUS ARCHAEOLOGIST AT IT AGAIN. It described how after a brief break, the legendary Dr. Bravestone had returned to the field, new team and all. The couple were just sitting down to morning tea. Russell took one look at the article before tearing it from the rest of the paper, crumpling it up, and tossing it across the room, it sailing past Terri who was just coming in with the teapot. \"I was going to read that,\" she said, gesturing to the now half-torn newspaper. He only grumbled in response. She picked up the crumpled page and scanned it. \"Looks like quite the group he's gathered: a commando, a pilot and mechanic team, a professor, a marksman, and oh - a zoologist!\" He gave a frustrated sigh at her enthusiasm. \"Well, luckily he's not the jewel expert. You are.\" And thus began the obsession with finding the jewel. He saw it as a race, one that he had to win. \"It's not a competition,\" she would constantly remind him. \"I can't let him get to it first. I'm the one who's done all the research. It wouldn't be fair.\" She saw his point. \"No, it wouldn't be.\" A couple of weeks after that she was going over some notes for her next lecture when the door to her classroom suddenly flew open, making her jump. Russell stood there, a huge smile on his face. \"I've got a lead! I'm a step ahead of Bravestone!\" \"How do you mean?\" He grinned. \"Pack your bags, my darling. We're going to Jumanji!\" Sorry it's taken me so long, but here's the chapter that I've been excited for (this way, we get a glimpse of their life outside the game storyline :)). There'll be another memory sequence the next time we catch up with Terri and Van Pelt too (it'll be romantic ;))! I was having a bit of difficulty because I've decided to add a major plot point, and character, part way through now - this is why I really need to outline everything before I start writing, haha! But hopefully it won't be too much trouble to add, so that's what I'll be working on :) Thanks so much for reading and I hope you enjoyed! ","Summary":" Welcome everyone! :) So myself and another writer have teamed up and have started writing 'Jumanji'"},{"Movie":"Jumanji","Title":"Heart of the Jungle - Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Author":"FantasyandHistory","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12799401","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hello and welcome to my latest story, based on 2017's 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle'! So I was super excited for this movie and started thinking about this story even before it came out just based on the trailers, that's when the idea of Vera started to emerge. Then I saw it and really enjoyed it - it was so much fun! - and now I have become even more inspired and the whole video game scenario has been an interesting and exciting writing challenge! I'm really excited for this story and hope you enjoy! :) So the full summary wouldn't fit in the story description, so here's the full summary: \"We're here to help you.\" \"Oh...\" When Spencer, Martha, Bethany, and Fridge get stuck in a video game as adventuring avatars, they have to venture through the jungle and join forces with a well-accomplished archaeologist to end a curse and save the game - the only way they'll ever go home. The only thing is, Dr. Bailey claims to not need or want their help in the quest, especially Dr. Bravestone, who she knows from before... That complicates things, that, and the fact that she doesn't realize it's a game... Can the thrown-together group trust each other long enough to stay alive, break the curse, end the game, and get home? Might later have a little romance between Spencer/Dr. Bravestone and my character, or at least some flirting :) Based on 2017's 'Jumanji'! And I do not own 'Jumanji' or any of the characters! Only my character, Vera :) Thanks! So if you're still with me, I sincerely hope you enjoy 'Heart of the Jungle'! Thanks so much! One: The Task \"Welcome to Jumanji!\" A cheerful looking man greeted them, pulling up in a Jeep whose doors promptly popped open, beckoning them inside. \"Well come on then!\" he urged them with a friendly smile when they stared uncertainly back. This was enough to convince them and they piled into the Jeep. They were barely inside when the doors snapped shut and they drove on. \"Ah, Dr. Bravestone!\" the man exclaimed as he drove, turning to Spencer sitting beside him in the passenger seat. \"The legendary archaeologist and international explorer himself! Known across the Seven Continents for your skill and bravery and successful expeditions!\" \"Uh, hi,\" Spencer managed. \"Delighted to make your acquaintance! Nigel Billingsley at your service. Welcome to Jumanji!\" He tipped his hat. \"Uh, is there a seatbelt?\" Spencer asked. The man wasn't exactly driving slow, and the road was rather bumpy, not really even a road at all, just a messy pathway through the jungle. \"I can't tell you what an honour it is to finally meet you!\" the man, Nigel, continued. \"And I'm not embarrassed to say that you're even more dashing in person!\" \"Um, thanks...\" \"I've been so anxious for your arrival!\" \"Could you keep your eyes on the road please-\" The man kept turning to Spencer to speak to him, therefore not able to watch where he was driving. \"Thank goodness you're here! As you know, Jumanji is in grave danger!\" \"It is?\" \"We're counting on you to lift the curse!\" \"Curse?\" repeated Fridge, echoing everyone's thoughts. \"What curse?\" \"Ah, Franklin 'Mouse' Finbar, delighted to make your acquaintance!\" Nigel chirped, smiling at Fridge through the rear-view mirror. \"'Mouse'?\" repeated Fridge. \"Uh, I think you mean 'Moose.' It's Moose.\" \"My good fellow, I do believe it's 'Mouse'. A nickname given for your diminutive stature, and adorable manner-\" The girls tried to hold back a snort of laughter. \"-I knew you'd be here - Dr. Bravestone's assistant.\" \"His what now?\" \"Ah yes, Dr. Bravestone never goes anywhere without his loyal and trusty sidekick! Ever since Dr. Bravestone rescued you from a warlord in the jungles of Peru, you haven't left his side!\" Fridge looked utterly dumbfounded by this. \"Welcome to Jumanji!\" \"Excuse me, have you seen my phone anywhere?\" Bethany tried. \"Ah, Professor Sheldon Oberon, delighted to make your acquaintance! I've been so anxious for your arrival!\" Nigel was practically bouncing in his seat. The group couldn't tell if it was from excitement, because he was so anxious as he kept saying, or the bumpy road. \"Welcome to Jumanji!\" \"What's with this guy?\" Bethany whispered. \"Yeah, why does he keep repeating himself?\" agreed Martha. \"And you as well, Ruby Roundhouse, killer of men! Delighted to make your acquaintance! Welcome to Jumanji!\" \"I think he must be an NPC,\" Spencer explained. \"A what? English please!\" demanded Bethany. \"A non-player character, like he's a part of the game. So anything he says is limited to a series of programmed responses.\" \"Great...\" \"Yeah,\" added Fridge sarcastically. \"Got it. It's all clear now.\" \"Thank goodness you're here,\" Nigel cried, turning back to Spencer, once again repeating himself. \"As you know from the letter I sent you, Jumanji is in grave danger. We need your help to lift the curse!\" \"Letter? I don't have a let-\" Spencer gasped suddenly as, just like that, a letter appeared in his hand. \"What does it say?\" asked Martha. The others leaned in to look closer. \"Maybe it'll have some answers.\" Spencer unfolded it and began to read. \"Uh, right. 'Dr. Bravestone, I am writing to you urgently...\" His voice faded as Nigel's overlapped his and began explaining everything to them. Suddenly, the Jeep melted away and a new scene appeared before them, almost like a movie. \"Uh, guys...\" \"Whoa, what's happening?\" \"What the hell is going on?\" \"It must be a cut-scene,\" Spencer explained. \"A lot of games have them to provide story details. It's like a little movie clip.\" \"...Regarding the desperate situation in Jumanji. We need your help at once! My name is Nigel Billingsley. I am a Jumanji field guide,\" Nigel's voice-over continued. \" And I was recently hired to help lead an expedition run by your former partners, Professor Russel Van Pelt...\" The group saw the very Jeep they were in now driving through the dense jungle, surrounded by what looked like military men, heavily armed. A man with dark eyes and wearing a long coat emerged from the Jeep, a shining silver handgun resting against his hip. They guessed that this was Van Pelt. \"...And Dr. Vera Bailey...\" Next, a young woman with an excited glow in her eyes and dressed for adventure joined Van Pelt. They looked like total opposites, she with her bright blue shirt and yellow hair, and he with his dark hair, dark clothes, and dark eyes. \"...They were in search of the greatest treasure in all of Jumanji,\" Nigel's voice-over continued to explain. \" The legendary jewel of Jumanji, the fabled Jaguar's Eye, a jewel of immense power, the heart of the jungle itself, and the source of its life and power. I was helping them navigate and look for it. Van Pelt told me that he wanted to find the jewel in order to study it, but little did I know he had other plans...\" The clip panned out over the jungle, then zoomed in again to show some of the soldiers, as well as Van Pelt, slashing away at the tall grass with knives to make a path for them to follow. \"...We searched and searched, but all in vain. After months of searching, we began to wonder if the jewel was really just a legend after all. Even I had never seen it...\" The group jumped when the scene cut to a camp, where Van Pelt stabbed a knife into a map laid out on a table, frustrated by their lack of success. \"But Dr. Bailey and her contagious optimism urged us onward. And then, at last, we found it, the Jaguar's Eye...\" The group of expeditioners was framed by vine-decorated statues of different animals. Dr. Bailey ran her hand over the carven figure of an elephant, then snapping a picture of it with the camera hanging around her neck. Then, up ahead,a large, towering jaguar statue made of stone appeared through the trees, a round, green jewel set in the centre of the great cat's forehead, like an eye. \"That was when Van Pelt's true intentions became clear: he took the jewel, taking it for himself, removing it from the statue and thus taking its power to use as his own...\" The group gasped again as they watched Van Pelt cut the jewel, which glowed a bright green, from the statue, holding it up victoriously, a dark shadow passing over the once bright and colourful jungle. A now very distressed looking Dr. Bailey watched him as a large, vicious-looking vulture-like bird swooped down and landed on his shoulder. \"The jewel gave him power over all of the animal life here in Jumanji. Legend has it that should the watchful jaguar ever be blinded, it will not be able to watch over and protect the jungle, leaving it vulnerable and dangerous. Now it seems that legend is true. Dr. Bailey and I tried to convince him otherwise and begged him to return the jewel to its rightful place in the statue, but it had corrupted him, and he craved its power. He never let the jewel out of his sight. Seeing that his actions had threatened the jungle, now leaving it cursed, Dr. Bailey and I devised a plan to steal back the jewel. So that night, whilst he was sleeping, we snuck into his tent and snatched the jewel...\" The clip showed Nigel prying the jewel from the sleeping Van Pelt's grasp, Dr. Bailey keeping watch from the entrance of the tent. There was a moment of quiet victory when at last, Nigel had it, only to be broken by the squawking of the vulture, much like an alarm, awakening Van Pelt. Nigel tossed the jewel into Dr. Bailey's hands as they fled through the jungle, dodging shots fired at them as they disappeared. Nigel hopped into the jeep, luring the shooting men away, giving her a chance to escape, jewel in hand. \"Bring her to me, with the jewel,\" growled Van Pelt to the soldiers. \"And slaughter anyone else who stands in your way.\" \" And that is your task,\" Nigel finished with a smile. The clip fell away and they were once again in the jeep. \"I left the jewel in Dr. Bailey's trusted hands. Find her and help her return the jewel to its rightful place. You will need this map-\" He withdrew said map and handed it to Spencer. \"Go to the Bazaar and find the missing piece. Good luck friends, the whole of Jumanji is counting on you!\" With that, the Jeep drew to a halt and the doors popped open. The group only sat there, staring open-mouthed back at him. \"On you go! Jumanji thanks you!\" Nigel urged them. \"Send my regards to Dr. Bailey, and tell her I sent you!\" Slowly and hesitantly, the four climbed out of the Jeep. \"And now your quest I shall recite in verse: take the jewel, break the curse. If you wish to leave the game, return the jewel and call out its name. But keep this in mind: should the great jaguar once again wink, the true nature of the jewel is not what you think.\" He repeated this again as he drove away. \"Hey! Wait! Can't you just give us a ride?\" called Fridge, but the jeep had already disappeared. \"Oh my God, we're so going to die!\" cried Bethany. \"Bethany!\" hissed Martha. \"Not helping!\" \"Well you heard what that creepy guy said: to slaughter anyone who stood in the way of the jewel! And that's what we have to do!\" \"He also said to bring this Dr. Bailey to him,\" Spencer said. \"He didn't say anything about wanting to kill her. I think we're safest with her.\" \"Whoever she is. And where is she?\" \"I don't know. But I think that might be what this next level is, finding her.\" \"Okay. So what do we do?\" asked Martha. \"Why are you asking me?!\" he cried. \"Well you're obviously kind of the leader.\" He sighed. \"Fine. We start walking, I guess.\" \"It's okay, it's going to be okay,\" Bethany was muttering to herself. \"In real life people love you and you can hook up with anyone you want.\" \"Is that what you tell yourself when you're scared?\" Martha scrunched up her nose. \"Oh my God can you stop judging me for like two seconds? I got sucked into a freaking video game, I can't find my phone, and I turned into a guy, I'm allowed to be upset! And besides, says the gorgeous karate bad-ass to the old guy with no endurance.\" Just as they were taking their first steps forward, the ominous drumming started again, drawing them all to a sharp halt. \"That can't be a good sign,\" remarked Fridge, speaking their collective thoughts aloud. But the game would have its way. They had no choice but to continue. \"Game on,\" mumbled Spencer, and began to lead the way. So there's the first chapter, I hope you all enjoyed! Thanks so much for reading! :) I did update it as I saw the movie again and there was just too much awesome dialogue I couldn't leave out! ;) I like to go from the actual dialogue, also adding in some of my own. I also sometimes do some re-wording, to keep it different and interesting, but expanding on the original dialogue. Also, how did I miss the first time seeing the movie that Van Pelt was 'Professor'?! Haha now I just picture him doing so Indiana Jones style where he teaches but also goes on crazy expeditions, haha! And if you haven't yet seen the new 'Jumanji', I highly recommend it! Thanks so much! (I'll stop rambling now!)[Chapter 2] Hello and welcome back! Hope you enjoy this next chapter! Two: 'Welcome to the Jungle, We've Got Fun and Games!' \"This is so stupid!\" huffed Bethany. \"We've been walking for hours!\" \"It hasn't been that long,\" mumbled Martha. \"Well it feels like it! I just want to go home!\" \"We all do!\" Martha reminded her, more harshly than she intended. Bethany took offence to her tone. \"Well excuse me for being upset!\" \"I'm upset too! I'm just keeping it to myself!\" \"Hey Spencer, are you actually following that map?\" Fridge asked. Spencer held the map at arm's length and examined it. \"Kinda... I'm having a bit of trouble reading it.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Well not all of it's here. The writing's all broken up. Plus there's this whole piece missing.\" He pointed to the torn edge. \"Nigel said to find the missing piece. Do you think he meant the map?\" tried Martha. \"That's what I'm thinking.\" \"What do you mean? You can't read this?\" Bethany came over, taking the map from his hands. \"It's just a map of Jumanji.\" \"Cartography!\" Martha suddenly gasped. \"It was one of Professor Oberon's skills.\" \"Oh, so you can't read this but I can?\" Bethany looked impressed. \"That's right. The characters we chose, we all have special skills,\" said Spencer, realizing this too. \"So there must be a way to access our skills-\" He began patting himself down, gasping when, after pressing his chest, a bright green box listing strengths and weaknesses appeared before him. \"Dr. Smolder Bravestone, age 40. Strengths: fearless, climbing, speed, boomerang - smoldering intensity?\" He answered by turning and staring off into the distance dramatically. \"What the hell are you doing?\" demanded Fridge. This broke the trance. \"What just happened?\" \"Uh, you just smoldered,\" Bethany told him with a grin. Spencer turned back to his list. \"Weakness: none.\" He nodded, content with his skills. \"Damn that is a man right there,\" Bethany commented. \"Okay, stop it,\" said Martha when it started to get awkward. \"I can't help it,\" Bethany defended. \"How did you do that? The list?\" Martha asked Spencer. \"Uh, I think I just pressed my chest.\" Martha turned away slightly and tried pressing her own chest. A bright red box appeared in front of her. \"Ruby Roundhouse, age 33. Strenghts: Karate, T'ai Chi, Aikido, dancing fighting - dance fighting? Is that even a thing? Weakness: venom.\" Bethany tried next. A bright yellow box appeared. Professor Sheldon 'Shelly' Oberon, age 45. Her strengths were cartography, archaeology, and paleontology. Her weakness was endurance. \"Seriously?\" she said, assessing her skill set. \"Pal-e-on-tology? What does that even mean?\" \"Um, study of fossils, I think,\" Martha said. \"You know, like dinosaurs. That's pretty cool.\" She wished she got a skill like that, instead of - dance fighting? Lastly was Fridge. A bright pink box appeared, listing his strengths as zoology and weapons valet, and his weaknesses as speed, strength, and - cake? Franklin 'Mouse' Finbar, age 40. \"I hate this game!\" he declared. \"Everybody else got good stuff!\" \"Why do I have to be the oldest?!\" whined Bethany. \"Weakness: cake?\" said Martha, reading Fridge's list. \"Yes, cake is my weakness. Along with speed and strength. How is strength my weakness?! And speed? Why would I need to be fast if I'm being chased through the damn jungle?!\" He was fuming. \"Well, you are a good weapons valet,\" Martha tried to make him feel better. \"What's that?\" \"I think it means you carry my weapons in your backpack and give them to me if and when I tell you to,\" Spencer explained. Now Fridge looked even more unhappy. \"You guys!\" Bethany suddenly gasped. \"It's changing! The map's changing!\" The other three rushed over to see that indeed it was. More was appearing. \"See, it didn't say this before and now it does-\" Bethany pointed to the new part. From the Deep was written by the water. \"' From the Deep' ,\" Spencer read. \"The hippo, it came from the deep. \"You know, the one-\" \"That did the thing, yes.\" Bethany cut him off. \"Moving on.\" \"I think that that must have been the first level, and now we're on our way to the second level.\" \"Well don't look at me you're the video game genius.\" Spencer gave a sweep of his arm. \"Lead the way Professor Oberon.\" Now Bethany led the way, map in hand. Once again they were walking through the dense jungle. A nearby rustling drew them to a halt. \"That better not be another man-eating hippo,\" mumbled Fridge. Dum, dum, dum. Dum, dum, dum. Dum, dum, dum. There were the drums again. \"Um, guys-\" Bethany whispered. The drums cut out and when they did, a figure emerged. They could only see the figure's outline, the sunlight pouring through the trees casting a shadow on them. They stood before the group, leg up on a rock. When the shadow passed, the group found themselves face-to-face with a young woman. Spencer's first thought was, \"she's really beautiful\" and also, \"she means business\". The others recognized her too - it was Dr. Vera Bailey from the cut-scene, who they needed to find and help. \"It's her!\" cried Bethany, pointing. The young woman appeared briefly startled by this. \"You're Dr. Vera Bailey, \" Spencer said, stepping forward. She smirked. \"Very good Bravestone.\" And with that, she struck him right across the face. Haha, there's the official introduction to my character :) hope you enjoyed this chapter, thanks so much for reading! Also, I'm listening to the soundtrack while writing this - I highly recommend it, it's so good![Chapter 3] Hello and welcome back! Here's the next chapter where we actually meet my character! Enjoy! Three: \"Call Me 'Doctor'\" - Dr. Vera Bailey \"Ow!\" Spencer cried. \"Wh-what was that for?!\" \"Oh you know what! For abandoning us!\" \"I don't-\" \"Oh don't play innocent! You left to pursue your own selfish expeditions leaving the jealous Van Pelt to try and outdo you, leading us here, and now in the middle of this giant mess!\" She looked the same as she had in the cut-scene, only now looked more scraped up and dirty, having been on the run in the jungle. She wore a blue button-up shirt, the buttons undone with the ends tied in a knot, with a creme coloured tank top underneath, green khaki pants, brown combat boots, and leather finger-less gloves. Her yellowish-blonde hair was tied back in a messy fishtail braid over her shoulder, as though she had hastily pulled it back, a few wisps escaping here and there. Her face was tanned and smeared with dirt, but wore a determined look. She had a handgun resting against each hip and a knife sticking out of her boot. She looked to be in about her mid-thirties and she spoke with an English accent. There was a pause, the others too shocked to respond, especially Spencer. They had no idea what was going on. \"Wait, you guys know each other?\" said Martha, gesturing to Dr. Bailey and Spencer, and breaking the shocked silence. \"Yes. We've worked together in the past. Who are you?\" Dr. Bailey demanded of the redhead. \"Um, Martha - I mean Ruby Roundhouse, I guess...\" This only earned her a confused look. \"Why the hell are you wearing that in the jungle?\" Dr. Bailey asked, scrunching up her nose at Martha's shorts and short-sleeved crop-top, just as Martha had done. \"I said the same thing,\" the red-head assured her. \"Bethany,\" Bethany cried when the young woman turned to her next. Now Dr. Bailey looked even more confused. \"Bethany?\" \"Look, I know this is going to sound, well, weird, but I'm not actually Dr. Bravestone,\" Spencer told her. \"Really?\" Her voice was dripping with sarcasm. \"No, I'm serious!\" he insisted. \"I'm being completely honest. My name is Spencer, but I got trapped in his body. So I look and sound like Dr. Bravestone, but I'm not really him. See, that's Martha, but she's trapped as Ruby Roundhouse, and Bethany as Professor Sheldon 'Shelly' Oberon. And Fridge-\" But Fridge jumped in. \"Hey girl. How are you? I'm Anthony.\" He gave her a grin. She regarded him. \"And yet you're Franklin Finbar. Bravestone's assis-\" \"Assistant, yeah we know. We've been through that already.\" He was obviously still bitter about this. \"So, yeah,\" Spencer finished. \"It's the truth,\" he added for good measure, the other's nodding in agreement. Now Dr. Bailey regarded the four of them, arms crossed. \"So let me get this straight: you all look like these people but you're really someone else trapped inside their bodies?\" It did sound pretty absurd, but it was true. \"Yes.\" She gave a sigh. \"The curse is spreading, getting worse. It's trapped you as people you're really not, that's how strong it is. I need to act quickly to put an end to this madness.\" Now it was the four's turn to look confused. \"Uh no, this ain't a curse-\" began Fridge, but Spencer cut him off. \"Yeah, yeah, it's the curse. And that's why we're here. We're here to help you.\" \"Oh...\" \"Nigel sent us.\" \"Of course he did.\" \"We're here to help you break the curse and save Jumanji.\" \"Well, thank you, that's very kind, but I don't need your help. Good day.\" With a small, stiff smile, she turned swiftly on her heel and stalked into the jungle. There was a shocked silence. \"Did she just,\" began Fridge. \"Leave us?\" finished Martha. \"Yeah,\" said Spencer. \"Rude!\" cried Bethany. \"Uh, hey, wait up!\" The group took off after her. \"You don't understand, we need to do this in order to go home,\" Spencer explained, catching up with her. Wow, she was fast. \"What? Can't you just go home?\" \"No, we can't go back without helping you.\" Again, it sounded strange. \"It's, the curse,\" Spencer added, hoping that would make her more likely to believe them, whereas in any other case it probably wouldn't. \"Well, like I said, that's very kind, but I don't want nor need your help. Nothing personal, it's just I'm working alone this time around. It's better that way.\" With that she continued on. \"What-\" \"She can't do that!\" \"What's up with all this 'curse' stuff?\" Fridge demanded of Spencer. \"I don't think she realizes this is a game,\" Spencer said, lowering his voice. \"What? How could she not?\" \"Well just think: Nigel referred to this as a game, but she hasn't. She seems dead serious.\" \"Do you think she's trapped here too? Or is she another NPC or whatever?\" \"No, I think she's also an NPC.\" \"But she doesn't repeat herself.\" \"I don't know man. She must have an expanded set of programmed responses, cause I get the feeling that she's the character we interact with themost in the game. All I'm saying is that let's try to not mention the whole game thing. She already doesn't want our help, we don't want to give her another reason for not wanting it. I think we've confused her enough already.\" They continued following her through the trees. I didn't take her long to notice. \"What part of 'I don't need your help' don't you get?\" \"Look, Vera-\" \"Doctor.\" \"Doctor Vera.\" \"Doctor Bailey!\" \"Sorry! Look, we can help each other. We help you break the curse and you help us complete our quest so we can go home. You can trust us.\" \"That's what they all say.\" She sighed, hands on her hips. \"Fine. But try and keep up. I won't have you slowing me down, I can't afford that.\" The others gave a sigh of relief. \"Thank you.\" \"Dr. Vera Bailey, well-known archaeologist and anthropologist adventurer. Y ou can call me 'Doctor'.\" \"'Doctor', like just 'Doctor'?\" said Martha. \"Like Doctor Who?\" \"Yes, just 'Doctor'. Now come on then.\" She waved them onward. \"Oh, and welcome to the jungle.\" Haha I had to have Karen Gillan reference 'Doctor Who', I just had to! ;) Haha! And I realized that how I imagined Vera is very similar to the look of Brie Larson's character in Kong: Skull Island, so while reading you can imagine that she looks like Mason Weaver :) And I actually imagined Vera taking pictures of everything in Jumanji, as she says later she's fascinated by it all (which is what I would do if I were to ever go on an adventure like that! ;)) Hope you enjoyed, and thanks so much for all the reads already - this story has only been out a week so that's amazing![Chapter 4] Welcome back! Let's venture out into the Jungles of Jumanji once again! Haha! ;) Four: Run For Your Lives - Literally! The group did their best to keep up with Doctor Bailey. \"Talk to her,\" Fridge whispered to Spencer. \"Try and get some answers!\" \"Why do I have to talk to her?\" \"You two obviously have some sort of past!\" \"Well obviously not a very good one! She slapped me!\" \"Just go on!\" Spencer gave in and stepped forward awkwardly, while the others hung back. \"Uh, hi...\" He was glad when she struck up a conversation by posing a question of her own. \"How did you get here?\" \"Uh...\" He and Fridge exchanged a glance. Fridge just waved him on, leaving him to try and come up with something. \"W-we don't know really,\" he partially lied. \"We don't remember. It was just kind of one minute back home, and then here the next.\" \"Strange,\" she mumbled. \"Must be the curse messing with your memory.\" She was dead serious. \"Yeah, must be,\" mumbled Fridge. Spencer nudged him. \"What about you? How did you get here?\" Spencer asked her. \"A long, long boat ride, all the way from London,\" she said. \"I've been fascinated by this place my whole life and have been studying it about that long too. Finally, I made it here. And now I have to save it.\" \"See,\" Spencer hissed to the others. \"She's serious. She doesn't know it's a game.\" \"Poor thing,\" said Bethany. \"Shh! She thinks it's real. Just role with it.\" He turned back to Vera. \"Um, so Nigel said for us to head to the Bazaar, to 'find the missing piece'.\" \"Missing piece? Missing piece of what, the map?\" She nodded to the torn map in Bethany's hands. \"We think so, but we're not sure.\" \"Well, that's where I'm headed now. That's where I stashed the jewel.\" \"Wait, you don't have it?\" \"No, I hid it away safely, somewhere Van Pelt and his men won't find it. Nor anyone else for that matter.\" \"Oh, good, good.\" He looked to the others who were nodding. This was good. \"Yes. We'll go and retrieve it, and then I shall destroy it.\" There was a moment of shocked silence before all at once all four cried, \"What?!\" all stopping and staring at her. She appeared slightly startled by their reaction. \"To end the corruption and its dark spell over Jumanji, relieving its power over Van Pelt, and returning everything to the way it was,\" she explained, as though it were the most obvious thing in the world. The others exchanged a glance. \"But, wouldn't it just be the same to return it to the statue?\" \"And risk someone else becoming corrupted by its power and having a repeat of this mess?\" She raised her eyebrows. Okay, they saw her point, but they also couldn't let her do that. Not if they wanted to survive. Not if they wanted to go home. \"Guys! The map's changing again!\" The group, this time now including Vera, huddled around Bethany. The Mighty Roar was now written in what looked like a clearing. \"The second level?\" guessed Martha. \"I think so,\" agreed Spencer. \"Second level of what?\" questioned Vera. Right, they'd have to be more careful about that. \"Uh, which way?\" Spencer ignored her question. He felt rude doing this, but was unsure of what else to do. \"Um, let's see... If that is that, and that is that, then - well right here I think.\" As if in response, something sailed between them, rippling the map, exploding ahead of them a few feet away. They turned at the sound of a roaring motor just in time to see a pack of motorcycles launch over the hill towards them. \"Shit!\" Vera cried as she watched another line of bikes sail over the hill, speeding towards them. With that, she took off. \"Everybody run!\" yelled Spencer, watching the bikes. When he turned back to his companions, he found that they were already way ahead of him, literally, already sprinting down the hill and into the clearing. \"Hey wait!\" He scrambled to follow them. However, with his speed strength, he was soon caught up and ahead. Vera was in the lead. Despite being quite small, she was really fast, easily keeping up with Spencer and his special speed skill, even managing to stay ahead. Seeing as she wasn't as panicked as the rest of the group over the attack, they could only guess that this had happened before. She just kept running, dodging blasts from the bikes. Then, she slowed down and stopped altogether. \"What are you doing?!\" cried Spencer. \"Keep going!\" She withdrew both handguns. \"Take cover in the trees. There's a cliff up ahead, jump down into the lake, that'll lose them.\" \"What?!\" Jump off a cliff?! I'll do my best to hold them off. Go!\" \"But, you-\" \"They won't hurt me. Trust me on that. Not if they don't want to suffer at Van Pelt's hands. Now go!\" The bikes were nearing and the others didn't need to be told again. They took off into the trees. \"Ah! Why am I running so slow?!\" screamed Fridge. Vera turned back to face their pursuers, the bikes now speeding towards her on only one wheel, still firing explosives. \"Oh Russel,\" she mumbled. \"So dramatic.\" She fired a shot which pierced the front wheel of one of the bikes, causing it to spin out of control and crash in an explosion. The others stopped at the mouth of the forest and had to watch some of the epic spectacle taking place before them. The next thing they knew, Vera was speeding around on one of the bikes herself, having shoved off the rider and stealing the bike. She rode up alongside another bike and kicked the driver off. Then she jumped off her own bike and the others watched as it spun and crashed in an explosion, catching two other bikes up in it. \"Wow,\" breathed Spencer. \"Whoa! She's so cool!\" cried Bethany. \"A total bad-ass!\" \"What is this game?!\" cried Fridge. Their observance didn't last long as there were still multiple bikes left, and they were zooming straight towards them. They quickly resumed running. \"This sucks!\" Bethany practically screamed as they took cover within the trees. However, this didn't stop the bikes from chasing them. While it did provide obstacles, the bikes persisted relentlessly. Putting their skills to good use, they actually managed to take down a good number of the bikes themselves. Well, Martha and Spencer at least. Bethany decided to stick with Martha, who had just saved her by launching herself at one of the bikes and kicking the rider off, while Fridge didn't really have a choice in sticking with Spencer, who had just managed to throw a boomerang, which was apparently one of his skills, and completely miss all the bikes. \"Now what?!\" Fridge demanded as they took off running again. At least the roaring motors of the bikes made them easy to hear, so they couldn't sneak up on you. \"You want me to look in this backpack for a hacky sack or something so you can do absolutely nothing with it-\" He was cut off though by the boomerang whipping back towards them, taking out a line of bikes. \"You've gotta be kidding me...\" Spencer looked impressed. The victorious moment was short-lived though, for more bikes were still coming. There seemed to be no shortage of them. That led him to wonder if Vera was okay - sure, he had just seen it himself, she was perfectly capable of defending herself and others, but she was vastly outnumbered... But he didn't have long to ponder this. \"Come on, we've gotta go-\" \"I can't outrun those guys!\" How embarrassing. Back at school, he was one of the fastest players on the team. \"uh, well here, get on my back.\" Spencer crouched down so Fridge could climb onto his back. \"Wha- hell no!\" \"I'll carry you, come on-\" \"I would rather die,\" Fridge declared. \"Get on my back!\" \"Oh nope, I'm gonna to die-\" He barely finished for before he knew it, Spencer had thrown him onto his back and was now charging through the trees. \"Ahhh! PUT ME DOWN! Spencer - PUT ME DOWN SPENCER!\" They met up with the girls again up ahead - at a cliff's edge. \"Vera said jump,\" Martha reminded them. \"I would literally rather do anything else right now,\" said Spencer. The motors behind them were growing louder, and therefore closer. \"We have to jump-\" And with that, Martha did just that, launching herself over the edge. \"MARTHA!\" wailed Bethany, before throwing herself off the cliff after her. \"Spencer jump!\" yelled Fridge. \"But I-\" \"JUST JUMP!\" Spencer watched as first Martha disappeared, plunging into the water below, then Bethany. His heart thundered in his chest. \"SPENCER!\" roared Fridge, who was still on his back. He took a deep breath, and mustered all the courage he could possibly manage at that moment. And he jumped. Yay, some action! ;) haha! And more about Vera too! Thanks so much for reading, hope you're enjoying![Chapter 5] Hello again! Welcome back! Here's Chapter Five! Five: Trust Issues \"That was the most humiliating moment of my life!\" Fridge declared as the group dragged themselves, now dripping wet, from the small lake. The only good thing to come out of this seemed to be that they had lost the bikers, as Vera had said. Bethany collapsed onto the bank, while Spencer was panicking about having swallowed some water. \"G-guys,\" Martha managed to choke out. \"T-they got me...\" The other three froze when they saw the bloody bullet wound in her chest. And just like that, she disappeared. \"Wait-\" \"Oh no, Martha!\" \"Did she die? Is she dead!?\" In answer to this, a chiming noise sounded from above, like had happened after Bethany had been eaten by the hippo, and Martha fell from the sky - landing on Fridge. \"Ow! Get off me!\" \"Sorry!\" \"Martha! You're alive! Are you okay?!\" cried Bethany. \"Uh, yeah, I-I think so...\" The redhead was obviously pretty shaken, and understandably. Spencer reached out and gently took her wrist. \"That's what I thought,\" he sighed. \"What?\" \"Those tattoos, they're our life count. Bethany got eaten by the hippo, so she only has two lives, and now Martha got shot, so she's down to two as well.\" The girls looked at their wrists to find only two black lines now instead of three. \"W-well what happens if we lose all three?\" Martha asked shakily, as though she dreaded the answer. \"Well usually that would mean game over...\" \"Game over?\" \"Wait, like over over? Are you saying we can actually die here?!\" cried Fridge. \"I don't know...\" \"You don't know?! I thought you were Mr. Video Game Genius!\" \"Well I've never been stuck in one okay! But yes, I think that's possible.\" There was a quiet moment between them as the group absorbed this. \"W-well, we'd better find the missing piece then,\" Martha said determinedly. \"Hey wait, where's Vera?\" Bethany asked. It was then that the others noticed too - they were back down to four. \"You don't think they - killed her, do you?\" \"She said they wouldn't hurt her...\" They jumped a little when they heard the sound of another motor bike. \"Oh no, not this again...\" They prepared themselves for another chase, but quickly realized that they were quite safe. A bike pulled up to the edge of the lake, driven by Vera herself. \"Oh good. I hoped I would find you all here.\" She dismounted and left the bike at the water's edge. \"Everyone alright? No one hurt?\" \"N-no...\" \"Good. Onward then.\" She waved them on. \"Hey, you were amazing back there,\" Spencer told her. \"Oh, thank you.\" \"You really know how to - kick some ass!\" He chuckled awkwardly. She chuckled a little herself at this. \"Thanks.\" They trudged on, Vera once again in the lead. The four avatars were still pretty shaken from the near-death experience with the motorbikes. \"Look, despite what I might say, and despite our falling out, I am a big fan of your work,\" Vera told Spencer who was walking behind her. \"His work. Sorry, I'm still not used to the whole you-lot-being-stuck-in-other-people's-bodies thing.\" \"Yeah, trust me, we're not either. And you are? A big fan of my - I mean Bravestone's - work?\" \"Yeah. Always have been. Archaeologist to archaeologist, doctor to doctor.\" She smiled a little. Then her face fell. \"I just can't afford another mistrust.\" \"So, trust issues huh?\" \"You could say that. I was betrayed by my - work partner.\" She paused briefly before saying 'work partner', as though in consideration. He nodded. \"Van Pelt?\" Now she turned sharply to face him. \"How did you-\" \"Nigel told us.\" \"Oh. Of course he did.\" How much did he tell you? \"You were a part of the expedition? The one that brought him here?\" \"I was. Let me guess, Nigel told you all about that too? You know, it's kind of funny, I never really believed in magic or curses. Not until I met Russel. For such a serious guy, he wholeheartedly believed in all that stuff. Magical amulets, ancient relics imbued with great power, cursed jewels... And now look at me, right at the centre of it all.\" Spencer nodded. \"You know, you actually kind of remind me of Lara Croft, a video game character. She's an archaeologist-adventurer too, and deals with some magical and cursed artifacts. She's English too.\" \"Hmm, sounds interesting.\" \"Yeah, she's pretty cool. It's a fun game.\" \"Oh, my, God,\" Bethany suddenly cried, stopping in the middle of the path. The others stopped as well, looking at her in concern. \"What?\" \"I can't believe I didn't realize it before! I'd know that look anywhere: you just went through a break up!\" Now all eyes were back to Vera who appeared startled. She looked as though she was about to protest but then gave up. She kept walking. \"I don't want to talk about it.\" \"Oh come on, talking about it helps I promise! I've been through this many times before, I would know!\" Bethany hurried ahead of the others to walk at Vera's side. Vera still appeared hesitant. \"I really don't-\" \"I'm here to support you, in this difficult time, woman to woman,\" Bethany assured her. \"Now come on girl, spill it.\" \"I-I don't know where to start-\" \"That's what I'm here for!\" Then she hollered over her shoulder, \"Martha! Come join us! We're having a girl talk!\" Hesitantly almost, Martha awkwardly shuffled over. \"Don't think I'll be much help but, I'm here.\" \"Okay,\" Bethany said, turning back to address Vera. \"We're your support squad. First thing's first: who did the breaking up? You or him?\" \"Uh, me... I guess... Not officially, but it's obvious. We had a disagreement, and both went our separate ways...\" To finish, she shrugged. \"OMG this is literally what I just went through with Noah! I know exactly what you're going through right now!\" \"I'm quite over it really,\" the blonde insisted. \"Well I'm here to talk to if you need it. Lucinda, she's like, my best friend, is always there to talk to whenever I have boy issues.\" \"Thanks, Bethany.\" \"Well no wonder you've got some trust issues! First your work partner, then your boyfriend! Double the sting!\" \"Yeah...\" Vera only nodded. They continued on. \"Careful,\" Spencer called as they climbed up some rocks to continue following the path. \"Wouldn't want anyone to twist an ankle. I did that at camp once - not fun.\" \"You don't get out much, do you,\" Vera said. \"Y-you can tell?\" She chuckled. \"Only a little.\" \"Yeah, I guess. Before this, the most dangerous thing I'd ever done was write Fridge's paper for him.\" She raised her eyebrows. \"You need to live a little mate.\" Suddenly, the drums started again from overhead, though sounding more distant this time. \"You hear that?\" said Vera. Everyone turned their gazes up to the sky. \"Legend has it those drums are the heartbeat of the jungle.\" Yay, more about Vera! And I saw the movie again and went back and updated the first chapter with some of the dialogue :) Like I said in the updated chapter, I like to go from the actual dialogue from the movie, also adding in some of my own, but I'm going from memory so it's not perfectly accurate! Anyways, please re-read chapter one if you're interested in seeing the changes, thanks again![Chapter 6] Hello again and welcome back to 'Heart of the Jungle'! Hope you all enjoy this next chapter! Six: Into the Jungle We Go! The ladies were now walking ahead of the guys. \"So what happened exactly?\" Bethany was still curious about Vera's break-up. \"Bethany, cut it out! Can't you see she doesn't want to talk about it,\" Martha scolded. Vera had to admit she was thankful to the redhead - she appreciated Bethany's concern and willingness to help, but Martha was right: she did not want to talk about it. \"Hey, can I borrow your jacket if you're not using it?\" Martha then asked, nodding to Bethany's jacket which she had tied around her waist in the heat of the jungle. \"Yeah sure.\" She untied it and handed it to Martha. \"Thanks. I feel like I'm wearing a bikini at school.\" Martha tied it around her own exposed waist. \"I did that once,\" Bethany recalled. \"I got sent to the office.\" \"Makes sense.\" \"Noah liked it when I showed some skin. It was like the key to our relationship.\" Now Martha scrunched up her nose. \"Eww.\" \"Oh my God again with the judging! You don't even know me and it's like you've already made up your mind that you hate me.\" \"Whoa, hey, I don't hate you,\" Martha defended. Bethany raised her eyebrows in a 'really?' sort of way. \"I just think that you're living in the popular-girl bubble, you know, where people either treat you like a princess, or an object, and it's made you a little self-absorbed, maybe. And you're your own person, and should be treated as such.\" Bethany considered this. \"Do you think the reason why you're so closed off is that you're afraid people won't like you so you decide not to like them first?\" Martha considered this for a moment. Even Vera paused, intrigued by what the girl trapped inside a man's body had to say. \"No - maybe.\" Bethany grinned. \"Okay then. I'm just saying you're a babe, so own it.\" Now Martha looked a mix of touched and surprised. \"Thanks, I think.\" Vera considered this too. \"That's interesting advice.\" \"Yeah I actually give really good advice.\" Bethany paused. \"Vera, I'm just curious, but it wasn't Bravestone who you broke up with, was it?\" \" What ?!\" the young woman cried, louder than intended. She shook her head. \"No, no definitely not. We were just colleagues.\" \"I just thought maybe cause of your reaction to seeing him and all. I just had to ask.\" \"Fair enough. Speaking of...\" They noticed then that the guys had fallen behind a bit, due to them being in an argument. Fridge had obviously said something that had hurt Spencer, for the taller man was staring down at the ground, looking, well, sad. They watched as Fridge then lunged forward in a mock attack, making Spencer jump. Tension now hovered over the group. \"Oi, let's keep moving,\" Vera prompted them. \"Dumbass,\" mumbled Spencer as Fridge went to follow the ladies. He heard this. In a burst of fury he dove at Spencer, shoving him off the cliff's edge. Spencer's screams echoed as he fell. \"Bravestone!\" cried Vera, momentarily forgetting that he was not actually her former partner. \"SPENCER!\" Martha and Bethany ran over and watched in horror as Spencer plunged down to the base of the cliff. \"You killed him!\" \"Bitch, you lunatic!\" yelled Bethany. \"Oh chill out,\" snapped Fridge. \"He'll be back.\" As if on cue, they heard the chiming, and Spencer fell from the sky, landing swiftly. Now his wrist only bared two life lines. \"This just keeps getting stranger and stranger,\" Vera muttered to herself. That jewel certainly was powerful. It just went to show that, despite years and years of intense research, she actually knew very little about it and this place. \"Are you okay?\" cried Martha, rushing over. Spencer assessed himself, obviously shaken. \"Yeah, I-I think so.\" \"Don't call me a dumbass.\" Fridge pointed threateningly at him. \"Don't push me,\" Spencer shot back. \"Or what? What'cha gonna do Spencer?\" Fridge mocked. \"I'll push you back.\" \"Okay enough!\" ordered Vera, stepping between them. \"Fighting won't help. I've had enough of breaking up your and Van Pelt's arguments, I don't want it to start again here too.\" \"She's right,\" agreed Spencer. \"And we can't waste lives. We need each other, like it or not-\" He grew all intense. \"We have to do this together.\" \"Could you say that again please,\" said Bethany, obviously smitten. \"We have to do this together,\" Spencer repeated in his normal voice. \"No but with the smolder. Do you have control over it or does it just happen naturally?\" He smoldered again. \"It just happens naturally.\" \"Yup, it just happens naturally,\" Vera assured them. \"Now come on, we're almost at the bazaar.\" Far away, deep in the jungle, a camp was nestled in the trees. It was the very camp Vera had hastily abandoned those many nights before, trying to get the jewel to safety. The bikers who had attacked the group earlier that day were just returning, here to report back to their boss. They had good and bad news: good, Dr. Bailey hadn't been harmed, but bad, she and the others had gotten away and didn't have the jewel. Van Pelt had his back to them, and was watching intently as a tarantula crawled up his arm, beneath the sleeve of his coat, a creature that would have made Vera cringe. He had a content smile on his face. Somehow, he sensed their presence. \"Bravestone?\" \"Yeah, him and the others, the whole lot.\" \"They got away.\" \"We lost 'em - they had help-\" \"Vera.\" The smile crawled further up the dark-eyed man's lips. \"Yeah...\" \"A pair of old friends, reunited at last.\" Now he spun around sharply to face them, the smile gone. \"I will summon every creature, every soul in this jungle to hunt them down and reclaim what is mine.\" Oooo! Haha! ;) Yay next up, the bazaar, which is one of my favourite parts in the whole movie! :) Thank you so much for reading, hope you enjoyed! And thank you so much for all the reads - you guys are amazing! :) Also, I'm going to be starting a 'Jurassic Park'/'Jurassic World' story soon, so if you're interested, please stay tuned! Thanks![Chapter 7] Hello! Time to return to the jungle to continue our adventure! ;) Enjoy! Seven: Bizarre at the Bazaar The bazaar was one of the most notable points of the game. It was colourful and bright and busy. And interesting. There was so much to look at. Vera led them all the way through the intricate market, a combination of inside and outside booths and tents, and to the other end, the very edge of it. \"Alright, you lot stand watch,\" she ordered them. \"Where are you going?\" In response, the doctor shoved aside an empty, abandoned cart and lifted the colourful rug beneath it that they were standing around. Beneath it was a wooden hatch which she also lifted, revealing a dark hole. She lowered herself down into it - it mustn't have been very deep - and took out her knife. Now the others stood around the hole, peering down into it, watching her. Taking her knife she went to cut one of the stones inlaid in the wall, but stopped abruptly, obviously noticing something. \"Bloody hell-\" She removed the stone, without having to carve it out - she had refilled the dirt around it to hold it in place and make it look untouched and undisturbed, but it had definitely been carved out since her last being there. She cursed. The hiding place in the space behind the rock was empty, no jewel. She cursed again, returning the rock messily to its place and hauling herself up out of the hole, kicking the hatch closed in anger. \"It's gone,\" she promtly declared. The others stared back at her. \"Wait, wh- what do you mean gone?\" cried Fridge. \"I mean gone! No longer where I put it!\" She tried not to panic. If Van Pelt got a hold of it again... He was smart, maybe he had figured it out... No, she didn't want to jump to conclusions... \"There's no possible way anyone could know-\" She cut herself off, the realization dawning on her, hard like a slap in the face. Of course, how could she have been so stupid? \"Seaplane,\" she growled. The others didn't have a chance to ask her what she meant before she stormed off, back into the heart of the market. They soon reached the centre of the busy space. \"Rations! Get your rations!\" An older man called, waving a loaf in the air. \"Oh my God does anyone have any money I'm like literally starving!\" Bethany pushed past the others and to the food booth. \"Guys, I think it's telling us to keep our health up,\" said Spencer. Then he grew all intense. \"We need to eat-\" \"Okay will you stop doing that,\" said Fridge, breaking the smoldering trace. Spencer sighed. \"I told you I can't help it! Now we need to eat, but we also need to be discrete-\" \"Oh no, now you're rhyming too,\" mumbled Fridge. \"Oh my God this is so good! I haven't had bread since I was like nine!\" Bethany gushed. \"Seriously?\" questioned Martha. \"Yeah. How do you think I got these abs?\" \"Give me some of that-\" Fridge snatched some of the loaf from Bethany's hands, taking a rather large bite, savoring it. Then his face fell. \"Uh, what is this?\" he asked the seller. \"That's my famous pound cake,\" the man replied. \"Cake? Ooo, I'll try some then. I'm known for my incurable sweet tooth.\" Vera took a piece for herself, almost not noticing the sudden tension that had risen amongst her companions. \"Cake?\" cried Martha. \"Isn't that one of your weaknesses?\" Now Fridge tried not to panic. \"Bethany I thought you said this was bread-\" Bethany smiled sheepishly. \"I guess it's been so long I forgot what it tastes like...\" \"HOW DO YOU FORGET-\" Fridge cut himself off. \"Uh, i-is something happening to me?\" When his friends assured him that nothing unusual was happening to him, he breathed a heavy sigh of relief. \"Okay, okay we're fine. It probably just meant that I love cake so much I just couldn't resist it!\" he tried to reassure himself. \"It's all good-\" BANG! He was barely finished before he was swallowed up by a rather large explosion that shook the whole bazaar. \"Oh my God! Fridge!\" wailed Bethany, staring at the now empty spot where he had just moments before been standing. There was the sound of chimes overhead, followed by a scream, and seconds later Fridge reappeared, falling and smashing down into a pile of crates. \"OW! WHAT THE HELL?!\" \"Bloody hell,\" mumbled Vera. \"This curse is really messing with us.\" The others didn't respond to this, only exchanged a knowing glance. With another glance at the explosive cake, she promptly discarded her own piece. Spencer went to go help Fridge to his feet. \"Like I said, it's important to be discrete.\" \"Yeah but you also said eat!\" countered Fridge. \"Rations! Get your rations!\" called the man, waving the deadly loaves in the air, completely un-phased by what had just happened. \"You can shut your ass up!\" Fridge snapped at him, making him go away. \"Dr. Bravestone!\" An excited young boy came over to them then. It seemed that everyone had moved along with what they were doing before, as if the explosion and man falling from the sky only to come crashing down and cause a scene had never happened. \"Thank goodness you're here! Jumanji needs you!\" \"Uh, thanks. Good to be here,\" Spencer responded with much less enthusiasm. \"Ask him about the missing piece.\" Martha nudged Bethany. \"Oh right! Uh, hi, I'm Bethany - I mean Dr. Shelly... Something. I'm a - a map doctor, and we're trying to find the missing piece.\" She looked to the boy expectantly. The boy only stared back blankly, blinking a few times, before turning back to Spencer, the same excitement as before returning to his face. \"Dr. Bravestone! Thank goodness you're here! Jumanji needs you!\" \"Uh, rude,\" remarked Bethany. \"Excuse me, do you think you might be able to help us?\" Vera tried. She took the map and held it up. \"We're looking for the missing piece of this map.\" \"Dr. Bravestone! Thank goodness you're here! Jumanji needs you!\" Now Vera frowned, obviously perplexed. \"We're looking for the missing piece,\" Spencer tried. The boy glanced around them cautiously before nodding for them to follow him. \"Oh, now he gets it.\" They followed, no one noticing the vulture perched above them, watching intently. When they disappeared into a tent, the bird took flight. His master would be pleased to know the location of Dr. Bailey and the jewel thieves. Sort of a cliffhanger ending! Hope you all enjoyed, thanks so much for reading! And I've decided to break up the next few chapters and make them shorter, just cause I felt that they worked better that way, so just thought I'd let you know! Until next time! Also, I started my 'Jurassic Park'/'Jurassic World' story (I was too excited to wait!), so if you're interested, please check it out! :) Thanks![Chapter 8] Welcome back! Hope you enjoy! Eight: Snake Charmers The boy led them deeper into the bazaar to a more covered area, and then inside a tent. All that was inside was a table in the very centre, on which sat a single basket covered with a lid. The boy turned serious. \"What you need is in the basket. One wrong move, you're in a casket. Trust one another, never blink. The missing piece is not what you think. Good luck mighty hero!\" he concluded, once again becoming cheerful and addressing Spencer. \"Jumanji needs-\" \"Needs him, yeah we know, we got it,\" Vera cut him off. \"Thanks kid, you can run along now.\" And the boy did just that. Now the five turned to face the basket. \"So, uh, what do you think's inside?\" \"I don't know...\" \"Well, I think this is a Bravestone thing,\" Fridge decided. \"Why would it be a Bravestone thing?!\" cried Spencer in protest. \"Cause you heard him, you're the 'mighty hero.' Now get.\" Hesitantly, Spencer gave in and approached the basket. They all jumped when the drumming started again, seemingly from overhead. \"I don't want to do this!\" Spencer cried. \"Just go!\" Still hesitant but realizing he really had no choice, Spencer cautiously approached the basket. Then, taking a deep breath, he lifted the lid... Nothing happend. \"Oh,\" he said, breathing a sigh of relief. \"It's empty-\" But he spoke too soon as right then, a large snake poked its head out, hissing, jaws wide and fangs bared. \"SNAKE!\" shrieked Vera, leaping back. \"Black Mamba!\" yelled Fridge, pointing at the creature. Bethany and Martha responded by shrieking too. Spencer slammed the lid back down onto the basket, sealing it and holding it closed. \"The black mamba. A quarter miligram of its venom is enough to kill an adult,\" Fridge informed them. Then he shook his head in pure disbelief. \"How do I know this?!\" \"Okay, 'trust one another and never blink'...\" Spencer recited the verse, trying to figure it out. \"What does that have to do with a snake?!\" \"You guys!\" gasped Bethany with realization. \"I think it's a staring contest!\" \"What?!\" \"Think about it: never blink.\" \"I think she's right,\" Spencer agreed. The basket was shaking in his hands - no doubt the snake had become angry with being trapped. \"Okay, who's good at staring and not blinking?\" There was a moment before Bethany declared, \"I'm amazing at it.\" \"Beth, this is your moment,\" said a still-shaken Martha. Vera was frozen and said nothing. Bethany lowered herself down so that she was kneeling before the basket and so that she would be eye-level with the snake. She took a deep breath, composing herself. \"Just tell me when,\" Spencer said, concern clear in his voice. \"Okay - now.\" Slowly, he lifted the lid. The snake rose out of the basket and locked eyes with Bethany. They held gazes. Then, without any warning, it lunged forward, hissing. This broke the staring contest. Then, it shot out of the basket, snapping its venomous jaws at Vera, who still stood frozen. Luckily, Spencer acted quickly and reached out, grabbing the snake before it could get her. Now he held it, its face just inches from hers. \"Okay, now what?!\" he cried, the snake wriggling in his grasp. \"We've got to de-fang it!\" cried Fridge with certainty. \"We what?!\" \"De-fang it-\" Fridge reached forward and promptly snapped off the snake's fangs with no trouble. Spencer let the snake go. There was a moment of stunned silence. \"I guess it wasn't a staring contest...\" Haha, love that moment ;) Thank you so much for reading and commenting and your continued support! :)[Chapter 9] Hello! Here's the next chapter for you! :) Nine: Trust There was a moment of heavy silence as everyone recovered, the tension from just moments before slowly fading away. \"'Trust one another and never blink',\" Spencer repeated, breaking the silence. Then he looked at Vera who was still recovering from the scare, staring down at the now limp snake where it lay on the ground at their feet. \"You trusted me.\" She looked up at him and seemed to realize this too. \"Yeah, I-I did.\" Her fear fell away and turned into a small smile, which he returned. \"And you trusted me,\" said Fridge. \"And I de-fanged the snake.\" \"We trusted each other,\" Martha realized aloud. \"'Trust one another and never blink.'\" There was a moment of quiet victory. \"I de-fanged a snake!\" declared Fridge again, now beaming, obviously impressed with himself. \"Um, well it's definitely not the missing piece of the map...\" The others turned to Bethany who had retrieved what the snake had been guarding in the basket. A small stone carving of an elephant, wrapped in parchment. \"Look, there's something written on the wrapping paper: 'The jewel is the heart but it is not the key. When you see me, begin the climb,'\" Martha read. \"Oh no, more riddles.\" \"'When we see an elephant?\" \"Climb?\" \"Heart? Key?\" \"What about the missing piece?\" \"I guess we just have to keep looking.\" And with that, they started to head back to the busier section of the bazaar. Bethany caught up to Vera, who still appeared tense. \"Jealous?\" she asked. When Vera looked at her quizzically she elaborated. \"When that kid was calling Spencer a mighty hero, you seemed sort of jealous.\" Now Vera understood. She shook her head. \"No. I just thought that I would be the one to save Jumanji.\" She paused and thought about this. \"That sounds jealous, and selfish, only it's not. It's just, I'm part of the reason this whole curse happened in the first place, so it only makes sense that I should be the one risking myself to end it. It's only fair. That's why you guys shouldn't be here, risking yourselves.\" \"Yeah I really didn't want to.\" \"Bethany!\" cried Martha. \"But that was before,\" Bethany finished. \"Now I want to help. We all do.\" She looked to Martha who nodded in agreement. Vera smiled. \"Thank you.\" \"So what now?\" asked Fridge as they wandered back through the market. \"I don't know,\" Vera replied. \"We keep looking for the missing piece I suppose. And the jewel now as well.\" When they emerged into the more open part of the bazaar, Vera noticed it first: the large vulture perched on the roof above, eyeing them with its beady eyes, eyes that locked with hers. Something- fear almost - flashed across her face. \"We need to go, now.\" Cliffhanger! Sort of ;) Like I said these few chapters are shorter but that means I'll post them sooner! Hope you all enjoyed and as always, thanks so much for reading! Bye![Chapter 10] Hello welcome back! Again, this is a shorter chapter but they'll start getting longer again soon - enjoy! Ten: Caught! She took off running through the crowd. With no chance to ask questions, the others were left standing there confused. That was until they heard the motors and saw the lights of the bikes - this snapped them into action and they quickly followed suit. The group tore through the bazaar, knocking into people and booths and crates, making a huge mess of the beautiful place. They heard angry shouting behind them and could only guess that the men had abandoned their bikes and were now chasing after them on foot. \"Hey!\" someone yelled in protest as they knocked over a stack of crates full of goods to be sold. \"Sorry!\" It didn't take long for Vera and Spencer, who were of course in the lead being the fastest ones there, to become enclosed by a group of the men. They stood, back-to-back, assessing their situation. \"Uh, you take those guys and I'll take these guys,\" Spencer suggested, eyeing the men before him. He turned to the rather burly man standing directly in front of him. \"I should warn you, I think I'm a very strong puncher.\" \"Just punch him!\" cried Vera. And with that she stepped forward and delivered a kick to the gut of one of the men, beginning the fight. Spencer followed suit and threw a punch, which much to his shock, sent the man sailing through the ceiling boards and up into the sky. Surprised but impressed, he didn't have much time to bask in his victory as another man came at him with knives, whipping one towards them which Spencer managed to catch mid-flight - right before it struck Fridge through the forehead. He dropped the knife into Fridge's hands and stepped forward, this time with confidence. \"Let's do this.\" Soon Vera was much too shocked to fight herself and joined the others in watching Spencer single-handedly take down all the men. Not that she hadn't seen Bravestone fight before, and it was impressive, but Spencer's expression as he successfully fought was priceless. She looked especially impressed when he tossed a man through the wall. \"Wow! That is insane !\" cried Bethany, echoing everyone's thoughts. Now all the men lay scattered across the bazaar. Spencer turned back to his friends, a wide grin on his face. Did you see that?! his eyes cried. \"Not bad Bravestone,\" Vera complimented. He nodded thankfully. \"You too Bailey.\" Bang! Bang! Sudden, sharp gunshots rang throughout the now panicked bazaar. People screamed. A figure pushed through the crowd. Vera froze. She recognized those gunshots. Van Pelt was here. Duh duh DUH! Haha! ;) I'm super excited for the next chapter! Hope you guys enjoyed, thanks so much for reading as always! :)[Chapter 11] Hello and welcome back! Hope you enjoy this chapter (I'm excited for this one! ;)) Eleven: Reunited? \"Back, get back!\" She jumped in front of her four companions - he wouldn't hurt her, so as long as she was there with them they were safe. And he wouldn't just hurt them if given the chance, he would kill them. Speaking of. There he was emerging through the crowd which had frantically moved back. They had the right idea, get out of the way. You didn't want to get in his way. He was flanked by more of his soldiers. She hadn't seen him since the night she had hastily fled the camp. That had been weeks ago. He looked pretty much the same, although his newly-coloured eyes seemed to grow brighter, especially when they fell on her. Now both sides stood, staring one another down. Van Pelt smirked. \"Hello Love. Fancy seeing you here.\" She responded by pulling one handgun from its holster and pointing it at the rival group, making sure she separated them and her new friends. She figured though, that even if she had to, she wouldn't be able to pull the trigger, not if her gun was on him. His soldiers responded by raising their own weapons, but he only raised a hand to tell them to stand down, for now. Next he addressed Spencer. \"Hello Doctor. It's been a long time.\" Spencer only stared back. \"I believe you have something of mine.\" Spencer gulped. \"We just want to go home.\" Still smirking, Van Pelt turned back to Vera. He looked back and forth between her and Spencer. \"Vera...\" He shook his head. \"You moved on so quickly.\" She ignored this. \"We don't have the jewel.\" Now she spoke the truth, she didn't have to lie. \"Come back with us. We won't harm your new friends.\" Her grip on the gun tightened. \"Liar!\" \"I don't lie.\" \"Oh, no? Like you didn't lie about the real reason why you wanted the jewel? Like how you didn't lie about how you felt!\" \"I didn't lie.\" \"You used me! Now I see where your priorities really lie.\" \"I never lied.\" \"Bullshit!\" \"I never lied.\" \"Oh shut up! Stop saying that!\" There was a moment of tense silence, Vera glaring across at him, fuming, so angry that she was almost shaking. Her new friends noticed her change in demeanor right away; despite being noticeably angry, while before she had confidently faced the bikers, now she seemed - more unsure, fearful almost. Now that she faced the leader. But not afraid of him , no, but afraid of what she might have to do to stop him, such as use the gun in her hand. Suddenly, Bethany gasped, turning all eyes on her. \"Oh my God! It's him!\" she cried, realizing first. \"The creepy bad guy's your ex!\" Haha, I felt like that was a good place to end ;) Did you guys see it coming? Was it a surprise? I'm curious! Finally we have the truth - we'll learn more about them later! For now, thanks so much for reading and I hope you enjoyed! :) Oh and if any of you are also reading my 'Beauty and the Beast' story (if you are, thank you!) I just wanted to let you know that I FINALLY updated another chapter! Thanks![Chapter 12] Hello welcome back! And now, picking up right where we left off... Twelve: Jewel Thief Now all eyes went from her to Vera, who now stood uncomfortably. \"Awkward...\" mumbled Fridge, his voice high-pitched. Vera sighed. \"I told you I didn't want to talk about it.\" Perhaps it was Bethany's comment which earned them Van Pelt's next order. \"Kill them! Bring her!\" Receiving their order, the soldiers strode forward towards them, weapons drawn and ready. This is it, Spencer thought. Game over. But then, before anyone could react, smoke filled the area, separating the two groups. Now everyone was a mess of coughing, spluttering, and waving the thick smoke away. The outline of a figure appeared through the haze. \"This way, quick, follow me!\" A young man's voice called out over the sound of shots being fired blindly into the smoky abyss. The group didn't need to be told again, and followed him the best they could. \"Quick, down here!\" The young man removed a grating in the ground, revealing a ladder leading underground. He urged them on quickly, the smoke fading rapidly. He went last, ducking into the hole and putting the grate back, sealing their hiding place. Only then did everyone dare to breathe a sigh of relief. SMACK ! Without hesitation, Vera promptly struck the newcomer across the face. \"Thief! Where is it?!\" she hissed. \"Ow! What the-\" He removed the cloth covering his face to reveal a handsome young man - with a now bright red and most likely stinging cheek. \"Vera-\" \"-Dr. Bailey.\" \"-I told you before, I'm just trying to help you!\" he protested, taking a step back from the obviously upset doctor. \"By stealing?!\" \"Look, you can't destroy the jewel, okay, you just can't.\" \"And why not Seaplane?\" she mocked. \"How about you have your good friend and work partner become corrupted by it and turn evil, and then tell me that you don't want to destroy it too!\" \"And boyfriend - how about that important detail, huh? Look, I'm sorry alright! I didn't want to take it, but I had no choice. And I did just save you from your maniac ex-boyfriend.\" \"Oh not you too-\" \"So you're welcome.\" \"I had it under control. He won't hurt me, so you're lucky I'm on your side-\" \"Shhh!\" he hissed suddenly, holding a finger to his lips and then pointing to the ceiling. There was still shouting and footsteps from overhead. \"Now follow me and do exactly as I say. And please, be quiet !\" He lit a torch and waved the group on. \"Oh I am so stoked you guys are here,\" he whispered excitedly. \"So stoked! You have no idea-\" \"You are?\" \"Yeah! I've been waiting for you guys for so long!\" \"You have?\" \"Yeah - backs against the wall!\" he suddenly shouted. The others obeyed - right as arrows zipped past their heads and into the far wall behind them. \"This game sucks,\" whispered Fridge. \"Wait, you knew we were coming?\" asked Spencer as the young man waved them on. \"Yeah! When I heard about the strangers I thought 'naw, it couldn't be.' But then, I began to wonder...\" \"Wait, you're Seaplane aren't you? The pilot?\" \"Yeah, that's me! Oh, watch your step in here,\" he warned. \"And don't step on the white bricks-\" \"Shit-\" Bethany had just stepped on one right as he said that. Long, thin blades shot out of the wall between them. Martha shrieked. \"Sorry,\" Beth said sheepishly. \"So gnarly,\" the young man said as the blades slid back into the walls and the group continued on. \"Really?! Seriously?! It had to be the guy who's trying to kill us - it just had to be!\" Fridge was now mumbling. \"He's your boyfriend!\" \"He's not my boyfriend! Not anymore!\" Vera snapped back at him from where she was walking ahead. \"I told you I don't want to talk about it!\" They soon came to the end of the long cavern. The young man, Seaplane, tossed his torch below them - only to reveal a pit filled with water and vicious-looking crocodiles with snapping jaws. He must have done this before because he calmly took a plank of wood that had been resting against the wall and lay it across the gap so they could cross over. \"Careful. It's a horrible way to die.\" He spoke knowingly. Once they were all safely across, Seaplane undid a latch on a door. Instead of leading out into the bazaar as they had been expecting, it led right out into the dense jungle. If you peered through the trees, you could see the bazaar perched on the mountainside. Wow, they'd come a long way. \"Anyways, I'm Alex.\" He clapped his hands together and turned to give the group a smile. \"So, 'Alex'-\" Vera strode forward towards him, hands on her hips. He jumped back, as though he feared another slap. \"The jewel. Now .\" She held out her hand expectantly. \"Okay, okay, alright. It's right through here.\" He began leading them through the trees. \"Wait - you don't have it?\" \"Not on me, no.\" \"You left it unattended?!\" \"That's what you did!\" \"I hid it, there's a difference-\" \"Guys, could we try and get along please,\" Spencer said, obviously a bit uncomfortable with the fighting. \"Well I hid it too, in my hide-out.\" Alex led them a little further until the trees began to thin to reveal a small, crafty hut. Alex strode up the steps, dug around through a pile of supplies, and withdrew a cloth-wrapped item. He unraveled the cloth to produce a bright green jewel that fit perfectly in the palm of his hand. There was a moment of silence as everyone stared. \"That's it?\" said Fridge. \"I thought it would be bigger. You know, it being the 'heart of the jungle' and all.\" \"This is it,\" Vera assured him, snatching it from Alex. \"Wow, it's really beautiful.\" Bethany came to inspect it. Vera nodded. \"Yes, it is. Beautiful, but dangerous.\" Yay, now we've met Alex! :) Hope you guys enjoyed, thanks so much for reading! And in the next chapter we'll learn the whole story behind Vera and Van Pelt's relationship - I'm so excited! ;)[Chapter 13] Hello and welcome back! Now time for some backstory :) Thirteen: Vera's Story Evening settled over Jumanji. Alex made a fire and they all sat around it as the jungle grew dark for the night. Spencer kept jumping at all the different nightly jungle sounds. \"Chill Spencer, jeez,\" chuckled Fridge. He jumped and cried out himself a few moments later when a bird overhead started calling. Now it was the others' turn to chuckle. \"So, you wanna talk about it now?\" Bethany asked Vera, trying not to pry, but also curious. They all were. Vera chuckled. \"No, not really. But you deserve to know I guess.\" She stared into the crackling flames. \"We were a team, the three of us.\" She nodded to Spencer's Bravestone. As her words continued, the scene melted away, just as it had done when Nigel had provided the backstory. \"Hey, it's another one of those things!\" cried Bethany. \"A cut-scene,\" Spencer corrected. \"Yeah those!\" \"Don't interrupt,\" said Martha. While the others reacted, Vera didn't seem at all phased by it. A photo appeared, black and white, of the three of them, the once-team, Bravestone smoldering of course, Vera standing in the middle wearing a smirk, leaning with her arm resting on a very serious Van Pelt's shoulder, his arm around her waist. When she continued, it was in voice-over. \"He was always rather jealous of you - Bravestone I mean. Thought he always got all the credit for everything. That would get on anyone's nerves. But him, it made his blood boil...\" Many newspapers flashed before them, all with headlines such as 'Bravestone does it again!' and 'Legendary Archaeologist Makes Remarkable Find!' There was no mention of the other two team members. There was one that said 'Dr. Bravestone and Team', but didn't go into detail about names. \"...That's why he was so intent on finding the jewel. A chance to prove himself better than even the great Dr. Bravestone. It got to the point where you two were always arguing, you couldn't agree on anything, and I would always have to step in and break up your arguments...\" A clip showed just that, Bravestone and Van Pelt having an argument, growing increasingly angry, and Vera jumping in between them, separating them, grabbing them both by the collars of their shirts. It was strange for Spencer to watch him, well his avatar, in the scenes, almost like watching a video clip of yourself, but not remembering any of it actually happening. \" Together Russel and I had been studying Jumanji and the Jaguar's Eye for a long time, in between our work as a team. That's how we met actually, many years ago, through a mutual interest in the fabled jungle. He, Bravestone, thought it was silly, a waste, us investing so much time and effort into something that may not even exist. That's when we had the falling out. He left, and it was just us. And now it seemed like a good opportunity to pursue that.\" A pause. \"Suddenly, it was different between us. It had never been that way before, but then we realized it had always been that way, we were only just realizing now - brief as it was.\" Here she paused again, and couldn't help but smile. Then the cut-scene continued. \"When we arrived here, we were extremely determined. This was our life's work...\" The clip replayed from Nigel's backstory of them stepping out of the Jeep, only now the others noticed them put an arm around each other. More clips showed Vera with a camera, snapping pictures of everything. \"Oh come on Russ!\" she laughed when Van Pelt ducked away from her camera. \"Smile!\" \"...I kept wondering what we would do once we found it. We'd been working on this for so long that it was strange to think of it actually being over. And then, we found it...\" The clip showed the group emerging through the trees, Vera and Van Pelt in the front, to find the great statue ahead. Van Pelt took a beaming Vera into his arms and spun her around in a celebratory hug. It was funny for the others to see him so happy, only having seen him angry really. \"Our life's work, finally found. It was an extremely proud moment for both of us...\" Again, she paused to smile a little at the memory. But that smile soon fell. \" We climbed up the statue. He was ahead of me. I don't like heights, so I was moving slower...\" The clip showed the two climbing up the statue, aided by a long rope, Vera indeed far behind. \"Russel!\" she called up. \"What do you see?\" She was answered by a flash of green light, and him holding the jewel in his hand, already possessed by its power. \"I actually never reached the top of the statue, for the next thing I knew, he had the jewel and the curse was set.\" She paused. \"And he wouldn't let it out of his sight. He wouldn't even let me hold it. It was funny, a couple of nights before we found it, he said to me, 'finding this jewel is going to be the start of a new life for us Vera.' And now look at us. New indeed.\" The clip skipped ahead to her running through the jungle, jewel in hand, after she and Nigel stole it back. Distant shouting from the camp could be heard. \"Sorry Russel,\" she mumbled. \"But you left me no choice.\" She continued running. She paused in her story again, and they all waited for her to continue. But she didn't. Instead, the cut-scene fell away, signalling her story was over. She just shrugged, eyes still locked on the flames. \"There, now you have it.\" The others absorbed this. \"Vera, why didn't you tell us?\" Bethany asked. \"I didn't think it would be the best information to disclose upon us meeting.\" \"Now I get why you wanted to destroy it.\" Spencer nodded. \"Yeah. I'd hoped I would be able to free him from the clutches of corruption, but...\" Her words trailed off and she shrugged again. She picked up a stick and tossed it into the fire. \"Excuse me,\" she then said, getting to her feet and leaving the group of avatars sitting around the fire. There it is, now you have the backstory! :) Hope you guys liked it, thanks so much for all the reads and reviews! :)[Chapter 14] Hello again! :) Here's the next chapter for you - hope you enjoy! Fourteen: The Difficult Truth When Spencer found Vera, she was crouched down by a nearby stream splashing water on her face. She looked up sharply at him, as though he had startled her. \"Just me,\" he said. \"Hey.\" \"I'm just filling these up.\" He held up their canteens. She nodded and he knelt down beside her to scoop up some water. \"Thanks for telling us your story,\" he said after a pause. \"Oh, yeah. Thanks for listening.\" \"I realize it was probably difficult to recall.\" She gave a little shrug. \"Like I said before, I'm quite over it.\" He could tell by the way she said it though that she knew she was lying too. You didn't just get over a betrayal like that. \"Hey, thank you again, for earlier, with the snake. I'm deathly terrified of them, bugs too.\" She chuckled a little. \"Not ideal for an archaeologist working in the jungle. And not so ideal when the man you once had feelings for suddenly has bugs crawling all over him.\" She chuckled at the absurdity of it. \"And I don't know, when I saw the snake I just, froze.\" \"No problem.\" He smiled. \"I like your Dr. Bravestone, Spencer,\" she said. \"You do?\" \"Yeah. You're sweet and funny. And cute. Different. But a good different. And I'm glad you're here. All of you. I said I wanted to do this alone, but it was getting difficult. Perhaps I needed some additional support. I was becoming rather uncertain.\" \"Well uh, thanks.\" He smiled. Then he asked, \"is he a real jerk, like in real life?\" She chuckled. \"Not exactly. He's very self-centered, and flirtatious. Loves attention. And loves to joke around - he put a rubber snake in my desk drawer once.\" \"Oooo...\" \"Yeah. Still haven't forgiven him. Never will.\" They both chuckled. \"No, he's just not much of a team player. If anyone was the team, it was Russel and I.\" Recalling the memory, she didn't catch herself and called him by his first name and not just 'Van Pelt' as she had before. He nodded. Then he turned more serious. \"Vera,\" he said, as gently as he could. \"I don't think the jewel corrupted him.\" She was quiet for a moment before she sighed. \"No, I think you're right. I just didn't want to believe it was him.\" \"I'm sorry.\" She shrugged. \"You know, I kind of get it, the whole betrayal thing, feeling betrayed by a friend. I know this isn't really the same thing, but Fridge and I used to be really close friends, back in elementary school. But then suddenly, I wasn't 'cool' enough to hang out with him anymore.\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"So if you ever want to talk, I'm here.\" She smiled a little. \"Thank you, Spencer. He smiled back. Then his smile fell and he turned serious again. \"Vera, have you noticed that everyone besides us here acts kind of strange? Like they repeat themselves and only say a few things?\" He was curious as to what her extent of awareness about the game was. So far, it seemed like virtually none. Now she appeared thoughtful. \"Not really. Why?\" \"Or that no matter how many we take down, Van Pelt still seems to have the same number of men?\" Now she looked confused, and shook her head. \"Because-\" Here goes. \"-There's no real easy way to say this but - they're not real. It's not real. It's all just a game - Jumanji. It's a video game me and the others found and got sucked into. You're one of the characters. Same with Nigel. And Van Pelt - he's the classic video game bad guy.\" He paused, trying to read her expression. \"And Alex - he's been here longer than us, but we don't know how long...\" He trailed off, allowing her to absorb this. She stared at him, he staring expectantly back. SMACK! She struck him across the face. She looked wounded. \"How dare you tell me that this isn't real! That all I've done has been for nothing!\" \"Vera I-\" \"You think this is some sort of damn joke?\" \"No! Of course not-\" \"Get away from me!\" she hissed and shoved him. While when Fridge had shoved him before he hadn't moved, her shoving him caused him to stumble back. Wow, she really was strong. \"Vera, I didn't mean-\" \"Oh shut up! And you wonder why I was so hesitant to trust you. Well I shouldn't have. And no, you don't understand how I feel - don't pretend to.\" And with that, she stormed off into the trees. Spencer just stood there, rooted to his spot, shocked. Finally, he snapped out of his trance. What had he done? \"Vera - wait!\" Without another thought he took off after her. But she was gone. Nowhere in sight. She had fled, deep into the trees, away from them - away from him. Their task to get home, the person they were supposed to help in order to leave the game, was gone, and it was all his fault. This now weighing heavily on him, he returned to the group. \"Spencer? What's wrong, what happened?\" Martha noticed his distress first. He looked down, guilt written all over his face. \"Vera's gone.\" \"What?\" \"She left.\" \"Why?\" \"I told her this was all just a game. And of course, she took offense to that. How could I have been so stupid?\" he cried. \"But I thought she deserved to know.\" The group was silent, absorbing this. \"Now what do we do?\" asked Bethany, but everyone was wondering the same. \"We're supposed to help her right? That's how we complete the game.\" But how were they supposed to help her now if she wasn't here? \"We do what she would want us to,\" Spencer decided. \"Complete the quest.\" Thank you guys so much for all the reads and reviews! :) I'm so, so glad you guys are enjoying this story! It is starting to wrap up I'm afraid, but there's still a few chapters left! Thanks again so much and I hope you enjoyed as always! :)[Chapter 15] Hello again! Welcome back! :) Fifteen: Encounter Storming through the jungle, Vera was suddenly drawn to a sharp halt, snapped from her angry thoughts. How could he say that? How could he believe that? And I was just beginning to warm to them- Although it was a welcome distraction from her current thoughts, she sensed something around her, an uneasy presence. There was a pause in the dark and quiet; her hand wrapped around one handgun... Seconds later the weapon was drawn and she had whirled around, pointing it at the emptiness that was behind her, surrounding her, finger on the trigger, ready. Or maybe not... Maybe she hadn't sensed someone else. She lowered the gun - maybe she was just paranoid. When she turned back to resume her trek, she came face-to-face with the watchful vulture. It was a giant bird, big and menacing. A shrill squeak escaped her lips and she jumped back. The bird only cocked its head to the side, regarding her through its small, dark eyes. Eyes dark like those of its master, or at least before they had become the bright green of the stone that controlled him. Vera had always found herself intrigued by those dark eyes, and would only have ever admitted it to him. She did not need to turn around to know that he was there too. The bird had led him to her. She kept the gun lowered, for now, but her grip on it tightened. Finally, she turned and met his eyes, familiar and yet unfamiliar at the same time. They stared at each other for a long time in silence. She spoke first. \"You've got a little something there.\" She pointed to her own cheek, watching a little bug with many legs skitter across his cheek and disappear beneath the collar of his jacket. He didn't even flinch whereas the sight made her stomach churn. He stepped closer and she shuddered when a centipede crawled out of his hair and into his ear. This was enough to make her cringe. \"Did not need to see that...\" She squeezed her eyes shut tight and shook her head, trying to rid her memory of that image now seared into her brain. He reached out to hold her cheek, the leather of his glove brushed soft against her skin. She batted his hand away. \"Sod off.\" He lowered his hand. There was another moment of silence before she scoffed. \"'This is going to be the start of a new life for us Vera'. Seriously? I mean, what the hell Russel? You can't just say something like that and then pull a stunt like this. Our life's work.\" She scoffed again. He didn't say anything, only continued to stare at her through his now bright green eyes. She didn't like it. \"Say something. You came here for a reason.\" But still, he remained silent. \"I don't have your bloody jewel.\" Only now it dawned on her too - she'd left it with the others, her thoughts too clouded with anger to remember it. After much convincing, they'd manged to get her to give it to Fridge to put in his backpack for safekeeping. \"All this time...\" Finally, he spoke. \"The key to unlocking the jewel was right here in front of me...\" What the hell? \"What are you talking about?\" Controlling all the animal life in Jumanji and setting a curse upon the jungle wasn't enough? He wanted more power? \"You-\" Now he came forward and cupped her face in both hands. \"You're the key...\" His green eyes were wide and bright and he chuckled with realization. She squirmed away. \"What are you talking-\" \"Come with me Vera, join me. Together we shall rule the jungle.\" Did it sound as ridiculous as she thought it did? \"Give in to it's power-\" \"Okay stop-\" \"Come with me Vera, join me...\" \"What-\" \"Come with me Vera...\" \"Wh- stop!\" \"Join me...\" \"Stop saying that!\" The repetition was robotic almost, delivered the same each time. She stared back at him, shocked. I loved you! she wanted to scream, but forced herself to hold her tongue. \"Even if I were to, that's not going to happen to me is it?\" She gestured to her face, clear of bugs, thank goodness, unlike his. \"Well, as tempting as that sounds-\" She made sure her voice was dripping with so much sarcasm even the most gullible could tell. They now stood close, their faces inches apart, she looking up at him. So close, she was sure he could feel her hot breath on his face. \"-I'm not taking any chances. Think again, Mate. You made your choice Russel, and I've made mine.\" With that, she drew away and turned on her heel and started to stalk off. \"They're heading to the statue, Bravestone and the others. See you there, Vera.\" He knew she would go back to the statue. Whether for him or the others, she would go. Yay we finally got to see them together - sort of ;) I'm super invested in their relationship, if you couldn't tell ;) Haha! Thanks so much for reading and as always, hope you enjoyed![Chapter 16] Hello welcome back! Thank you to all who have read, reviewed, followed, and favourited this story, it means so much to me! :) Sixteen: The Last Level is Always the Hardest There it was, the jaguar statue. Night had fallen, and now it stood looming, a dark shadow in the distance. Thunder rumbled in the distance, followed closely by strikes of lightning. \"The final level,\" Spencer declared. \"The last level is always the hardest.\" Putting Fridge's plan into action, the five split up to lure away 'the defenders', real, alive jaguars protecting the statue, and trying to avoid the men on motorcycles who had arrived in pursuit of them. The plan went relatively smoothly - that was, until they reached the base of the statue. Spencer, Martha, and Alex looked in horror at the sight ahead of them: Van Pelt had caught Bethany and was now holding his silver gun to her head, a pack of jaguars surrounding them. \"Beth!\" cried Martha. \"Oh no-\" \"Let her go,\" Spencer tried. \"The jewel, now,\" Van Pelt demanded. \"Or your friend dies.\" They just stared back at him. Bethany felt the cold press of his gun against the side of her head. \"Bethany, no!\" cried Alex. \"Take me instead!\" He gestured to himself. There was a moment of tense silence that was broken moments later by the sound of a crash, followed by a wail. This was followed by more crashing and cries. The group turned to look back at where the motorcycle men had surrounded them, but one by one, they were all being taken down by some seemingly invisible force- Martha and Spencer exchanged a glance. It's her, her gaze said. He nodded, a smile appearing on his face. Now, despite having a gun pressed firmly to her head, Bethany smiled too. \"Oh boy, you have a storm coming!\" she told Van Pelt. \"Your ex-girlfriend is here, and she's pissed! And trust me, there's nothing worse than a pissed off ex-girlfriend!\" And she was right. With the next crack of thunder and flash of lightning, the group saw her silhouette from where she stood above them on a little cliff side, leg up on a rock, just like when they had first met her. She had changed her appearance some, now with a leather jacket over her tank top and not her blue shirt, and also different pants and boots, and a helmet over her head hiding her face, having disguised herself as one of the mercenaries. Vera removed her long riding gloves and then whipped off her helmet, her yellow hair now down and flowing around her face. She grinned at Van Pelt. \"Hey Love,\" she mocked. Van Pelt just responded by pressing the gun more firmly to Bethany's head, as though his ex-girlfriend and work partner hadn't just shown up meaning business. \"Five...\" He began to countdown. Nothing. \"Four...\" Still nothing. \"Three...\" \"Spencer!\" hissed Martha. \"I can't give you the jewel,\" Spencer said. \"Spencer!\" cried Alex this time. \"Two!\" \"Because I don't have it!\" As if on cue, there was a rustling nearby. Moments later, Fridge burst through the trees, riding on the back of an elephant and holding the jewel up in the air almost tauntingly. \"ZOOLOGY BITCH!\" Seeing as her captor was momentarily stunned by Fridge's dramatic entrance - they all were - Bethany seized this as her moment. \"Douchebag! You suck!\" She stomped on Van Pelt's foot, followed by driving her elbow into his chest. He let go of her but recovered quickly and promptly backhanded her across the face. Then he took the chance to set his jaguars loose on Fridge and the elephant, causing Fridge to let go of the jewel and it to go flying up onto a nearby cliff. Now Van Pelt raised his gun on Bethany again, finger on the trigger- \"LEAVE HER ALONE!\" Alex dove forward, taking out Van Pelt before he could shoot her. Spencer, Martha, and Vera all leaped into action while Alex fought Van Pelt. \"Wait, elephant!\" cried Martha in realization. \"Begin the climb,\" Spencer finished. \"You guys go, I got this.\" With that, Martha charged towards a group of men - time to put her dance fighting skills to good use. Spencer turned to Vera and smiled. \"You came back.\" She nodded. \"I figured, I've been at this too long to give up now, real or not.\" \"Vera, I'm sorry, I didn't mean-\" \"But it's real to me,\" she finished with a smile. \"What did you lot get up to while I was gone?\" \"Uh, well, we learned that Alex has actually been stuck here for twenty years, Martha flirted with some guys to distract them while we snuck into the transportation shed, and she totally kicked their asses at dance fighting. We stole a helicopter, which I was hanging out of, got chased by rhinos, almost lost the jewel - almost - and Bethany saved Alex's life.\" She looked a mix of shocked and impressed. \"Hmm, you were busy.\" Their path was blocked by jaguars. \"How did you get past the jaguars last time?\" he asked. \"We didn't. They weren't here. He's controlling them.\" They both noticed a flicker of green up on the nearby cliff - the jewel. \"Here, you go, I'll hold them off,\" Spencer said, speaking of the cats. She nodded and took off running - no time to lose! The cliff was small so she didn't have to climb up very far. However, what met her at the top of it almost made her fall - it was a pit full of little snakes. Of course, it just had to be. And of course, the jewel was sitting at the centre, surrounded by them, almost as though they were guarding it. But she had no choice. So, taking a deep breath and mustering up all the courage she could, she gingerly took a step forward. The snakes didn't move, just watched her. She could feel the press of their gazes. She tried to maintain a wide stance to balance herself better - she narrowly avoided stepping on a snake. Finally, she reached it. She scooped it up. \"Gotcha.\" Suddenly, in eerie unison, all the snakes stretched their heads up and with one great hiss, all turned at once to look behind her. She looked too - there stood Van Pelt. \"I'll take that.\" He reached his hand out expectantly. She didn't move. \"Game over, Vera.\" She gave a firm shake of her head and clutched the jewel close. \"Not yet.\" Once again he commanded the snakes, and now all their heads turned on her - he knew how terrified she was of them. Searching around desperately for an escape, she quickly lost her footing and began to stumble. \"Vera, wait - stop!\" But his warning came too late. Stumbling back, she accidentally stomped on one of the snakes. This in turn made it angry and with a vicious hiss, it rose up and dug its fangs into her leg. Pain struck her expression and a sharp gasp escaped her lips. She grew rigid. \"I-I hate s-snakes,\" she managed to choke out after a stunned moment, before the others, including Van Pelt, watched in horror as she, now weak, stumbled off the edge of the cliff. \"Oh my God!\" \"Vera!\" The jewel fell from her hands, plunging into a rushing river below, lost. Just when it looked like she might crash to the ground, the vulture swooped in and took the collar of her jacket in its talons, swooping down and landing, gently laying her on the grass. The others scrambled over to her, but Van Pelt beat them to it. He dropped to his knees by her side. Pain creased Vera's face. She writhed a little as the venom spread and her face and neck were already shiny with sweat, her body's desperate attempt at ridding itself of the deadly venom, but all in vain. \"Vera you're hurt, lie still,\" Van Pelt instructed, his voice surprisingly gentle. \"R-Russell?\" she breathed. \"W-where are you? I c-can hear you, but I-I can't s-see you...\" She blinked, again and again. \"I'm right here.\" He took her hand in both of his gloved ones. \"Oh, there you are...\" Although it was obvious she still couldn't see him. \"W-where are we?\" \"VERA!\" Now the other five arrived, stopping dead when they saw Van Pelt. \"Bravestone?\" She recognized his voice. \"You're here too? Did we come to an understanding? I'm glad...\" The venom was making her confused. Even her words were becoming slurred. And she was already sickeningly pale, the venom doing its damage fast. \"We- we're in Jumanji,\" Van Pelt answered. She seemed to almost perk up at this. \"Jumanji?\" She chuckled. \"We made it...\" \"Yes, we did.\" \"After all this time... Did we find it, the jewel?\" \"Y-yes...\" She breathed a heavy sigh, one that sounded like disbelief. \"I knew we could do it...\" \"Vera-\" One last heavy breath left her lips before she became quiet and her body went limp. As though reflecting the now somber mood, thunder rumbled distantly. The five others kept their distance, but all looked at their fallen friend with sadness. There wasn't long to mourn though. Furious now, Van Pelt spun around, rising to his feet and pointed his gun at the group. \"This is all your fault!\" he accused. \"Our fault?!\" demanded Bethany. \"You're the asshole who stole the damn jewel!\" Just as he was about to fire, there was a rumbling and everything shook. Moments later, all was still again. Just as abruptly, all was quiet. Duh duh duh! Cliffhanger! ;) Haha! It's been a bit of a stressful week - lots of assignments due, and on top of it all I had computer troubles and had to take it in to get it fixed. But, it's all fixed now, so I can continue writing ;) The end is near I'm afraid, but there's still a few chapters left! Thanks so much for reading and as always, I hope you enjoyed this chapter, as well as the little twists I added! :)[Chapter 17] Hey guys! Here's the next chapter for you, hope you enjoy! :) Seventeen: 'The True Nature of the Jewel is Not What You Think...' \"Whoa...\" \"W-what happened?\" \"You guys felt that too?\" \"Alright, what the hell just happened?\" The five stood at the mouth of the forest again. They jumped when, just as before, the long, torch-framed pathway lit up, as though beckoning them to venture down it. \"This again?\" \"Uh oh guys, we've got company...\" Lights through the trees signaled Van Pelt and his men arriving. Everything happened just as before: they split up, followed Fridge's plan, only for it to be halted when Van Pelt caught Bethany. Then Vera arrived and they leapt into action again. \"The jewel!\" cried Vera. \"We got it!\" Spencer cried, not wanting a repeat of last time. \"Martha, Fridge, and I will get the jewel, you help Bethany and Alex.\" He didn't give her time to protest, and rushed off with Martha and Fridge in tow. Vera turned to face the others, just in time to see Van Pelt punch Alex and send him flying. \"Alex!\" cried Bethany. Then she noticed the fellow blonde woman. \"Vera!\" She had a clean shot, and was even holding her gun ready. But she was frozen, finger on the trigger. \"Vera!\" Vera cursed herself - she had a clean shot, why wasn't she taking it? Her hand was shaking so much she was afraid she would miss and hit Alex. No, it wasn't just that; she didn't want to hit him either. Bang ! A shot shattered the night, drawing everyone to a sharp and sudden halt. But it wasn't from Vera's gun. It was one of Van Pelt's mercenaries. They weren't sure where he had been aiming, but he had missed terribly - and hit Vera. It was hard to miss, as her light-coloured tank-top made the blood stand out, even in the dark. \"VERA!\" \"Oh no, not again-\" The mercenary realized his mistake, but too late. Next thing they all knew, there was another deafening ring as Van Pelt shot the man dead and rushed to catch Vera just as she collapsed. \"Vera-\" She stared up at him, wide-eyed and gasping. \"T-this is y-your f-fault,\" she hissed at him. \"Y-you did t-this...\" Then, just as suddenly as before, everything shook and then was all still again. Vera was gone, Van Pelt was gone, and it was just the five avatars, standing before the entrance to the shrine. \" Again ?\" \"Seriously?!\" \"What are we, trapped in a time loop or something?\" \"Why does that keep happening?\" Again, everything played out just as before: \"Give me the jewel, or your friend dies.\" \"I can't give you the jewel.\" \"Hey Love.\" \"ZOOLOGY BITCH!\" \"Douchebag! You suck!\" \"LEAVE HER ALONE!\" \"Wait, I think it's trying to tell us something,\" Spencer said, waving the group over. \"I think we're doing this wrong. Usually in video games if you fail at your task, the level ends and you have to start over from the beginning...\" \"So you're thinking we keep failing at our task?\" Martha summed up. \"Yeah...\" \"But we're doing what they want! We're trying to get the jewel back to the statue.\" \"Yeah, but what if the jewel isn't actually the literal jewel? What if it goes deeper than that?\" Spencer turned to Vera. \"Vera, I think you're the key to saving Jumanji. I think you're the jewel. Or at least, you have to be the one to return it.\" She gawked at him. \"What?! That makes no sense!\" \"But just think, the message the snake was guarding: 'the jewel is the heart but not the key'. And remember what Nigel said: 'the true nature of the jewel is not what you think.'\" He looked to the others who were nodding, recalling this. \"This must have been what he meant.\" Vera still looked skeptical. \"B-but-\" But then she recalled what Russell had said. \" All this time... The key to unlocking the jewel was right here in front of me... You, you're the key ...\" He'd literally told her, but she had just dismissed it as the possession of the jewel's power over him. \"And our task,\" Spencer continued, everything clicking into place. \"We're here to help you save Jumanji. Help you .\" Now they were all looking at her expectantly. \"And I think Van Pelt realizes that.\" \"That's why he's so intent on keeping me unharmed...\" He nodded. \"B-but-\" She looked up at the statue, alit by a flash of lightning, and the thunder that followed it sounding like a great roar. The height of the statue alone was giving her jitters, let alone this new pressure to save this place. \"Vera, if Fridge and I can take on a snake, if Spencer can do all those brave things, if Martha could flirt and fight those guys, and if Alex could fly that helicopter, you can do this,\" Bethany assured her. \"We're here to help and support you,\" Martha added. \"Yeah, and I'll be right up there with you,\" Spencer assured her. \"We'll do this together.\" She looked up at him and smiled. \"Okay.\" \"You need to get to the top of the statue.\" \"I need to get to the top of the statue.\" A group of motorcycles surrounded them, snapping them back into action. \"You two go, I'll get the jewel to you.\" With that, Martha dance-fought her way to the cliff. \"You go, get a head start. There's something I have to take care of here first.\" Spencer didn't answer. \"Spencer?\" He appeared to snap from some sort of trance. \"Yeah?\" \"You alright?\" \"Yeah, yeah I - no,\" he sighed. \"Vera I - I'm scared. I'm not actually Bravestone, I'm not actually brave. And if we don't succeed, I don't know what's going to happen...\" He looked at the ground. \"Hey.\" She placed a supportive hand on his shoulder, making him look up. \"But see, you are brave. I've seen you be brave. And admitting that you're scared, that's one of the bravest things to do. And I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little scared too.\" He nodded slowly, and a smile spread across his face. \"Thanks Vera.\" She smiled back. \"Now, let's do this.\" With that, they split up. She turned to face the fight taking place between Alex, Bethany, and Van Pelt. This time, Alex ducked out of the way, just missing being punched. Van Pelt withdrew his gun. Seeing that this was her chance, Vera charged forward. She jumped in front of Alex and Bethany and kicked the gun from his hand. Having caught him off guard, she didn't waste this moment and kicked him to the ground, delivering a punch to his jaw. This did the trick, and he lay there motionless for a moment, groaning. Bethany and Alex had joined Fridge and were safe. They all turned at the sound of a roaring motor to see Spencer speed by on a motorcycle he had taken, beginning the climb. That was her cue. Only, how was she going to get up to the top of the statue. As the loyal jaguars crept around their master, she got an idea. With Van Pelt down for now, he couldn't control them... \"Oi Finbar, jaguars are good climbers, right?\" \"Yeah. Their skills include that, swimming, and crawling. And they have a very powerful bite,\" the zoologist told her. \"Brilliant.\" She held out her hand, letting one of the great cats sniff her to gain some trust between them. Then she hopped onto its back and it bounded off, climbing the statue. \"Don't look down, don't look down,\" she repeated, almost like a chant to calm herself, as they continued to climb. \"Why does it have to be at the very top of the bloody statue?\" Looking ahead she saw Spencer had reached the top - the sun was just starting to rise above them. There was the sound of chimes and she saw a flash of red hair and a pink shirt and green jewel as Martha fell from the sky, having used up one of her lives to get the jewel to them. Using a rope with a hook on the end from the bike, Spencer swung off the side of the statue to meet her as she fell, catching the jewel. He got it right as Vera and her new jaguar friend made it to the top, and Martha had a safe landing below. Spencer tossed the jewel into Vera's hands. \"Care to do the honours?\" \"Gladly.\" With that, she plunged the jewel into the eye of the statue. Nothing happened. Nothing. There was only tense silence as everyone watched and waited. They'd done everything right, what were they missing? \"'Call out its name...'\" \"'Call out its name!'\" \"Call out its name, everyone!\" \"Jumanji!\" \"Jumanji!\" \"JUMANJI!\" JUMANJI! :D So, what did you think of my twist? The next chapter I had two ideas for, and I couldn't decide on one, so I wrote both! Looking forward to seeing what you guys think of both - thanks so much for reading and as always, hope you enjoyed! :)[Chapter 18] Helloooo! Here's the first version of the ending! Enjoy! Eighteen: Level Complete (Version 1) \" JUMANJI !\" There was an almost blinding flash, followed by stunned silence. The silence was broken by Vera's excited cry, she jumping into the air with a fist-pump. \"We did it!\" The others soon joined in, cheering and hugging. \"You guys, we did it, we finished the game,\" Alex said once Vera and Spencer had made it down from the statue and joined the rest of the group. While they celebrated their victory, they heard a groan from off to the side. \"Vera?\" They looked to see Van Pelt, no longer surrounded by jaguars, sitting up and looking disoriented, holding his jaw where she had punched him, and a nasty bruise was already forming. \"I'm going to go give that guy a piece of my mind-\" Fridge stormed forward, but Vera held up a hand, signalling for him to- \"Wait-\" Slowly, she stepped forward, approaching Van Pelt, who was shakily getting to his feet, looking around in mixed wonder and confusion. While the others hadn't known him before, only knowing him in his cursed state, they didn't catch on to the notable difference: his eyes were no longer green in their possessed state. They were back to their usual intriguing dark brown. That, and he didn't have bugs crawling all over him anymore. \"Vera-\" He noticed her slowly approaching. \"What's wrong?\" Then he noticed the others. Now he looked even more puzzled. \"Bravestone? What are you doing here? I thought you left.\" The others shuffled back. Vera now stood before him, staring up at him curiously. Slowly, hesitantly almost, she reached up and held his cheek, turning his head from side to side, and up and down, making sure it wasn't just her own eyes playing tricks on her. No, his eyes really were back to normal. And no bugs. The curse, the jewel, its power... Now that they had returned the jewel and broken the curse, could that mean... \"I thought you said he was just the bad guy,\" she called to Spencer, eyes still on Van Pelt. \"That's what I thought. It made sense.\" Van Pelt had just seemed like the classic video game villain. However, this game did seem to have a mind of its own to some degree... It was full of surprises. \"Vera?\" Van Pelt still appeared to have no clue what was going on. \"What's happening? Where are we?\" \"How much do you remember?\" She posed a question of her own. \"Uh, not much-\" \"Well that's convenient,\" mumbled Fridge. \"-We traveled to Jumanji - wait, is that where we are? We found it? And the jewel, did we finally find it? Is it real?\" Now he looked excited. She scoffed in disbelief, a smile spreading across her face. She looked as though she might burst into tears. \"You have no idea.\" She shook her head. \"Russell.\" \"Yeah?\" SMACK! Now he fell victim to one of Vera's vicious slaps. \"Trust me, you deserve that.\" Now he was only even more confused, especially when, right after that, Vera threw her arms around him in a passionate kiss. \"Whoa,\" Spencer and Martha both declared. Fridge almost dropped his backpack. Even Van Pelt looked surprised at first, but quickly recovered and fully returned the kiss. It got pretty awkward pretty quick. Alex looked slightly uncomfortable, while Bethany looked slightly unsure. \"It's kinda weird, but also kinda cute...\" \"Uh, you do remember he was trying to kill us like five minutes ago right?\" Fridge said. Vera broke away, laughing and watery-eyed. \"I thought I lost you! You stole the jewel and then there was this curse, and you became possessed and turned all evil, and had bugs crawling all over your face and your eyes turned all green! I even began to wonder - and worry - if it wasn't the curse. B-but it was, in the end.\" She laughed again in disbelief. \"And then - AHHHH!\" She suddenly screamed and jumped back when a fat tarantula emerged from beneath the collar of his coat and onto his shoulder, this one lagging behind after his loss of power. He jumped and began trying to brush the hairy spider off his coat. Finally, he did, and it landed on the grass and scurried away. There was a moment before she burst into laughter and threw her arms around him once more. Beep beep! This time their embrace was cut off by the honking of a car horn. Down a dirt road ahead, a Jeep was making its way along towards them. \"It's Nigel!\" The group rushed to meet the Jeep. Nigel emerged, looking impressed and proud. \"You did it friends!\" he cried. \"You lifted the curse! All of Jumanji thanks you! So sadly, this is where we part.\" Vera came over and joined the field guide in bidding their friends farewell. This was it. \"Goodbye, Alex,\" Vera said, shaking his hand. \"I'm sorry. Had I known that it had been so long, I would have helped you right away-\" \"Hey, it's cool. I didn't realize it either,\" he assured her. \"Thanks Vera.\" \"You taught me to persevere, and keep trying.\" They hugged. \"See you later, Seaplane. You're not so bad after all.\" \"Seaplane McDonough, let me shake your hand.\" Nigel extended his hand. Alex turned to the others one last time. \"Thanks guys.\" Then he reached out to shake Nigel's hand, and vanished almost instantly. Now Nigel turned to Fridge. \"I shall miss you the most, Mouse-\" \"Get me the hell outta here!\" Fridge practically leapt forward, throwing off his backpack. He paused in reaching out to shake Nigel's hand to turn to Vera. \"Hey, it was nice meeting you.\" \"You as well, Fridge.\" She tried out the nickname. \"You taught me that size doesn't matter, doesn't measure your worth or strength, coming from a fellow small person.\" She pulled him into a hug before he took Nigel's hand and was sent off as well. \"Adieu, Professor Oberon.\" Next Nigel extended his hand to Bethany. Beth turned to Vera. \"Later girl. Good luck with everything.\" \"Thank you, Beth. You taught me the importance of loving me for who I am.\" They hugged. \"I shall always remember your advice.\" Bethany gave her hands a squeeze and one last smile before also shaking Nigel's hand and disappearing. \"Ruby Roundhouse-\" Now it was Martha's turn. \"And you Martha, you taught me that a little confidence can go a long way. I might have to give that dance fighting a try.\" Martha chuckled and hugged the smaller woman. \"Thanks. Bye Vera.\" \"Goodbye.\" Martha too shook Nigel's outstretched hand. Now it was only Spencer who remained. Spencer turned to Vera. \"So, I guess this is it, huh?\" \"It would seem so.\" \"You gonna be okay?\" She chuckled a little. \"Yeah, we'll be good. We'll figure something out. I obviously have a lot of explaining to do.\" \"What going to happen to you? Now that the game's over?\" She considered this. \"I don't know. We'll see, I suppose. It'll be an adventure.\" She looked a little nervous, but smiled through it. He extended his hand. \"Well then, farewell Dr. Bailey.\" \"Farewell Spencer.\" She shook his hand. Spencer looked at Nigel, waiting patiently to send him on his way. She sensed his uncertainty. \"Hey - go home Spencer, live your life. And don't worry, you still have lots of time to figure everything out. You've got your whole life to. And I know you will.\" She smiled. \"Goodbye Spencer. Thank you.\" \"Bye Vera. Thank you .\" \"Bye.\" She turned away. \"And Spencer, one more word of advice: never stop living the adventure.\" She smiled. He smiled back. Then he turned back to the expectant field guild. \"Nigel, I'm ready to go home.\" He gave an affirmative nod, preparing himself. \"Doctor Bravestone, it's been an honour.\" Nigel extended his hand. \"Farewell my good man.\" \"See you later, Bravestone,\" Spencer said softly. Then he reached out and took Nigel's hand. So that's one of the versions of the end - what did you think? ;) I've become so invested in Vera and Van Pelt's relationship that I was searching for some way for the possibility of having a happy ending for them, so there we go! Next is the second version of the ending, something different, more along the lines of how this story was originally going to go! Hope you enjoyed and as always, thanks so much for reading! :)[Chapter 19] Hello again! Now time for the second version of the ending! Enjoy! Nineteen: Level Complete (Version 2) \" JUMANJI !\" There was an almost blinding flash, followed by stunned silence. The silence was broken by Vera's excited cry, she jumping into the air with a fist-pump. \"We did it!\" She jumped into Spencer's arms and they twirled around in a hug, their faces close. He set her back down and they both pulled away, a little awkwardly, but smiling. \"You know,\" she said. \"It's actually a very nice view from up here - if you don't focus too much on how high up we are.\" He chuckled. \"Yeah, it is.\" \"I just thought of something.\" \"Hmm?\" \"How are we going to get down from here?\" Both laughed. \"You guys, we did it, we finished the game,\" Alex said once Vera and Spencer had made it down from the statue and joined the rest of the group. Off to the side, while they celebrated their victory, Van Pelt was still being surrounded by the jaguars, who now pounced on him playfully. \"I'm going to go give that guy a piece of my mind-\" Fridge stormed forward, but Vera grabbed his backpack to hold him back. \"Whoa, easy there, Mate. We'll deal with him, don't you worry.\" She made her way over. When the jaguars saw her they scampered off into the trees, leaving a shaken Van Pelt - his eyes were no longer green, therefore he had no more power. She hauled him to his feet by the collar of his jacket and then promptly smacked him across the face. \"Oh I've been waiting to do that!\" she declared, and then took some rope from Fridge's backpack to knot his hands together. Beep beep! Down a dirt road ahead, a Jeep was making its way towards them. \"It's Nigel!\" Alex cried. The group rushed to meet the Jeep. Nigel emerged, looking impressed and proud. \"You did it friends!\" he cried. \"You lifted the curse! All of Jumanji thanks you! Though sadly, this is where we part.\" Vera shoved Van Pelt into the back seat of the Jeep before joining the field guide in bidding their friends farewell. This was it. \"Goodbye, Alex,\" Vera said, shaking his hand. \"I'm sorry. Had I known that it had been so long, I would have helped you right away-\" \"Hey, it's cool. I didn't realize it either,\" he assured her. \"Thanks Vera.\" \"You taught me to persevere, and keep trying.\" They hugged. \"See you later Seaplane. You're not so bad after all.\" \"Seaplane McDonough, let me shake your hand.\" Nigel extended his hand. Alex turned to address the others one last time. \"Thanks guys.\" Then he reached out to shake Nigel's hand, and vanished almost instantly. Now Nigel turned to Fridge. \"I shall miss you the most, Mouse-\" \"Get me the hell out of here!\" Fridge practically leapt forward, throwing off his backpack. He paused in reaching out to shake Nigel's hand to turn to Vera. \"Hey, it was nice meeting you.\" \"You as well, Fridge.\" She tried out the nickname. \"You taught me that size doesn't matter, doesn't measure your worth or strength, coming from a fellow small person.\" She pulled him into a hug too. Then he shook Nigel's hand and was sent off as well. \"Adieu, Professor Oberon.\" Nigel extended his hand to Bethany. Beth turned to Vera. \"Later girl. Good luck with the ex-boyfriend, but I know you've got this.\" \"Thank you Beth. You taught me the importance of loving me for who I am.\" They hugged. \"I shall always remember your advice.\" Bethany gave her hands a squeeze and gave one last smile before also shaking Nigel's hand and disappearing. \"Ruby Roundhouse-\" Now it was Martha's turn. \"And you Martha, you taught me that a little confidence can go a long way. I might have to give that dance fighting a try.\" Martha chuckled and hugged the smaller woman. \"Thanks. Bye Vera.\" \"Goodbye.\" Martha too shook Nigel's outstretched hand. Now it was only Spencer who remained. Spencer turned to Vera. \"So, I guess this is it, huh?\" \"It would seem so.\" \"You gonna be okay?\" She chuckled a little. \"Yeah, we'll be good. We'll figure something out...\" There was a pause. \"Okay, come here you.\" She held out her arms for a hug which he gladly returned. \"What going to happen to you? Now that the game's over?\" She considered this. \"I don't know. We'll see, I suppose. It'll be an adventure.\" She looked a little nervous, but smiled through it. Spencer looked at Nigel, waiting patiently to send him on his way, but then turned back to Vera. He surprised her by saying, \"What if I were to stay? I-I like being like this - with you. We could go on more adventures. We could be like this, every day.\" She appeared a little shocked by his suggestion, but then smiled warmly. \"Go home Spencer, live your life. And you can be like this, every day. As you.\" She poked him in the chest. \"And don't worry, you have lots of time to figure everything out. You've got your whole life to. And I know you will.\" She smiled. Then she rose up on her tip-toes and pressed a kiss to his cheek. He managed to catch the death-glare that Van Pelt was giving him from inside the Jeep. \"Goodbye Spencer. Thank you.\" \"Bye Vera. Thank you .\" \"Bye.\" She turned away. \"And Spencer, one more word of advice: never stop living the adventure.\" He nodded. \"Hey Vera, do you think you'll ever reconcile with Bravestone?\" She considered this. \"Perhaps.\" She smiled. He smiled back. Then he turned back to the expectant field guild. \"Nigel. I'm ready to go home.\" He gave an affirmative nod, preparing himself. \"Doctor Bravestone, it's been an honour.\" Nigel extended his hand. \"Farewell my good man.\" \"See you later Bravestone,\" Spencer said softly. Then he reached out and took Nigel's hand. Aww... So this was the original ending, before I became way too invested in Vera and Van Pelt's relationship ;) Which ending did you like better? Like I said, I couldn't decide, so I wrote both! :) That's the nice thing about fanfiction - anything can happen! Either way, I think Van Pelt gets a better ending than dissolving into a bunch of rats, haha! ;) Hope you enjoyed, thanks so much for reading - almost done (one more chapter!)[Chapter 20] Hello! Here's the final chapter! Hope you enjoy! Twenty: The End? They were back home, as themselves, Spencer, Martha, Bethany, and Fridge. As for them, well, they were changed, and for what they saw to be the better. Their adventure as Bravestone, Ruby Roundhouse, Professor Oberon, and Mouse Finbar was not forgotten. \"Yo Spencer.\" \"Hey man.\" Spencer and Fridge fist-bumped. They had reconciled and had gone back to being friends. Bethany was less focused on her phone, less selfish, and definitely more open to trying new things. \"I want to go backpacking,\" she told her friend Lucinda, who stared shocked back. \"Like outdoors, in nature?\" \"Yeah. It'll be fun!\" \"Are you okay?\" \"Never better!\" Bethany assured her. \"Hi Martha!\" \"Hi! Hello! Morning!\" Martha smiled as she bounced through a crowd of students getting off the bus. She was trying to be less shy and more open, and was so far succeeding. The new term was off to a good start for all of them. And, on top of it, they had all become close friends. Their shared experiences in the game had brought them together. They all had history together first period. \"Good morning everyone,\" the cheerful voice of their teacher called out as she entered the classroom. \"My name is Ms. Evynsen and I'll be your new history teacher-\" She wrote her name on the board and then turned to face the class and when she did, the four friends audibly gasped. She looked exactly like Vera. Save for her different clothes and shorter hair. And she spoke with an American accent instead of English, but other than that, the resemblance was unmistakable. \"No way,\" they whispered amongst themselves. At the end of the class they waited until all the other students had left before going over to her. She greeted them with a smile. \"Hi.\" \"Hi. I'm Bethany.\" \"Anthony.\" \"Martha.\" \"Spencer.\" She shook each of their hands. \"Nice to meet you all.\" \"We just wanted to say that we're all really excited for this class,\" Bethany told her. Her friends nodded in agreement. At this, she looked touched. \"Thank you. This is my first time teaching, so I'm a little nervous, but that means a lot. Thank you.\" Dum, dum, dum. Dum, dum, dum. Dum, dum, dum. Everyone froze then when the Jumanji drums suddenly sounded from overhead. Even Ms. Evynsen looked confused. \"Do you guys hear that? It sounds like drums or something.\" She could hear them too? The four exchanged a glance. SMASH! Out back behind the school where the dumpster was, Fridge smashed the game with a bowling ball they had also found in the cluttered basement. With that, the drums finally ceased. As they walked away, leaving it behind, and for good, they didn't see the flicker of green light coming from the now seemingly destroyed console. The game always finds a way... So that's it, we've reached the end! (this is the fastest I've ever completed a story!) I just wanted to say another HUGE thank you to all you guys for reading this story and for going on this adventure with me, I hope you had as much fun as I did! :) So, while writing 'Heart' I was already planning more for these characters - I'm not ready to let them go yet! Sequel? Maybe! Will we meet Vera again? I hope so! (I have a few ideas!) Not sure about what's going to happen with her look-alike in the real world, but it was just something I wanted to include! I've been thinking of ideas for a sequel and perhaps a prequel (we've got to see the brief happiness in Vera and Van Pelt's relationship, right? ;) haha!). But first, I've already begun writing another 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' story, which I am very excited for, so I will be posting that very soon! It's called 'My Jewel' and is completely different from 'Heart'.

So I was su"},{"Movie":"Ghost Ship","Title":"Stay away from my baby","Author":"Angela-Bennet","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2624222","Passage":"[Chapter 1] WARNING THIS FANFICTION IS NOT FOR THE FAINT HEARTED, IF YOU ARE THE TYPE TO PASS OUT FROM SHOCK AT ANYTHING SEXUAL. PLEASE TURN AROUND. BUT IF YOU ARE WILLING TO STEP INTO MY WORLD... WELCOME! Jack approached Epps with the coolest of ease, and in turn, she edged away slightly still clutching the detonator. \"I don't seem to be getting through to you, what I'm asking for is an exchange...this ship...for your life.\" Jack's piercing blue eyes bore into Maureen's. \"I want my crew back.\" She replied coolly. \"Sorry, once the souls have been marked...their mine.\" Maureen glanced over to the side, gathering her thoughts, then she looked up and stared him in the face. \"Then I guess it's over.\" Her finger twitched towards the trigger- \"Wait!\" Jack exclaimed stepping forward, slightly panic stricken, Maureen jerked away. \"Okay, okay...I'll give you your crew back...just fix this piece of shit up!\" \"What, just like that?\" \"Just like that.\" Epps lowered the detonator to her side, a satisfied smile playing on her lips. \"But I think I should mention the catch.\" A sneer slowly formed at the corner of his mouth, as he watched her smile being literally wiped off her face. \"I knew it, I just fucking knew it! what is it?\" Dreading what she was about to hear. Jack smirked, then he stalked over towards her, he placed both of his hands over her broad shoulders, and he brushed his lips over her ear. She shivered at his delicate touch. \"Years from now Maureen, when you've settled down in a nice cosy little house, with a nice husband, you got a nice little family of your own building up...you must let me take your first child.\" He stepped back to observe her features, the smile still remained plastered on his face. Her expression was blank, and then-\"You bastard!...I think I'm doing enough for you already!\" she clenched her fists. \"Is that yes then?\" \"Fuck you! You really think I would hand over my child to a murdering son-of-a-bitch like you, you must be out of your fucking mind!\" \"Well in that case, you're not leaving this ship alive...not to mention you won't see your 'family' for a very long time, maybe even never.\" Jack sighed and started to walk away from her slowly. Maureen suddenly realised she was no longer holding the detonator, she would have blown the place up there and then if she had it. Pure hatred and anger pushed its way up from the pit of her stomach, she gritted her teeth together, lashed out. \"YOU FUCKING SON-OF-A-BITCH!\" She ran at him, wrapping her arms tightly around his neck, and jumping onto his back. He chucked evilly as he swung her across the room, bashing her against the railings on the side of the catwalk. She yelped in agony as he fell back on the stairway, with her pinned between him and cold metal steps, which were digging painfully into her back. \"I'm offering you a great opportunity for a happy life.\" He said pushing his weight down on her. \"Aaaaa...yeah...sure, then you'll come along and ruin my life by taking away an important thing from my life.\" She croaked, feeling extremely claustrophobic. Her arms tightened around his neck. Jack began to cough and splutter. \"You know Epps, if you kill someone y-you go to hell...then again you might want to go there yourself... s-s-since part of your friends are already there.\" He managed to get out through gasps. Maureen still held tight, her eyes in deep concentration. \"You know perfectly well I can't die, Maureen.\" Jack within one swift movement, yanked her arms away, forced them apart and rolled around, so his chest was pressed firmly against hers. She struggled terribly as he brought her arms up above her head and held them there. Maureen kicked and screeched in frustration, as he pinned her. His hypnotic eyes gazing into hers. She stopped struggling and relaxed, even though she was worried about what he was going to do next. He lowered his head, his small lips getting closer and closer, until they gently brushed against hers, then his chin came to rest on her forehead with just his bottom lip grazing her head. The scent that greeted her was a mixture of peppermint, cologne, and salt. Maureen closed her eyes and took it all in. After what seemed like a minute-\"You can't make me agree to your deed, Jack.\" She whispered, slightly disorientated. \"I know, but just think about it.\" He answered gently, running his fingers softly over the smooth skin of her arm. He smiled against her head as he felt the reaction he was getting off her. Goosebumps. Suddenly, without warning he got up, so he was standing over her. He offered her his hand. Maureen glanced nervously at it, 'Surely he wasn't going to suck out her soul there and then.' She thought. Jack realising her hesitation. \"Don't worry, I want you to see something.\" She shakily took his hand, and he helped her up. He put an arm about her back to keep her facing one direction. Jack waved his other hand in front of him, as if searching for an invisible wall. Suddenly five golden orbs materialised out of his palm. Epps was transfixed at the site. The orbs gracefully floated around the room, then came back down and circled Epps' head, then they floated away, and hovered in a group metres in front of them. Jack clicked his fingers, and the orbs suddenly manifested into non-other than- \"Murphy...Santos...Munder...Greer...Dodge!\" Epps exclaimed. Her crew checked the own bodies, amazed at where they were. Then they smiled and ran out to greet Epps. She hugged every member of her crew for one minute, expressing \"I thought I was never going to see you again.\" She said as her eyes began to well up. Murphy held her in a tight embrace. \"I would be proud to call you my daughter.\" Epps smiled with joy as she hugged her 'dad'. She was tapped on the shoulder, she turned around and came face-to-face with Dodge. \"There is something I should of told you the day we were travelling here...and the thing is...I love you Maureen Epp.\" Maureen was over come with emotion, and her heart began to ache as she smiled and released tears of joy. Dodge smiled back, and pulled Epps into a passionate kiss. The rest of the crew smiled pleasantly at there friends, while Munder fake retched, Maureen and Dodge couldn't help but smile against each others lips. After about a minute they broke there kiss, and held each other in an affectionate embrace. She looked over Dodge's shoulder at Jack, who was watching her intently, she noticed no-one else was aware of his presence. He had his arms folded and he looked as smug as ever. \"So...what do you say?\" She glanced over to the side in deep thought. 'It'll be a long time till I have kids, he would have probably forgotten by then?' Her chocolate browns met up with his pale blue eyes, her lip still glistening with Dodge's Sylvia...she nodded. Jack grinned and dematerialised. please r[Chapter 2] The first bit is basically telling how it came too be, and it will get more interesting further in the chapter. 6 months later, after the Antonia Graza... Maureen and Dodge married. A big party was held in their honour, at the very bar the crew met in. And after the massive reception, the blushing bride and the groom were thrown off the pier together. They then swam in a fit of giggles to their boat, which they had bought during their courting months, and they had named it the Arctic Warrior 2. They sailed many hundreds of miles, including to the honeymoon destination on an uninhabited island not far off the coast. After a year of adventurous sea voyages, and various ocean battles on stormy waters. Maureen and Dodge decided to settle down somewhere in the city. So they moved into a nice Victorian style house in Boston. A month after their arrival, Maureen discovered she was 6 weeks pregnant. So she spent most of her time off her feet. Dodge apart from working at the docks and running a market, he would have to rush around doing errands for his wife, mostly to satisfy her midnight cravings, such as; chocolate éclairs, pickled onions, and pop tarts. Maureen wasn't keen on being pregnant, it made her feel week and vulnerable, she felt incapable of doing things, especially when her dad (Murphy) or her husband were about they would always sit her down and tell her 'take it easy' or 'you shouldn't be on your feet, Maureen', when they could just say 'you mires well just sit down, because you can't do anything anyway'. All those years of being a secondary captain to a rough sea vessel were coming to an end. But it was worth it...when she first looked into the emerald eyes of her baby girl. 4 years later... \" Daddy!\" Catrina's eyes lit up as she smiled, she used her little legs to run to her daddy, who enveloped her, lifted her into the air, and put her over his shoulder. \"How's my little girl then?\" He said as he carried her to the car. \"Okay, I guess.\" Catrina replied, her voice dropping. Dodge put his daughter down, and opened the car door. \"You seem a little unsure about that.\" \"Well...I've been thinking lately...and...when are you going to take me out to sea?\" She exclaimed, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear before climbing into the back. Dodge got into the car and closed the door, turning around to Catrina. \"What's brought this up?\" \"Well in class today we were told to write about our favourite holidays, one boy wrote about him and his family camping, and one girl wrote about her journey to France on a Concorde, and everybody else talked about their trip to Disney world.\" She said in a childish perplexed way. \"We've been to Disney world, why not write about that?\" \"Dad...I don't wanna write about where everybody else has been, that would be boring, I want to have an original holiday...why can't we go on yours and mummy's boat?\" \"We will someday, but not anytime soon, your mum and I promised to give it a rest for a while.\" Dodge started the car and pulled out onto the main road. Catrina, feeling defeated, folded her arms and looked out the window. Then after awhile she got out her sketch pad and began drawing things outside. Dodge glanced at his daughter through the rear view mirror. She had grown fast in a short space in time. Her head which once only held a few gingering hairs, was now a full head of wavy brown hair, which reached the base of her back, and had flecks of blonde at the tips. Her eyes had been manufactured from Dodge's blue and Maureen's brown eyes, and had transformed into emerald orbs of colour, which were partly covered by a light fringe. Dodge smiled. They pulled into the drive way of their home. Catrina jumped out, and ran into the house, dragging her school bag behind her. Maureen was ready and waiting by the door. As soon as Catrina had stepped into the doorway she was swept off her feet, and carried to the couch. She squealed as she was tickled by her mum. \"Grrrrrrrr...tickle tickle...grrrrrrr...tickle tickle!\" Dodge came around the back of the sofa and kissed his wife. \"I believe it's somebody's birthday in a couple of days.\" Dodge said leaning on the couch, and side glancing at Maureen, who smiled. Catrina sat up, her eyes glinting. \"Am I having a party!\" \"You might be.\" Maureen and Dodge said in unison. Catrina grinned as her mum and dad strolled into the kitchen. Two days later... Catrina stood blind-folded, clutching a bat in the middle of 10 giggling children, who were all sticking a hand in to spin her around, the group scattered. Catrina ran forward swinging her bat around. She smiled as her bat made contact with card and tissue paper , a-ha she was in swing range. After she had made one hit, sweets began cascading down upon her, her friends cheered as they crawled across the grass towards the many chocolate éclairs, rainbow lollipops, and fruit pastilles scattered across the floor. Catrina removed her blind-fold, and began grabbing all the sweets she could get her hands on. She stood and glanced at her friends. Well only 3 of them were her friends, the rest of them were random class mates who she got on with. Emma her best friend came up behind her as she was day-dreaming. \"Did you like my gift!\" \"Oh yes, it's beautiful.\" Catrina said, raising her arm to look at the thread woven, beaded bracelet. \"Did you make it yourself?\" \"Yes, I spent a week on it.\" Catrina smiled warmly and hugged Emma. Emma then departed to join some boys who were trying to sit on some balloons. Amidst the music and the sound of children playing, Catrina just stood there in her lilac party dress, which was fanning out around her ankles, the sun shining down on her brown hair, and reflecting off her purple ribbon. She scratched her arm feeling overcome with boredom. Catrina decided to get some punch. She walked over to the refreshment table, and reached across for a plastic cup. A big gush of wind blew and ruffled through her hair. She felt the hair on the back of her neck stand on end, she felt an unsettling feeling she was being watched by someone that didn't want to be seen. Catrina looked about her, her mates were rolling across the grass, wrestling over balloons, her dad was fiddling with the barbeque, and her mum was icing her birthday cake. No one was taking much notice of her anyway. She turned back to the punch bowl...her eyes widened, reflected in the red liquid was a man staring at her, he had short mousy hair, thin lips, and intriguing eyes. His lips curled into a smile, and he mouthed something at her, but she couldn't make it out. Catrina leaned towards the punch bowl in curiosity- \"Honey, what are you doing?\" Maureen asked, putting down the tray of cocktail weenies. \"Oh...I was just checking the punch.\" She stood up straight, folding her arms behind her back innocently. Catrina watched her mother walk away, she looked back at the red liquid, the man had disappeared. Two weeks later... It was Autumn, the leaves on the trees had now turned crisp and were floating down to the floor. Maureen stared out the window into the back garden, her face hitched with concern. Catrina sat alone on the bench staring at the ground. Dodge came up to Maureen from behind, and wrapped his arms around her waist. \"What's wrong?\" He said quietly in her ear. \"I don't know, I'm just getting a little worried about Catrina, that's all.\" Maureen placed both her hands on Dodge's. \"In what way?\" \"Well she's been a little quiet lately, she normally has so much to say, but nowadays it's just...like...she's not bothered...or...she's hiding something?\" \"-Or she could be maturing?\" \"She's five, Dodge!\" Dodge thought for a moment \"Maybe she's being bullied at school.\" \"No she's not, I've asked her, and I've had the school closely monitoring her.\" \"And what did the school find out?\" Dodge questioned. \"They said she was normally off in a world of her own, sometimes they found her talking to herself.\" \"You don't think she'll need to visit a shrink do you?\" Dodge asked starting to look concerned. \"No...no, I just think we should keep a close eye on her.\" Maureen , made her way to the back door, and opened it. \"Catrina, it's getting cold now...don't you wanna come inside?\" Catrina slid off the bench, and trotted inside. She took off her coat, and then slumped onto a chair at the table. Maureen for a moment couldn't blink, her daughter's resemblance to the meek little girl on the ship was almost uncanny. \"Say Catrina, why do you watch 'snow white and the seven dwarfs' ?\" Dodge inquired. \"I just want to go to my room.\" She said quietly. Then she slowly got up and made her way to the stairs. Maureen and Dodge watched her go. \"Maybe I should go and check on her?\" She said, and quickly followed. When she got to her daughter's bedroom door which was covered in flowers, she heard her daughter's mumbling from the other side. She pushed open the door. The room was terribly dark, and she was surprised to be greeted with an intense cold air. \"Jeeze Catrina, it's freezing in here.\" She rounded the door to see Catrina standing in the corner of the room, with a nervous look on her face. \"What's wrong?\" Maureen asked concerned. Catrina slowly approached her mum. \"He must have followed me in the house? He won't leave me alone!\" Maureen was both puzzled, and on edge with what her daughter had just said. She lowered herself to her child's eye level, and held her at the shoulders. \"Who Catrina...who!\" Her voice getting panicky. Catrina stepped away, and rummaged through her bedside table draw, and she pulled out a folded up piece of paper. Catrina gave it to her mum. Maureen looked at the paper, and hesitated before she opened it. She then unfolded it, half by half, until she came to the last fold, she flipped the paper over and stared wide eyed at the page. ...There looking up at her was a sketch of Jack Ferriman. Her whole world turned upside down in anger, panic and absolute fear, she could do nothing more than grab her daughters hand and drag her out of that room. She ran down the corridor and into her and Dodge's room. \"Mummy, who is that man?\" Catrina whispered, with a hint of fear. \"Nobody honey.\" Maureen whispered, placing a hand on her own head, trying to pace herself, and trying to think. \"How come you're so scared?\" Her daughter questioned. Her mother looked down at her, thinking of the right thing to say. \"Well, he is an old friend who turned into a bit of a nasty friend.\" \"Can he hurt any of us?\" Catrina said, in a squeaky voice. Maureen looked at her and guided her to the wooden chest at the foot of her bed. \"No sweetie... he can't, at least not when I'm around.\" She tucked a strand of her daughters hair behind her ear. Catrina's eyes darted to the side, and she stiffened- \"MUMMY HE'S HERE!\" -Maureen whirled around, she came face to face with Jack, the smell of peppermint, cologne and salt came rushing back to her, and she felt like she was being dragged back to the catwalk. She pulled her daughter behind her protectively. \"Now you stay away from her! Do you hear me...STAY AWAY FROM HER!\" Jack stood there with a serious look upon his face, he hadn't aged since the last time she had met him. He was still 24. His pale blue eyes still contained their unearthy brightness and sharpness. Jack smiled, showing his pearly whites. \"Come come Maureen, we had a deal...you wouldn't want you friends and family to suddenly disappear would you?\" His voice was deep and calm. \"I won't let you take her...I would kill you before you do!\" Her hands remained wrapped tightly around her daughters small wrist behind her back. Catrina peered around the side of her mum, with a questioning look on her fearful face. Jacks eyes met Catrina's, she saw a great flash, followed by a few vivid flickery images. She saw the Artic Warrior sailing through a rough sea -'flash'- Her mum, dad, granddad, and a few of their friends she knew, walking down a dark corridor -'flash'- Her mum and the scary man talking at the front of a boat -'flash'- Her mum and the scary man tackling each other to the ground -'flash'- Her mum hugging her dad, and nodding to the scary man. The room came back into focus, Catrina placed a hand on her head as a head ache raked through her skull. \"Mummy...what is he trying to show me!\" She yelled in pain, rubbing her head. Maureen dropped to her knees and held her daughter's head. \"JACK...WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO HER?...LEAVE HER ALONE!\" \"I'm showing her something you should of told her...about the bargain... and she belongs to me!\" Jack exclaimed, he then made a grab for her. Maureen jumped up and darted away bringing her child with her. Suddenly she heard someone running up the stairs, 'maybe there is still hope?' She thought, as she gripped Catrina tightly. Dodge came bursting into the room. \"What the hell is going-\" he caught sight of Jack, and before he could do anything - Jack quickly raised his open hand, and an incredible force hit Dodge squarely in the chest, and it threw him through the bedroom door and down the stairs. Catrina screamed. \"Daddy!\" She was about to run past Jack, and run down the stairs after him, but her mum remained clutching her, tighter than ever. \"This isn't over...that was just a warning...I will come back in years time and claim her, and I won't tell you when...it'll be a big surprise.\" Jack dematerialised with a sneer on his face. Maureen never felt so scared in her entire life, she squeezed her daughter, as they both began to sob. The smell of Jack had now gone, and a pleasant warmth returned to the room. The sun blared across them from the window. Maureen pulled away looking into her daughters face, her eyes were puffy and her nose was bleeding. \"Come on, let's get you cleaned up.\" She guided Catrina out of the room, the door had been blown off it's hinges and lay on the floor. They peered from the top of the stairs at Dodge who was slowly getting up at the foot. \"Aaa...will someone please explain what the hell just happened?\" He groaned as rubbed his back.[Chapter 3] WARNING SEXUAL CONTENTS...IT'LL GET WORSE! Don't worry I'll do this epilogue style of text a lot less. It just to make sure you understand what has happened. After that terrific night, Maureen and Dodge kept a close eye on their daughter. Catrina became very clingy to them, as they were to her. For a few years she would sleep in her mum and dads room. She was collected from school 10 minutes earlier, so she wouldn't mingle in a crowd and be lost. After 5 years they decided to give her a little freedom. She was back in her own room again, she walked to school and back with her friends. And she could run around in the garden and sketch, without her dad closely monitoring her. Years went by...Catrina spent her childhood like any other kid her age. The memories of the frightening evening had passed, they turned into just faint memories, which then turned to forgotten nightmares. 7 years later... \"It wasn't like casual sex...actually it was kind of rough, but is a one night stand, casual sex?\" Emma said, while gesturing her hands. \"I don't want to know, Em !\" Catrina rolled her eyes, the look of disgust edging on her face. \"Well I wanna know, I want to see where I stand with this guy?\" Emma took a sip from her strawberry milkshake. \"Guys, can you stop talking about me, right in front of me...and 'this guy' has a name!\" Emma leaned sideways, and rested her head on his shoulder. \"I'm sorry baby...but I needed a second opinion.\" She kissed him on the neck affectionately, then she sat up, still rubbing his thigh. \"So when are you gonna be ready to get laid?\" Emma asked, smiling cheekily at Catrina. Catrina stared at Emma shocked with her mouth open. \"Soon as you stop making it sound like an offer!\" \"Oh come on, you've been dating this new guy...err Robert, for like 5 weeks, and you haven't even brought the come on yet?\" \"Excuse me?\" Catrina said, furrowing her brow. \"I don't believe I'm having this conversation with you pervs.\" She got up from her chair, dragging her sketch pad with her, and she walked around behind her friends to leave. Emma and her boyfriend smiled cheekily at her. \"Oh yeah... I almost forgot, are you coming to Stacey's house party tonight?\" Emma leaned her head back to see Catrina opening the cafe door. \"Errr no... I got to go to one of those job interview thingys.\" She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. \"My mum thinks it's best to have a job ready when I start college.\" Catrina exited the cafe, breathing in the fresh air around her. She broke into a jog down the main street, as she approached the park she slowed down to a speedy walk. She looked about her, couples were sun bathing on the grass, young teens skate-boarding around the bandstand, and a mixture of hippies and hobos we playing guitars and singing under trees. Suddenly a great gush of wind blew about her, leaves went flying, strands of her hair spiralled around her face, her tight jumper even rippled against her cold skin, then her sketch pad flew out of her hand. Catrina ran after it, when she caught up with it, it had landed near the foot of a park bench. As she bent down to reach it, she sensed someone sitting on the bench, watching her. She quickly looked up, she caught a glimpse of what looked like the corner of a navy blue overcoat disappearing around a tall hedge. Catrina jumped up and rushed to the hedge, to peer around the corner, no one was there. She shook off the feeling, and proceeded out of the park. Catrina steadily jogged back home clutching her pad tightly to her chest, her hair flowing behind her. She reached her house and scrambled inside, slamming the door behind her. \"Honey, your back already...I thought you would be out with Robert or your friends for another 40 minutes?\" Maureen's head poked around the kitchen door. \"Well I had to get away, I got a whole lot of studying to do...err...bye!\" Catrina rushed upstairs without another word. She went into her bedroom and locked the door. She then jumped onto her bed, and began skimming through the pages of her pad. Every page was covered in detailed drawings of ships, each and every one unique and unknown to her. Then as she reached the last two pages she found that they were covered in different sketches of a little girl dressed in a fine party dress, which she didn't remember drawing. Catrina glanced at her watch 4:00pm, she had another 65 minutes before her interview. She jumped up and began to change her clothes. She slipped into a black skirt and tights (pantyhose), with matching high heeled boots, and then she put on a dark green V necked top. Catrina pulled her blondie brown hair into a high pony-tail, and then she applied some lip-gloss. She walked downstairs, flicking through her drawings, then she entered the kitchen. Her mum looked up from her magazine at her and smiled pleasantly. \"You look nice.\" \"Thanks.\" Catrina sat on a stool next to the countertop. Maureen turned her back to her daughter to wash the pots. \"Err...mum, what's the Antonio Graza.\" There was a great clatter of pots, Maureen stiffened. \"Why do you ask?\" \"Err...I'm just curious that's all?\" \"I know, but you wouldn't have mentioned it...if you hadn't had some source of information.\" Maureen's voice began to get edgy. Catrina said nothing and slid her open pad across the counter, her mum dried her hands on a flannel and silently looked through her pad. Maureen turned every page to be greeted by another memory, she never blinked once. \"Did you draw all of these?\" \"Yeah.\" \"But how, you couldn't have seen these ships by sight.\" \"I see them in my dreams...but I don't understand, why won't I see them by sight...are they in a different country or are they out at sea?\" \"No...their over 1000ft below sea level to be precise.\" Maureen folded her arms. \"And they sunk before you were born.\" Catrina stared wide eyed at her drawings. \"But who's the girl?\" Catrina stretched across the table and flipped over a few pages. Maureen jumped back from the counter. \"Have you seen this girl in your dreams?\" She looked horror struck. \"Mum, who is that girl...do you know her?\" Maureen pulled herself together \"Her name is Katie Harwood, she was a passenger on the Antonio Graza...and that is her resting place.\" \"Did she drown?\" Catrina asked, slightly spooked. Maureen looked wearily at her daughter unsure if she should tell her everything. \"No...she was murdered, by a couple of crew members, she was one of the many others that were murdered on that ship.\" Catrina stood horrified. \"Murdered...but why!\" \"Greed Catrina, Greed...you see, there were crates of gold on the ship, who ever got their hands on that would have become millionaires...maybe even billionaires.\" \"But why kill all of the passengers...why not leave the ship, and take the gold with them.\" \"Because they needed the ship to transport the gold...and the passengers would have got in the way.\" \"The gold...did it belong to all the passengers?\" Catrina questioned. Maureen turned her back. \"No...it belonged to a man that was onboard at the time.\" Her voice became quiet. \"Who was he...was he a passenger...did he die with the others?\" Catrina continued. \"Your asking too many questions.\" Her mother walked out of the kitchen into the living room. Catrina stood there awhile letting everything catch up with her, then she followed her mum. \"Is any of this to do with the bogeyman?\" Maureen turned around puzzled. \"The bogeyman?\" \"Yes...the man that came after us when I was little.\" Catrina watched her mum stare her in the face with fear. \"How did you remember that?\" Maureen approached her daughter. \"I have faint memories of it, or you could say nightmares.\" Her mother looked at sympathetically. \"Mum...what he said...he won't come after me will he?\" \"No... it's been 12 years now...he's probaby forgotten by now...why'd you ask...you haven't seen him have you!\" Maureen approached to look into Catrina's green eyes. \"No I haven't, I just want to know what he meant by me being his?\" \"My my, you remember a lot,...oh it meant nothing, he's just a very possessive person that's all.\" She replied, getting slightly agitated. \"So you knew him then-\" \"No no...I didn't.\" \"You must of, he mentioned you by name...and...and you called him...Jack!\" Catrina exclaimed, she pulled away. \"How come I'm getting the feeling your not telling me everything!\" \"Because I'm telling you stuff that is safe for you to know!\" \"And just what is that supposed to mean!\" Catrina yelled. \"I know you think I'm a little girl...but I'm not anymore, and I know a little more than you think I know!\" \"Like what!\" \"Well...in my dreams I've seen you, dad, and Granddad going on a ship which looks very similar to the Antonio Graza, I've seen you wrestling with Jack the bogeyman, then I've seen you nodding in agreement totally calm...even though Jack was in the room!\" Suddenly the clock chimed. They both stopped and looked at the clock. \"I'm gonna be late...bye!\" Catrina broke the silence and ran for the door, grabbing her handbag on the way. She rushed out of the door. Her heels clicked heavily on the tarmac as she jogged down the street. She hated moving fast in heels. The chilling wind which made contact with her exposed skin, made her teeth chatter. She turned into the main street, Catrina began to pick up the pace, her bobble flew out of her hair and landed on the pavement, she didn't bother to go back for it. She ran by loads of people, who were all curious to where she was running to. She glanced at her watch 5:05, the time her interview was dure to start. Her legs seized up as they protested for a rest, her chest heaved painfully, she tasted copper in her mouth. Catrina ran up the steps of the 'Gap' store, she wrapped her ice cold fingers around the steel handle of the door, and pulled. The door remained shut- \"Shit!\" She kicked the door in frustration. She tried the door again, and without suceeding she banged her palms against the doors. \"Oh come on...I was only like a minute late.\" She placed her foot on one door, and pulled with all her might on the other door. Then she decided to bash the door with her side, but as she did, she caught her head on the glass, and she mouthed a wide 'ow' as she rubbed her bruise. Catrina gave up and turned to leave, noticing passer byers had stopped to watch her trying to get in, in amusement. She blushed as she started to walk the long way home. \"I could have gone to Stacey's party...but nooo, I went to a stupid job interview, which is now cancelled.\" She muttered to herself as she swung her handbag to and thro. \"Now I have to go home and face my mum and dad, and tell them I didn't get the job because I was late...then I have to tell them to turn on the TV, 'because I might be featured on a cops programme...subject tempting to break and enter.' She kicked a can. After about 5 minutes of walking, she thought about the Antonio Graza. 'If the crew had killed all the passengers, and they still had the gold, and they were preparing to sail away into the sunset, why the hell did it sink?' As she was thinking, she hadn't noticed the wind had increased in force around her. 'Did it hit an iceberg or something...err wait...then how come my mum and dad on it?...wowe I'm getting way over my head here!' She thought. Suddenly she sensed someone was walking behind her, she picked up her pace, bringing her handbag to her shoulder. The person behind her had increased their speed as well, she panicked slightly and began to jog, she prayed she wouldn't trip and brake her neck on her heels. The sound pattern her shoes were making, matched her followers'. Catrina found herself braking into a run, fear caused her lungs to seize up, as she tore along the pavement. She saw her house in the distance. She darted across the road and scrambled into her house, slamming the door shut behind her, her frame shook with terror. \"Hello?...I'm back!\" Catrina partly yelled, she slipped off her shoes. As she calmed down, she realised how cold it was in the house, and it chilled her to the bone. She would normally find her mum and dad watching TV in the living room, but all the lights were out and TV wasn't even on, so it was deadly quiet. \"Mum...Dad!\" There was no response. She hated the idea of being alone in a dark house. If it was her birthday, then she would have been thrilled, because the lights could suddenly switch on, and all her friends and family could jump out from under the table and behind the curtains yelling 'SURPRISE!' But her birthday was a week away, she knew that wouldn't happen. She smelt a very familiar scent, but she couldn't place it. She noticed a small note on the table, she picked it up -suddenly there was a clatter from the kitchen, Catrina jumped around, her heart drummed hard in her ribs. She saw that a light was on. \"Who's there!\" \"It's only me honey!\" Catrina heard her mum say. She rounded the corner, to find her mother washing the pots, she felt slightly relieved, but kind of unnerved. \"Err mum...why are you washing the pots, again?\" \"Erm...I thought they could do with another clean.\" Catrina nodded and mouthed an 'O', while rocking on the balls of her feet. She was startled by her mum turning around open armed. \"Oh honey!\" Catrina jumped backwards. \"Aren't you mad?\" Maureen stood for a moment and thought. \"Why should I be mad? I'm just glad your home.\" She made to hug her again. \"Where's dad?\" She said, as she took a step back. \"Oh...he's gone out to get a pizza.\" Maureen replied hesitantly. \"Oh, okay then...bye!\" Catrina quickly backed out the kitchen and headed for the stairs. She brought the note closer to her eyes, it said; Gone to get Chinese, back in a jiff ! Mum xx Catrina's eyes widened, and before she could take action, she felt a pair of strong arms cross over her arms, and pull tightly around her waist. She kicked and screamed as her feet left the floor. A hand came up to her mouth, to silence her, but it only muffled her cries slightly. Then she saw something she only thought she would see in sci-fi films, her attacker's hand began to glow a yellowy colour, and she was greeted by the smell of chloroform, her eyelids grew heavy, and her breathing became slow as she drifted into the darkness, and was rendered unconscious. Jack held Catrina's limp form in his arms, he placed one arm behind her back and his other behind her knees, and then he lifted, he was surprised at how light she was. Just as he dematerialised he muttered under his breath \"Gotcha!'\"[Chapter 4] WARNING PEOPLE...SEXUAL CONTENT well maybe not quite. Maureen walked up the driveway towards her house, carrying the Chinese. She placed a hand on the door handle, preparing to put the key in, but the door flew open. Still baffled by the door being unlocked, she stepped inside. A nasty breeze blew through the lifeless house. Maureen tripped slightly on something, she looked at the floor and noticed a pair of black boots which were disarray. 'Ah... Catrina must be back, I wonder if she's got the job?' she thought as closed the door behind her, and kicked the boots under the table. She walked across the hall towards the kitchen, switching on all the lights as she passed, wondering why the lights weren't on in the first place. \"Dodge, Catrina?...I got the Chinese!\" She yelled towards the ceiling. She placed the bag on the counter and removed her coat. She peered into the living room, nobody there. She walked to the bottom of the stairs. \"Hello...is there anybody there!\" She began to trot upstairs. \"Dodge?...I know you're here, you were here before I left!\" Maureen searched every room, no one was in the house. Catrina's room looked the same as when she left it before the interview, Maureen even checked her wardrobe. \"This isn't funny anymore you guys!\" She trudged downstairs, and she made her way to the kitchen, but something caught her eye on the way. Something dark was seeping out from under the closet door, under the stairs. She reached out for the doorknob cautiously, dreading her worse fears. Maureen quickly pulled it open - Dodge lifeless form slumped out of the cupboard, and dropped near her feet - She swallowed her scream as she dropped to her knees, and placed his gashed bloody head on her lap. Tears welled up in her eyes. \"Wake-up baby.\" She pushed his dirty blonde hair back to look into his face. \"Oh baby please wake-up.\" She checked his pulse, it was very week, he had lost a lot of blood. \"I don't want to lose you again.\" Suddenly a groan escaped his lips, and his eyes began to flutter open. \"You won't lose me again.\" He breathed. \"Thank god.\" Maureen said, wiping away her tears. He tried to get up, but his wife pushed him back down again. \"Save your energy honey...now, who did this to you?\" Dodge placed both hands over his face, and he rubbed at his eyes, then a look of realisation passed across his pasty face, and he jumped up in panic. \"Oh god, Jack was here!\" Maureen looked horror struck as well as Dodge, and they both yelled in unison \"Catrina!\" They both took off around the house, searching. Dodge checked the garden, then he went around to ask the neighbours, while Maureen called all of Catrina's friends, to see if she had gone to stay over. She sunk to the carpet as she considered the big possibility that Jack had taken her, Dodge came through the front door to see his wife kneeling on the carpet, sobbing, next to the phone. He sat down next to her, and pulled her into a hug. \"Don't worry we'll get her back,...and then it's payback time for Jack!\" Catrina didn't know where she was, she couldn't see anything, the world was pitch black to her. All she heard was faint echoic voices, which she could only make out slightly. She made an attempt to open her eyes, but her lids were still too heavy for her, she tried to scream, but her voice box felt like it had shrivelled up into nothing, she tried to move her body, but every inch of her was numb and paralysed. After awhile she gained feeling back in her fingers, and they curled around ripples of silk sheeting. She knew she was on some kind of a luxury bed. Catrina was suddenly hit by a great amount of fear and nausea, she hated the idea of being on a strangers bed, especially if she had no means of defending herself. Her ears then began to tune in better to the voices around her, and she was able to put together sentences. \"What does he want with her anyway?\" One person's voice said quietly. \"Who knows?...A servant, an extra soul, or maybe even a sex slave!...\" Catrina swallowed, while listening intently. \"Well I've heard he only took her because of some deal he made with a woman many years ago.\" Another voice whispered. \"Where on earth did you hear that!\" \"Francesca told me yesterday.\" \"Oh...one of Jack's sex slaves told you a?\" A voice said, with a hint of amusement. \"Hey!...She had sex with him once, and that was before she died.\" \"Speaking of sex...who wants to go first at touching this girl's bosom?\" A cocky man asked. Catrina on the inside, shook with fear. \"You Roy, are you game?\" There was silence for a few seconds. \"Or you Daniel?\" Catrina guessed he must of shook his head. \"Go on...I dare ya.\" \"No!...I can't, he told us no one's allowed to lay a finger on her.\" Another replied in a harsh whisper. \"Well he's not gonna know is he? Just go over there and touch it!\" \"No, I ain't that perverted.\" \"This is her breast we're talking about, not what's under her skirt,...then again I wouldn't mind!\" Catrina would have stared wide eyed at this comment, but she couldn't. \"You sicko!\" \"Well if you're not going to do anything, I will.\" The next thing Catrina heard was the sound of someone getting up from a chair, and traipsing across the floor, she felt terribly indecent and desperately tried to move. \"-No, don't do it, he could appear any minute!\" The man half yelled and half whispered. She felt the hem of her skirt being tugged up, tears were forming in the corner of her eyes. And then- \"And just what do you think your doing!\" A slightly angered silky voice said from the corner of the room. \"Get out!...I'll deal with you later.\" She had heard that voice before. Catrina thanked the heavens in her head. She heard foot steps approach her, then she felt two hands brush her waist as the person adjusted her skirt. Then a hot breath fanned across her face, and she was greeted with the smell of peppermint. This gesture caused her fingers to twitch slightly, the person jumped back. \"Oh you're awake?\" Rapidly, her whole body came back to life, as if he had said the magic words. She opened her eyes to come face -to -face with Jack. Her eyes widened with fear, and she tried to jump as far away as she could, but her attempt was effortless. She found that each of her limbs had been handcuffed to a bedpost. Jack smiled in amusement at her struggling. \"GET AWAY FROM ME YOU BASTARD!\" She shrieked as the silk sheets began to fold into a heap at the foot of the bed. \"Well you're a charming little thing aren't you?\" He reached out to caress her cheek, she bit out at him, and he jerked away, then started to laugh. His laughter showed no sign of fear or anger, just some kind of a sick twisted happiness, her aggression faded slightly. \"That's a nice way of treating your saviour.\" Jack folded his arms, and stood superiorly over her. \"If you hadn't have captured me in the first place, I wouldn't have been in that mess.\" She spat. \"I needed to capture you Catrina...because I have a deal to uphold, and I'm not the sort of person to make a deal, and totally forget about the other end of it.\" Catrina caught on a pattern. \"What deal is this?...those men in the room with me, they mentioned a woman you made a deal with years ago.\" Jack innocently tilted his head to the side. \"Did they really?\" He pursed his thin lips, with a dangerous look in his eye. \"That Francesca is gonna get it right in the neck.\" He then sniggered at his own comment. \"Any way...about the deal?\" Catrina asked curiously, Jack's gaze came back to her, and she again filled up with dread. Jack sat down next to Catrina on the bed. \"I'm guessing your mother never told you fully about her past experiences, has she?\" \"Not really no...but what's that got to do with the deal?\" Beginning to get impatient. \"Well...I suppose I could tell you everything.\" Jack ran a finger along her leg, the hairs on the back of her neck stood on end. \"But first I want to get a bit more comfortable.\" Jack brought his legs onto the bed, and lay his head down on the pillow next to her. She shuffled away almost immediately. \"Keep your distance Jack!\" She warned. He smirked and placed his hands behind his head. \"Right so we're both comfy.\" \"I'd be more comfy if I was 100 miles away from you, with a high brick wall in between.\" She side glanced at Jack, and it chilled her to see him silently chuckling. \"Would it satisfy you if I undid your hand cuffs?\" \"Yes.\" Catrina replied through gritted teeth. He reached in his pocket, and leaned across her. She was instantly captivated with his slender jaw line, her eyes wondered down his pale neck, and she suddenly stopped herself from looking down his shirt at his chest. Jack pulled back, tossing the cuffs to the floor. Catrina rubbed her wrists, her eyes darted around the room noting all the exits, planning her escape. She sat up, and moved to the very edge of the bed out of Jack's reach. \"Your mum and Dad were salvagers as you probably know, I approached them one day telling them about a ship which was supposed to have gold on it -\" \"Wait are you talking about the Antonia Graza?\" \"Err...yes.\" Jack replied. \"You know about it then?\" \"Yeah...a guy brought gold on board...the crew saw the gold...they formed a plan...they killed all the passengers...then I'm guessing the crew sailed the ship for awhile, hit an ice-berg and sank.\" Catrina finished. \"I am right.\" Jack scratched his head. \"So that's what your mum told you?\" \"Yep...pretty much.\" Jack's face concealed a hidden smile, and Catrina cringed slightly. \"Well...some of those facts are correct...the rest is... how do you say?...Bullshit.\" Catrina's heart sunk. 'She lied to me!' She thought. \"Well the thing is.\" Jack leaned in close to Catrina so their noses were almost touching. \"We're sitting on the Antonia Graza.\" He then observed her reaction, waiting for the side effects to transpire. \"You're...you're...you're lying to me!\" Catrina's eyes widened, as she jumped back. She couldn't believe it, she wouldn't believe it . She looked about her and ran to the curtains, and pulled them back to find a rusty porthole, outside the entire landscape was covered in water and she saw nothing in the horizon, just blue sky. Catrina had to be sure she wasn't where she thought. She turned around to see Jack standing in front of the doorway with a serious look upon his face. Catrina knew that he knew she was going to bolt out of the door. She dodged from to side to pass him, but he managed to dodge with her. His lips curled into a slight lopsided smile. Jack then moved forward with his hands up, ready to strike, she backed up and found herself cornered. He was getting closer now, her fingers were twitching with fright, she tried to avoid contact with his eyes, as his shadow passed over her. Then in one motion she dropped on all fours like a cat and slunk between his legs and bolted out the door. \"Shit!\" Jack exclaimed. Then he followed. Catrina took off down the corridor, not quite believing such a cliche move had worked. She noticed the rest of the ship was rusted and rotten, apart from the room she just ran from. She turned into another corridor, and ran through some double doors, which fell off their hitches as soon as she touched them. Catrina had reached what looked like a reception area, just as she was approached the desk, she skid across the floor on some water, and slammed into a giant fish tank. Her head collided with the glass, then she slid to the floor, she groaned as she got up. \"I'll murder the son -of -a -bitch who invented glass.\" Slightly dazed and panicked, she dragged herself up and she continued running, panting heavily as she did. She slowed down as she noticed someone dusting off their hat in the corner of the room. Catrina ran across toward them. \"Excuse me...can you please help me...there's a man after me!\" The man just stood the staring at her blankly, then he put on his hat. \"If he's after you, you can't be helped.\" He then passed through a wall on his right side. Catrina backed up shaking her head \"No...no...no..\" She hit something solid, she spun around meeting Jack's hypnotic gaze, she screamed in surprise as he enveloped her around the waist. \"Don't fight it Catrina, accept it.\" Her breathing was fast and it came out as tiny whimpers. \"Gotta...gotta get out...away...now.\" She sighed in panic, as she fought against him, with no prevail. She then raised her foot, and brought her heel down hard on Jack's foot, he yelped and released her, she took the chance and ran onto the outside decking. Jack couldn't help but grin devilishly, on the inside he was positively enjoying himself, he liked the fear he saw in her eyes, which was sometimes corrupted by her spirited determination to try and show how strong she was. He walked slowly outside, he saw her pacing with worry, her wavy brown hair blowing in the wind. \"Look around you Cat, a hundred miles of sea on every side, not another boat in site, plan your escape!\" Catrina closed her eyes as she turned around to face his handsome humoured face, which had a trance of danger in it, she tried hard to bring her cool to the surface, she looked out at the sea again. Jack continued. \"And you know what?...I was the guy that brought the gold on the ship!\" Catrina spun around and looked at him shocked. \"The crew didn't kill all the passengers...I did the rest...and I was the one who killed the crew afterwards!\" Catrina took a step back, her face riddled with fear. The wind constantly blew cold and wildly around them. \"And you know what else Catrina?...That deal which involved you... I made it with your mum!\" Jack smiled with triumph, then his face dropped slightly as he filled up with regret as he looked at her face. Her fearful face was gone, and it was now blank, but he could just make out the corners of her green eyes were welling up with tears. The next thing he knew she ran past, with the back of her hand at her mouth. Just a few minutes earlier at Boston... Dodge sat there with his wife at the counter, their faces reddened by stale tears, sick with worry. Dodge was baffled, he didn't know where to look for his child. Maureen was rocking like a mad woman on the stool, rubbing her hands together. Then she stood up and walked up stairs, she reached her daughter's room and pushed open the door, with a false hope that Catrina would be curled up sleeping in her bed- but she wasn't, the room was empty, dark, and cold. Maureen sat on the edge of the bed, she reached for one of her daughter's teddies which was propped up against the pillow, and she sat rubbing it's belly with her thump. She prayed her daughter was still alive, and not suffering. Suddenly she felt a great amount of guilt hit her in the chest, then she almost heard her daughters cry of distress, she had an eerie feeling of being betrayed, and from that moment she knew her daughter knew about the deal. \"I'm sorry baby!\" She sobbed, as she fell sideways onto the bed.[Chapter 5] Maureen lay on her daughters bed all night, her red eyes were wide open in disbelief. She heard her husband pacing downstairs, his feet padded on the rough carpet. Maureen's eyes wondered about the room, everything was where it should be...except for the drawing pad which was missing, she looked about the room seeing no sign of it. She thought 'Maybe she took it with her when she was...' Maureen was overcome with sadness, her lip quivered as she put her palms to her eyes. She thought about if her daughter was opening her eyes from a nice slumber, or from a night of terror. Antonio Graza... Catrina's eyes darted open, and her emerald orbs came into focus. The sunlight shone through the porthole and bleared across her pale skin, she shuffled her legs slightly under the silk covers. Her hands which were curled up and bent on either side of her head, twitched slightly as she adjusted to the warmth of the room. She suddenly remembered where she was and groaned irritably. Her surroundings were different from last night, she remembered after she fled from Jack, crying her eyes up, she ran to the very damp bottom of the ship, and locked herself in the mail room, where she fell asleep in a pile of unread letters. She guessed someone must of carried her up. Catrina shivered as she imagined either Jack or one of those perverted men...man handling her while she was asleep. 'I have to get off this ship.' She thought, she then yawned and turned a little, nuzzling her head into the soft pillow, her eyes drifted close. Catrina then briskly sat up, and looked about the room. 'Empty'. She swung her legs over the side of the bed and pulled herself up, and rushed over to the door. Catrina poked her head out the door, and looked down the deserted corridor. This was her chance, she didn't have much of an escape plan, but if she could just quietly make her way up to the decking, she could make a raft out of bits and pieces, or start a fire, to make smoke signals. Catrina made her way into the corridor, and she closed the door, with her back firmly pressed against the wall, her hair flipped into her face as she moved her head side to side to look along the corridor. \"Come on Jack where are you?\" She whispered, beginning to slide across the wall down the corridor. She stood still...silence. 'Why would Jack leave me unsupervised?' She broke into a steady run, every corner she came to, she would peer around and prepare to run in the opposite direction, but she never did run in the other direction, the halls were empty. Her tights kept threading, so she stopped and tore them off, her legs were now bare, apart from her knee length skirt. She looked up suddenly when she heard voices bouncing off the walls ahead of her, a group of ghostly figures deep in conversation turned into the hall she was in, she stood transfixed. They abruptly stopped when they saw Catrina standing there looking at them curiously. They hastily walked around her, Catrina kept her eye on them. One of them mumbled to the other. \"Is that who I think it is?\" \"-Yeah...Jack's new pet...and such a pretty little thing she is.\" \"Hm yeah...Poor girl, doesn't have a clue.\" She stood there dumbfounded as they disappeared around a corner. Catrina continued down the corridor. 'Oh god not more ghosts...am I turning into a freaking spiritual medium?' She thought as she headed through a door less, doorway into the reception hall. The sun shone brightly through every glassless window. Her eyes travelled over to the lounge area, where a group of middle aged women sat fussing over a heap of red fabric on the coffee table. She cautiously made her way over, and stopped a few metres away. She noticed they all were wearing dated clothes, she didn't know what time period. A frumpy looking woman looked at her over her glasses, and coughed to get the others to look up. They all turned and stared wide-eyed at her. \"Err...hi!\" Catrina said, she tucked a strand of her hair behind her ear. \"My dear, are you allowed out of your room?\" The frumpy woman asked, lowering her glasses so they were hanging on a chain around her neck. \"No I don't think so...but I'm already out now so I mires well stay out.\" She replied, sitting on a scruffy couch next to them. \"Do you think that's very wise?\" \"I do actually.\" The women looked at her wearily. Catrina looked off to the side shyly, she scratched her arm. \"Erm...where's Jack exactly?\" They looked at her as if she had said a swear word. A woman in a flowered suit broke the silence. \"He's out patrolling dear.\" Catrina relaxed slightly and slumped back into the chair. \"Is he patrolling around the boat?\" \"Err...no, he's in land.\" \"-You mean he's got a boat which brings him there and back!\" Catrina jumped up hopefully. The middle aged women looked astounded at her. \"Honey, do you know what Jack is?\" A lady in a green summer dress questioned. Catrina's happy face dissolved into a puzzled one. \"I know he's a murdering little-\" Catrina watched the ladies suddenly disappear in front of her. She swallowed and turned around expecting to see Jack looking down at her, but it wasn't, instead she saw I woman in a red evening dress, holding a cigarette walking towards her. \"Are you Catreena, si?\" She spoke with an Italian accent. \"Erm...yes?\" Catrina answered, feeling a little cold. \"Come with me.\" The woman in red turned and swayed her hips as she walked away. \"Are you coming all nota?\" She paused. \"Are you another ghost?\" \"It all depends on if you'll run away screaming if I say so?\" She took a drag from her cigarette and pouted her lips, as she held her slinky posture in the doorway. \"How can I trust you?...You don't exactly have much of a hallow above you head.\" \"-Look kid, all I'm here to do is keep yous away from the ozers and stop you doing something stupido.\" The woman unexpectedly disappeared and reappeared behind Catrina. \"So that means go back to your room.\" Catrina jumped and twizzled round. \"And if I don't.\" \"Jack won't be happy.\" Catrina folded her arms \"Why should I care, he's not here... is he?\" \"No...but he will be soon, and I will be in a lot of trouble if your not in your room.\" The woman began nudging her towards the doorway, a cold draft blew up Catrina's back. Catrina stood her ground, and spun around to face her. \"Why are you helping him, you don't have to take orders from him, he won't hurt you...your already dead, and-and another thing how can he get there and back that quickly, he has no boat or helicopter, does he!\" The woman had a dangerous look about her as she smiled. \"You know too little...you don't know what he's capable of do you...I'm guessing Jack hasn't told you much about himself.\" The woman walked around to the front of her, and puffed smoke in her face, Catrina recoiled, wafting it away. \"He can hurt ghosts now can he?\" \"He torments our very souls...so we have to follow him.\" Catrina cocked her eyebrows. \"What!\" Then she backed away. \"Who's we...all the ghosts on this ship? How can he keep you here?...Does he need to be brought to justice or something, before you can rest in peace!\" The Lady in red opened her mouth to say something, but closed it again, she stiffened and looked about her. Catrina watched nervously. The woman turned around. \"He's coming.\" She vanished. Catrina hurried outside, hoping to catch a glimpse of her escape transport. Nothing came. She suddenly felt the need to find a weapon and a decent hiding place. She glanced at the debris scatted near her feet, and she reached down and picked up a rotten chair-leg, after further inspection, she tossed it over her shoulder. Catrina made her way indoors, nothing remotely threatening lay about. She made her way into the hall, then she saw a door marked 'Cucina/ Kitchen' She scrambled inside. The entire floor was cluttered with rusty pots and pans, and the counters were covered with mould. Catrina opened a nearby draw, and peered inside. \"Muffin cups...oooo dangerous.\" She mumbled sarcastically. She kneeled to open the cupboards, she screamed and jumped back when a couple of rats scurried out. 'Shit! He's bound to hear that.' she thought as she journeyed deeper into the kitchen. She came across a draw that had dry blood marks on it. She opened it, and with a bit of luck she came across a razor sharp carving knife. Catrina smiled victoriously as she pulled it out, it glinted in the dim light. She twirled it in her fingers to marvel at the blade, when it reached a certain angle - she caught a reflection of somebody standing behind her - just before she could jump around and squeal - The person behind her had pinned her with their hips against the counter, and their hands had seized both of her hands, one of them still clutched the knife. The smell of peppermint reached her nostrils. \"If I'm not mistaken, I would think you were intending on harming someone with that knife you got there, precious.\" Jack's silky voice whispered, Catrina shivered as his warm soft lips tickled her ear. She still gripped tightly to the knife handle, not willing to let go. Jack's hands were ice cold, and were slowly warming up. \"Drop the knife.\" He commanded in a mocking tone. Catrina's body was beginning to ache, her legs were losing circulation due to the pressure Jack had on her hips, but she still held the knife firmly in her grasp. She shook with fear, anger...and a little of something else as she stood there. \"Drop it or I'll get frisky with you.\" Catrina eyes widened with surprise. He squeezed her wrist, and her fingers slowly opened, and the blade slipped out of hand and clattered on the counter. \"There's a good girl.\" He kissed the back of her head. She gasped as he yanked her arms behind her back as if he were arresting her. \"Now let me take you back to your room.\" He forcefully guided her out of the kitchen, with her digging her heels into the floor, which didn't help at all, it just burned. \"Let go of me you murdering bastard!\" She screeched, she managed to release one of her hands, and grab hold of a bar attached to a mirrored wall. His face held on a serious expression, but his eyes showed he was humoured, as he tugged on her arm, realising she was attached to something. He began prizing her hand from the railing finger by finger. Then he wrapped his strong arms around the slim of her waist and lifted her away from the bars, with her kicking out forcefully. Boy...she wasn't gonna make it easy. Catrina tried to fling her head back, to head-butt him, but all he got was a face full of hair, Jack smirked. He then put her down, and spun her around so she was facing him, before she could say another word, he lifted her and through her over his shoulder. A few seconds she went quiet, then she returned to screaming the ship down. Various ghostly heads popped out of walls to see what was the matter, but soon as they saw Jack they dodged out of sight. He turned into another corridor, the same two ghosts that were in deep conversation earlier, turned into the same corridor, and immediately walked backwards when their eyes locked with Jack's. He approached the room, and kicked the door open, and strode inside. Jack leaned forward to allow Catrina to slide off him, she had stopped screaming, her throat was soar. She looked up at him, with her messy hair, and flushed face, Jack smiled at her appearance, which was soon wiped off as she slapped him hard across the face. His head remained tilted to one side for a few seconds, then he looked up with pursed lips and a dangerous look in his eye. Catrina relentlessly coward from him. \"You better start treating me with more respect, or mark my words you'll regret doing that?\" Even though he was seething with anger, he was also feeling another sensation inside him. Catrina's green eyes locked with his pale blues, his anger washed away. \"I'll treat you with more respect, if you let me go home.\" \"That's not your choice.\" She sucked in her lips and release them again, leaving them wet and shiny. \"Well you could stop man handling me for a start, and let me have some freedom on this ship...\" She began to whisper slightly near the end, and she averted her eyes to the floor. \"I can do that.\" His voice had got terribly quiet, and he began to edge closer to her. \"I'm not finished yet.\" She said, looking up slightly. \"I also want you to stop looking at me like that.\" Jack was about to say 'Like what!' But he didn't, he already knew, and he backed out of the room, and closed the door. He walked down the corridor feeling slightly agitated, his trousers felt slightly tight. Maureen and Dodge lay on their bed. The sun shining down on their clammy skin. Maureen closed her eyes for a few seconds, she suddenly had a vivid image which seemed to being playing in slow motion, of her daughter kicking and screaming, being carried mercilessly to a bedroom- Maureen's eyes flew open. It had occurred to her many times 'what would a 24 year-old man do with a 18 year-old girl?' She swallowed and sat up. Dodge looked at her sadly. \"Honey you okay?\" Her eyes rounded, she turned towards him grabbing his arm. \"He must of taken her to the Antonio Graza...Come on!\" She jumped up, and ran towards the phone. Dodge looked at her with a realising look, the he turned to her. \"What are you doing?\" His wife spun around, holding the phone with her shoulder and ear, dialling. \"I'm getting the guys together.\"[Chapter 6] \"Maureen this is nuts, we can't just go to the Antonia Graza, we don't know where to find it!\" Dodge's eyes followed Maureen across the room and back as she paced. \"We could start looking from where we saw it last...in the Bering sea?\" \"The ship was fixed, it could have travelled anywhere by now!\" \"-We could at least try Mike, have some faith...jeeze it's like you not even interested in finding your own daughter!\" Dodge jumped up. \"Don't you ever say that I don't care for my daughter, I just think we should inform the authorities, they might give a nation wide search party!\" \"A nation wide search party? They won't do that, anyway this is between us and Jack, the authorities won't believe that a man who is a servant of the devil kidnapped our daughter, and is now imprisoning her on a ship which supposed to have sunk over 50 years ago, I mean come to think of it I don't believe it, but I know for a fact it's true, so I'm gonna go out myself and find her.\" Maureen took a breath. Dodge sighed, and sat down on the bed. \"When we do come up against Jack, what are we supposed to do?... Command him to give us our daughter back, because he won't without a fight?\" \"-What do you suggest, we form a demon slaying cult, or look up some serious demon-ass kicking voodoo?\" He looked up at his wife, his eyes rounded. \"That's not quite a bad idea.\" Maureen cocked her eyebrow. \"Are you serious?\" \"Yes, we could research it on the net, or in the library, and I'm sure there must be some spiritual people out there that must of heard of 'the soul collector'?\" Maureen considered it to be a good starting point, and nodded. Antonio Graza... Catrina stood there staring after Jack who had just backed out of the room. When she sensed his presence was gone, she placed a hand on her chest, her heart was banging hard against her rib cage. She sighed as her breath caught up with her. Jack's very essence had stirred her very soul, even though she loathed him with passion, there was something about him that was overpowering, and made her knees buckle at the sight of him or his slightest touch. When she looked into his eyes she could see a deep desire which frightened her. She mentally slapped herself for feeling and thinking such a thing. Catrina then decided to take out her frustration on the things around her, she picked up a vase and through it at the mirror on the dressing table. Jack strode down the corridor, soon as he entered his room he kicked a chair and sent it flying into the wall opposite, it splintered instantly. He was near the edge of his tether, he had actually agreed on a last deal before leaving a room, and he had walked out of a room without even considering satisfying himself. It then dawned on him; he was becoming infatuated with Catrina and he wasn't sure if he liked it, it corrupted him. Jack ran his fingers through his hair, to calm himself, then an evil smile spread on his face, a little voice in his head spoke. 'You don't have to like it, it's called lust, when it hits you, you make a grab for the opportunity, and the person doesn't have to want it as well, you could force yourself on them.' He embraced himself as he felt his old self returning. Suddenly he felt the other side of him, he began to shake his head. 'Never Jack, that's rape.' '-Why should you care!' '-I don't care...I just don't think I have to have sex to satisfy my needs, I'm not an incubus!' 'But you will be someday...' 'Don't be pathetic...when I've filled my quota I'll throw a party in limbo and get promoted-' '-You will automatically become an Incubus.' 'GO TO HELL...-...Gladly, wait I'm you sooo... if I go back...you'll have to come with me.' Jack took his coat off and let it slip to the floor, putting an end to the conversation with himself. He cracked his neck, and exited the room, it was time to check on Catrina. (Can't you just imagine the jaws theme tune playing right now) Down the corridor... Catrina stood clutching her torn pillow in the middle of a cluttered room, her hair was a disarray and it looked like she had been rolling around in a chicken coop, for her hair wasn't just sticking up at different angles, it was speckled with pillow feathers. She panted heavily, as she glared about her. The silk sheets were ripped down the middle, and the frame of the bed itself was on it's side. Catrina heard the turning of a door handle behind her, and she lobbed the remains of her pillow in that direction. Shecouldn't help but smile at Jack's stunned expression as the pillow bounced off his chest. She went back to her serious calm look when she remembered why she had became frustrated. \"What the fuck has happened in here!\" He exclaimed, putting on his scary face. \"Oh...I was just showing the place how much I loved it!\" She said sarcastically, folding her arms. Jack approached her slowly, stepping on bits of broken mirror to get to her. He smirked as a flicker of fear passed across her face . 'Damn she looks hot with sex hair!' He thought, he noticed Catrina cautiously edging away. He began to pick out the feathers from her blondie brown locks. \"You do realise if you've damaged your bed, you'll have to come and sleep with me.\" She jumped back, appalled at his statement. \"The bed's not damaged it's just messed up and I can easily tidy that up!\" \"What about the sheets and the pillow?\" \"I can sleep without them!\" Catrina scowled. Jack put on a fake hurt look. \"That's a shame, we could have snuggled up real close.\" He speedily enclosed his arms around her arms and pulled her in close, she struggled against him, bashing her arms against his shirt. \"Let go of me...we had a deal!\" Her voice got muffled as he pushed her head further into his chest. \"Oh don't worry this isn't man handling it's called an affectionate embrace.\" \"No it's not...now let go you're suffocating me!\" Catrina gasped in panic. He let go immediately and she leaped back into the dressing table. \"Ow fuck!\" Jack wiggled his eyebrows suggestively. \"Is that a request?\" \"No...go to hell would be a request!\" She said through clenched teeth, rubbing her back in pain. \"Oh how little you know.. my sweet.\" Jack took a step towards her, wetting his lips. She narrowed her eyes. \"Stop looking at me like that!\" She said it as an order, and surprisingly he stopped, his face mellowed into an innocent face, and he pursed his lips, and looked off to the side. She could tell by the way his cheek bulged out, that he was gritting his teeth. Jack left the room mumbling. 'You'll want me before tomorrow's out.\" Catrina's head remained facing the place where Jack once stood. She put her hand to her now flushed cheek. She had never felt so uncomfortable in her life, it was kind of an arousing uncomfortable feeling. Catrina rubbed between her eyebrows. 'What...was he somehow forcing me to make the first move?' She thought. At the top deck... Francesca filed her nails, while leaning on the railings. She looked up when she felt a twinge in her hand. Jack walked over to her. \"I want a word with you?\" He said nastily, cracking his knuckles. Francesca looked nervously at him. \"Is this to do with Catreena?\" \"Yes, it is actually...why wasn't she in her room when I got back?\" He put hands either side of her on the railings, leaning towards her face. \"I tried but she was not listening to me.. I tried to move her, but she wouldn't budge, and she started asking questions!\" \"Questions-\" He tipped his head innocently. \"You didn't give her answers did you!\" He grabbed hold of her throat, Francesca looked taken aback. \"I-I-I didn't know what to say, so allz I said was you tormented our very souls.\" Francesca whimpered slightly as he tightened his grip on her deathly cold throat. \"But-she d-d-doesn't know, she just thinks it's a...it's a, figure of speech.\" Jack released her and she rubbed her neck, still trying to figure out how he managed to do that. \"Has she asked the date of your death?\" Francesca recapped with remorse. \"No, but she did ask how you got to land and back so quickly?\" \"And how the hell did she know I was inland?\" \"I don't know...one of the ozers must of told her!\" Jack began to click his teeth together as he paced the deck. \"Jack, why are you worried about tellings her? I'm sure if you told her she would never want to disobey you again\" Jack continued pacing, he would have told her, but there was a slight chance of her running around cowering from him. 'Why should I care?...I want her to fear me' He then paused. 'Or do I?' He then considered if he really had started to develop feelings for her, then he shook it off. 'It's not love...it's non-affectionate, animalistic lust.' He nodded in agreement with himself, and turned towards the Italian woman. \"Because my dear, she might get worse than she is now, and jump off board in terror, anyway I'd like to have a bit a fun with her first.\" \"Why not chain her to the bed, tell her, then have your fun with her?\" She went back to filing her nails. \"It's not like you haven't done it before?\" Francesca hurtled back, as Jack wagged his finger at her. \"I told you not to mention that.\" He turned his back on her considering it with relish, then he shrugged his shoulders, feeling slightly uncomfortable. He folded his arms and turned towards her. \"Francesca...how would you get someone that doesn't like you, to have sex with you?\" \"Willingly?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Well the only way to do that is to get the person to like you.\" \"There's got to be an easier way, a quicker way.\" His pale blue eyes drifted to the corners. Francesca slunk up to Jack, placed both hands on his shoulders and leaned into him. \"There is lust, lust can be created even when there's hate present.\" Jack gave off a devilish smile, as he wrapped his arms around her waist. Jack's lips were centimetres away from hers. \"What you mean like how your feeling right now?\" \"Ci, you need to stir her senses.\" \"Oh but her senses are hard to stir, what do you suggest?\" Francesca turned her back on him, and slipped her gloves on. \"You won't need to stir her senses... she just needs to see you stirring.\" Jack smiled evilly as they walked along the deck, a plan had began to foil in his mischievous brain. \"So are you going to get started?\" Francesca interjected. \"No not yet, I think I'll just hang around with her for a bit, real gentleman like.\" Jack shoved his hands into his pocket and de-materialized, as Francesca passed through a wall. Dodge made his way up the stairs with a cup of coffee in his hand, he approached Maureen's and his room, and pushed the door ajar. As soon as it opened 4 inches the door immediately slowed down and began to knock over stacks of paper. He poked his head around the door, the room was entirely cluttered with papers and leaflets, it was that bad, not a single piece of carpet or furniture could be seen. \"Err...honey? I brought you some coffee.\" Mike called. Maureen's head appeared over the top of an over piled stack. \"Oh thanks!\" She said gratefully. \"Bring it in.\" Mike looked about him, as he pushed the door half way, which caused 3 piles to topple over. \"You've got to be kidding me?\" He tried his best not to step on stuff as he approached Maureen, but something always crumpled under his feet. He handed her the cup. \"Have you got anything?\" \"Surprisingly...yes.\" She put her coffee down after taking a small sip. \"All demons can appear in human form and most demons collect souls to gain more power, there are many types which rely on souls, but have entirely different powers...like err...this one. \"Maureen grabs a random bit of paper and hands it to Dodge. \"A Capito demon, is a demon which can create fantastic illusions that can fool all the 5 senses. Depending on the degree of powers, now that's definitely Jack!\" He hands her back the paper. \"Ah-but the thing is, Jack has more than one power, so he could be a Cedo.\" \"-Cedo?\" \"A demon which can change or shape shift.\" Maureen stated rather perplex. Dodge stared at her blankly. \"Then there's the Escensio...a teleport, but it says here it can't travel over open water using it's power, which is confusing, so I think he is an Eleskron which is similar to an Escensio but doesn't have to see where there going, and can travel over water.\" \"-Maureen, as much as I would love to go over the whole demon encyclopaedia, we only really need to find out one thing...which is how to kill it.\" Mike interrupted. Maureen began to sift through the papers again. \"I was just getting to that, if I keep finding more species of demons, the harder it's going to be to find a way to kill them.\" Maureen tapped a pile on it's side on the floor to neaten it. \"Have you found anything?\" \"Yes, it occurred to me he might not be a demon, but a human being possessed by a demon, so I researched exorcism.\" \"Yer what!\" \"Exorcism, you know removing evil spirits from a person by driving it out using the power of god.\" \"-I know what exorcism means, but I don't think it applies to Jack.\" Maureen stood up, and folded her arms. \"So that's all you've got?\" \"No, I've got a list of demons I need to go through.\" Dodge put on his reading glasses, his wife couldn't help but smirk. \"Hit me.\" Dodge went through the whole list, pausing when Maureen asked what they did. \"What the hell is a Incubus?\" \"You don't wanna know\" He mumbled in reply. \"I think you'll find that I do.\" Maureen made a grab for the piece of paper, but her husband pulled it out of her reach. \"Mike, if that piece of paper has the right definition to fit Jack, it will be the answer to all of our prayers, now gimme!\" She gleefully snatched the paper out of his hand, and skim read it. Dodge looked nervously at her, by the time Maureen had finished reading the page she had the look of horror on her face. She sank down on the bed. \"The demon itself feeds off sexual energy, mainly given off during sexual intercourse.\" Her hand holding the paper, fell to her lap. Dodge sat down, placing an arm around her. \"Maureen...listen to me, I don't think Jack's an incubus, if he was, he would of been draining us on the arctic warrior years ago...I was lusting after you then, you know?\" Maureen nodded, with a red tint in her cheeks. \"Incubus or not I don't want him anywhere near my baby, he'll still harm her in someway or another.\" Her voice was calm. \"I just want to get to her as soon as possible Mike.\" Her husband shook her affectionately and kissed her on the forehead. \"We will, I think we should fly to Alaska, then hire a boat, 'cause I don't want to sail all the way there...it'll take too long.\" Maureen nodded, she reached her hand up to Dodge's, which was rested on her shoulder. \"I just hope Dad will be okay to go, I know he has the mind of a younger man, but he hasn't got a body like he used to.\" Catrina lay in bed, with the torn covers pulled up to her chest, her stomach groaned with hunger. She tossed and turned until she drifted asleep. As soon as Catrina closed her eyelids, she saw that she was standing outside her primary school. She scratched her head in confusion. Catrina looked to the side, and saw her friend Emma talking to her, but her lips were moving speedily as if someone had pressed a fast forward button, she couldn't hear a word she was saying, all she heard was garbled squeaks. Catrina opened her mouth to respond, but nothing came out. She started to hear her loud intake of breath, and her heart beat which was very rapid, the sound chilled her to the bone. Children around her were hurriedly walking by, on their way home. The atmosphere suddenly went cold, everybody froze instantly in their positions. Catrina stared blankly at them, then she saw movement across the street. Her eyes locked with none-other than Jack's, his alien eyes narrowed evilly as he waved. She had never realised before...that Jack still looked the same as he did when he first started storking her when she was young, since it had been many years ago, she never had reflected on it. 'What the hell!' she finally thought. The place began to dissolve, it transformed into a garden littered with autumn leaves. Her bum met a bench, and her feet automatically shuffled some leaves. Catrina suddenly remembered feeling trapped and alone at the time. She heard her mum talking about her in the house a few yards away. She started to remember the creepy moments. Catrina continued to sit quietly, she shivered as she felt a hand caresses her cheek and tuck a strand of her behind her ear, she could hear Jack's silky voice whispering a disturbing song in her ear. \"Cradle falls, unholy wallsnCradle falls... -Silent in my sanitynI live safe inside my cellnIn the darkness that surrounds menI see my own special hellnComfort in my suffering nFeeling warm inside this painnBefore I was coming down on menI come on down again.\" She remembered almost every word. She didn't want to think back to any more. Catrina struggled to pull herself out of her dream. Her hair fanned out across the pillow as she turned in bed, not knowing Jack was lying next to her, stroking her hair, his lips gently brushed against her ear. please r&r;[Chapter 7] Things get a little more interesting somewhere in the middle, but it's still a good start. Catrina woke with a start, she felt the other side of the bed, her fingers made contact with a warmness on the sheets, she shivered slightly. Catrina used her remaining strength in her to push herself up, and lean against the headboard. Her eyes levelled with the person sitting on the trunk at the end of the bed, Jack was smiling pleasantly at her. Catrina mistaken it for some-sort of a twisted kindness, and tugged the silk duvet upwards to cover her top half, even though it was fully clothed. \"What do you want, to maul me again?\" Catrina was surprised at her own calmness in her voice. Jack's coat rustled a little as he cautiously stood up and made his way around to her, she eyed him suspiciously as he settled down next to her. \"I just dropped in to wish you good morning.\" He said innocently, he was quite a distance away from her, as if he were shy. She gapped at him, and then returned to her suspicious gaze. \"That's it...no precious, or sweetie or touch up?\" \"Why would I do that?\" He said sheepishly, his lips parted slightly exposing his two incisors. She narrowed her eyes, and hastily slid out of bed on the opposite side of him, she remained facing him as she slowly backed towards the door. \"I'm just going to nip out for a walk.\" He nodded, she stared wide eyed at him, and rushed out into the corridor. Her bare feet padded along the rough carpeting, as she trotted towards the kitchen. She banged the door open, and rummaged through the cupboards. All she came across was cans of rat poison which were in the same place as the tinned baked beans, which was very disturbing. Catrina was startled by a voice behind her. \"Hungry?\" She turned towards Jack who was leaning against a counter behind her. She nervously scratched her arm \"Erm yeah...I haven't eaten in days.\" Jack brought something from behind him on the counter top, it was a Chinese take-out noodle box. He said nothing as he waved it by its handle, in front of her, she grabbed it as soon as she got a waft of the sweet and sour sauce. \"Err...thanks?\" She turned her back on him, and began to devour the noodles with her bear fingers. Jack smiled evilly, his eyes dropped to her slim waist, then to her ass, then his eyes dropped down her slender legs. Catrina turned and noticed him jump as if he had be caught doing something he shouldn't have been doing. Realising she must look a right state, she wiped her lips with the back of her hand, slightly embarrassed. \"You don't have to follow me around?\" She walked by him. 'Maybe he's finally going with the deal?' she thought as she made her way through the door and towards the decking. Jack's gaze followed her until the doors flapped shut, he tugged at the top of his shirt, wafting it about his neck. \"God it's hot in here.\" He muttered. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Maureen knocked the knocker against a grand oak door. As she waited, she took an interest at a pentagram wind chime which was hanging above her head. She prepared her pleasant smile, as she heard the sound of catches being undone, the door opened, and out poked a youngish man's head, he looked no older than 20. \"Err...hi, I'm Maureen I called about the...\" She dropped her voice. \"The night world cult.\" The man opened the door wider, and pulled her inside, checking for passer-byers as he closed he door. \"I-I was told you could-\" She started, but he pressed a finger to his lips to hush her. \"Shush.\" He whispered. \"The neighbours press their ears to the walls...now follow me\" As they passed the living room, Maureen noticed a séance was being conducted. They continued down the corridor towards a small door in between the kitchen and the dining room, the smell of sulphur filled the air. He pushed the small door open and walked down a darkened stairway, Maureen followed uneasily, and was soon in a room lit by candle light. There were 5 others in the room, apart from the man and her. They were all seated on small three legged stools in a semi-circle. A woman looked up at their new visitor. \"You are Maureen, and you wish to ask me something.\" She said huskily, her bright brown eyes glowed in the candle light. The man smiled encouragingly at Maureen and wondered back upstairs, leaving her alone. \"Yes...I asked if you know a way to kill a demon.\" Maureen kept near the stairs with her back to the wall. \"We will tell you know more until we know you mean business.\" Maureen listened intently. \"If you wish to freak out, then just turn around and leave my house. But If you want to know what you came here for, step closer.\" Maureen hesitated, but gradually moved closer to the semi-circle. \"I love my daughter, and I'll do anything to get her back, even if it means diving into something that I always found hard to believe.\" The stool creaked as the woman stood up, she was surprisingly small for the depth of her voice. \"And do you believe?\" Epps stood for a moment. \"I do, because I have witnessed unbelievable things in my life.\" \"And you think just because your daughter's vanished off the face of the earth, means a demon must of taken her?\" \"I don't think,...I know, and my daughter hasn't disappeared off the face of the earth, she is still here and I know where...sort of!\" Maureen began to raise her voice. \"All I want to know is how to kill it.\" All eyes in the room were upon her. \"I know who took her, but I'm still not quite sure what he is...a cedo, a capito, maybe even an Incubus?\" Maureen heard a couple of them gasp. \"But I know for sure he is a soul collector.\" The rest of the group burst into whispers. The woman raised her hand to silence them. \"A soul collector you say, that is a little out of our league.\" \"You mean you can't help me?\" She folded her arms in irritation. \"I didn't say that, it's just we've never been asked how to destroy one of there kind before.\" \"-And why is that, surely someone must have been bothered by one, or realised how dangerous it must be to come across one?\" Maureen eyes glanced at the others in the room, who were all looking at each other wearily. \"Maureen, soul collectors don't bother people at random, and anyone who has ever came across a soul collector ends up dead. I just don't see why 'one' would take your daughter. Even if one had?...I wouldn't hold much hope for her.\" \"She's not dead if that's what you mean?... I can still feel her. And guess what...I've met one, and I'm not dead...and I don't fear it.\" Maureen walked closer to the semi-circle. \"Then you are very very lucky or...\" The woman then indicated to another member to fetch something, the person walked to the other side of the room, to rummage around. The woman sighed as she closed her eyes, she opened them again to look at Maureen. \"I'm guessing he took your daughter in your stead.\" Epps looked down with guilt. \"That would be correct.\" The woman closed her eyes again. \"You made a deal with him before she was conceived.\" Maureen nodded slowly, she noticed all the others were looking at her curiously. \"I was young and stupid, I was hoping he would forget...I, I just wanted to see my family again.\" Dry tears began to well up in her eyes, she sniffed them back. \"You were foolish.\" The woman said simply, her eyes still closed. The other member returned , and approached Maureen on her right side, he was starting to open a jar. The woman took a sharp intake of breath, and then the candles began to flicker about the room. Maureen looked about her at the others, as if asking. 'Err...what the hell is going on?' They were obviously confused as her. The woman began to shake. She then cracked her neck to the side, and spoke in a strained voice. \"Years from now Maureen, when you've settled down in a nice cosy little house, with a nice husband, you got a nice little family of your own building up...you must let me take your first child.\" She smiled evilly, her neck rolling from side to side. Maureen gapped, while the others stared wide-eyed at her. \"You know perfectly well I can't die, Maureen.\" The woman's eyes darted open, they were bright blue. Her head straightened to look at Maureen full on, the atmosphere was cold. Maureen shivered. \"Jack...what have you done with my daughter?\" The woman's voice remained her own except it was croaky, and staggered. \"How did I get here?\" She looked about her confused. \"What have you done with my daughter!\" Maureen repeated starting to get annoyed. Jack's eyes darted back to hers, and held them in a hypnotic gaze. \"Your one nosy little bitch aren't you?\" The woman jerked her head to the side. The group were standing as still as statues. \"I want her back now, Jack.\" \"Whom... the woman, or your daughter?\" The woman's mouth tugged into a sneer.. \"Catrina of course...she doesn't belong to you!\" \"Oh well that's where your wrong Maureen...we had a bargain, she's mine and there's nothing you can do about it, that's unless you want me to take back all of your friends and family.\" \"-You know perfectly well I can't let you do that!\" Maureen seethed with anger, as she clenched her fists. One of the three members behind the woman whispered to another. \"What's causing this?...What should we do?\" \"-I...I dunno, this has never happened before, and we're not even doing a seance.\" One said in panic. Maureen at that moment wanted to flee from Jack's sight, but she felt like she was nailed to the spot. \"I've given you a lot Jack, you don't need anything of mine!\" \"We had a deal, anyway I can't give her back now...I've grown quite attached to her.\" Jack said mockingly, a smile curled on the woman's lips. Maureen gritted her teeth. \"-You stay away from her!\" \"I can't just stay away from her, I do need to keep her where she is after all.\" \"I want to see her now!\" Maureen bellowed out, a surge of sadness hit her, as she felt she was slowly being defeated. Suddenly the man standing next to her looked to the floor, a look of realisation passed across his face, he then looked up at the others, and yelled. \"We're forming a pentagram, jump out now!\" Almost immediately after he said this, all the others in the group darted out of there positions. Maureen watched horror struck as the woman snapped her head back and erupted a deafening screech, her back arched as a gush of wind spiralled around the room and shot upstairs, the woman crumpled to the floor motionless. \"Why'd you do that for I could of found out more?\" Epps exclaimed, as the group ran to attend their fallen leader, the man looked like he was very close to her. \"So how do you plan on helping me!\" The man turned to Maureen, looking at her with annoyance. \"Did you hear me...what are you going to do!\" She repeated, taking a step towards them, from the moment she did - The man jumped back, reached into the open jar he was holding, and sprinkled a line of salt across the floor. \"Stay back, I don't know what you are...but what ever you are, you were the one that brought that negative energy in here!\" The others had carried their leader to a chair in the corner, and had made their way behind the man. \"But I didn't mean to...all I did was come for answers to get rid of my demons.\" Maureen was appalled at being blamed for something that wasn't her fault. She strode over their carefully laid out line of salt, they instantly backed away. \"That energy as you called it' I didn't bring it, it must have followed me, and I'm not letting you blame me for this!\" \"-GET OUT!\" The man yelled starting to chuck salt in her direction. \"GLADLY!\" She stormed upstairs, the man which had let her in the house was lighting some candles in the corridor, and he jumped in surprise as Maureen strode angrily by him. \"Excuse me...err...are you alright?\" Maureen stopped in mid-step, and spun around. \"Alright...alright!...No I'm not alright, I came here for answers, and what do I get...a possessed witch and a wrong accusation from a salt slinging cult!\" Maureen retched the door open and stalked outside. After she had briskly walked up the path, she turned onto the main pavement and began walking the long way home, the breeze blew hard in her face, and felt she was not alone. Epps suddenly heard someone calling in the distance, she remorsefully turned around to see the man she had yelled at, running to catch her up. He reached her puffing and panting. \"I, I apologise for chasing you up like this, but, but I just want to ask...do I know you from somewhere?\" Maureen's face softened, as she blanked out. \"Erm...no, I don't think so?\" \"- 'Cause I recognise you, your name is Maureen right?\" She nodded at his question. \"That wouldn't be Maureen Dodge would it?\" \"Err...yes?\" She replied slightly suspicious. \"Do I know you?\" \"I'm sorry...you see I've been dying to meet you, I'm Robert...Catrina's boyfriend.\" He stuck his hand out, Maureen shook it still baffled, then she smiled at his half smile. \"Robert...I was wondering when I was finally going to meet you, sorry about earlier...erm...do you live in that house?\" She scratched her ear in question. \"Err...yes unfortunately, the whole cult thing is kind of a family business, all except for my mum, she absolutely hates it. My Dad holds seances in the living room, and my aunt has a club in the basement.\" He coughed slightly when he mentioned his aunt. \"Your aunt, that possessed witch?\" \"-She's not my favourite aunt, did she really get possessed?\" \"Yes...but it doesn't matter, Okay then...I'll see you around.\" She began to rush off in the other direction, trying to avoid the question he might pop. He caught up with at the corner, tugging at her sleeve, and standing in front of her. \"So how's Catrina, she hasn't called me in days.\" Maureen looked off to the side, then back. \"She's fine, she's out and about...in different places.\" She replied quickly, too quickly. \"-So she hasn't fell out with me or anything?\" \"No, no, no, no, no.\" \"Could you pass on the message that I asked about her, and ask her to call me.\" Robert began to back away, feeling happy with himself. \"Erm...I won't be able to do that straight away she gone to err...San Francisco, for a few days.\" Robert paused, and looked slightly baffled. \"Oh...she didn't tell me.\" \"-Well it was all of a sudden, an old pen pal asked her last minute and zooooom, she was off.\" Maureen rubbed the back of her head irritably. \"Catrina loves her shopping.\" She gave Robert a weak smile and took her leave. -------------------------------------------------------- Jack lifted himself off the floor, and dusted himself off. He looked up to see Francesca staring at him curiously. \"Don't ask.\" \"She doesn't have that effect on yous does she?\" Francesca asked, putting a hand on her hip. \"Nooo, something dragged me somewhere else, I was able to talk through someone else, and you'll never guess who I spoke to.\" \"Who?\" She asked, beginning to slip off her gloves to file her nails, not in the slightest bit interested. \"Well my dear.\" He snatched the file away from her, and she immediately looked up in surprise. \"Maureen.\" \"Maureen...as in the girl that got away, the Madre of Catrina!\" \"Yes, now get out of my way.\" Jack shoved by her, making for the decking. \"Your not by any chance looking for Catrina are you?\" Francesca questioned. Jack paused in the doorway, with the sun blazing on his front, silhouetting him. He licked his pointed tooth as he turned around to her. \"Well yes, she is my prisoner, I have to see her sometime or another don't I?\" \"Aren't you supposed to leave her alone, and then go wiz our little plan?-\" \"I was going to befriend her first, then go 'wiz' our little plan.\" Jack mocked, he then winked at her and flashed a dazzling smile which he had captured many women's hearts with, as he disappeared into the sunlight. Jack circled the decking, not finding Catrina. He decided to seek out her soul, using one of his many talents. He closed his eyes, and began to sense the whole boat in his mind, he scanned every nook and cranny for his token, a smile came to his lips as a small outline flash in his mind, he felt a warm tug in his heart strings, he could almost smell her feminine essence. His fair blue eyes met daylight again as he casually turned around and made his way indoors. He headed for the helm, he pushed open the door, and rushed in, the same way he did when he heard Dodge and Maureen talking about him many years back. He could feel her, but couldn't see her, his eyes went cat yellow as he saw her glowing aura through the ceiling of the helm. He walked over to one of the windows, and stuck his top half through, and stretched, his eye level rested above the roof, and he saw Catrina's slender form standing a distance away from him, facing out to sea, her hair looked red in the sun light with it's mixture of blonde and brown, and it blew away from her face like a silk sheet. 'How can a mortal look that beautiful?' He pulled his tall cat-postured frame through the window, and used his strong arms to pull himself up. She hadn't noticed him behind her, he pushed the lust to the back of his mind and approached her. \"I think I shall call you Rose.\" Catrina jumped around, she lost her balance and she was about to plummet over the edge but he grabbed her waist and pulled her towards him. For just a half second he felt shell-shocked that she was about to fall to her death. But the worry passed suddenly as he held her safely, he had to come to terms with the personality he was supposed to be using on her. \"Are you okay?...s-s-sorry I startled you.\" He stuttered, acting on his innocent friend manoeuvre. For a brief moment he thought she bought it, but she shakily pushed him away. Catrina felt sick with shock and slight arousal. She had almost died, but then she was saved by the man she loathed, and her core began to ache. She shakily tucked a strand of her hair behind her ear. \"I'm fine...I'm fine.\" \"No your not fine Catrina, now sit down.\" Jack put pressure on her shoulders and she sank down, and he sat down along side of her. She pulled her knees protectively to her chest, and Jack copied her, so it would throw away some threat. \"How'd you know I was up here?\" She asked quietly, not looking at him. Jack strained his eyes to think. \"I...err...could smell you?\" Jack suddenly heard her huff out a laugh through her nose. \"I smell that bad do I?\" Catrina was slightly amused. Jack brought his eyes to her and noticed she was still looking out to sea. \"No no, not at all.\" He side glanced at her, she was discreetly rubbing her arms. He shuffled over, and wrapped one side of his coat around her so they were sharing a coat, she didn't reject it at all, in fact she tugged it tighter around her, which made Jack jerk closer, he didn't mind. Catrina didn't know if she was happy or not, she stared out at the sea because she was confused and frustrated, she knew that if she took her eyes off the horizon she would look at Jack, and he would be looking at her in his creepy way, or vice-versa he would see her looking at him in the same creepy way. Catrina placed her chin on her kness, her eyes glazed over. -FLASH- Her mother looked at her and guided her to the wooden chest at the foot of her bed. \"No sweetie... he can't, at least not when I'm around.\" Her mum then tucked a strand of her hair behind her ear. She then seen Jack appear behind her mum, she shook with fear. \"MUMMY HE'S HERE!\" -Maureen whirled around. -FLASH- Catrina jumped. 'How did he magically appear in the room?' She remembered Jack was right next to her, and she shuffled away. Jack looked at her in surprise. \"What's wrong?\" She was sitting a distance away from him. He tried to scan her mind, to see what she was thinking that had made her jump, he didn't come across anything. He assumed she must have remembered he was there or something. 'Maybe I could stir her hormones?' He knew he was breaking all the rules to all deals and promises he had made...but what the heck. He narrowed his eyes and concentrated, he was searching for her inner core. Catrina was just going to sit a few metres from him, but then she felt slightly uncomfortable and began to slide further away, an ache had formed in her stomach, suddenly the ache turned into a warm pleasant feeling, then it exploded into a pleasure. She gasped and clutched her stomach. Catrina felt it increase, she didn't want to moan out in ecstasy, not in front of Jack, so she exclaimed a mighty 'ow!'. Jack at first was enjoying himself, what he was doing to the inside of her body, but he immediately stopped when she exclaimed an 'ow' and he realised he must of been hurting her. Jack put on an innocent look and moved over to her. \"Are you feeling alright?\" He placed a comforting arm around her, and in response she shivered slightly, she looked up. Her emeralds locked with his blues. Jack felt intoxicated, he felt like a horny teenager again, and couldn't hold it back any longer. Jack grabbed her head and pulled her in for a kiss, he didn't even get a chance to taste, for the moment his lips met her, her palms pushed hard against his chest and he was knocked back, which gave her the opportunity to run to one side and jump to the lower deck. He jumped up and growled angrily after her, now that her presence was gone his arousal faded a little. ----------------------------------------------------------------- She was tired of running, but it was the only thing she could do. 'Always look on the bright side, I'll have a brilliant stamina by the end of this ordeal...that's if there's an end to this ordeal?' Catrina slowed her pace when she reached the doors to the main hall, she put a hand to her jaw and clicked it slightly. In her desperation she didn't know she had walked through Francesca's ghostly form in the doorway. Francesca watched her walk off down the unlit corridor, and Catrina was slowly engulfed in darkness. Francesca quickly dissolved when a dull pain shot through her right hand, Jack was coming and he was extremely grassed off. ------------------------------------------------------------------ Catrina stepped over bits of broken glass and furniture in a part of the ship she hadn't been in before, shimmers of light, reflected off ripples of water which shone brightly on the grim walls. She reached what seemed like the end of that particular corridor. She heard a creak nearby, she looked to her right and saw a door which was ajar. Catrina motioned towards it, and pushed open the door with her finger -FLASH- She saw her mum, holding a flash light and motioning cautiously towards the same door. -FLASH- Catrina was amazed she had stumbled on the same door her mum must have years ago, she was overwhelmed with excitement and made her way in. The room itself was cluttered with half opened suitcases. Clothes and toys were strewed about the gloomy room, and crayon drawings were untidily stuck to the doors of the wardrobe. She glanced at a china doll which was perched on a chair next to the dressing table, it's beady eyes held an eternal sadness. Catrina picked it up and rubbed her thumb along it's cold pottery face. Her gaze went back to the wardrobe, her fingers brushed over the rough drawings, she pushed the door open - and screamed in terror as she jumped back- she dropped the china doll to the floor and it's face shattered. A half decayed skeleton, dressed in a scraggy blue dress hung from the top of the closet. The dress looked familiar, it was the same dress she had drew on a girl in her sketch pad...she remembered her mum had called her Katie Harwood. \"Who are you?\" A little voice asked from behind her, she spun around and stared at the girl from her pad in life form. She was reminded of when she was little, all except for the deathly pale skin, and her eyes. Katie looked back at her. \"I'm Catrina...Catrina Dodge, I'm guessing your a ghost.\" Catrina said, and Katie nodded in response. \"Is it true that your Maureen's daughter?\" Catrina smiled weakly at her, and Katie's eyes widened. \"I knew it!\" Katie jumped up slightly, simply childlike, her face then dropped. \"But is the other thing true...you were bargained for and kidnapped?\" Catrina scratched her arms \"That is true.\" \"How come your still alive...how come your soul hasn't been taken!\" Katie exclaimed, totally baffled, Catrina's brows furrowed. There it was again the mention of 'souls'. \"I am alive because Jack wants me alive,...and what is the significance with souls around here?\" Katie walked around the cases, brushing her colourless fingers over her old suitcases. \"Didn't your mum, or anybody else tell you anything about Jack?\" There it was again something about Jack and souls. \"You know what, why don't you tell me everything you know about Jack?...Then we could cut the explanations short.\" Catrina looked at Katie rather perplex. Katie folded her arms behind her back. \"He's a soul collector.\" \"Say what?\" \"A soul collector.\" Katie repeated looking about her wearily. \"Is that another way of saying a weird guy that likes living on a haunted ship?\" \"Haven't you even wondered why we're all afraid of him, and how he keeps us here?\" Catrina started to take in more breath. \"Maybe your just b-being paranoid, your just trapped 'cause you need the killer to be brought to justice...I will bring him to justice.\" Katie walked in front of Catrina. \"It's not as simple as that, he has-!\" Katie froze, and looked at the ceiling in terror. \"Not again!\" She put her hands over her head, as a form of protection as she faded out, Catrina stood their dumb-struck and creeped out. She shook herself. 'No he can't be...it's ridiculous.' She walked out of the room and into another room across the landing. 'Does he have powers or something?' Catrina then imagined what he would be capable of if he did have powers, she cringed. Catrina slowly opened the wardrobe in the room, and was surprised to find everything intact. It was a closet of a wealthy young woman, she pulled out three coats which caught her eye, and tried them on, looking in the mirror. The first one was a scarlet, ankle length coat, it wasn't something she had in mind. The second was a black rain coat which had a waist belt, then she tried on a dark green velvet cloak which had a hood on the back, she flicked her brown hair out of the coat, and the light brown curls at the end of her locks passed her shoulders. Catrina smiled and did a little twirl, it felt comfortable, not to mention it matched her eyes. As she looked about her she noticed, as she did on may occasions everything looked old-fashioned. She looked at the wall, there was a lighter patch on the wall, as if something had been removed recently, maybe a calendar. The other clothes in the wardrobe were all dresses and skirts, and not a single pair of women's trousers could be seen, not even a pair of trainers. 'Just how old is this boat anyhow?' Catrina now wished she had paid attention in history. Suddenly her eyes focused on a black pair of knee length heeled boots, similar to ones she had at home but the toes were squarish. She immediately grabbed them and slipped them on. 'Oh yes I feel whole again.' Catrina walked out feeling absolute triumph, all she needed know was to get off the boat. Catrina headed back to her room, but before she did she rushed down to the kitchen to get a few things. She walked through the door of her room 2 minutes later, suddenly the door closed behind her, she jumped around- Jack was standing behind the door looking quite pleased with himself, his pearly whites showing partly. \"There you are!\" He exclaimed as if he were talking to a child. She swallowed, she didn't know if she liked him when he was happy. 'At least he's not angry.' He almost floated towards her, then he pinched her cheeks cruelly. \"I have been looking everywhere for you...and don't you look nice with that little cloak on, let me help you off with that.\" Catrina bat his hands away, and took a step back from him. Jack moved forward and began fiddling with the bow at the front of her new cloak, and she flapped out at him \"Could you keep you hands off me!\" Her hair began to get messy, and her cheeks went red in frustration. \"Calm down sweetheart...just helping you take of your cloak, that's all.\" Jack desperately tried to put on an innocent face, but he couldn't help but smirk at her suffering. She half growled. \"JAAAAACK STOP IT!\" Catrina tried to slap him, but he caught her hand. His fingers came forward to try and hook them around the bow, but they went further and hooked onto the bit of strap between the cups of her bra. He instantly stopped and the smile was gone from his face. Catrina had stopped flapping when she suddenly felt cold fingers down her top, she looked down and looked back up again. Blue eyes staring at her, it was the look. It wasn't him playing games anymore. The next thing she felt was a hand on the back of her head, pulling her forward. 'Oh no... not again!' Her hands automatically came up between her face and his, he was desperately trying to reach her lips, she squirmed. She remembered on another occasion, where she had just been to her high school prom and she was getting a ride home from her date, Derek Johnson, and he pulled her by her hair back in the car to smooch her, luckily her dad was coming out to greet them. He dragged Derek out of the car by the scruff of his neck and kicked him in the ass. But with Jack, it was going to be slightly different, her dad wasn't around to kick anybodies ass, so she would have to rely on her own fist, but it all depended on her timing. Catrina then remembered what was tucked in the waist band of her skirt, the carving knife, she didn't wish to kill anybody, just use it as a threatening device. She came out of thought to find the room was a wreck, everything had been carelessly knocked out of its place, and she was pressed against the dressing table, Jack was firmly pinning her, her eye level reached his neck. His hands were about her head, with his thumbs caressing her cheek, he leaned in - TAP TAP... \"Err...pardon me Jack?\" Jack looked around at a waiter standing in the doorway, Jack's face hitched with anger and slight embarrassment, he released Catrina's face. Catrina gazed at the ceiling, mouthing 'thank heavens'. \"Have I come at a bad time?\" The waiter added nervously. Catrina shook her head. \"Well yes actually you have, but what is it!\" Jack said. \"Erm...F-F-Francesca was wondering if you were supposed to be going somewhere this afternoon?\" He didn't hold eye contact with Jack. Catrina noticed Jack's pale blue eyes went blank, then they slowly moved to the corners to side glance at her. He pursed his lips in thought. \"Oh yes...so I have!\" He jerked off Catrina and walked past the startled waiter and down the corridor. The waiter remained and looked Catrina up and down, suddenly an arm appeared out from the side of the door and pulled the distracted waiter sideways. Then you heard Jack's voice. \"I know she's nice to look at...now come on\" Don't forget to r&r;, even if your a regular.[Chapter 8] Sorry about the spelling and grammar mistakes you might find. Maureen sat at a desk, the lamp shone on her hands and across the pages of a book she was holding, the rest of the room was shrouded in darkness. With every turn of an ancient page, an echo would erupt throughout the entire room. She rubbed her temples as she reached another dead end. She slammed the book shut. \"Err...Mrs Dodge?\" Maureen sat up straight and looked around, a woman in her late 50s was shining a torch in her direction. \"I'm afraid I can't keep the library open any longer Maureen...I'm having calls from local residents about a burglar.\" Maureen smiled slightly at her being called a burglar, however the Librarian couldn't help but look at her sympathetically. \"Did you find what you were looking for?\" \"No I didn't.\" Maureen began to scoop up the various books that were scattered about the table and place them in there rightful places on the shelves. \"But thanks all the same for giving up your spare time, I'm very grateful.\" The librarian smiled and patted Maureen on the back, as she led her towards the main doors. \"I think I'll come in the morning and have another look...If that's okay with you?\" \"Oh that's fine.\" The woman subtlety guided her out into the open. \"Not to be nosy or anything Maureen, but...err...what are you exactly looking for?\" Maureen turned around to face her in the doorway. \"Just research really.\" \"But why do it in the evenings?\" \"-Because I have other things to do in the day time.\" Maureen smiled pleasantly and waved as she turned around. The librarian looked after her curiously as she closed the door and locked it. A cold night air ruffled through Maureen's curly locks as she zipped up her coat and stuck her hands in her pockets, once again thrown into a pit of frustration and confusion, there were no answers to what she needed, she could feel her daughter slowly slipping away into oblivion. Maureen knew she could find her daughter, but she didn't know how to take her back without getting her or her family hurt. Many times she had been tempted to head to Alaska straight away, but she knew she was being idiotic, so she would settle down again. ------------------------------------------------------------------- The sun dimly lit the horizon which was reflected in Catrina's eyes. She stood at the very front of the ship, her hair and cloak blew out behind her. She hadn't seen Jack in days, which was quite unusual. Catrina gripped the railings tightly, turning her knuckles white. Although she was glad he wasn't there, another part of her felt lost without his presence. She even felt like she...missed him, but no she didn't, he was her captor, and she hated him for it. Catrina also disliked the way he touched her without her permission, no matter how much her heart screamed out for more, her brain said 'No!...He is an evil, murdering, perverted little...' Her face softened. It was just the way he touched her- like no other boy who had touched her before...Not even Robert could match up to the amount which pleasured her. There were moments when she was with Robert where she felt...ecstatic, but it wasn't the same as feeling - lust, and confusing lust. Catrina tried to think hard of a moment where she did feel lust towards Robert - there was a weak spell when she was in his car on lovers canyon. That's where she kissed him for the very first time, it was a forced kiss, because he wasn't really trying to start anything, he was just sitting there, talking about his annoying math teacher, then it happened...they were making out. It was a bit embarrassing when Emma and Adam started making Ape noises in the back seat. Ever since that night they had been going out. \"Catreena, what are you doing up at this hour?\" Catrina turned her head slightly, she could see red in the corner of her vision. \"Why should you care?\" Catrina replied calmly. \"Your just another servant of Jack, trying to keep me here and prevent me from destroying more furniture.\" Catrina thought the woman had left, because it was tomb-like quiet, then the voice was right next to her ear. \"I am also here to make sure you don't try and hurt yourself.\" \"Excuse me?...Does Jack think I'm suicidal!\" The Italian woman pursed her lips. \"Well he does now...I told him about ze knife secreted ona your person.\" Catrina began to feel around for her knife, it was gone, she looked up angrily at her. \"I wasn't going to use it to kill myself, I was going to use it as a means of defence!\" She stormed through Francesca's ghostly form, which dispersed into hundreds of orbs, then they rejoined again, forming a pissed of Francesca. \"I hate it when she does zat!\" ------------------------------------------------------- Catrina once again wondered into her room, she looked about her. The past few days had caught up with her, she thought she had come to terms with it all, but she hadn't. Now that no -one was around to bother her, her lip began to quiver, and she clasped like a tonne of bricks on to her bed spread. She curled herself up into a ball, like she did when she was younger. Tears sprung to her eyes, which then leaked onto her silk duvet. Sadness, isolation, and anger gripped her very soul. Catrina hadn't yet come to terms with her mother bargaining her off, she couldn't believe it, and she still couldn't believe no - one had come to her rescue yet. She then sat up feeling tired of feeling sorry for herself, it was time to act. She needed to build a raft or at least make an attempt to contact someone nearby. Catrina slid of her bed, and dashed out of her room in a direction which led her to a corridor leading to even more corridors, she was lost in a maze of doors. She came across a stairway which spiralled downwards into a deep cavern of darkness. Catrina edged slowly down the steps, every metre brought her closer to the gloom, every intake of her breathe rattled through her lungs and bounced off the walls of the stairway, it seemed to take forever to reach solid ground, she sighed and began feeling around her, to get a rough image of the pitch black room she was in. The floor was non-carpeted, and there was a strong smell of death in the room. Her fingers brushed against what felt like buttons, then she came to a wall, her hand knocked against a lever which was sticking up, she rest her hand on the handle -FLASH- A man approaches a lever, his hand pushes it up and a wheel begins to turn which causes a metal wire to tighten. People are dancing on the upper deck, the wire is pulled so tight it snaps and flies out towards the people dancing, it slices through them all. Everyone on the dance floor collapses, all except two, Katie and the captain. The girl steps back and the captain's head drops to the floor, his lifeless body then follows. Katie steps back and screams in terror. -FLASH- Catrina jerked her hand off the handle, her eyes were round like quarters and rimmed with tears. She spun around ready to walk towards the stairs - the lights came on - a man stood directly in front of her dressed in white, she jumped back in surprise. \"Hello sweetheart, you lost?\" He smiled evilly at her. Catrina stared wide eyed at him, that voice, she recognised it as one of the crew members that tried to lift up her skirt 6 days ago. \"I'm fine, I was just leaving.\" She tried to rush through him, but he was as solid as a brick wall. He chuckled slightly. \"I don't think that's going to work...y'see I'm concentrating real hard.\" He pushes her back and she falls onto something soft behind her, arms envelope her across the chest, she shrieked in surprise. \"Let go of me!\" She elbowed the person behind her in the chest and it had no affect on them, so she screamed. The man in white stepped forward and slapped her hard across the face, so hard in fact she almost blacked out from the sheer force of it, her face reddened and her eyes stung with tears. The person behind her spoke. \"Dashel...what yer playing at?...You could of left a mark!\" \"It's just a little red, that'll fade.\" Dashel replied while turning Catrina's head by her chin, she jerked away from his grip and spat at him. \"She's so feisty isn't she?...I'm going to enjoy this.\" The man made for her again. \"Wait!...won't she tell?\" The man behind her added, still gripping her tightly. \"Nah she won't, if she knows what's good for her?\" He looked her in the eye dangerously, then he kneeled down and raised her legs. 'God how I hate being the damsel in distress!' Catrina kicked out violently at him, her foot collided with his face, and he was knocked off his feet. At the same time she jerked her head back to head butt the guy behind her, he released her to rub his nose. As she jumped up and ran by the pair towards the stairs, she wondered how she managed to harm a ghost? She clattered up the stairway, her heart pounding madly with shock and fear, she reached the top and proceeded down a corridor towards a door marked fire escape, the draft wiped through her hair. Catrina's heart sighed with relief as she bashed the doors open and was greeted by sunlight. ------------------------------------------------ Jack crossed a road towards the Alaskan bar, he smiled nastily as he walked into his territory, he strode by the juke-box and sat where he normally sat to observe the rest of the bar, then he ordered a beer. His youthful face blanked out as he took a swig out of his bottle. He found himself thinking of Catrina, over the pass couple of days he would have a moment where he had vivid images of Catrina flashing through his mind, some which were just part of his imagination. He remembered one very well which was of her sitting on his bed in a towel, combing her wet hair, then the next minute he would appear in front of her and whip off her towel, the next part was quite obvious. A smirk came to his face as he recalled the last time he had touched her, his loins throbbed with an erection, and he quickly grabbed a newspaper and placed it on his lap to cover it slightly. He cleared his throat and smiled casually at a female bartender walking by him, she in turn flashed him a dazzling seductive smile, and when she was out of ear shot, he turned back to his beer and muttered 'slut' under his breath. Suddenly his blue eyes glazed over, his pupils shrunk -his face felt sore- He cracked his knuckles angrily, he sensed someone had deliberately slapped Catrina hard. How dare they touch something of his. He was dragged out of thought when he sensed someone sitting next to him, he smiled. \"I didn't expect someone like you to travel this far up.\" He turned to find a middle-aged man looking seriously at him. \"This isn't a smiling matter Jack.\" Jack dropped his smirk slightly. \"Why...what have I done now?\" \"You know perfectly well what you have done!\" The man wagged his finger. Jack rolled his eyes. \"And what is that then?\" He took a swig from his beer. \"You've turned into a softy.\" \"-No I haven't.\" The man dropped into a harsh whisper. \"-You haven't killed anybody in days...and I bet you haven't even thought about killing anybody in the next 24 hours.\" Jack raised his eyebrows. \"How would you know that, I could be planning a massacre as we speak?\" \"And are you?\" Jack said nothing, and shook his bottle to swirl the last dregs of his beer. \"Uh hu... I knew it, it seems to me this new obsession of yours is ruining your schedule.\" \"-It has just been one drink, one drink once a week.\" \"I'm not talking about your drinking habits, I'm talking about Catrina.\" Jack took a final swig from his beer. \"I'm not obsessed with her, I'm just keeping her in check.\" The man sniggered slightly. \"More like keeping her fresh for yourself.\" \"No...it's just I have a deal to uphold.\" Jack added, feeling a bit aggravated. \"She is a prisoner.\" \"I think it's more than that, she's turning into a nice little play thing for you to go back to...isn't she?\" \"You can't tell me what to do with my prisoners.\" The man surveyed him through his spectacles. \"I think you'll find I can, I'm doing this for your own good Jack, you don't want to mess up now...your the best in the business.\" \"Yeah...I am aren't I?\" Jack leaned back in his seat, with a smarmy look on his face. \"Don't get cocky about it, you still have some faults...like your dislike for hot chocolate...and being un-able to keep your hormones in check.\" He tapped on Jack's newspaper which was still rested on his lap. \"-I don't love her!\" A few people in the bar looked over at them, the man leaned in closer to Jack. \"Whatever...just focus on filling your quota, not getting into Catrina's pants.\" Jack pursed his lips irritably. \"I am capable of doing both.\" The man got up from his seat. \"I'm sure you can, but if your work suddenly deteriorates, then I know what's to blame...and I'm positive management will eliminate the problem.\" Jack glared angrily at him, the man then waved and exited. Soon as the door flapped shut- the beer bottle he was clutching in his right hand, shattered into pieces. His hand trickled with blood, and splitters of glass could be seen sticking out of his raw palm. Jack opened out his hand and marvelled at the site of his own blood, he then curled his digits tightly into fist, the warm fluid oozed out from between his fingers. His eyes darkened as the blood began to run backwards and drip back into his hand, meanwhile shards of the bottle, which were either on the table or scattered on the floor, flew up and began to repair and re-attach itself to form a full bottle. When Jack finally opened out his right hand, it with perfectly normal, and he held a dozen diamond sized pieces of glass which immediately shot out of his hand, and clicked into their rightful places of the bottle shell. \"-What the fuck!\" He looked up and stared darkly into the eyes of a gob smacked bar tender. The bar tender yelped as a blade suddenly sank between his ribs and into his rapidly beating heart, he was dead before he hit the ground. What happened within the following 10 seconds was chaos, on-lookers jumped up and yelled in terror, some just ran for the exits, but not a single person made it out alive. Jack casually strolled out of the bar, flexing the fingers of his right hand sinisterly. ------------------------------------------------ Catrina was bored beyond relief, she had sat with her back against the cold railings for 2 and a half hours, counting the seagulls which had landed on the roof of the helm, so far she had counted 3, this meant she was not very close to land, which brought down some hope of her getting away from the ship. She remained there most of the evening, when the stars began to appear, Catrina pulled herself up, and walked to the side door. She had become obsessed with her height, every so often she would scratch a line on a random door frame to measure herself out, and return to it later, to see if there was a change. She was always 5 ft' 6, at least 4 bits shorter than Jack. Catrina wondered back to her room. She found it had been cleaned, and there was a stack of brand new clothes on her bed. She began to sift through the pile, she held up a t-shirt which had a miniature big-bird from Sesame Street printed on it, a pair of hip hugger jeans, and a matching denim jacket. Catrina tried them on and looked in the mirror, she noticed part of her stomach was showing. \"You've got to be kidding me?\" She then turned to look at the tiny rose shaped tattoo on the base of her back. She remembered Emma had encouraged her to get one just like hers, even though she hated it. \"Damn I'm gonna have to get that removed.\" She came out of the room 10 minutes later fully dressed, she had found a pair of trainers in the stack so she put them on. The ballroom area was quiet as usual. As she reached the centre of the room, she suddenly froze in mid-step, something was nagging at the back of her mind, she looked over towards a line of tables which were curved into a 'C' shape. The middle table was somehow calling to her, Catrina approached it cautiously, she stretched out her hand - Her finger grazed the table cloth - FLASH- She saw herself running into the ballroom in panic -FLASH- her outfit changed into a long dress -FLASH- her outfit changed back to how it was, she twisted her neck round to look behind her BANG she saw herself run into the middle table. \"Aaah...ow ow ow!\" Catrina shrieked clutching her hip. -FLASH- Catrina brought her fingers away from the table, she stared blankly at it, she had come to terms with the fact she could see stuff which had already happened, but she was baffled to visualise something that had definitely 'not happened'. Normally when she visualised something, it held some significance. 'So if I don't avoid this table, I will hurt my hip...and I will be unable to escape?...Okay...that seems easy' Catrina backed away from the set of tables, and turned - her eyes caught sight of a grandfather clock, it's pendulum was ticking and swishing from side to side. 10:00 pm . ----------------------------------------------------- Jack tipped his plane sideways to turn it in the right direction. His bright blue eyes peered over his oxygen mask and out of his window, below him were the rough waves of the Bering sea. He had to go up there to take pictures of the Antonia Graza to show salvagers to lure them in, his other pictures had been lost. It wasn't about fixing the ship anymore, it was about bringing a group of gullible sinners to an isolated location, and slaughtering the lot of them - for their evil souls. He smiled at the thought of galleons of blood being spilt upon the rusty interior of his ship, his smirk dropped slightly when he suddenly pictured Catrina screaming at the top of her lungs in a pool of blood, the same type of blood which was dripping from his own hands. He rubbed his temples irritably. 'She must be out of the way...she can't see that.' 'So what...why do you care!...She going to see something just as bad when you return anyway?' '- I'm okay with her seeing that, it's just...putting Catrina and murder in the same room, is not something I had in mind!' 'Jack you've gone soft.' 'I can slaughter in front of her if I want to...I just don't want to' 'You pathetic little softy!.. .You can't even have sex with her without having...' issues !' 'FUCK OFF JACK!' He left his little box of debate, he suddenly heard a voice in his earpiece. \"Ferriman your nose is down!\" Jack looked up front, most of the horizon was took up with water, he was plummeting fast towards the sea bellow. \"Pull up Ferriman!\" \"Shit!\" He brought up the nose and found himself going into a stall, he pulled off his mask and gasped for breathe. Jack brought the craft straight, his oxygen tank had slightly jolted. He clipped his mask back on. \"Bit of a close call that was Jack.\" The other pilot said riding up along side him. \"I know, I know!\" He replied a little aggravated. \"You didn't have to come with me you know?\" \"It was a good job I had, or you would have been on your way to the sea bed right now.\" Jack rolled his eyes. They flew in the darkness for 10 minutes, Jack sighted the Antonia Graza in the distance, he heard the other pilot comment on it, but he ignored it. He then noticed the letters S.O.S a blaze on the top of the helm. Jack grinned under his mask. \"Clever girl.\" He muttered, as he soared in circles above the ship, he tore his eyes away from the blaze, and onto a figure who was tying white bed sheets to the railings. His precious. \"What the hell!...we better call back immediately.\" The other pilot said in a state of shock, he picked up another receiver attached to his control board. \"I wouldn't do that if I were you?\" Jack's deepened voice answered through the earpiece. \"Wha..?\" The man's plane suddenly jolted slightly, then it tilted to turn around, it was heading back to base on it's own accord, the man was baffled. Jack was almost having a migraine controlling the thing, he then had to also turn his own craft around and follow, while steering the other plane with his mind. \"Err...Jack I'm having trouble controlling...Jack?\" Jack grit his teeth in concentration, his lips pulled tight. When both planes were about a couple of miles from the ship, he released. The other pilot sighed. \"Pheew...what was that all about?\" He turned to his right, to look at Jack in the other plane, he remained staring straight ahead. \"Ferriman respond,...err...hello can you here me?\" He waited a moment...then - \"No one can hear you Alan.\" Jack said darkly, he slowly twisted his head around to face Alan, a dangerous look was in his eye, Alan looked back at him creeped out. \"Not - a living - soul.\" Alan stared wide eyed out of the window as Jack de-materialized - leaving the cockpit empty, he suddenly felt a cold presence behind him. -------------------------------------------- Catrina stood on the decking, looking anxiously in the direction the 2 air force planes went. It was odd, they had made no indication to her they were going to do anything. But her hopes were sky high and her fingers were tightly crossed behind her back.

Twondays after Catrina's fifth birthday...FLASHBACK Maureennand Dodge were holding their daughters hand on either side, guidingnher across the ice rink. She beamed brightly as her blades skimmednthe ice beneath her. \"Okaynokay, I think I got it.\" She said, her eyes still watching hernfeet. \"Alrightynthen!\" Dodge released his daughter's hand, Maureen exaggeratednslightly before she loosened her grip, unsure if it was safe. Catrinanslid ahead of them, her legs were still stiff and parted, and hernarms were prepared in front of her. \"Honey...Inthink you have to skate now?\" Her mother called over jokingly. Shensmiled as Catrina began to push off with one leg and glide off thenother, and vice-versa. Her daughter then turned her feet side on andnswirled in a circle to face them. \"Didnyou see what I did!\" Catrina squealed excitedly, she then turnednand began to skate off. Dodgengrinned. \"She's just like me when I was five.\" \"Indidn't know you were a girl when you were five?\" Hernhusband turned towards her bemused, then he smirked. \"You're anright smart ass ain't ya?\" He then saucily slapped her ass, whichncaused her to wobble slightly on her skates. She straightened andnreturned his ass slap twice as harder. He smiled evilly at her. \"Ooonit's a little competition now is it.\" Maureen flashed him a sexynsmile and raced off, Dodge followed closely behind her with his handsnout-stretched, trying to grab her, she laughed at his every attemptnas she circled the rink. Catrina watched them 'goofing around'nwith amusement. 'Someone'sngoing to sleep well tonight.' She thought. Her feet were stillnsliding across the ice - when she suddenly knocked into someone andnfell hard on her butt. Catrina stared in front of her at a pair ofnlegs, the person then crouched to her level - She was looking intonthe eyes of a man she saw reflected in the punch bowl at her party. \"Hellonagain Catrina.\" He exclaimed pleasantly, he brought his cold fingernalong her cheek, she flinched away from him- a reaction which madenhim grin. Jack then picked up one of her little hands and removed thenglove from it, and then he kissed it at the knuckles. \"I'll benoff then...see you tomorrow!\" He stood up straight, tucking hernglove into his coat pocket. He backed off slowly, so he wouldn'tnbreak their eye contact. Jack then disappeared behind a wall near thenedge of the ice, just as her Mum and Dad reached her either side. \"Arenyou alright sweetie?\" Maureen inquired, starting to help her up.nHer daughter remained staring in one direction, Dodge followed herneye-line to a wall, then turned back to turn her face towards him. \"Honey,nwhat are you looking at?\" She stared blankly at him, Maureen shooknher then looked at her husband very concerned. \"Maybenwe should go home?\" They both guided Catrina off the ice-rink. --------------------------------------------------------------- Catrina'snwas lying on one of the sheets she had laid out on the poop deck, thenbreeze had lightly caught her hair, and strands of it were lightlyntickling her face, her eyes fluttered open. She was looking at thenrailings of the ship, she then turned and lay on her back looking atnthe sky. Smoke was billowing upwards from the S.O.S sign from thenother night. Catrina sat up, no one had come to rescue her, and shenwas so sure it would have worked, from the moment she heard the jetnengines in the distance she had scooped up some wood, found herselfnsome matches, and headed to the helm. 'Maybe someone will see thensmoke?' Her ankle seared with pain as she struggled up, she had hadnan unlucky turn in the night in which she tripped over something andnfell awkwardly on the bottom of her leg. Over night it had healednslightly, and she could walk again, but in great agony. Catrinanwalked through the ballroom, as she did she looked at the curvedntable, noting where it was. Francesca was pacing on the stage likenshe had done on many occasions, but her posture wasn't as straightnas it normally was, it was an inelegant slouch. \"What?...I can notnbe perfecto all ze time!\" She added, after glancing in Catrina'sndirection. She then disappeared off the stage and reappeared in frontnof Catrina. \"What have I told you, to stay in your room, I amngoings to be in a lot of trouble if Jack finds out I've let you donzat mess up zere!\" Francesca gestured angrily towards the ceiling. \"Younain't the boss of me.\" Catrina walked around the Italian woman,nholding back her tears of pain as her ankle began to hurt, then shenturned around. \"Oh yes and kindly tell Jack, when he gets back,nthat I have killed myself, and my body is on it's way to the bottomnof the sea.\" She then smiled sarcastically, and took her leave. 'HappynBirthday to me, Happy birthday to me, HappynBirthday to ...Catrina, Happy Birthday to me.' Catrinanpushed the door open to her room, the smell of sweet and sour saucenreached her nose, and she immediately jumped back from the doorwaynexpecting to see Jack come from behind the door, but he didn't, sonshe slowly edged into the room with her hands up in defence. The lastnthing she needed on her birthday was a man molesting her. 'Wouldn'tnmind though?' Catrina blinked, amazed and disturbed by her ownncomment. She sat on the bed and reached for the box of noodles, shenate them singularly with her fingers, and then reached for a packetnof spring rolls. Thoughts came rushing to her as she started to opennthe box. 'If I do manage to get off this boat...where will I go?nMy mum hasn't exactly improved the situation, 'cause she's thenone that got me into this.\" Catrina rubbed her face inndissatisfaction. Even though she was angry with her mum, she feltnlike there was another side to the story which will make hernunderstand why her mum had betrayed her - maybe Jack has been lyingnto her all the time, and maybe her mum is trying to rescue her, butndoesn't know where she is? During Catrina's pause for thought,nshe hadn't realised her spring rolls where now scattered acrossnfloor. She looked down and groaned with annoyance. Then she stoopedndown and began to do the nasty task of looking at bits of fluff nownstuck to her meal. Catrina stuck her top half under the bed to looknfor the remaining rolls. The covers fell around her on the outskirtsnof the bed, as she grabbed two of her rolls. The temperature suddenlyndropped in the room, as she shivered - her breath came out in littlenwisps of steam. She slunk from under the bed, and stood up, as shentossed the rolls on her bed her gaze came to a familiar navy coatnhanging on the bed post, her eyes widened and she straightened. \"Jack?\"nShe could almost feeling him smiling. \"Yesnhoney, I'm home...and what a nice thing to come back to; a cosynroom with a nice ass sticking out from under the bed. \" His silkynvoice said, a fair distance away from her, Catrina nervously turnednto see Jack starting to settle down in an arm chair propped upnagainst the door, he swung his long legs over the arm, he was wearingnjeans with a black jacket. \"What...no hug, no kiss on the cheek,nno sitting on my lap and asking about my day?\" He put on a fakenhurt look, then his lips curled into a sinister smile. \"Hownabout a slap round the face for returning?\" She smiled sadisticallynat him before sitting down on her bed. Jack raised his eyebrows,nimpressed out her calm she was at his presence, which wasn't goingnto last very long if he could help it. \"Yournnot too old to get a spank for cheekiness you know?\" Catrina pullednthe blanket over her lap and shifted uncomfortably. Jacknstrengthened his gaze on her as he brought his legs from the arm ofnthe chair to the floor, where he then stretched them out in front ofnhim and crossed them, so his posture was of a slinky cat. \"I havensomething for you in my pocket...do you want to know what it is?\"nHe leaned back into his chair, to observe her perplexed expression. \"No,nbut I know you're going to tell me anyway.\" \"Rightnyou are love, in my pocket is a letter for you.\" Catrina sat upnstraight, her needingful eyes shifted to his breast pocket. \"Who'snit from?\" Her voice was quiet and remained staring at the pocket.nJack pushed his ear forward with his finger. \"I said who's itnfrom!\" \"Indon't know I haven't opened it, I'm not nosy.\" Jack said,nentwining his fingers and resting them on his stomach. \"CannI have it?\" \"Yes.\"nJack looked upwards slightly, as if not bothered. Catrinanrolled her eyes. \"Well aren't you going to hand it to me?\" \"Err...no,nI thought I would let you get it for yourself.\" Jack licked thenbottom of his top set of teeth. Catrina jumped up and with her fistsnclenched. \"Ifnyou think I'm gonna come over there you must be bloody joking!\" \"Wellnyou're not going to get it then.\" He smiled and folded his arms. Catrinantilted her head to the side. \"There isn't a letter in your pocketnis there?\" \"Ohnbut there is.\" Jack pursed his lips, and waited, cruelly watchingnher. His eyes dropped to her flat stomach which was on show and hencould just see her hip bone jutting out from the top of her low cutnjeans, he could just imagine running his fingers along it, maybe evennhis lips. He brought his blue eyes to her startling greens, she wasnscratching the back of her neck irritably. Catrina was looking at thenhollow of his neck, it was pale, slender, and... darn nice to looknat. ' What'snwith this guys neck, it's just a neck for Christ's sake, Robert hasnone!' Catrina looked up, and was taken aback to find Jack stillnlooking at her questioningly. She clenched her fists and stalked overntowards him, and stood directly in front of him. She bent her backnslightly, and relentlessly stuck her hand in his breast pocket, hernhand immediately came back out again and she took a step back.n\"There's nothing in there!\" She said heatedly, feeling stupid.nJack gave her a lopsided grin, as his eyes focused on her. \"That'snbecause it's in my trouser pocket sweetheart.\" Catrina starednwide-eyed at him, she gritted her teeth. There was no way of hernputting her hands anywhere near his ass or even his thigh. \"I'mnwaiting.\" Catrinanhesitated, then her hand darted forward and she thrust it into thensplit at the side, the pocket itself came round to the front of hisnjeans. She could feel his warm hip which made her quake as shensearched. TonJack it was better then he thought, it wasn't just the thrill ofnher finding what he had left in his pocket, but her small handsnwriggling about his hip and his thigh, so close to his member. Hisneyes rolled and fluttered closed, he began to buck his hips towardsnher hand groaning and chuckling. Catrina looked at him bewildered,nshe tried to hurry her search. \"JACK...QUITnIT!\" The tip of her fingers caught an edge of some sort of paper,nshe brushed her thumb over the surface, it felt laminated and therenwas something squashed inside it. As her fingers enclosed around it,nshe could feel the whole packet. Her eyes rounded and she leapt back,nflinging her hand out in the process. \"YOU TRICKED ME!\" Catrinanhalf screamed at him, and he in turn laughed at her. \"Indidn't lie, I said it was a letter.\" Jack said, keeping hisnamused tone. \"I just didn't tell you it was a French letter.\" \"Jack,nthat was a condom.\" \"Samenthing.\" \"Whyndo you do these things!\" Catrina gave him a disturbed look. Jacknraised his eyebrows. \"Why?\" His lips straightened, as he pushednhimself up from the chair to gain height, a smile flickered on andnoff his face as he noticed her backing away from his power. \"Donyou want me to show you why?\" She nervously shook her head, henreleased his eerie laugh which made her skin crawl. His expressionnsuddenly went serious and he took a step towards her, knowingnperfectly well she was going to leg it. He could tell, when her eyesndarted to the side he knew she was planning an escape route, and whennshe stopped breathing it was like a starting trigger to get hernmoving. 'Whatnis he waiting for?' Catrina didn't blink, she stopped inhalingnand took off - he was ready for her, and he enveloped her around thenwaist and lifted her slightly as he brought her backwards towards hisnchest, she kicked out wildly, her ankle began to throb with pain. Shenthen screamed 'JACK' at the top of her voice. She began hittingnat his arms which were tightly sealed around her waist, he thennturned himself around and sat down on the arm chair, bringing Catrinanwith him, so she was sitting on his lap. She continued to struggle,ntrying to heave herself up from his lap, but his strong arms held herndown on his thighs like a seat belt. \"OhnI'm getting sick of this.\" She growled. \"Thennstop struggling.\" \"No...Inwant you to let go!\" \"Can'tnyou just let me-.\" \"No...Inwant to be as far away from you as possible.\" \"Catrina.\"nJack warned. \"-nJust let me go!\" \"Inknow you want it.\" He then whispered, jerking her further onto hisnlap. \"NonI don't, now release me, you're squishing my liver!\" \"Youndo want it, you just need a little boost of something.\" \"Younbetter not drug me up!\" She rocked from side to side trying tonloosen Jack's grip. \"Catrinanstop it.\" She continued to rock. This wasn't improving thensituation, as Jack stared into her sleek hair, he could feel himselfngoing harder with every jolt she made. Catrina froze after releasingnshe was stimulating something underneath her and began to heavenherself forward away from him. Jacknknew she wasn't going to give up. 'If I could just keep hernstill, I might...just might have a chance.' He pulled his left armntighter around Catrina's abdomen, just below her breasts, and thennhe raised his right arm. \"Letngo of me!\" She protested while trying to lean forward, Jack 'outnof her sight' was manifesting a purple orb in his hand, his facendeep with concentration. The purple orb then sunk back into his palm,nhe brought his hand up in front of her face. \"Looknat my hand.\" Soon as her eyes focused on his palm, she felt herselfngo drowsy and yet she wasn't falling asleep, pink began to obscurenher vision, and her movement speed was terribly slow. Catrina couldnhear the blood pounding in her ears. Her sense of touch wasnincredibly strong, every brush of fabric, or strand of hair was verynsensitive to her skin. Jack's hand began to run up and downnCatrina's arms, she didn't know why she couldn't stop him, shenwasn't paralysed, she just felt incapable. Hernhead began to drop slowly forwards, just before her chin touched hernchest, Jack brought his hand to her forehead to steady her, and hentilted it back to rest on his shoulder. Catrina shivered as his warmnpeppermint breath blew gently on the side of her neck, she wasntotally unaware that her Iris was gradually turning pink. Jack rannhis lips over the soft flesh of her neck and shoulder which werenexposed, taking in her voluptuous feminine scent. He smiled inwardlynas he sensed her body leisurely melting against his. Catrina'snvision had started to go cloudy and crimson, she was too aroused tonbe angry at her hormones for betraying her.n' Got...to...stop...this,...can't...stop,...won't...stop,...don't...stop.' Her mind was pushing aside her pride and dignity, just to fit innpure lust. A small moan escaped from the depth of her throat as Jacknlips began to pinch little bits of her flesh on her neck. Thensun blazed through the porthole on their now sweat speckled skin,nJack had pinched the skin on her neck until it had flushed, and henremained gently caressing her arms, while biting her ear. ' Whonneeds the plan now...when I can do this?' He thought. 'Mustnremember if I touch her lips the magic will end...and thenmanifestation will brake.' Catrina,nwith her head still tilted to one side, had totally lost touch withnreality and found herself rubbing her upper legs sensually, then hernhands slid up to caress her breasts, she was smiling and humming withnpleasure, the spell had totally kicked in. Jack eyed her puzzled overnher shoulder, with a little hint of desire. ' God how I lovenher...'. He froze and sat up straight. '...Thatncame out wrong.' He shrugged it off and got up, bringingnCatrina with him, she was still in a funny state, she had turnednaround and was hugging him with her head firmly pressed against hisnchest, a dreamy smile was plastered on her face. She had stuck hernhands into his back pockets of his jeans. Jack had found himselfnbacking her up towards the bed, soon as her legs hit the bed-frame henpushed her back onto the mattress, just before he was about to lie onntop of her, he stopped. 'This isn't right, she doesn't evennknow what she's doing, and when the manifestation does finally comento an end she will probably remember nothing, and then I'd havengained nothing.' He stood himself up and looked down at her.nHer brown hair fanned out under her head on the mattress and her eyesnwere pink and resembled an albino, which he wasn't aware of being anside effect for lust orbs. ' When I do get round to fucking hernsenseless, I want her to be herself and fully aware.' He thenncorrected himself as he tilted his head to look deeper into her eyes. 'I mean when I'm making sweet sweet love to her,...itnwould be fun if she made the first move, then I would be in controlnduring the whole performance.' Jack curled his lips up into annevil smile, he dragged himself out of thought and noticed Catrinantrying to undo his zipper -He jumped back. \"Backnoff sister, your not ready for the pleasure package yet!\" He slowlynbacked towards the door, pointing at her warningly, as if he werenmaking a dog stay. Jack stopped at the armchair realising he hadnforgot something, he made his way back in front of her and crouchednto her level, he then gave her a wet kiss on the lips, almostnimmediately afterwards he felt her jerk off him, and then a handncollided with his cheek. Even though his face stung like mad, and thenlook he was getting from her was sour, he couldn't help but grinnand salute before pushing the chair aside and exiting the room,nlocking the door behind him. --------------------------------------------------------- Dodgencoughed and spluttered, as his wife lit some black candles. \"Isnthis really necessary?\" \"Yes,nit's the only thing I can think of doing?\" Maureen held out anpiece of chalk for dodge to take. \"Now remember it's a 5 pointednstar, and make sure you don't draw the St Davis cross.\" Hernhusband nodded, and began to drag the white stone along the basementnfloor. \"Ifnwe can somehow contact... 'the other world', maybe they couldntell us how to kill the demon, then we can head out to Alaska.\" \"-nAnd get our daughter back.\" Dodge put down the chalk and got up.n\"I'm going to find my gun.\" \"Whyndo you want a gun for? That won't work...you even told me yourselfnit doesn't kill him.\" \"Itnwill slow him down, but just maybe if I aim for the head it mightnkill him.\" \"Ohnalright then.\" She watched Dodge doubtfully, as he hastily made hisnway out of the basement. His head appeared around the door as she litnanother candle. \"Anothernthought...does this mean Jack might appear in the room?\" \"Indunno, when the woman did it she was trying to focus on him, andnthink she was kind of a receptacle for possession, so if we don'tnfocus on him-he won't show.\" She cocked an eyebrow perplex at hernhusband, still trying to come to terms with what she had said. \"Donyou even know what you just said, or what we're supposed to do?\" \"Nope,nnotta clue.\" Dodgenshifted uncomfortably. \"I don't think I want to do this any more,nI think this sorta thing is for the professionals- and us...we'rennot exactly professionals. When we're doing it- it's callednmeddling.\" Maureen gave him 'do you have a point look?' before crossing her legs. \"I mean, don't we have to benwitches...or something?\" \"Itnlooked pretty simple from where I was in the house, so let's justnget on with it.\" She then picked up a fattish candle, and held itnon her knee. Maureen did a little shiver with her shoulders, andnreleased a shuddered breath, her eyes slowly closed. The room wasnsilent -Maureen squinted one of her eyes to look at Dodge. \"Wellnaren't you going to join me?\" \"Ohnyou wanted me to do that, I though you were having a seizure.\"nDodge unfolded his arms, and settled down opposite her. He copied hernactions and sat quietly with his eyes closed. \"Wenwish to communicate with the...err...'other world'.\" Maureennsaid. \"Maybenyou should say limbo?\" Maureennnodded slightly with her eyes still closed. \"It would be nice tontalk to someone in limbo.\" She called, her husband sniggered. \"-Itnwould be nice?\" \"What!\" \"You'vengot to command to see them, be more authoritive. You can't saynstuff like; it would be nice, or if you not to busy?\" \"Ohnshut up, I'm being polite.\" \"MaybenI should do the call out?\" Mike asked, swapping his candle hand.nHis wife squinted at him suspiciously.\" Just...go along with menplease.\" \"Gonon then.\" She replied irritably. Mikencleared his throat. \"Hi I'm Mike Dodge, this is my wife Maureennand we wish to speak to someone that has some connection to the othernworld, and has some knowledge on evil, without actually being evil.\" Silence-n Maureen had opened her eyes, and was glancing about the roomnwearily. Her husband watched intently as his candle began to flicker.nA draft lightly blew through the room, causing both of them tonshiver. \"It's a little bit breezy in here isn't it?\" \"-Ssshhh,nwe might lose touch.\" They both eyed their candles as they allndimmed to the same dullness. \"Isnsomething supposed to happen at this point?\" Maureennsighed before answering. \"I dunno...the same things arenoccurring.\" Suddenlynthe tools hanging on the walls of the basement began to drop of theirnhooks and clatter on the work benches underneath, the floor rumblednbeneath them, Maureen jumped up and ran into the arms of her husbandnfor comfort. They stood in the centre of the room holding each other,nwhile listening to the lone window rattle in it's pane. \"Indon't believe it...it's actually working!\" Maureen bellowednover the deafening noise. The candles rocked and rolled on the coldnshaky floor, trailing drips of hot wax behind them. \"Mikenlook at the pentagram!\" Maureen squawked in his ear, he spun aroundnto look in his wife's direction. The chalk drawn pentagram had anhuge crack tearing through it's core, the crack grew longer andnlonger, then it split and opened up into a cavern. Maureen forcefullynpulled Dodge back from the crumbling mass of rock which was fallingnin ripples towards them. The earthquake abruptly stopped, leaving thencouple standing there staring down a huge hole in the basement floor,ngob smacked. Dodgenbroke the silence. \"Well I'll say that was a good start!... Nownwho wants decaf?\" He began to walk towards the stairway, butnMaureen yanked on the scruff of his neck. \"Let'sngo down there.\" She said calmly. \"-BoynI knew that was coming.\" \"Wellnif you scared you can stay here, and I'll go down.\" \"Indidn't say I was chicken, I'm just a little unsure how far itngoes and where it goes. It could be the portal to hell for all Inknow!\" Dodge kicked a nearby rock down the hole and it immediatelynclattered at the bottom, they both stared downwardly, surprised. \"Thatnhas got to be 10 ft tops Mike, so it's not a long climb, anyway,nyou asked for it to be a non-evil source...so I don't think it'snthe portal to hell.\" She crept around the outside of the cavern tonreach a few boxes under a few work benches, and she returned with twontorches, and a load of climbing rope. Maureen tied one end of thenrope securely on the banister of the stairs, then shucked the slackndown hole. \"Okay I have decided you stay here, and I'll gondown...no buts, I just want to make sure Catrina has someone to looknfor her just in case something happens to me down there-.\" \"Aha...youndo think there's something evil down there!\" \"Non- I'm worried about injuring myself, or worse...killing myselfndown there.\" \"Therenmight not be anything down there in the first place, it could be justna ditch.\" Maureen turned her flash light on and pointed it down thenhole, it shone on the opening of a tunnel on one side. Maureennsmiled approvingly at her husband, and gripped a piece of rope. \"OhnI think I'll get somewhere.\" \"Wellnwhere ever you're going I'm coming too, we're in thisntogether.\" Dodge grabbed a piece of rope nearest to the ledgenbehind her. \"Werenyou listening to what I said earlier?...If something happens to me Inwant you to be able to rescue our daughter using a different method!\" \"Nothingnwill happen to you 'cause I'll be your support, I'll nevernleave your side...because I love you.\" His wife turnedntowards him with a weak smile hitched on her face. \"Younhaven't said that in ages.\" Mikenstared back at her. \"I have, I've told you manyntimes...haven't I?\" \"-No...Inwould say it to you and you would say Dido, you know, like from thenfilm 'Ghost'.\" Maureen pushed past him and lowered herselfndown, using the bit of rope she was still holding. Dodge watchedndumbfounded. \"'Ghost'nI like that film.\" He crouched down and daggled his legs over thenside of the cavern. \"Okay...you win, I'll stay, but don'tnforget this.\" He lobbed her a walkie-talkie which she caught. \"Aaa...thengood old days.\" ---------------------------------------------------------- Catrinanpaced the room in panic. She knocked the side of her head with hernknuckles, struggling to remember what had happened in the past tennminutes. All she could remember was being pulled onto Jack's lap,ngoing drowsy, then falling into a half sleep -feeling slightly happynabout herself, her core ached badly, then the feeling was suddenlyndragged out of her, and her eyes came open, to find herself sittingnon her bed with Jack's lips on hers. Not the most worst experiencenshe must admit, but the idea of not knowing what he could of done tonher in the ten minutes before where she hadn't been aware, made hernfeel panic stricken -lost and vulnerable. ' Hencould have just moved me to the bed, then kissed me...' Hernexpression was blank, then a disgusted look slid across her face. 'Jack wouldn't just move me and do nothing...unless he wasngoing to do something and I woke up before he could begin.' Shendragged her trainers across the floor, lost in thought while bitingnher nails nervously. She stopped abruptly after catching a glimpse ofnher reflection. Her hair was dishevelled at the back, meaning shenmust have been lying down at some point. Catrina bit her thumb nailnin frustration as she stroked her hair down to neaten it. She pullednin her inner muscle to sense check it, it felt intact - some slightnrelief came to her well being, and she smiled weakly at herself innthe mirror. ------------------------------------------------------------- \"I'venchanged my mind.\" Francesca jumped as Jack strode into the room,nher company disappeared. Francescanturned around to greet him, but immediately took a step back -nslightly freaked out. \"What!\"nJack exclaimed, glaring at her. \"What'snwrong wiz your eyes?\" \"What'snwrong with my eyes?...You've known me for over 50 years andnyou ask me what's wrong with my eyes, Jesus Christ!\" Francescanindicated to a mirror on the wall, he turned to look. Hisneyes where pinkish, albino pinkish. \"What the hell!\" \"Usednany mageek lately?\" Jackntwisted away from the mirror. \"Yes...a lust orb, but I've neverngot red eyes from it before.\" \"Nownwhen was ze last time you usings lust orb - oh ci, who could forget,nze girl of 79.\" \"Haven'tnI already told you not to mention that!\" Jack swung his arm aroundnto grab her throat but soon as his hand opened out wide - a huge firenball emitted from his hand and flew past a startled Francesca, andninto wall behind her. Francesca stared at the scorched wall inndisbelief, then she steadily twisted her head round to look at anfrozen Jack. Apart from his pursed lips, the rest of his face held nonexpression, and his hand which had released the fireball, stillnremained up in front of him. Francescanbroke the deafening silence. \"Err...zat was very...interesting.\" \"Hm...yeah,nand not to mention cool.\" Jack added, he scratched his headnirritably. \"Erm...I guess this means I've been promoted a littlenearlier than I expected?\" His brows furrowed. Francescanhalf smiled. \"Congratulations...I guess?\" Jackndidn't look pleased at all, his eyes narrowed, making the Italiannwoman shake with fear. He rubbed his temples impatiently. \"Fuck,nthis is gonna totally screw everything.\" \" 'owncan it?\" \"Firstnof all my dear, I'll probably have to hand in this ship, and allnthe souls with it.\" \"Doesnzat mean I will be free?\" \"Nonit means you will go to hell.\" Jack began to pace. \"Item two, Inwill no longer be killing sinners to collect souls, instead I get tonbe frisky with anything that moves to collect souls!\" \"-ErrnJack?...I still can't see ze negateeve side.\" \"I'mngetting to that, you see...being an incubus...while I'm gettingnfrisky with whoever...I will be at the same time sucking out theirnsouls, which will eventually kill them!\" Francescanface remained blank, he rolled his eyes. \"Sonthat means no more playing around with Catrina...No more plan A,nand come to mention it plan B has gone out the window!\" He foldednhis arms angrily, his nostrils flared. \"Whyncan't you play around with Catrina? It would save you time andneffort, because she is already here.\" \"Indon't want to fucking kill her!\" \"-Whonze hell are you!\" She exclaimed throwing her arms up in the air. \"Someonenwho is keeping a bargain you stupid bitch!\" He brought his facendangerously close to hers. Francesca opened her mouth to respond, butnclosed it again, muted with terror, she vanished. Jacknsighed heavily and straightened. He slowly rolled his head on hisnneck, he could almost hear his trapped souls and co-workersnwhispering. 'Obsession.' Henknew he had been given promotion early, either as a sample of what henwill get if he completed all his work, or to test him to see if henwas obsessed. Okay, maybe he was a little obsessed, but the mainnreason was to uphold the deal,...Catrina being dead is not a verynlong-lasting suffering for the mother, after all she did ask for morenthan what she deserved. Jack peered in the mirror his eyes werengradually returning to their pale blue. Thinking back to when he wasnwith Catrina, she had stirred him real bad, and if he hadn'tnstopped, she would probably be dead now. He grit his teeth heatedly. ' Allnwork and no play makes Jack a very dull boy. All work and no playnmakes Jack a very dull boy. All work and no play makes Jack a veryndull boy. All work and no play makes Jack a very dull boy. All worknand no play makes Jack a very dull boy. All work and no play makesnJack a very dull boy. All work and no play makes Jack a very dullnboy. All work and no play makes Jack a very dull boy. All work and nonplay makes Jack a very dull boy. All work and no play makes Jack anvery dull boy.' Luckilynhe had brought some company with him, a small group of bag packers -nfresh out of college. All he needed to do was make sure they don'tnwonder deeper into the ship, and that Catrina stays in her room.[Chapter 10] Please be patient with the long scenes -I was going to include a little something in this chapter (at the end) but decided to put it in the next. I prefer limiting chapters up to 12 pages. The Sunlight streamed through the blinds in Mrs Marguiles's classroom. The desks were set in neat rows in the middle of the room, and every desk was labelled with the pupil's name. Every child was present and was either beaming brightly or resting their chins on their hands bored. \"Ships and Boats...used since the beginning of civilisation...\" A red headed girl raised her hand. \"Err miss...aren't we supposed to be designing war posters?\" \"Yes Alice we should, but I've decided we should do something a little different for today...we've made lots of posters over the past few days and now I think it's time we take a break from it all.\" The children looked at her shocked. \"-I know we're in the middle of a war...but I think America will forgive me for just this lesson.\" \"As I was saying...Ships and boats, used since the beginning of civilisation...a man made object for transporting people and cargo across rivers, seas, and oceans.\" Mrs Marguiles paced in front of the blackboard while hitting a ruler into the palm of her hand. \"You're probably thinking...why is she telling me all of this, this is supposed to be an art lesson. Well children I believe before we make something, we have to know it's origins, and most importantly, how it works? Because I don't just want you to build a boat out of lollipop sticks...I want you to be the boat.\" Several sniggers erupted around the classroom, the teacher rapped the ruler against her desk for silence. \"Now if you please...turn to page 55 in your books.\" The sound of pages being turned filled the room as the children in unison flicked through their text books. \"I would like some readers...?\" Not single pupil spoke or raised their hand. \"Okay?...How about.\" Mrs Marguiles cast her metre stick across the class, pondering over the many nervous faces at each desk. \"Amy...would you do the honours?\" A girl's brown skirt rustled slightly as she stood up from her desk with her book held close to her face. \"For thousands of years, people have wanted to move on the water. They have used boats and ships to fish, to travel, to explore, to trade or to fight. Throughout the time that people have been building boats and ships, they have made changes to them, to make travelling on the water easier, faster and safer.\" Meanwhile a chubby blonde boy slowly opened his desk to pull out a folded piece of card, after checking the teacher wasn't looking, he passed it to another boy on his left. \"It's the latest.\" The boy half opened it. A smile slid onto his face, he closed it. \"Piiisst...Jacob.\" He whispered, Jacob's ears twitched, and he brought his hand behind his back and opened it, his friend slipped the card into his hand. He brought it in front of his eyes. \"Wow she's pretty...what's her name?\" Jacob asked, keeping his voice low. \"Betty Grable.\" Jacob glanced at the teacher. She was sitting at her desk with the book in front of her, following what Amy was reading. \"...No-one knows exactly when the first boat was invented. Long ago, people probably discovered that they could keep themselves afloat by clinging onto fallen logs or bundles of reed. Gradually, they learnt how to hollow out logs to make rafts. Dug-outs and rafts meant that people could cross water without getting wet. They could also carry things and animals.\" Jacob leaned over to pass the pin-up picture to a small boy on the other desk, who was doodling on the inside cover of his text book. \"Jack...take a look at this.\" Jack took the picture in his hand, looked at it and gave it back to him uninterested. \"I'm seven Jake, we still have another 6 years until we should start taking an interest in girls.\" \"Oh come off it...we have to be prepared for high school.\" \"We have plenty of time before -\" \"JACK BE QUIET!\" Mrs Marguiles ordered after spotting him. Jack's little aristocratic face held an icy coldness as he pursed his lips and focused on his book. The voices in his head had started up again, they weren't just anybody's voices, they were his own. The dark side of his mind - not entirely a different person, but another half of him which tells him to do stuff. He wasn't a skitso, or somebody that liked to create imaginary friends...Jack was just someone that had rash thoughts. But when they began to corrupt him, they weren't just rash thoughts, they were sick fantasies which he believed he had to accomplish. A misty haze had clouded his mind as he stared uncomprehendingly at the book. Amy's voice had began to drift further away, as he was sucked into his own little world. 'Time to kill Jack, kill everybody... no the teachers.' Jack smiled inwardly. Then a bright light took up his entire vision, the light faded, and he saw himself wondering into a science lab. He reached up for a bottle of disinfectant sitting on the top shelf. Then his little hand pawed through a tray of test tubes, he selected one and slipped it into a holder, Jack placed a funnel at the top of the test tube. With both of his small his hands he held the bottle and clumsily poured some disinfectant into the funnel which then filtered into the test tube below. He put a cork in the test tube and slipped it into his dungaree pocket. Another blinding light flashed before him, he jumped and found he was sitting at his desk, Jack could still feel the weight of the disinfectant filled test tube in his pocket. Later...recess came, the teacher filed out the children in lines to the play ground. Jack went inside, pretending he was going to the bathroom, but instead he snuck into the teachers lounge, he stood on the tips of his toes as he poured the test tube content into the staff teapot. ------- Jack slowly opened his eyes, he was staring at a rusty ceiling. He sat up feeling terribly weak, he had just recently fed and it felt like he hadn't, he pushed the corpse off his bed and stood up. Jack caught sight of his reflection, his eyes were slowly returning to their unearthly blue. He took a glance at the dead woman lying naked on the floor, her skin was deathly pale and her eyes remained wide open, but her expression was blank. Even though she had spent the last few moments of her life screaming her head off in terror. A few lumps were protruding under her skin around her neck, from her fractured vertebrae. During her struggle, he had attempted to silence her, but in the process he had sharply twisted her neck back at a dodgy angle. The woman had panicked because she had felt like something was being drained from her after her orgasm, and she didn't fail to notice Jack's eyes which had slowly turned crimson. Jack sat down on the bed. 'The other bag packers are going to wonder where their friend is...could just say she's using the bathroom, no...or else they'll come in and use it...Catrina could be found or heard.' He leaned forward with his head in his hand, he could feel himself getting weaker again. He hated being an Incubus, it wasn't to what it was all cracked up to be. Jack was still worried about how he was going to cope with Catrina. He knew he wasn't going to be able to have any fun with her, if he touched her something could start. 'How am I supposed to keep her in check with out touching her?' He needed to eliminate the bag packers, and take their souls. They had to be on the boat because it's the only way to keep them in one place, a place separated from the rest of the world. The massacre in the bar had been pointless, he had claimed every single persons soul in that Alaskan bar, but they would remain there, so it would be harder to for him to control them, or transport them to hell. Jack glanced at his watch 5:00 pm. He scratched his scalp and yawned tiredly. ----------------------------------------------------------------- Maureen had been walking down the same bit of tunnel for 10 minutes, every bit of natural light had gone, and her torch shone brightly on the ground below. She brushed her hand over the walls either side of her as she walked, the rock was rough and crumbly. 'What if there's gas down here?' She hadn't taken any precautions with her. Suddenly the earth above her head began to shake violently, she shone her light upwards worried about a cave in, she had taken her eyes off the path ahead of her and then - drop. Maureen yelped as she tumbled down a steep slope, she landed with a thud at the bottom. When she raised her head, her eyes came to a fire burning magnificently in a grate a few yards away from her, she groaned as she lifted herself off the floor. \"Mrs Dodge.\" Maureen jumped in surprise when a dark figure stepped out of the corner and into the fire light. \"Do I know you?\" Maureen edged away little, still taking in her surroundings. \"I wouldn't say you know me, but I know you...and over half the population of the Night World know about you.\" The person lowered their hood, thick black waves of hair tumbled out over a pair of pointed ears, their dazzling purple eyes focused on Maureen's shocked stare. \"Permit me to introduce myself, I am Pavlov, Priestess of the Night World.\" Maureen stood still, gaping at her. \"It's not as impressive as it sounds, for really I am but a mere mistress of the Priest...which is kind of -\" \" -Were you expecting me?\" Maureen butted in impatiently. \"Ah-well, when we heard you and your husband call, we opened up our little porthole...well I did, all I needed to do was wait, and here you are!\" \"So are you going to help me?\" \"Sorry... no can do honey, helping is not the type of thing I do.\" \"Well then what is the type of thing you do, who's side are you actually on?\" \"I don't take sides Mrs Dodge.\" Pavlov placed her arms behind her back, and walked about slightly. \"I'm somebody that stands on the boarder and observes the goings on of both worlds. So far I'm a bit confused with your daughters...situation.\" Maureen stiffed. \"Situation.\" Pavlov tilted her head to the side and smiled. \"Yes, it seems to me she is a cross between being in great danger and being perfectly safe at the moment.\" Maureen's mouth had gone dry, she bit her lip in anticipation. \"C-can you explain to me why?\" \"Certainly my dear.\" Pavlov waved her hand. Maureen heard a swishing sound, followed by bash in the back of the knee, she yelped as she fell back into a chair. The priestess had made her way to the fire place, her arm rested casually on the mantel. \"Ever since management noticed Jack was getting obsessed with Catrina - Oh...you do know who I mean by Management don't you?\" Maureen nodded in response. \"Well management thought if they gave Jack promotion early he would take more of an interest in his new powers and finish off Catrina like that.\" The priestess snapped her fingers as she said the last two words. Maureen dug her fingers angrily into the arm chair. \"But he didn't, instead he accepted his new powers with remorse and is at the moment concerned about Catrina's safety.\" Epps furrowed her eyebrows and stood up. \"Concerned...that's good isn't it? He won't hurt Catrina.\" The priestess held a disapproving look on her face. \"Yes- I thought you would like that, but management don't. Jack is still working on his new job, but not enough.\" \"-Because of Catrina? \"Yes, know listen.\" Pavlov flicked her hand out and an invisible hand knocked Maureen back into her seat. \"Catrina could be disposed of by management, if that happens, you won't be happy and Jack won't be happy. He would be so angry he might do something such as; give up his job or worse, turn against the big bad.\" \"Woaw...Catrina is at the centre of a little war in the night world, wouldn't the big bad just take away his new powers...if they know that's bothering him.\" Pavlov walked towards a table which appeared next to Maureen's chair. \"They would - but they can't just get rid of them just like that...it's time consuming process. Also they believe if they give it time, Jack will eventually let his feelings dominate his conscience, and kill Catrina with his new powers.\" She waved her hand over the table and two glasses containing a see-through orangey liquid appeared on it's surface. \"What sort of powers do you speak of?\" Maureen questioned taking a glass which Pavlov was now offering her. \"Well fire ball manifestations, and a thing I like to call 'night night glances'\" Maureen shifted uncomfortably, Pavlov took a sip of her whisky before continuing. \"It's all within a standard incubus package.\" Maureen stiffed -time had stopped around her and she felt totally cold. She swallowed back tears of fear and sadness. Her eyes looked up to see Pavlov looking down at her questioningly. \"By the look on your face I assume you know what an incubus is.\" Maureen nodded and chucked her whisky down her throat, she placed the glass on the arm and fondled with the rim as she spoke. \"My baby...my angel, imprisoned on a ship with a...\" Maureen felt lose for words. \"-Sex maniac?\" \"No.\" \"-Pervert?\" \"No -well yes, but.\" \"-Nice pervent?\" \"Can you stop finishing off my sentences!...What I was going to say from the start was a sexually frustrated Jack.\" \"-Hm better.\" Pavlov nodded while pursing her lips. \"You know what I think?\" She placed her butt on the arm of the chair. Maureen slid over to one side not giving her a glance. \"What?\" \"I think this is the perfect time to rescue her.\" Pavlov ran a hand through her black hair, and then flipped it over shoulder. \"It seems to me he doesn't want to hurt her.\" \"But he could - just one mistake could harm her, and if he denies what he wants and gets sidetracked...Catrina will be killed by management, and if I go and rescue her...I'll be killed by Jack.\" Maureen leaned forward and put her head in her hands. \"Ouch, when you put it like that, the rescue does seem a little scandalous.\" \"-Scandalous...but doable.\" Pavlov gave a little nod and went over to the fire place to warm her hands. Maureen watched her with ease, with a thoughtful gaze pressed on her features. \"Are you going to help me?\" Pavlov smiled inwardly and turned towards her company. \"I don't do help remember...I just pass on information...or give advice.\" \"-The last time I looked, to pass on information and giving advice was helping.\" Epps heaved herself out the chair. \"Is there anything else you can tell me which will help me on my future journey.\" The black haired woman pouted her lips attentively, while swishing the remaining droplets of her whisky in the glass. \"Nothing springs to mind.\" Maureen stared at her strangely as she slowly backed away and turned to go back the way she came. --------------------------------------------------------- Catrina shook at random as she lay curled up in a ball on her bed, she had the eerie feeling something bad was going to happen. She rolled over onto her back, and tilted her head back so she was looking upside down at the porthole - Life was passing her by and she had no way of stopping it or changing it. Catrina hastily pushed herself up, her hair cascaded around her shoulders as she narrowed her eyes on the door. 'Probably locked.' Her feet went over the side of the bed and onto the floor, she walked towards the door and tugged on the handle, it remained stuck. She pouted her lips and rolled her hips round as she turned and headed to the porthole. A sigh escaped her lips, as she contemplated her hatred for Jack once again...then right on schedule a sudden pang in her stomach would follow. Normally she would get these when she was either thinking of what her and Robert might get up to in the back of a car in lovers lane, or the result of a bad breakfast burrito. 'Quit it with the sappy thinking, and get down to business.' Catrina balled her hands up into fists, either she was going to knock the door down or barricade it. Catrina grabbed the armchair and pulled it away from the door and then with all her might, rammed it into the door. The outer wood splintered inward, she pulled the chair back and pushed it forward again to get the desired effect, after a great crack...a hole had ripped through the door, big enough for her to climb through. She carefully stepped through and trotted down the corridor. Catrina hadn't yet decided where she wanted to go, but she knew where she shouldn't go...firstly not down the stairway and secondly not into the room she believed to be Jack's. Her womanly intuition - common knowledge told her never walk into a room which belongs to a man who could have indecently assaulted you. 'Well duh.' 'Well I can fight him off if I have to.' Catrina found herself laughing at her own statement, and put down her tightly clenched fists which she had unintentionally held in front of her. What was she kidding trying to fight off Jack, she was a half developed woman, and he was a fully grown man...with a nice neck. She stalled as her thought caught up with her, after mentally kicking herself she continued down the length of the corridor. Suddenly without warning a door opened behind her further down the hall, she frightfully jumped around, her hand had came up over her mouth. A dim light was shining through the open doorway, and no one was between the frame. Catrina nervously backed away, hoping against hope she would have managed to turn the corner before Jack or anybody could come into view. She was too busy concentrating on the door to notice Jack standing behind her, holding an open bed blanket as if waiting to abduct her. A secret smile played on his lips. 'This is going to be a lot of fun.' He waited patiently as she slowly backed up, her arm briefly touched the sheet and just before she could jump away, the blanket enshrouded her - she was wrapped up like a sausage roll. Catrina's cry was muffed slightly as he scooped her up and carried her back to her room. She was terrified of the tight space, and the lack of air, so Catrina fidgeted helplessly in his arms. What made it worst was she could feel herself getting turned on by the warmth radiating off his body on the other side of the sheet. Her ears picked up his shallow breathing, 'Surely he wasn't having trouble carrying her.' She felt her bum touch the floor, and the tightness around her waist disappear, Catrina raked her dishevelled self out of the heap of cotton. \"Jack can't you get me from one place to another with manha-.\" She noticed he was just standing in the doorway over her with his eyes closed. Catrina pushed the hair out of her face while adding \"What are you doing?\" Jack took a sharp intake of breathe, he squinted one eye to look at her. \"Stay in this room.\" \"You can't tell me what to do.\" Jack huffed out an amused laugh showing his pearly whites. \"Honey I've been telling people what to do most of my life, if you think I'm going to listen to you... then you're pretty much stupid.\" Catrina got up. \"Well you're a stupid little prick, who should get a life instead of wasting it on idiotic bargains.\" \"-Spoilt brat.\" \"Murderer!\" Catrina added, kicking the blanket towards his feet. His eyes were still closed as he angrily stepped over the blankets towards her, she sucked in her lips timidly as her worried eyes looked up at him. Jack tipped his neck to the side. \"Don't call me a murderer...think of me as the bogeyman.\" He said huskily. Catrina's lips parted subtlety, she stared at his closed eyelids. \"Why Catrina...I can smell your fear, and I can smell your -\"Jack dug his fingers into his palms, he could hear his heart beating...which wasn't a good sign. Catrina saw that he was backing out into the corridor, his handsome features strained. She watched as he rolled his head while closing the door at a snail's pace. She heard the click of the locks, then a large metal panel slid in front of the gap at the bottom of the door from the outside. Catrina eerily waited for Jack footsteps to disappear before barricading the door. As Jack entered his room, he opened his eyes, they were pink. \"I was being so fucking careful!\" He then slumped onto his bed breathlessly. 'First I'll nap then I'll feed.' --------------------------------------------------------- Catrina held her right hand, it was shaking violently. She pressed it to her lips to calm it. The energy in the room had gone warm, and somehow sensual. She crossed her arms in front of her and gripped the hem of her shirt as she pulled it off. A light draft blew on her bare skin, and she looked towards the door wearily. Her green orbs came across a small pale figure leaning against the door. \"Katie?\" \"I see you haven't made much of an attempt to get off this ship.\" Katie floated forwards with her arms tucked neatly behind her back. The sunlight passed through her transparent form, her face which was similar to Catrina's, held a dull happiness. \"I've made many attempts- non have been successful, it's hard when you've got nothing to get on when I've got off the ship.\" \"Oh you mean like a dingy, or a life boat?\" \"Well yes.\" Catrina observed her younger twin while crossing her fingers in front of her. \"You wouldn't happen to know where I could find one, would you?\" Katie pursed her lips. \"I've kept an old dingy under the floorboards in my wardrobe.\" Catrina rolled her eyes irritably. \"You could of told me that before.\" \"Sorry... Are you going now, 'cause if you are thinking about it...now's the best time -Jack's having his afternoon rest before he goes off feeding.\" \"Err- goes off feeding?\" \"Yes, you know when I said Jack was a soul collector?\" Catrina looked up at the ceiling unconvincingly. \"Vaguely.\" Katie narrowed her eyes, and placed her hands on her hips. \"You still don't believe me do you?\" \"What is there to believe...some cock and bull about black magic and devil worshipping?\" Catrina sat down on her bed. Katie copied her actions. \"You have to believe it because it's true...he is trapping us all here to fill his quota.\" Catrina looked off to the side and rolled her eyes as Katie spoke. \"Worst of all he collects souls differently now, he can only drain souls using sex.\" Catrina snapped her head around. \"You're a bit young for talking about those type of things?\" \"What sex?...Naaa, I've seen some pretty nasty stuff over the years.\" Catrina's eyes looked down at her sympathetically \"I bet you have.\" She stiffly patted the air of where Katie's hand was. \"So Jack.\" She rubbed the back of her neck. \"Can he produce sexual energy, you know like...the lusting after type.\" \"He certainly can.\" Katie replied watching hopefully as Catrina stood up with the look of bewilderment on her face. \"Ah- I think you starting to believe me.\" \"Err...I don't think so.\" Katie disappeared and startled Catrina by reappearing in front of her. \"He does have magical powers Catrina, given to him by the devil, well, when I say devil I mean bad people.\" Catrina circled around Katie as she bit her nails in thought. \"Has there been anything in your life you have been unable to explain?\" Catrina froze, and looked back concerningly at the little girl. \"My dad, one time...went flying through a door?\" Katie nodded intriguingly. \"Also I believe Jack was disguised as my mum, before I was abducted.\" The little girl approach her and placed her icy hand on Catrina's arm. \"I think it's time for you to start believing.\" Katie said in a low whisper, a glint appeared in her eye. \"I might have to show you.\" Catrina felt slightly aggravated as she felt a terrible chill pass through her shoulder as Katie's hand came up, for few seconds Catrina felt she was being guided into a refrigerator, her stomach did a flip and jolted slightly as she felt the returning presence of the room. She looked at Katie questioningly, who was returning the same look. \"Katie...what just happened?\" The little girl looked into her sheet pale hands perplexly. \"Nothing...but something was supposed to happen.\" \"Like what?\" Katie looked up to reply. \"It was supposed to transport you to a past memory.\" Katie raised her hand wondrously towards Catrina's shoulder. \"It won't allow you to go through.\" Catrina smiled weakly while looking downward, she then stood up to put on a new shirt. Katie watched her slightly baffled. She could read the fear and innocence in her eyes, but the rest of her face held a determined expression. 'Keep fighting Catrina...keep fighting.' The little girl's form disappeared through a wall. ------------------------------------------------------ Dodge bashed his feet up against the side of the hole in his basement while whistling a merry tune. His eyes wondered to the ceiling which had small grains of dirt falling from it, caused through the recent earthquake. He brought his head back to the tunnel his wife had disappeared down, a beam from a torch was flickering across his boots and a sense of relief came to his well being. \"Maureen is that you?\" A set of dirt incrusted finger nails came around the side of tunnel entrance, he smiled slightly to see the top of a woman's head merge from the darkness. Maureen looked up earnestly at her husband. \"We're in deep shit.\" \"Why what happened?\" He brought his hand down for her to reach, she gratefully took it and pulled herself out of the hole. When Dodge looked full on at Maureen's face he noticed her eyes were red and puffy, he returned a grave look. \"She's not dead is she.\" \"No Dodge she's not.\" She ran a hand across her damp eyes, she sucked in a breath. \"Dodge, I want you to go upstairs and pack some clothes for me and you, then I want you to load it in the car.\" She brushed pass Mike towards a table. \"Honey what's going on...are we going to get her now?\" \"We sure are?\" Maureen grabbed her tool box, and shoved it into a duffel bag nearby. Her husband rushed towards her and placed a hand over the tool box to prevent her from loading it up any further. \"Shouldn't we make a plan first?\" \"Nope.\" \"I'm not going without a plan...that's suic-\" \"Dodge listen to me...we have to get to that boat now.\" \"This seems awfully familiar?\" Dodge added, his wife turned around releasing what he meant. 'I want you and dodge to stay here and control the rudder.' '-But you just sai' 'Dodge listen to me.' \"Dodge we don't have to think back to the past, only forward.\" \"Maureen we've been trying to do that our whole lives, and look where it's got us, we take our eyes off of Catrina for a few years and then look what happens.\" \"I know, I know, but going down memory lane is not going to get our daughter off the ship, is it.\" Maureen forcefully knocked Dodge's hand off the toolbox and zipped up the duffel bag, she then pushed by him and hurried up stairs. Dodge was in hot pursuit behind her. \"Oh yes trying to put out of your head who's fault it is in the first place!\" He exclaimed grabbing her wrist. Maureen whirled around, she looked close to tears. \"How dare you say that, how dare you bring that up!\" \"-Well it's true, the reason Catrina's on that ship is because of you!\" \"We wouldn't of had a daughter in the first place if I hadn't saved you, Greer wouldn't have been married, Munder wouldn't have found his true career, and Murphy wouldn't have said what he had said.\" Maureen yelled glaring into Mike's face. \"I was stupid okay, but at the time my intensions were good...I was hoping Jack would have forgot the bargain.\" Her husbands face softened a little. \"Well he hadn't Maureen, he hadn't.\" His wife's lip was still quivering from her speech she had made as she slowly sunk down, water leaked from her eyes. \"It's all my fault Dodge, it's all my fault.\" Her husband sunk down to the floor with her, his eyes full of compassion. \"It's okay, it's okay, I'm sorry I brought it up.\" He stroked her hair as he guided her head towards his shoulder. \"Please tell me what you saw down there.\" \"It wasn't what I saw, it's what I found out.\" She mumbled into his shoulder, snuffling slightly. \"And what was that?\" Maureen brought her head up. \"Never you mind...let's just get going, I'll explain on the way.\" She pulled herself up and headed for the door, her husband lurched in front of her. \"Honey, honey, honey, we're not leaving until you tell me.\" Epps released a sigh. \"Fine...Jack's an incubus, happy!\"[Chapter 11] WARNING SEXUAL CONTENTS LATER IN CHAPPIE! \"Slow down!\" \"Who's the one driving here!\" Maureen's knuckles were white around the steering wheel. \"I said I wanted to save our daughter, not get a ticket for curb crawling!\" She sharply turned the wheel to dodge past a white van, causing her to scrape into a passing vehicle in the other lane, which beeped furiously at her. \"These people know nothing of road rage!\" Maureen growled. Her husband sitting next to her was cringing in his chair, and was tightly gripping the edges of the passenger seat. \"Maybe I should drive?\" \"-Too late hun, I'm already at the wheel.\" \"Pull over the car...and we'll swap.\" Maureen twisted her head round. \"No!\" \"-Eyes on the road!\" Maureen jerked to one side, steering the car from right to left. Dodge watched in horror, as a they narrowly missed a school bus. \"Jesus Christ!\" \"You could say that again.\" Epps sighed. Dodge eyed her, to see if she had calmed down. \"Maureen, are we heading out to the airport or the coast.\" \"The coast...we're taking the Arctic Warrior 2, it's the only way I can think of smuggling weapons\" She side glanced at Mike wearily. \"...And the explosives.\" \"Explosives?\" \"They might work, you said shooting the bastard would slow him down...so I'm assuming good old TNT might totally destroy him.\" \"Oh so you're going to light a stick of dynamite and just hope he would be stupid enough to pick it up, and just hold it for a little while, good plan!\" \"I was thinking more along the lines of blowing up the ship...with him on it.\" \"-And that would make Catrina- oh let me think- DEAD!\" Maureen narrowed her eyes at Dodge. \"I would get Catrina off first.\" \"We're supposed to kill Jack first...then get Catrina. Jack's not going to just let her walk off the boat Maureen.\" Dodge settled back down in his seat, and stared out of the window. \"You better slow down, there's cops up ahead.\" He felt the sudden pressure on his back leave, and the rumbling of the car around him reduce. The inside of the car fell silent, as if someone had literally pressed the mute button on a TV remote. As always the cops would stare out any passing vehicle suspiciously, waiting to take chase at any unusual activity. Maureen remained focused on the cars in front of her as she felt a policeman's eye burn into the side of her head. After 40 seconds, she heard her husband sigh with relief, she put her foot down once more and weaved through the traffic. \"What do you think would of happened if they had pulled us over and searched the boot (trunk)...they would have found a load of guns and a load of TNT!\" \"We could of said we work for a demolition company?\" \"-With guns!\" \"A mafia demolition company?\" Maureen suggested with a hint of laughter, Dodge gave her a disapproving look. \"Oh come on you're no fun anymore.\" \"I thought we were focusing on our daughter's crisis?\" \"Yeah...\" She said rather high pitched. \"But I was just squeezing in that little bit to lighten the mood. Jeez-Louise, I can't wait to reunite you with Munder...now that'll get your sense of humour back.\" Dodge rubbed his rugged patch on his jaw line. \"Everybody kind of lost there sense of humour after the incident Maureen.\" His voice dropped slightly and he shrunk in his seat. \"Experiencing death - the pain of it, the sensation of your heart stopping, the intake of your last breath.\" His wife took her eyes of the road for a second to look at him sympathetically. \"-And finally you take your last look at the world around you, then darkness falls.\" \"It must of been horrible.\" Maureen hesitated before patting his shoulder. \"I would ask how you died...but I don't think I want to know.\" \"After all these years, we've never really came to the subject. It seemed every time we were about to go to the subject, one of us would leave the room...before the other asked questions.\" \"Yeah. After I had made the deal, it was kind of sereal, we knew what we had to do- fix the boat, even though 'you' weren't asked to, and you weren't totally aware about the deal. We just got on with it like zombies, we didn't talk...we never saw Jack, but soon as the boat was fixed we sorta...\"Epps closed her mouth and stared straight ahead at the up coming junction. She didn't know how to explain it. \"-Went to sleep.\" Dodge finished, at almost a whisper. His wife steadily nodded still staring mystically ahead. \"Then we woke up, sitting in that bar with a...\" \"-Hangover.\" \"Yeah. We all went our separate ways from then on, except for us...and Murphy. We only contacted the others through letters, I remember sending them each a picture of Catrina when she was five years old. The last time I wrote to them was 6 years ago, and now, we've arranged to meet them at the coast, to prepare to go to back to very thing that screwed our lives up.\" \"I wouldn't say screwed our lives up, if we hadn't of gone, we would have been still working on the Arctic Warrior, day in and day out together, but 'apart', never getting on with a normal life.\" \"We don't have a normal life now, we would have been better as we were just the six of us as a family on a boat.\" \"What...and not be married, is that what you mean!\" Dodge realising he had said it in the wrong way, elaborated aggravatedly. \"Err...no, we still could of got married, but we would be still on the boat.\" \"Dodge, you wouldn't of had admitted your feelings me if we hadn't had gone through the Antonia Graza ordeal. And your missing the point if I would of married you then, I wouldn't have wanted to spend the rest of my life with you and the other 4 men on board.\" Maureen heatedly jerked the steering wheel to one side, as her husband cringed at her angered form. ------------------------------------------------------ Catrina sat with her back against the wall under the porthole, focusing on the door, praying no one would come through it. No matter who it was, she didn't feel like talking to them, she wanted to be alone, alone with her thoughts, and fears. Her eyelids slowly fluttered closed, she felt herself drop and she suddenly jerked awake. Catrina felt like if she did nod off, something unpleasant would happen to her. She still found it hard to believe what Katie had told her, and yet she was sitting there fearing it. Darkness began to fall within the room as little by little the sun began to set, the atmosphere was bitter and she imagined her own screams piercing the deadly silence. Then as if on cue - she heard a distant door creak open, slow footsteps padded along the landing -she jumped up leaning against the wall. The patter went by her door and quickly faded away further into the ship. Her heartbeat quickened at the returning peace. 'Where was he going?' Catrina pushed her trainers away from her, and slid down the wall. The remaining light in the room made her eyes sparkle a little, and gave the impression she had teared up. After a while nothing happened. She had grown a fascination in scratching her name on the wooden flooring, as she did this she mumbled. 'Oh lord...why do you hate me.' She looked upwards, and found herself inspired to speak out loud. \"Somebody help me, I know I'm only a young maiden with a heart like a withered old woman, and on some occasions a foul mouth, but I'm not all that...I'm frightened, in need of a prince to sweep me of my feet.\" A faint smile came on her face as her childish mind wound up. \"Robert maybe -yeah Robert...whatever, I have been imprisoned by a so called demon.\" She clamped her mouth shut to prevent her from saying '..with a nice neck.'. She drew a deep breath before continuing. \"Why mother have you not come, are you still angry with me...or are you just accepting the fact that I have been taken because of a deal you made years ago?\" She hugged her knees to her chest, her eyes surveyed the door once more. \"Maybe I don't need your help...maybe I can get out of this situation on my own.\" She released a sigh and looked off to the side. As Catrina sat there alone in the dark, she felt lower than her age which was the first time for her. Normally when she reached a new age she would have the mind and the attitude of someone three years older than her, her childhood had somehow felt rushed. She could speak in full sentences before she reached 3, by the time she was 6 she could read any book and every book in her house, when she was 9 she began planning life after school, when she was 11; apart from getting braces, Catrina dyed her hair black and went through a gothic stage, which lasted 2 years, by then she had developed a little interest in boys, and sex had become a big issue at school. Everybody was doing it with no thought of commitment or even the consequences. Catrina had a few boyfriends just like every other girl, while she would be walking hand in hand with a guy from a science revision class, other girls her age would be screwing members of the football team in the same night. rnAfter she got her braces removed, she was known to all the guys in school as a stunner. Various boys from all over the neighbourhood fancied her, but they mainly fancied her because she had a few things some other girls didn't have; her virginity, self respect, pride, and a natural pretty face. rnWhen she was sixteen, and the upcoming prom was getting closer, various boys were falling over each other to get to her first, but she knew better, she knew perfectly well they would try and drag her to a 'after prom' party -get her pissed, and try to screw her in a cupboard. So she decided to accept Derek Johnson's hand when going to the prom. He was a library squatter -someone that spent 85 of their time in the library, 10 playing football, 5 eating. He looked so innocent... until he gave her a ride home, which put her off boys for a year. That's until her best friend Emma' dragged her to Adam's house party, the first ten minutes were fun, then she collapsed onto the sofa with a bunch of other teenagers to rest, while her mates danced or 'went upstairs.' Then as if by magic she locked eyes with a man laughing with his friends by the fire place. Robert. Turned out he was one of the Goths she used to hang out with at a cult when she was 11, and he had had his eyes on her since the prom. 'Robert, sweet Robert.' Catrina hugged her legs tighter to her as if it were him. Suddenly a scream surged upwards from the bow of the ship, Catrina jumped up with a start and pressed herself further into the wall behind her. It was a woman's scream. Her eyes were shining as she stared awkwardly at the door, not knowing whether to attempt a rescue. rnAnother scream erupted from the bow of the ship, it rung terrifically in her ears, and her stomach plummeted as it abruptly finished. Something started in Catrina, she had a leap of faith, she ran forward and began kicking at the metal panel attached to the bottom of the door. Pain shot through the bones of her toes, as her feet continually connected with the solid metal. Then the metal finally gave way and flopped uselessly onto the landing. Catrina scurried through the gap, and she was already running ahead before fully standing up. The corridors were long and dark, and she hurtled through them like no body's business. She ran through Francesca's form which had suddenly floated out of a side wall to try and prevent her from running any further. \"Come back 'ere at once!\" She ignored Francesca's command and ran into another corridor. Catrina knew she wouldn't forgive herself if she didn't save that persons life. From out of the blue - a ghostly hand came through a door on her left followed by the rest of the body, Katie grabbed her arm in mid run. \"No Catrina don't! Normally I would encourage people to rescue innocents, but this time it's a no no - Don't go when he is working...he would be in the wrong mood.\" Catrina whipped her arm away from her. \"Katie...I can't let them die!\" \"You can't stop Jack...he's in the middle of the draining process.\" Katie shrieked desperately trying to keep up with her. \"Are you still on about the soul thingy again!\" \"I would let you go and see it for yourself so you can believe me, but now is not the time.\" Katie was skipping through corners to stay by Catrina's side. And as always ghost heads would be popping out of walls at any bit of commotion. \"I'm sorry Katie but I can't sit around waiting for people to get hurt-\" \"Sometimes you have no choice!\" Katie clutched Cartina's forearms, close to tears. \"Sorry Katie.\" Catrina jerked her arms away, while rushing past her. Her heart was breaking at the desperation in the little girl's voice, but she had to do what she thought was right. Her determination had brought her this far, she couldn't turn her back on it now. Even if it meant tackling Jack to the ground to get the woman to run ahead she would strive to do it. She heard murmuring further down the hall, her trainers padded on the rough flooring and they came to a dramatic stop in front of a door. Her muscles twitched slightly as she eyed the door knob. She placed her hand on the brass handle. Even though the brass was ice cold, she could feel pulses of energy igniting within her palm. She sighed before forcefully opening the door. The heat in the room was intoxicating, and it came at her in waves, which blew her hair back from the side of her face. She looked about her - full of ease but uncertainty, and she remained dithering in the doorway as if preparing to back off. The room was a type of storage room, cardboard boxes were stacked on top of each other right up to the ceiling, and newspapers littered the floor, apart from that...the room appeared to be empty. Catrina turned towards the door, to retreat into the corridor...when suddenly a blood curdling scream rung out, she froze in mid-step - the colour drained from her cheeks - the sound was coming from right behind her. She spun around, she couldn't see anything, then she peered around a stack of boxes. Catrina stared horrifically at the scene before her. Jack was topless, and he had a semi nude woman pinned under him, she was hoarsely screaming, trying to push Jack away from her, who was jerked into her forcefully. Jack seemed to be concentrating on what he was doing, ignoring the woman's pleas and efforts of escape, he hadn't even noticed Catrina standing behind him, the woman on the other hand was reaching out to her. Catrina stood frozen to the spot her mouth hung open in shock, then as if an invisible hand had slapped her across the face, she leapt forward onto Jack's back. Her arms came up around his neck and she pulled all her weight back, trying to prize him off the woman. \"GET OFF HER YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH!\" Jack wasn't paying attention, so she kicked, scratched and bit. The woman had now gone pale, and her eyes were rolling in their sockets. Catrina in panic cried. \"Stay with me, don't pass out!\" In her desperation she covered Jack's nose and mouth with her hand. \"Why are you doing this Jack, why\" She suddenly sensed him come out of his trance, and his hands released the woman, she sunk to the floor. His hands then flew up to prize Catrina's hands away. Her worry over the woman's life had gone, and she was now concerned about her own, he was going to be pissed. He was staggering around the room dragging Catrina with him who was still hanging off his back and attached to his face. Jack then unexpectedly bent forward, causing Catrina to flip over his shoulder and onto the floor. She sat up, her heart was racing, Jack was still bent forward, he had his hands on his knees trying to catch his breathe. He finally looked up, his eyes were blood red. Catrina stared into them fearfully, wondering what was going to happen next. Jack was looking her up and down hungrily, then his eyes softened into a fearful stare and he averted his eyes towards the lifeless woman behind him. He zipped himself up and walked across the room to retrieve his shirt, he could feel Catrina's gaze burning into his bare back. He slipped into his familiar green shirt feeling slightly angry and ashamed. He brought his attention back to Catrina who was spawned out on the floor, her eyes were staring off to the side at the woman sadly. He didn't feel like saying anything. Jack took a step forward, and her eyes rushed back to him her chest heaving. \"Catrina.\" He felt annoyed at the concern and guilt he was feeling. He took another step forward trying to look as innocent as possible. \"Cat?\" Then just what he was expecting, she her eyes widened as she screamed in terror. Then he made the mistake of coming forward into her recovery zone. Jack's heart skipped a beat as his attempt at trying to comfort her failed as she bolted out the door.[Chapter 12] NownI like the way I wrote this chapter, funner, I used a bit ofnreferences with the '-' this time I checked through it for anynmistakes...and I hope I haven't missed any. Sorry for thenswearing...but don't forget it is an M...It'll only getnworse. --Flashback at ending that wasn't included in film--- ----------------------------------------------------- Francescanhurried out onto the deck, utter chaos had broken out on board - somenof the ghostly passengers were pacing impatiently, while others werenleaning over the side of the ship in fascination. \"What 'tisngoing on!\" She stood centre deck waiting for an answer, everybodynignored her. \"Did I miss somesing?\" She rolled her eyes innannoyance and scurried over to Katie who was perched on a stoop. \"Brat,nwhere's Jack and zee girl!\" Katie twisted her head around, herneyes were round like saucers.- \"-Havenyou been on another planet, Jack is overboard!\" Fran froze. \"...Andnthe reason that is because, Catrina is overboard!\" Without anothernword the Italian woman darted over to the railings. Jack's head wasnbobbing up down amidst the waves, he yelled out Catrina's name,nthen took a deep breath and sunk beneath the surface. She pullednherself straight and glanced at the other passengers- realising theynhad to go. \"Okays...okays,nnotsing to see 'ere.\" She waved her arms around to shun them awaynas Katie came up behind her. \"Theynhave the right to be here.\" She was close to tears. \"They couldnhelp spot Catrina further away.\" \"Fine,nyou!\" Francesca brought her gloved finger up to point at a steward.n\"Go to zee 'elm, Roy - starboard side, Enrico- back, and Katie-\" \"Uh,nnot on your pass-life sweety, I'm staying here.\" She folded hernarms bitchily. \"Suitnyourself.\" Thenbow of the ship cast a dark shadow over the waters making it hard tonsee, luckily another one of his powers had kicked in, and his eyesnshone bright blue through the depths of the gloomy sea. Jack used hisnarms to pull himself deeper. A lump formed in his throat as he lookednfrom side to side. No sign of Catrina, it was as if she had passednthrough another dimension soon as she hit the water. Everything wasnmuted and slowed down within the water, his eyes stared out thendarkness below him. If she had sunk to the bottom she was out of hisnreach. He wondered how she had managed to sink, she wasn'tnparticularly heavy, and there was no way she couldn't swim, for shenwas brought up into a family of natural born swimmers. Jack wasnsnapped from his thoughts when a fist sized bubble floated up pastnhis face, his eyes returned to the depth below, he kicked hard at thenwater above him and brought himself down. -\"Hownlong can he stay down there?\" Katie squatted while clutching a barnof the railings. Francesca observed her standing up. \"Prettynlong while, you still haven't explained to me 'ow she got overnboard?\" \"Wellnshe just sorta...fell, well I would say jumped in panic, cause Jacknwas coming at her...you know.\" \"Inwould of done zee same sing if I could.\" An unknown peace had camenbetween the two as they stood on the deck. Meanwhilenunderwater, Jack had caught sight of something chestnut floatingnbelow, he lowered himself and his eye-beams cast a shimmer of lightnonto a face, Catrina. Brown hair floated gracefully about her head,nand her pretty face was looking slightly more peaceful than usual, henwould have smiled but she looked lifeless as hell. His hands pullednaround her waist, but her body refused to budge, Jack clawed down hernbody to reach the source of the problem, a ropey cord had took refugentightly round her ankle, connected to a steel lope and a few rivetsnon the side of the boat. He easily snapped the cord with his barenhands, and he seized Catrina around the waist and swam up. As henbroke the surface, he was greeted by an intense cold air and an \"Ohnmy god\" from above. Once he had teleported himself and Catrina tonthe deck, he lay her down on the floor. Katie almost immediately rannover and crouched down next to her. \"Catrina?\"nShe shook her hand delicately, while staring into her pale face. \"Indon't think she's got a pulse.\" Jacknshook his head, while gritting his teeth behind his pursed lips. Henplaced a hand on Catrina's jaw and pushed her head upwards, thennshook it slightly. \"Come on Catrina, wakey wakey.\" Katie wasnsurprised at how calm he was. A look of realisation then passednacross Jack's aristocratic face. \"Shit.\" He hastily pinched hernnose and opened her mouth -sealing it with his own mouth, breathingnfor her. This was the first time their lips had met - for more than 2nseconds. He crossed his hands over her chest and began to press downnforcefully, her head jolted with every pump, but her face remainednexpressionless. Katie was counting as phantom tears rolled down herncheeks. Francesca was watching the scene before her in shock. 1,2,3n(breathe) 1,2,3 (breathe) 1,2,3 (breathe) 1,2,3 (breathe) 1,2,3n(breathe) Jacknhad begun shaking with anger, as his attempt at saving her wasnfailing. He found himself saying \"Fucking breathe God damn it!\"nAs he pumped her chest. The one thing that was upholding the deal wasnher, not to mention a nice thing to torture himself over. He feltnpain, an unknown pain to him, the feeling of helplessness...thenfeeling of heartbreak, and yet he was inches away from sniggering atnthe pain he was feeling, the pain that Catrina would be feeling - Butnmaybe that was his other side. He had known her since she was four,nhe had first seen her when she five, and now she was dieing beforenhim...with or without his permission. Francescanblurred out at random, after witnessing 10 minutes of drama. \"Insink she long gone by now.\" \"Shutnthe fuck up!\" Jack's lips then returned to Catrina's once more,nthinking it will be his last 3 goes. He was just breathing gentlyndown her throat as he began to feel something - a sudden surgenresiding deep down in Catrina's lung, a type of gurgling. Jacknpulled back just in time to see Catrina's eyelids flutter open asnshe lifted her head and began to cough and splutter up water. Hisnheartstrings tug, as he lifted her back up slightly. A look of utternrelief coming to his features. Francesca was shaking her head innannoyance, while Katie was desperately trying to hug Catrina whonstill wasn't fully aware of where she was. Her aura was strong andnit reached Jack's senses almost immediately -an incredible thing itnwas, her own light which floated about her, in which a few minutesnago had been missing, but now it was back. Her head was leaning intonhis chest tiredly. \"I'dnbetter get her inside before she catches pneumonia.\" Jack scoopednher up and carried her indoors, closely followed by Francesca andnKatie. Droplets of water trailed behind him as he hurried down thenhall, he inwardly smiled as he felt her hand beating against his legnand a murmur escape from her lips. \"Shouldn'tnshe be wide awake by now?\" Katie piped up, her feet padding alongnthe flooring after him. \"I mean you did revive her.\" -n\"Well she was under about 10 minutes, in zat ice cold water -it mayn'ave frozen up 'er giunti e muscoli.\"nFrancesca was hobbling alongside Katie in her extremely high heels. \"Whatnthe hell's giunti e muscoli!\" \"Indon't know zee ezact terminologee!\" Jacknsteamed and twisted his neck round. \"Girls do me a favour and pissnoff!\" He said in a cold tone, Katie and Francesca coward slightly,nthen huffed off through a wall. Nothing gave him more pleasure thanndoing that -well maybe a few other things -But what he didn't neednwas a bunch of irritating nattering girls on his back. \"Inguess it's just you and me now Cat.\" He chucked her on the bed,nthen waltzed into the bathroom and came back into the room with somentowels, to his surprise Catrina was slowly sitting up. \"Woo take itneasy.\" His hand came to her arm, and she jerked away, not lookingnat him. He didn't take it personally...she had the right to benfrightened of him. \"Look, I think there's a few things I mustnexplain to you.\" He started, placing the towel over her head, shenimmediately pulled it off and threw it across the room, then shenjumped off the bed and strode towards the door, Jack got there firstnand blocked her exit. -\"About what happened in the storage room.\" -n\"I already know what happened in the storage room!\" She croakedntrying to push him out of the way with no prevail. \"Youndo.\" \"Yes,nand I don't want it to happen to me...now get out of my way ornI'll spew all over you!\" Shenshrieked slightly as he pushed her back away from the door. \"Itnwon't happen to you, I'm not that heartless.\" Catrinanhuffed while thinking what a stupid thing to say. \"You just killednsomeone by raping them Jack!\" Damn,nputting it like that wasn't going to help. He breathed out with ansmile -not a proud smile, more like a 'you silly girl' smile. \"Itnwasn't rape, we had it going on at the start... she just freakednout half way through, and I kept going.\" Catrinangrit her teeth. \"Gee that puts my mind a peace!\" She lunged atnhim, trying to barge her way through to the door. A huge scrapnfollowed, arms blindly flying out at each other, backs being forcednagainst solid walls. But Catrina's previous trauma had caused hernweakened body to shut itself down, and she collapsed against him,nburying her face into his chest, panting heavily. He held her firmlynby the forearms. \"Arenyou finished?\" He asked slightly amused. \"Gimmena sec.\" Henheard her grunt as she attempted to move, her head lifted ancentimetre before it sunk back into his chest with an exhausted sigh,nshe couldn't even muster up the strength to thump him in thenstomach. \"Comenon, let me dry you or else you're going to get sick.\" \"I'mnalready there.\" Henlooked at her reproachfully. \"You're not going to puke on me arenyou?\" He said as he lifted her up with one arm and used the othernto carry some towels towards the bed. \"Wellnif you try anything...just remember -I'm loaded.\" ----------------------------------------------------------- Maureennsignalled to her husband to quickly bring the Armaments to the ArcticnWarrior 2 -without being seen. Dodge scurried down the slipway, whennhe reached the boat -he tossed the box to his wife who then secretednit under the sitting-area near the table. Murphy snorted loudly onnthe couch and immediately sat up. \"Sorry dad, just putting thesenunder the table...you go back to sleep.\" \"Naa...Inneed to wake up soon anyway.\" \"Yeahnwell you take it easy.\" \"Everybodyntreats me like an old fart.\" He growled as he struggled to sit up. Maureenntried to hide her amused expression as she side glanced at Dodge, hensmiled warmly back at her. \"Well pops, that's because you are annold fart.\" He patted him on the shoulder before returning to hisnfetching and carrying duties. Murphynstood up stretching his legs. \"God damn it the others arenlate...we did say 4 o'clock right?\" Maureenngazed out the window at a dirt road coming round the side of a hillnin the distance. \"Yep, but don't worry they'll be here, theynsaid themselves they would never miss a good fight.\" \"Whatnif we lose?\" Her fathers voice came from behind her. Shenturned to look at him. \"I like to think positive.\" Murphy gavenher a straight smile before de-boarding the boat to help Dodge. Hernattention came back to the surrounding walls of her second home, shenhad certainly made sure it looked like the Arctic Warrior. She hadnused the same colour schemes, the same types of furniture, and thensame cookware. Her mind went back to the wedding night, shenremembered the foreplay - boy did she remember the foreplay -nThen she remembered during the kafuffle of their passion, she hadnheard a clatter - which didn't stop them. After their night ofnlustful sex, Maureen went to investigate the clatter, and found thatnher silver heart -given to her by Katie -had somehow snapped off thenchain and fell to the floor. It was heartbreaking - ironically- and she had never got round to fixing it. Maureen'snhand rested on a draw handle, she pulled it open, and on view in thendraw was a glinting silver heart. \"-Looknwho I found hanging around outside.\" Maureen jumped and closed thendraw, when she turned around she saw her husband and Munder grinningnat her like a bunch of Cheshire cats. \"OhnMunder.\" She groaned as she hugged him. \"Are you a sight for soreneyes.\" \"YesnMunder, I told you should have wore a brown paper bag over yournhead.\" Dodge laughed as he received a punch in the arm from Mundernafter breaking away from Maureen. \"Wellnat least I wash my hands after masturbation.\" \"Munder!\"nMaureen exclaimed, her voice full of disgust. Maybe bringing the boysntogether was a bad idea. \"If you're going to talk filth...gonoutside.\" \"SorrynEpps...just making the place more homey -you know, filling it withnmy sex talk.\" \"-Andnsmell.\" Dodge made spray can hand gestures behind his back. \"Sonthat's another one down, how many more are coming?\" \"Geernsaid' he was coming - But he's got a family now, and I reallyndon't think they'll want him to go.\" Maureen explained, fromnthe corner of her eye she saw Murphy come back into the room. \"-I'mnnot surprised.\" \"Yeahnwell he said 'if anything happens', call me - so I did.\" Herngut instinct already told her he wasn't coming. She smiled weaklynat the others as she turned her back on them to unpack some boxes. Munderncut through the silence. \"Wait a sec, what about Santos?\" Thenothers looked at him warningly, and turned to look at Murphy -hisnback was stiff. Murphynthen spoke lower than a whisper. \"Don't think so.\" ------------------------------------------------------------ Catrinandidn't feel so good, her lungs felt sore, her head was rattled andnshe felt extremely hot. Her mind just couldn't rest, earlier on shenhad drowned after trying to keep herself underwater, then after shenhad finally decided enough was enough- she tried to swim backnup...unfortunately she was stuck on something. Catrina shivered, shenhad always been frightened of the prospect of death by drowning -butnthe way she went - it was surprisingly peaceful - but uncomfortable.nShe remembered after all her oxygen had ran out - she found herselfnsitting alone in the dark for 10 minutes, she had started screaming,nworried that her soul was doomed in limbo- 'cause that's wherenshe felt she was. Then as quickly as she got there - she felt hernsoul return to the pain and coldness of her body, and Catrina becamenaware of someone kissing her. An odd sort of kiss...gentle, but itnfelt like the person was blowing up a balloon than smooching her.nCatrina came out of thought and opened her eyes. She was in hernroom...on the ship. Minutes before she had slept- it had beennhectic, Jack had tried to remove her soppy wet clothing - she didn'tneven have to object, because soon as he had begun he seemed to glazenover, then he left the room without saying a word. Shensat up in bed, her nighty clung to her now clammy skin. Her achingneyes scanned the moonlit room and she found Jack's form sitting onna chair at the front of her bed, a shadow put his top half inndarkness. 'What is he worried I'm going to try an' escape?'nCatrina noticed he wasn't moving. Must be sleeping? Shenswung her legs off the bed and was about to get up when - \"Wherendo you think you're going?\" His voice drawled in the room.nCatrina froze looking at the ground. - \"Inneed air.\" \"Why,nare you hot?\" \"I'mnwarm.\" She said simply standing up. Henleaned forward into a streak of moonlight -so all she could see wasnhis mouth and the glow of his retina. \"You sense feverish to me.\" \"Hownwould you know that?\" Jacknpursed his lips. \"I have many talents, if you'd listened to menearlier I would of told you all about me.\" \"Ohnwhat...that you're a soul collector.\" Her lips quirked slightlyninto a smile but it dropped when he stood up. \"Sonyou know then?\" \"Sonit's true, you're really are a..-\" \"-Soulncollector yes - well proper name for it is an incubus.\" Catrina'snexpression was bemused \"Is that a technical word for collectingnsouls ...\"She folded her arms uncomfortably. \"...Using sex.\" Shennoticed his stillness and wished she'd never said anything. \"Who'sntelling you all this stuff?\" He finally said, making it clear bynthe tone of his voice that he didn't want her to find out . Notnwanting to get Katie into trouble she quickly answered. \"Justnsomebody, I would of found out anyway.\" \"Scared?\" \"-Excusenme?\" \"Scared?...Ofnme in general.\" \"Justnanswer me this...\" She released an uneasy sigh. \"Do you have anynsupernatural powers?\" \"Yes.\" \"Wellnthen yes, I am scared of you.\" Her eyes came up to him then lookednaway. Jacknfelt her fearful stance -and cracked the cold atmosphere by smirkingnat her -she shuffled away from him. \"You know I will never use mynpowers against you...only if I have to. And I'm not going to putnany moves on you, 'cause if I do, I won't be able to stop myselfnfrom...\" He rubbed the back of his head aggravatedly. \"-Drainingnme.\" Catrina sunk down on the bed. \"Why.\" \"Whynwhat?...Why did I take the job, or why am I not wanting to drainnyou?\" \"Both.\"nShe observed him through her green eyes. He was swaying slightly withnhis hands placed cooly in his pockets - then he plonked down next tonher. \"Firstnof all I didn't start off like this, I had to begin at a differentnlevel. I was just a normal soul collector at first -you know - drawnsinners in within their packs - hack them to bits, you know - allnthat standard shit.\" Catrinanraised a questioning eyebrow \"Right.\" \"-ThennI got promoted, and now I fu-\" He glanced at her realising he wasnfreaking her out. \"I have sex with sinners -female ones of course -nfor their souls.\" Wasnshe going crazy, she was sitting here listening to a psycho demonntelling her about his profession without as much in possession of anweapon. \"Wait hold the phone! -and you like this job!\" \"Errnyeah. But it ain't much fun anymore.\" \"Why'snthat?\" Jack'sneyes moved to her after coming out of thought, she felt slightly morenunsafe. Like he was going to tell her - 'Cause I can't fucknyour brains out, okay? \"Wellnit's kind of becoming more like a chore to stay healthy, err...andn-\" I can't fuck your brains out...say it! \"And I'mnunable to separate pleasure, from killing. Meaning I can't have sexnwithout some one dieing...so.\" \"-Sonyou're worried if you have sex with me you'll kill me.\" Shenadded softly, Jack repentantly nodded. \"Gee, I didn't know youncared.\" She said it as more of a sarcastic remark. \"WellnI do so there-\" Cutting himself off. \"But in the 'deal'nsense, you're no good to me dead if I want to uphold the deal.\"nHe was sure he caught a glimpse of a hurt expression on her facenwhich then switched to a slowly growing smile. \"Sonthat means I can't be touched.\" Catrina jumping up beaming, thisntime it was Jack's turn to look sad and hurt. He grit his teeth - \"Yes.\"nHe pushed himself up. \"-But I must warn you if I get too close Incan easily pop - and even if you are dead, I won't conflict withnthe deal...it'll just hurt your mother -which I would enjoy may Inadd.\" ' But not as mush as keeping you alive ' He mumblednthe last bit as he settled back into his chair at the end of the bed.n\"So watch it.\" He closed his eyes and faked going off to sleep,nhe peered through his slits at Catrina scowling at him, then shenexhaustedly climbed into bed - her fever had seemed to have gottennworse. ' Ain'tnlife just a fucking bowl of cherries?' ---Billy Connelly ----------------------------------------------------------- \"6ngirlfriends, 5 ex-wives , 6 illegitimate children.\" Munder took andrag from his cigarette. The others looked at him in disbelief. Dodgenwas shuffling the cards next to him. \"That's not a nice way tonlive buddy.\" He then began to deal the cards across the table. \"I'venkept in touch with all my exs', just some of them don't want mento see the kids. Well there's one - Amy...she is always willing toninvite me round to see little Josh and Moonbeam.\" \" So Greer I'venheard you've had a few little ones?\" Greernsat up to reach his pack. \"Yeah well...their not exactly little anynmore, they grow up so fast - a little too fast for me and my Janet'snliking. Morgan's just started college, Tara's at junior high, andnVJ's starting junior high - the amount of things you got to buynthem over the years- especially the girls when they reach theirnteens.\" \"Wenknow how you feel.\" Maureen added with a weak smile as she sat onnDodge's lap. Maureen cut to the edgy question. \"It seems like younleaving a lot behind just to catch up with an old grudge?\" \"Well...it'llnbe worth it, it's been nagging on the back of my mind for a whilennow, cause you can never really forget you death and...\" They allnhushed down feeling like they had reached a nerve point. Murphynabruptly cut through the atmosphere with a knife. \"So why are youngoing?\" \"Inwanna kill bastard -just simple as that.\" \"Mentoo.\" \"Menthree.\" Munder added, they looked over to where Dodge and Maureennwere sitting. \"Wenjust want to get our daughter back.\" Dodge finally said, he thennjolted Maureen closer to him. \"So when do we leave?\" \"It'snyour boat- whenever you like.\" FLASHBACK Murphynand the others trudged down a slipway, the sun was gradually goingndown, casting a warm orange light upon the horizon. Dodge, Santos,nGreer and Munder clambered aboard the Arctic Warrior closely followednby Epps -before setting her foot down onto the decking she lookednaround at Murphy who was waiting for the other man to catch up. \" Wellnhere it is Ferriman.\" \" -Nice.\" \" Hopenyou don't suffer from travel sickness -'cause it's going to bena bumpy ride.\" Murphy patted him warmly on the back to push himnforwards, and he steadily proceeded towards Epps who was standingnthere watching him. As he walked up the ramp, his fair blue eyesnfixed on her, and he gave her a friendly smile. As Maureen returnednher smile, everything seemed to slow down as Jack's hands grabbednthe railings of the Arctic Warrior, she thought nothing of it as hisnhand briefly -just briefly- brushed over her stomach while going pastnher to get onto the deck. Maybenit was just an accident, maybe even a coincidence, or maybe he knewnsomething...[Chapter 13] Catrina'snlegs were powering her down a dirt road, a desert landscape was hernentire surroundings, dirt flew up in gusts of fog around her feet.nShe didn't know why she was there, but she had the urge to justnkeep on running. She abruptly stopped at an abandoned gas station.nWith her eyes squinted, she looked about her with her hands on hernhips. Her eyes rested on the horizon -where a sizzling tarmac roadnwas on view leading towards her and under her feet. Within the hazynheat waves, she saw a truck come into sight, it came towards her, andnslowly stopped on the opposite side of the road. Catrina's mumnstepped out of the car. \"Honey...honey!\" Maureen rushedntowards her in disbelief, Catrina's heart leapt -she had finallynbeen found. \"Mike...come out here it's Catrina!\" Dodgenstumbled out the truck. \"Catrinanwhat are you doing all the way out here?\" Dodge exclaimed asnMaureen embraced her. Catrina was lost for words, a lump was tightlynlodged in her throat and she was unable to move -shock had paralysednher to the spot. Even though she didn't know how she got there -nshe felt nothing could spoil the moment - The only problem was thenintense heat wave of the desert made her fever go up...not tonmention the contents of her stomach, Catrina pulled back from her mumnand bent her back to retch. A hand rested on her back, her head camenback up and to her surprise she was back on the ship. Utter confusionnand fear filled her voice. \"Whynam I here...w-what's going on?\" \"Ssssshnhush now, you're hallucinating.\" Jack's voice was slow andncalming - there was not a trace of disgust in his voice. Hernback remained bent as she stared about her. \"Where's thentruck...and the desert...and-and my mother!\" \"-Itnwas never here Cat...you're sick remember, now lie back down.\"nHe said -leaning fully over her body. \"Inwant to go back.\" \"Okay...youncan go back to your hallucination -But do it in bed.\" Jack grippednher shoulder and pulled her up straight, his lips lingered by hernear. \"Now go.\" A shudder went through her spine which seemed tonautomatically cool her down. Catrina didn't recall herself climbingninto bed, but found her head slowly sinking into a fluffy pillow -nthings around her slowly went into darkness and she felt frightfullynalone. Her mind was bewildered...she desperately wanted to be rid ofnthe ship...away from Jack, on the other hand she wanted to staynwithin his company -a murmur escaped her lips and echoed through thendarkness \"Jack.\" Then a hand delicately clasped hers. Ansneer came to Jack's lips as her fingers responded and he found hisnhand being stroked hers. A lingering desire to jump in bed next tonher was pretty strong - but he knew he couldn't, she was sick andnunaware...and he was -well, dangerously horny. He swiftlynflicked his hand out from under hers and proceeded to the door, hengave her a last look over before leaving. He needed violence and somengood sex. -------------------------------------------------- TonMurphy's disappointment...Santos arrived one minute shy of theirndeparture. While Dodge and Munder chatted merrily about comicalnmoments within their past, Greer and Santos were bitching about thenothers on deck. Murphy cast a cautious eye on Maureen who was lookingnback at him apologetically. Dodgenhad begun to raise his voice in his half-drunken state. \"-So whennme and the Mrs got home...we found Catrina and Emma- her mate, lyingnon the front garden laughing themselves silly, dressed in batman andnrobin costumes.\" Dodge cracked up...as Munder bashed his fist onnthe table in laughter. \"After Maureen and I had pulled ourselvesntogether, we asked them why.\" \"Theyndidn't tell us anything...but as I was bringing them in the house,nI could smell weed on their breath.\" Mundernrolled his eyes. \"Teenagers.\" \"Itnonly turned out they had found my old stash in the attic.\" They innunison snorted as their heads slowly sunk to the table in fit ofngiggles. \"Inbet you were furious...your little girl smoking pot.\" \"Nah!n They're teenagers - what d'you expect? -Anyhow I should ofnthrown it away soon as we got Catrina.\" \"Yeahnbut still she should of known better not to smoke weed.\" \"No...Emmanswore to me she had encouraged Catrina to smoke it - Not much damagenwas done -except for the exotic after smell which took weeks to fade,nevery-person that set foot in our house would leave as high as ancloud.\" Dodge hissed the last bit out absolutely consumed withnhysterics. Munder rolled in his chair. \"Ohnwait wait it gets better!\" Maureen jumped in before her husbandncould say another word. \"-Inthink you've said enough...\" Mundernstared at her through droopy eyes. \"But Maur eeeen ..\" Henempathized every letter in her name \"-There's soo much catchingnup to do.\" \"Wellnthere'll be plenty of catching up to do when we're on our waynback home with Catrina.\" Her voice was strained, as she stared downnat the louts before her, she noticed them glance at each othernwearily. \"Oh I wish you wouldn't do that...\" \"Donwhat?\" Santos had just stepped into the kitchen area with Greer.n\"Showing our concern towards our upcoming death defying missionninto no-mans land.\" His negative speech caused Murphy to turnnaround from what he was doing. \"Ifnyou're going to think negative...why bother coming.\" \"HeynI didn't start this off...it was tweedle-dee and tweddle dumb overnhere giving each other hopeless looks.\" \"-Yeahn- But you were implying something.\" \"NonI wasn't...you're just getting paranoid old man -so get off myncase!\" \"Whyndon't you make me!\" Murphy stepped forward and pushed Santosnagainst the wall and they began to scuffle. Maureen immediately camenforward to brake the two up. \"Murph take it easy...Santos younshouldn't have said anything.\" Before they could tackle eachnother again she pushed Santos onto the other side of the boat. \"Nownlet's chill shall we.\" Thenothers settled down, Mike stared up at his wife admirably. \"God Inlove that woman.\" Maureen blushed slightly. \"Whynthe hell am I blushing.\" Mundernlooked from one to the other. \"Cause 20 years ago he wouldn'tnhave been able to say that...well not out loud at least.\" \"20nyears...that's how long it's been?\" Greer outline could justnbe seen on the outskirts of the table lights, the others nodded innresponse. \"Jesus Christ.\" He took a large swig out of his beerncan. \"A lot of those years have been hell for me...always beennlooking over my shoulder for something to come and -you know- claimnme and send me home.\" He shuddered thinking back to the fall fromnthe elevator shaft. \"I could never use elevators again or watchnthose old Italian films...they gave me the creeps -(shivered)n\"Oh...and I almost had a heart attack when I saw my daughter'snScarlet prom dress.\" The others stared at him in disbelief. Santosnscratched his chin contemplatedly \"Is this to do with that womann-what's her name...Francoise?\" \"-Francesca.\" \"AhnI remember you writing about her in your letter.\" Maureen addedn\"Your only letter.\" Greernsmiled weakly. \"Sorry.\" In all that time they had known eachnother, the ordeal they had been through, it felt odd they had nothingnmuch to say...not even a million letters could express what theynwent through. Theynstood/ sat there fiddling with anything they got there hands onnbefore Munder broke the silence. \"At least your death was quick...Inwas-\" He swallowed sharply, his went eyes out off focus. \"Gratednagonizingly slow through clockwork in the engines.\" Everybodynwinced and cringed at what he had said. \"-Burntnalive I was.\" Santos blurted out -feeling rather stupid afterwards.nThe others nodded reasonably. \"Tonthose of you that didn't know...I drowned.\" Murphy sank downninto a chair as if just confessing a sin, he glanced at Maureen tonfind her eyes had glazed as if reflecting back. Then she was broughtnout of thought when she realised Dodge still hadn't said anything,neveryone else had noticed to and were eagerly waiting for him to tellnthem about his death. Her heart went out to him as he just sat therenknowing everybody was watching him. \"Ohncome it's not like you have to know.\" Dodge mumbled- he messednwith his cards on the table awkwardly. Maureen placed a loving handnon his shoulder and squeezed it. Munderncoughed, thinking of the right words. \"I think it would be best fornus all to know buddy. Get it off you chest.\" He smiled sincerely.n\"Like spilling the beans A.KA maggots.\" Dodgenreleased a huff of laughter. \"I knew that was coming.\" The othersnlooked at the two quizzically by what they were talking about. \"Seenit's getting easier every step of the way going down memory lane.\"nA simple nudge on the shoulder caused Dodge to sit up slightly in hisnchair. \"Okay.\"nHe sighed. \"At the time I always thought Jack to be a bit of anweed, never liked picking a fight, always backed down when broughtninto a fight- you know always the momma's boy.\" The othersnbrightened at his personalized humour, and sunk down on chairs aroundnthe table. \"Inalways seemed to push him around, even if it wasn't when I wasnangry with him.\" Maureen was starting to feel sick...She knew itnwas getting close to the point - some things had been left unsaidnduring their marriage...and now he was about to come out with it innthe open. \"-Younmean like when you molested him after finding the gold.\" Munderngrinned as Dodge narrowed his eyes at him. ' Molester!' \"Itnwas an aggressive manly wrestle dipshit - Anyway I'd pushed himnabout a bit...\" FLASHBACK ' Let'snjust be grateful we still have the gold and our lives.\" Jackngestured his hands innocently while confronting a pissed off Dodge.nEverybody else was settling down rubbing there wounds and trying tondry off from the big plunge. ' Yeah-tellnthat to Santos asshole!' Maureen-n'Hey Dodge ease up!' Munder glances from one to the other. Dodgen- 'This is bullshit!' Jack.n-'Santos came out here out of his free will just like the rest ofnus...' Dodge made for Jack across the room and grabbed him by thenjacket and knocked him back onto the bar. Munder and Greer rushednforwards to prize Mike off him. Dodge- 'WHAT THE FUCK DO YOUnMEAN?---SANTOS IS DEAD!' Maureen-nThat's enough! ' Jackn- 'shit fuck geroff me!' Munder grabs Dodge by the waist andnlifts him off a freaked out Jack. ENDnFLASHBACK \"Inhad just turned my back on what I thought was his corpse -when..\" Dodgenstops in mid-step as he hears a groan from behind him, he nervouslynturns to be confronted with a blood drenched Jack slowly getting up,nas he did his wounds melted away into nothing as if he had never beennshot. Jack craned his head - his eyes fixed on his prey with a coldnstare. \" Younthink that was going to stop me?\" Mike'snheart was pounding fast, he could feel an unpleasant force in thenatmosphere around him. He tried his best to hide his fear. \"Actuallynyes I thought it would...but I'll think of summut.\" Jackntilted his head, a cruel smile played on his lips. \"You betternthink fast cause I coming.\" He unexpectedly lurched forward towardsnMike-who stared at him wide eyed in surprise. Soon as contact hadnbeen made, Mike felt himself pinned to the floor -Jack was straddlingnhim. \" Younalways liked knocking me about...now it's your turn.\" Mike saw anfist fly towards his face SMACK, his head careered back at the impactn- a groan escaped his lips. For the first time he feltnpowerless...this punk kid had suddenly over whelmed him with defeat.nAnother punch in the jaw brought him back to reality. 'Who was thisnguy, why did he really want the ship fixed?' He ignored his ownnquestions and brought his hands up sharply and pushed Jack hardnagainst the chest, he fell back against the hard floor. Dodge wasnstill in panic as he dragged his numb self up and began to crawl awaynfrom Jack who was slowly getting up...to his uneasiness Jack wasnlaughing his chesty laugh as he struggled. Mikenspat out blood and glared at him. \"What the fuck is so funny?\" \" Younare...you're so weak and pathetic.\" \" Whatnand that makes your perfect?\" \" Nonnot perfect...special.\" Jack just stood there staring atnhim. Mike knew what he was doing- he was trying to Syke him out.nDodge had his fists clenched at the ready -but nothing came- Jack hadnbegun motioning himself one way then moving the other, slinkily, asnpart of an attack manoeuvre. \" Whatnthe hell are you waiting forJack!\" Jackngrinned while moving around a counter- \"For you to make yourneffortless first move.\" Mikenmind was scanning for ideas...then it randomly decided to quicklynpick up an object and throw it as a diversion. A spanner went flyingnthrough the air, with Jack's quick reflexes he slid over to onenside and it narrowly missed him by inches. By the time the spannernhad clattered to the floor, Mike was already running down a stairwayntowards the fish tank. He had to somehow reach Maureen in time so hencould double back and get her off the ship, all he wanted was to getnher out of the way before Jack could get his hands on her. He skiddednto a halt when a huge lump rose out of the floor and pushed up thencarpet, blocking his path. Dodge stood transfixed to the spot as thenlump moved towards him. \"You've got to be kidding with me.\" Henmuttered, his eyes wide. The carpet reached his height then slowlynmoulded into the shape of a person, then it dissolved away to revealnJack standing there smugly. \" Prettyncool huh..?\" He grinned sinisterly at him bearing what looked likenfangs. \"Don't worry it gets better.\" Before Mike could asknwhat? He went careering backwards into a door which splintered at thenforce -Shit that's gotta hurt. Dodgengroaned, he could feel every muscle in his body slackening and hisnspine vibrating. The taste of copper came to his mouth, he could tellnthe end was near. He struggled up, with dread being his companion.nJack was crouched next to him by the time he looked up, his unearthlynblue eyes bore into him with no trance of mercy. \"Okay I'm borednnow.\" The younger man grabbed the older man's throat and began tonsqueeze hard, his wind pipe was abruptly closed off, restricting thenoxygen flow. Dodge's face turned purple as he coughed andnspluttered, he brought his hands up to prize Jack's hand away butnwith no prevail. His arm thrashed around helplessly beating Jacknhard. Mike grew weaker and weaker as his lungs slowly collapsed in onnthemselves, every second became worthless as darkness slowly creptnover his eyes - which felt like they were bulging out of his skull.nHis arms which were raised gradually dropped to his body as hisnenergy left him, even though Jack was in his sight, an image ofnMaureen flashed through his mind, then he died. -n\"After I had...died, I felt like I was floating then I wasnsuddenly in this dark room, then there was this -\" \"-Burningnsensation in your hand.\" Santos finished, rubbing his own hand, thenothers were nodding slightly. Mikenlooked around at Maureen. \"I'm glad you didn't go through anynof that.\" She felt dreadfully guilty for not experiencing what theynwent through. Hernlips parted ready to speak- she sighed. \"After you were...marked,nwhere did you go?\" \"It'snkind of hard to explain we were still on the ship, just notnwhole...sometimes we would be in this dark room where we couldn'tndo anything much, other times it would be like we were moving...butnwith somebody else, Jack to put it bluntly.\" Santos was leaningnside on into a wall. \"Like looking through his eyes or something,nbut wondering the ship was something I always done, it was betternthan the dark room or being a part of Jack.\" Murphynsat scowling in the corner of the room. \" Sure Santos...miss outnthe part where you were tormenting me!\" \"HeynI didn't know what came over me then, I was angry at you but notnangry enough to haunt you...I was a claimed soul!\" \"-Younthreatened me with a knife, and I had to defend myself!\" Murphnstood up absolutely seething. Maureennsuddenly stumbled on something she remembered, Murphy had looked atnher bewildered and frightened when she had approached him on the shipnone day and he had attacked her. \"Wait I was there...you somehownthought I was Santos...I remember the look on you face when you sawnme...then you attacked.\" Murphynwas wide eyed \"What!\" To imagine he would try and kill Maureennwas absurd and hurtful. \"I did!\" Thenothers eyes rounded, realisation came to there features. Santosnscratched his head. \"Wait now I remember; I was commanded to cloudnover Maureen's image.\" \"Whynwould you do such a thing!\" Dodge and Murphy said in unison whilenMaureen acted non-existent. \"Inwas a claimed soul...I couldn't do anything about it!\" \"Ohndon't give me all that claimed soul bullshit...what you did wasndangerous!\" Dodge exclaimed, inches away from pouncing on him.n\"Maureen was your friend.\" \"Heynguys I'm still here!\" Maureen raised her hand like a kid in anclassroom. \"-Itnwas out of my hands...anyway she wasn't killed!\" Santosnsquawked gesturing his hands stereotypically. \"Yeah,nwell it was darn lucky Jack was there to stop it all!\" Dodge saidnnot realising. Everybody else froze. ---n\"Wait hold the phone, Jack is behind all of this...he was lettingneverything run it's course so he would look like 'the good guy!'\" \"Thanknyou Maureen!\" Santos indicating to her. \"See, so it wasn't mynfault...it was all Jack's mystical doing.\" Murphynstared Santos out with a twitchy eye. \"Yeah fine...whatever.\"n' You could of stopped it' He mumbled turning his back onnthe situation. \"HeynI think we should focus here...we've got a big job to do in a fewndays.\" Greer crushed his cigarette into an ash-tray on the table.n\"We shouldn't bite each others heads off if we're supposed tonbe working as a team.\" \"Yesnlet's ease up.\" Santos then followed Greer outside for anotherndiscussion, briefly thanking him as they went through the doorway.nMurphy sank down next to Munder at the table. \"Well...what'snour plan?\" Maureennand Dodge looked at each other, they hadn't really considered annofficial plan. \"We thought we would get on the ship, find Catrinanand get her off...if we bump into Jack on the way we'll...\" \"-Blownhim up.\" Her husband finished. \"Pretty stupid I know, but gunsndon't work so we will have to.\" Murphnnodded -it seemed pretty straight forward. -------------------------------------------------------------------- \"Yountwist it...like this.\" Katie snatched her spelling toy out ofnFrancesca's hands, her ghostly fingers spun a cube around causing anletter to fix next to another. \"See?\" Francesca peered at thencubes. \"Ci,nnow 'ow do you write Gold?\" \"Easy.\"nThere heads leant over the toy as Katie began to explain whilenfiddling with the cubes. Their moments of rapt concentration came tonan end when they heard a great gasp. Katie's head snapped up at thensame time as Fran's, and they saw Catrina sitting up in bed. \"Ohndarn...she pulled through.\" Francesca's voice rung throughnCatrina's ears as she turned towards Katie who was the only othernperson in the room. \"Inpulled through...what does she mean by that?\" Katienearnestly looked at her while floating towards her bedside. \"Younhad a raging fever and bad hallucinations over night.\" \"Thatnexplains the desert.\" Catrina added in an amused tone, tucking anstrand of her hair behind her ear - She immediately stopped smilingnwhen she caught the odd look plastered across Katie's pasty face.n\"Why are you looking at me like that?\" Katienwas looking at her heavenly before replying with. \"I think I cannsee it too.\" Catrinancocked her eyebrow. \"What?\" She then brought her hands up to hernface. \"Do I have a bruise or something?\" Katie shook her head atna snail's pace, still looking at her with a slight smile. \"I knownI have similar facial features as you.. but-\" \"Nondeary, I can finally see why he is enamoured with you.\" Catrinanblinked. \"What Jack -No- he just sees me and wants something hencan't have.\" \"Yeah-nwell maybe, but I see you have a glowing aurora, which illuminatesnyou. You have a special gift Catrina...a gift of brightening up anroom with you cute facial expressions and striking body language.\"nCatrina couldn't believe what she was hearing, she was beingncomplemented for being a decorative ornament. \"Whynare you telling me all of this?\" Katienbrought a tray from under the bed and placed it onto Catrina's lap.n\"Because for ages I wondered why people spoke of this obsessionnJack had with you, I wanted to know the attraction...and now I seenit, it's not just new sex it's the curiosity of discoveringnsomething new.\" Catrina'sneyes were darting from side to side downward in bewilderment. \"Surenmen are attracted to different types of women...Jack's notnenamoured, just horny.\" She knew men had been drawn to her beforenbut this was different Jack was dangerous. \"Younknow Jack was watching over you all of last night...but then he hadnto go and get charged.\" Katie bent two of her fingers in mid-air atnthe last word. Cat already knew what this meant -another night ofnJack on the prowl for sex driven women. Katie brought her out ofnthought. \"Now I don't know if this 'thing' is good ornbad...if he is infatuated with you then he won't want to hurt younand do 'that', or he could be driven by this 'thing' intonlust and want to do 'it'...\" Hernmind was racing - too much talking of sex, she just wanted to run,nshe leapt out of bed, past Katie who was still standing therenaddressing her, then she swung the door open and ran into Jack whonwas looking as startled as she was, her heart stopped -it was annultimate cliche. \"Jack.\" She breathed. Hennudged her back into the room and followed her in, closing the doornbehind him. \"Good to see you out of bed, now if you wouldn't mindnclimbing back in.\" Jack realised he had caught her in the middle ofna terror spree, added. \" On your own to sleep.\" \"Wellncan you get out...please.\" \"Excusenme? I'm not endangering you...I'm under control.\" ' Fornnow' Jack pursed his lips while looking her up and down,nstanding inches away from her. \"See.\" Aaaww so appealing whennshe's frightened. \"I'mnnot worried about now, I'm still pissed off at what you do for anliving and what you've already done...and I don't want it in mynroom - so stay away from me Jack.\" Catrina noticed a genuinely hurtnlook in his eye...which then vanished when he sneered. \"Okay-nyou're right, a leopard can't change his spots.\" He walked tonthe door with his hands in his pockets. She had driven a blunt objectnthrough his heart, and once again he told himself it wasn't lovenjust lust for sex and kill. \"I'll check on you later...feel freento go for a walk around.\" He then left a stunned Catrina on hernown. No sooner had he gone into his own sanctuary he heard her feetnpadding along the corridor, she briefly glanced through the doorway nrealising it was his room, then she awkwardly strode pastnhoping he wouldn't follow. 'Jesus she's only just got betternand now she's going back outside in just a nighty.' His headnpoked around the corner of the doorframe and he caught sight of anfleeting hem of dress rounding a corner. Couldn't resi st, henjust had to follow. Annew feeling of freeness was upon her and she didn't want to neglectnit any further. She pushed a door open and stepped out into the opennsea air...and to imagine she could have never have felt this againnsince she had almost died. Sure Jack had saved her but what world hadnhe brought her back to, a trapped life, even on a normal day innBoston, she never felt like living her home -the cuckoos nest, butnshe dragged herself out as a mindless routine...trying to be likeneverybody else. School seemed like somewhere to stash kids,nboyfriends just seemed like an accessory -but a nice accessory, annaccessory that walks you home at night, holds your hand in the park,nsqueezes your knee in a movie theatre and just makes you feel specialnwhen everything else seems bleak and lonely. When she did reach homenafter another day had gone by she would touch a brick of her housenand think ' There are many bricks that make up this house as doesnthe people that make up the world, but even though I feel sad andnlonely cause I feel like I'm everybody else, I feel sad cause Inknow I'm not like anybody else...somebody's watching over me, andnthey're coming to take me whether I like it or not .' And shenalways knew it. Didn't live by it - But sensed something was aroundnthe corner she couldn't stop. Catrina sank down to the floor andnfound herself silently crying, she abruptly stopped when a navynjacket was draped over her shoulders. \"Don'tncry.\" He said plainly, not the slightest bit of sympathy in hisnvoice. \"Donyou mind...I'm having a very tough time right now, leave me alone.\"nCatrina could sense him watching her, then a scuffling noise as if henwas preparing to seat himself down next to her. \"Injust don't like it when women cry.\" \"-Younmean you don't like to see women cry, cause normally it is yournfault.\" She hiccupped as he unexpectedly grabbed her wrist andnjerked her towards him. \"Youncan sometimes be a real b..\" He stopped himself. \"Well actuallynno, I don't like it when women cry because it's the ultimatendistress sign...it shows their point of weakness, the breaking downnof emotions.\" He noticed she was listening intently. \"Andnsometimes it acts as a door into a persons soul...and I can seenalmost everything distressing about there life, usually I don'tnmind...but sometimes it gets way to emotional, I don't feel - itnjust experience it.\" They were sitting rather close and they couldnfeel each others breathe on their cheeks, he raked his eyes out ofnhers as Catrina's cheeks flushed slightly. He hastily let go of hernwrist and she slide away from him. Catrina wasn't crying anymore,nin fact she was just staring at him...utterly drawn. \"Jack,nwhat happens if they are crying with joy?\" She wondered, leaningnher head into one of the bars, his pale blue eyes came back to hernagain. \"Surely that's not distressing or shows any sign ofnweakness?\" \"Whynwould someone cry with joy?\" Catrina raised her eyebrows to Jacknwho was looking at her bemused. \"Maybenthey're pleased to see somebody they haven't seen in a longntime?\" \"I'mnnot the type of person to be around when someone's crying with joy,nnobody is pleased to see me.\" Catrina's eyes were wondering offnto the side back to the ocean, a sort of sadness clung to thenatmosphere. \"I mean...it's not like I deserve to have anybody tongenuinely miss me, look what I've done.\" Jack saw her nod out ofnthe corner of his eye, and his lip twinged into a casual smile. Hendecided to remain quiet within her thoughtful and wondrous statenwhile admiring the view, and what a nice bit of scenery it was...anyoung fair complexion, pink pouty lips, deep emerald eyes, and longnwavy brown hair which glowed red within the sunset. She was beautifulnand untouchable, like an irresistible ornament that a mother forbidsnyou to play with. Catrina couldn't really focus on the sunset - shenhad the sensation of hot sticky eyes on her, as much as she wouldnlike to steal glances at him... she couldn't, it felt like a sinnto start lusting after an enemy...so she shut it out as hard as shencould. \"Catrina.\"nHer head came around to meet his powerful gaze. \"Let's go for anwalk.\" Before he could let her reply he jumped up and draggednCatrina along with him. This was crazy - she thought. She was scarednof him but attracted to him, she was pissed off with him - butnslightly keen to have him around. Her back leaned away slightly,nunsure if she wanted to follow, even though her body allowed him tontake hernaway. Tunenin next chapter...Jack's gonna get nasty. A stormnbrews over the Arctic Warrior 2 as Santos andnMurphy...well...they will never get along. Greer takes up muffinnmaking, Dodge wants sex... ...nand Elect Munder for President (Presidental music). n'I'm just kidding'[Chapter 14] \"Wherenare you taking me?\" \"Tonthe lower decks my love.\" He gripped her hand tightly as he strodendown the many stairways and corridors. Catrina relentlessly totterednalong behind him, when she stumbled he would always pause and benthere - ready to catch her, and she would hop up suddenly when hisnhand grazed her back, even a quick recovery still felt awkward andnshe would shyly slip away from his helping hands. They turned into angap in a wall which revealed a narrow staircase going down into andrippy cavern. Jack was already ahead of her so he had to abruptlynstop when he still felt her lingering on the top step. He looked upnat her silhouette, he could just make out within the dim light hernbright green eyes staring fearfully into the abyss. \"Don't worrynI'm here.\" \"That'snwhat I'm afraid of.\" She mumbled as she accepted his clawingnhands. Their feet clattered down the stairs, and Catrina shrieked asnher last few steps sank under 15 inches of water, she didn't knownwhen the stairs officially ended and she stalled in panic when Jack'snbody began to move further away still holding her hand. \"Jack.\"nHe looked back up at her - smiled, then brought an arm just under hernbutt and lifted her out the water. Catrina felt 10ft tall as shenbalanced near his shoulder, no one had ever carried her like thisnbefore, and she didn't like the idea of her hip being so close tonhis face. Jack was having a very hard time himself, soon as he hadndone it -he realised it was a bad idea, cause he was overcome withnboth dread and desire - shit she smells good. Jack's handnwhich was clasped around her thigh picked up a shudder from her bodynand he began to do breathing exercises to stop himself molesting thenpoor girl. \"Whynis there so much water...we're not sinking are we?\" Catrinandipped her head as they passed under some piping. \"Thenship's fine, this is just water that hasn't been cleared away.\" \"Whynthe hell are we down here.\" \"You'llnsee.\" Theynpassed many massive pipes, Jack dramatically stopped in front of anniron door - to Catrina's amazement the door swung open by itselfnand lead to another stairway which looked completely dry compared tonthe rest of the ship. It seemed like an endless journey through thenbow of the ship, she didn't know where she was going or whatnawaited her. Was this some kind of a trick...who knows? Her mind wasnoblivious to him being the type to conduct themselves sexually in annicky environment...though he was a very creepy person. She triednher best to drive these frightening thoughts out of her head byncommentating. \"I think I just saw a rat...or maybe just a verynlarge looking mouse, ooo another rusty wall -nice -this ceiling isnvery low...either I'm getting taller or your getting taller...I'mngoing to bump my head any minute now.\" Catrina nervously glancedndownward at Jack's face which was facing straight ahead, he had angrave look and his lips were pursed as he walked on ahead. 'Damnnhe's ignoring me...I'm going to die or be helplessly...donenover.' \"- Okay - I think your 6ft and I'm 5'ftnsomething...what d'you say?\" -silence- \"And here's anothernwall...\" \"-I'mnnot going to rape you.\" Jack said out of the blue, he turned hisnhead slightly so he could have a clear view of her head. Catrinansucked in sharply. \"I never said you where going to.\" \"Yeah...butnyou were thinking it.\" His blue pearl drop eyes narrowed on her asnshe stared right back, she felt terror-struck and angered. \"Staynout of my head, this is the only privacy I've got left.\" Shencaught Jack huff out a laugh and flash his pearly whites. \"Don'tnworry I only hear snippets, your mind is like a radio - every now andnthen I reach a clear frequency and pick up a little voice.\" \"Wellndon't tune in, how would you feel if I was inside your head.\"nCatrina felt an uneasiness about Jack after she had said this. 'Ohnhow little she knew.' He placed her down on the metal grills ofnthe floor and guided her into a room with a high ceiling. A rusty oldnfashioned car sat in the corner, her eyes went straight to it, andnJack noticing her interest and bemusement, grinned. Her head dippednto the side. \"-Sonthis is what you wanted to show me?\" \"Err...no.\"nHe strutted into a smaller room and kicked open a crate. \"This isnwhat I wanted to show you.\" She came through the small doorwayncautiously and stared in disbelief at what she saw, about 40 bricksnof gold sat snug in a box and by the looks of the similar cratesnnearby - there were more. \"Sonthe gold really does exist.\" Her hands brushed over the invaluablencold bars. \"I've never seen so much in my life. Damn...I'mnsurprised you haven't bought a mansion and a dozen cars.\" Jacknsmiled evilly as she picked up one of the bars. Her eyes sparkled atnthe beauty of the object in her hand, and alas it wasn't hers andnworst of all people had been killed over it -she slammed it back downnin the crate, and Jack jumped in surprise. \"Arenyou trying to bedazzle me into greed so you can kill me.\" Shenexclaimed, trying to come across sharply but ended up shrieking. Jacknskulked over to the wall and leaned against it with his arms foldedn\"Actually bedazzle you into admiring me, every girl likes money.\" \"Don'tnyou need diamonds for that - wait...no, do you really think I wouldnlike this, do you really think this will turn me on?!\" \"What!\"nHe pushed himself off the wall glaring. \"I am not trying to turnnyou on...what's the point in doing that, I can't do anything!\" \"Apartnfrom fucking people and killing them.\" Thatnhad been the last straw, he could feel this deep anger raising, and andeep desire to hurt - At moments like these where a woman didn'tnknow her place...it was like wild fire. \"WILL YOU SHUT THE FUCKnUP!!!\" To Catrina's horror he pushed hard against her - the forcenthrew her body brutally across the room and into a rusting wall. Henwas shocked at what he had done but didn't let it interfere withnhis anger and lust to hurt. Catrinanwas in absolute agony and to top it all off the dread that filled hernup was sickening, for the first time she had experienced his truenwrath- his true nature, and she prayed there wasn't anymore. Hernwatering eyes looked up through some of her hair which had beennthrown in front of her face. Jack was breathing heavily, his nostrilsnwere flared, and his eyes were cold. \"ListennBitch - Do you think I like my job...well yes actually I do, I lovenit, but sometimes things get in my way, and when this happens I havento get rid of them and do what I have to do, and mark my words, Inwill have you by the end of this week. But don't you dare gonfucking criticising.\" He softened up a bit, trying to make himselfnless frightening so she wouldn't pull away from his assistance.n\"Now come.\" He offered her a hand...which she didn't take asnhe had expected. \"Fine.\" Jack spat, and he stormed out - as hendid he pushed on a hook which dangled on a chain so forcefully itnclattered heavily on the ceiling. She flinched at the bang, and triednto stand up but soon as she tried to move - she found she couldn'tnfeel her arm attached to her body, but a huge searing pain remained. \"Catrina?\"nShe heard Katie's voice a little distance away from her. Katie camenin and noticed to her dismay a knocked about Catrina cradling hernarm, she knelt at her side. \"Oh my god what happened... did henstrike you?!\" \"Yesnand no.\" Katie made to help her up but Catrina cringed. \"No don'tnmove me, I think I'll stay down here.\" \"Youncan't hide from him and anyway it's damp...you don't want tonget sick again.\" \"I'dnrather be sick than have a dislocated arm.\" She winced trying tonmassage it. \"What?!\"nKatie's hand shot to her shoulder, and the girl screamed in agony.n\"You mean he just pulled it out of your socket.\" \"No,nhe through me into a wall and it must of popped out.\" \"Ouch,nI would never think of him doing that to you, well yes Inwould...but you.\" \"WellnI guess I can't be safe all the time.\" Her smile was weak, andnfull of dread, she made another attempt to get up but squeaked innpain instead and sank back down. \"Oh this is ridiculous I can'tnget up.\" \"Inthink I'll go fetch Jack.\" Catrinaneyes widened in surprise, a sensation like electricity shot throughnher spinal cord. \"God no, don't do that, he'll...hurt me, Indon't want him to think I need his help.\" \"Butnyou do need his help, there's no need to be afraid of assistance,nor is there something else?!\" Katiennoticed her eyes go off to the side. \"Nothing.\" Catrina heard hern'tut' disapprovingly. \"Okay everything, beingnpowerless...feeling intimidated.\" Her fears were just likenthat and so much more which she couldn't confess to, her emeraldsnfocused on the British girl standing above her with her hands on hernhips. \"Ornyou could be just plain stubborn.\" \"I'mnnot being stubborn.\" Katienjust looked at her unconvinced, then sighed. \"Right then you won'tnmind if I leave, there's a bit of a do on upstairs -chow!\" \"-Katienwait!-\" She had already disappeared leaving Catrina sitting on hernown, she winced as her arm seared with an intense pain. \"God damnnit!\" ----------------------------------------------------------- Maureennwas standing at the very front of the Arctic Warrior 2, the gentlensea breeze and the quiet lapping of the water at the sides wasncomforting - but made her think more about what's was going on innthe real world, a similar feeling she had 20 years ago...when shenremembered standing at the tip of her boat thinking, followed by a -n' Hey.' Maureennjumped around in surprise, Dodge was making his way towards her onnthe bow with a cuppa coffee. \"Hey y'alright?\" Shengratefully took the cup out of his hands. \"Thanks, it seems like anquite pleasant night.\" Out of the corner of her eye she saw hernhusband nod, before adding in. \"For what could be happening rightnat this moment many miles away.\" \"Honeynjust stop, I think our daughter will be safe for now...you told menawhile back he's too scared to hurt her.\" Maureennsmiled weakly before sighing. \"Yeah yeah your right.\" Shensnuggled her head into Dodge's chest as he pulled her in. Her headnslid upwards to look at him - a saucy grin on her face. \"Don'tnget any ideas.\" \"Whynnot?\" He said rather childishly, looking down at his wife.n\"Nothing's stopping us?\" \"Err...actually,nyer there is...first of all we're outside in the cold..\" \"-Wencan go inside?-\" \"...Secondly,nthe bed is too small...\" \"-Wencould lay a blanket down on the widest bit of floor-\" \"...andnthirdly I don't want that lot in there.\" Maureen indicated to thenothers sitting around the table inside. - \"Listening or evennwatching us.\" \"Spoilnsport.\" Eppsnnarrowed her eyes at him. \"I am not! I'm not in the mood...howncan you possibly think of sex at a time like this?!\" Dodge justncontinued to grin at her, even though he was hurt slightly by thencomment, he couldn't help but notice how cute she looked with rosyncheeks...especially when talking about the subject of sex. \"WhennI'm with you I always think about it.\" He received a punch in thenarm. Maureen disappeared inside followed by Dodge, they werenimmediately greeted by the smell of cooked pastry. \"Hmm somethingnsmells goood.\" Greer'snshiny head appeared over the top of the kitchen counter, a warm smilenhitched on his face, a tray came into view loaded with muffins. Dodgencouldn't help but snigger at the pink apron and his motherlynappearance. \"I didn't know you were taking care of us...err...MrsnGreer.\" Munder snorted as a half amused Greer walked to the tablenmouthing 'fuck you.' \"Fornthose interested, I learned the recipe off my mother-in-law which isna strict family secret.\" \"Whatn- that you talk to your mother-in-law.\" Santos murmured causingneveryone to chuckle. ---------------------------------------------------- Anlong leg stretched across the length of the bed - the other slightlynbent, Jack had the top of his back and his head leaned up against thenheadboard. His arm was slightly extended from when he had previouslynthrown a dart at the opposite wall. He then brought a hand up whichnwas curled up against his side and pressed it to his nose andnmouth...something rested in his hand, it was small and woollen. Asna familiar smell reached his nostrils, everything left his mind andnwas replaced with a skitso daydream. A little girl was sitting on hisnchest - no older than 3, her small legs were bent up and her chinnrested on her knees, her green eyes looked at him curiously fromnunder her gingery fringe. A confused expression passed across hisnface followed by an evil smile, the girl immediately coward from himnand slunk off the bed dragging her bottom across his body as she did.nSoon as the girl's feet touched the floor, she awkwardly wobbled onnher skinny legs and was about to fall back when Jack's hand came tonback of her neck to support her -he was amazed at how small she was.nHe knew almost instantly it was Catrina as the little girl's bodyngrew slightly taller and her feet morphed roller blades. She skatednover to the foot of the bed, and clung onto the railings looking atnJack. Catrina slipped slightly and she disappeared from view. Fornthat one moment when she disappeared he took the woollen glove fromnhis face and put it back on the bed. The room seemed to darken as henstared at the dart stuck in the opposite wall, he inhaled a deepnbreathe and exhaled condensated steam which glowed eerily - he couldnfeel his natural body temperature coming back to him - his truenessence which was beyond the body he had kept from his original life,nbeyond human, beautiful almost but sinisterly deadly. To be one ofnSatan's servants had its' many disadvantages, such as thenconstant reminder of their past life, the echo of death - especiallynof other people, the very souls he had imprisoned -he could hear thenwhispers from his quota. A smoky skull shape hovered in front of hisnface, his eyes glowed magnificently, and also the signature symbolnglowed red on his right hand. ' Oh bollocks not another recount.' Jack thought as his head slid down from the headboard, his backnarched against the covers as he felt a demonic presence in the roomnsifting through his quota. He watched the end of the bed as a pair ofngreen eyes peered over the duvet, fingers followed over the duvet -nwith fingernails painted black. He was surprised to find his daydreamnmingling with a real situation. Catrinanpulled herself up, her hair was jet black, her clothes gothic - shenhad a purple tank top with a pentagram on, black denim skirt, blackntights with purple spiders on them, and a leather jacket draped overnher. Jack looked her up and down in shock - she was hot, but lookedna bit young, 13 maybe. He remembered a time when he popped back tonBoston to check on her, and found he couldn't find her - now henknew why. Jack felt a huge jolt and Catrina disappeared, he wasnbrought back to reality and found the demonic essence had gone, and anwispy number was hovering above his hand. ' 986' Hisnbody straightened, and he stood up without pushing, he made his waynto Catrina's room thinking 'Maybe she's learnt her lessonnnow.' Which was the best way to hide a tiny trace ofnhumanitarian guilt, he wasn't the type of guy to say sorry. Jacknturned into the doorway of her room to find it empty and cold. Hisnfirst thought was had she escaped - then he closed his eyes to locatenher...nothing precise, only spark in a dark room. Katie passednthrough the wall opposite to go through another, but she wasnimmediately grabbed by Jack, she almost soiled herself. \"Where'snCatrina?!\" He turned her to face him, when she didn't respond henshook her protoplasm form violently. \"Well?\" Herneyes were round - she stuttered. \"The s-s-same place you l-left hernb-b-before.\" Hendropped her and she fell though the floor, Jack dematerialised to thensecond mail room. He reappeared in front of Catrina, her head lookednclammy and it was drooping to her chest. He kneeled down beside her,nher head rolled back up and she looked at him fearfully. \"Catrinanyou gonna get sick again...why are you still down hear you sillyngirl.\" He grabbed her arm and put it around his shoulder -but tonhis bad luck he had chosen the bad one, she screamed in pain and henimmediately dropped her in surprise. He looked back down at her andnnoticed she was clutching her arm. \"What is it?\" \"M-mynarm is dislocated.\" Jacknshuddered...had he done that? He thought. \"What's caused thatnthen?\" Catrinanlooked at him bewildered. \"How can you act like nothing happenednyou monster...you threw me into a wall!\" She winced when her armnpanged. \"You have a bad temper.\" \"Sondo you...sorta, anyway your arm please.\" He motioned towards hernand she shook her head nervously. \"I need to pop it.\" Withoutnwaiting for her response he moved quickly and pushed her down ontonthe floor. Her mind was racing she couldn't keep up with what henwas doing, so she struggled against him with one arm. \"Jackndon't it'll hurt.\" \"Inknow it will...that's why I'm holding you down and...\" Henunbuckled his belt, as he did this Catrina's heart leapt into hernmouth horrified, and just a little... \"Here bite this.\" Jacknshoved his belt into her mouth, - 'Oh my god it's gonna really hurt' He took one last glance at her face, and sighed - henleaned far forward like he was lying on top of her, his face wasnbeside hers and he was holding the top of her shoulder and her elbow.nCRACK. In a split second Catrina felt an absolute hot sharp painnfollowed by soreness, her teeth nearly pierced his belt, and itncreaked at the compression. The last thing going through Jack'snmind was how erotic the situation was, he couldn't think of whatncame next...it would be polite to stand up, offer her his hand andnescort her where she wanted. But the predicament had seemed to havenchanged his mind, he had no belt on, she was currently gagged, and henwas lying on top of her. Not to mention she will probably be veryngrateful for fixing her arm...very grateful. Catrinansensed the awkwardness of the situation and murmured through thenbelt. \"Can you get off me now.\" Well that fantasy lasted long .nAnd as much as he would of loved her to offer him the 'chance'-therenwould have been dire consequences. He moodily got up and stood upnover her, she was slowly pushing herself up, wearily glancing at hisnintimidating form above her - at times like these she felt likenwhimpering, but surely he would get pleasure from that, so she wouldnput a brave face on. Jack was observing her with a trained eye -hisnhead lazily leaning back slightly. Catrinanpiped up avoiding his gaze. \"Are we going to go somewhere Jack ornwhat.\" \"Sure.\"nHis reply came out as a whisper, which sounded more creepy thanninnocent. \"After you.\" He seized her arm and guided her forwardsnout the door - this time she will have to walk herself through thenwater, since carrying her will increase his hunger for pain andnintimacy. He thought as he made his way down the corridor with her;nwill there ever be a time where they will be in the same room fornover 20 minutes without yelling at or harming each other...nah-nprobably not. Anger surged through his veins and bore in his eyes, henfelt like ripping her to pieces or nibbling on her tender flesh, butnonce again he couldn't, and the best way to deal with it is tonblame her and take it out on her. If it got to out of hand he thoughtnat least he could use his promotion against her and satisfy himselfnwhile killing her in the process, he smiled a rueful smile which thennfaded when he heard an 'OUCH!' Catrinanrubbed her arm fiercely. \"Jack don't grip so hard.\" He starednafter her as she walked on ahead...he could tell she was desperatelyntrying to avoid him. Shenscurried upstairs hoping to put a distance between them. Even thoughnher tiny tiny crush had chipped down her hatred, it had heightenednher fear of him...she was scared of herself in his presence. Jacknvoice reached out to her again. \"Not so fast Cat.\" \"Justnleave me alone.\" \"NonCatrina...I can't leave you alone, you are my responsibility, notnin the protective way, but more like keeping you in check.\" Shenstopped abruptly, it felt hurtful to feel used. -\"Younhaven't even thanked me for popping your arm.\" Jack's eyesnsoftened as she turned while tipping her head, her innocence wasnnever hidden, especially when wearing that nightdress. Her childlikenvoice caused his heart to temporarily stop, and he felt slightlynangered he felt that way. \"What?!...ButnJack you caused the accident, I haven't even heard an apology yet.\" Catrinancouldn't believe he was still blanking out the harm he had done. Hensmiled charmingly at her. \"If that's all it takes for you tonthrow your arms around me, and maybe have a little drink then...I'mnsorry.\" Jack had forced it out, even after he said it he knew itnsounded bland and cocky, it was a big mistake. 'Shit' Catrina had given him a ' You jerk' look and marched offndown the hall. He growled irritably and followed with a storm abovenhis head. \"I'm sorry!\" He called through grit teeth, he shooknhis head - this was going to be harder than he thought, it had to benso different with Catrina -since she wasn't a slut he would have tonmean his apologies -and actually use his mind and voice. Jackndematerialised and appeared in front of her, causing a 'Woh.' Tonirrupt from her small mouth - not to mention kissable. \"Cannyou stop with the appearing.\" Waving her arms flagrantly butnkeeping her guard on. \"Look...fornsome reason I'm having trouble lying to you, so when I say I'mnsorry, I mean I'm sorry.\" Catrina tried to walk by him, butnwalked into his arm which was extended to the opposite wall to make anbarrier, she ducked to go under, but he was ready for her and henstuck his leg out. She whined slightly - knowing there was going tonbe a scuffle. Jack swapped his arms around when making the barrier tontease and confuse her as she tried to squeeze through, and she endednup in a comical position with her waist locked between his arm andnleg which were currently making the barrier. She grumbled in defeat. \"Inhaven't got a choice have I?\" Hensmiled his white cocky grin. \"Nope.\" \"Wellnyou're forgiven, and thank you for popping my arm.\" \"Greatnnow gimme a hug.\" \"Uhnuh.\" Jacknlaughed half heartedly and dragged her down the corridor, Catrinanmeanwhile contemplated how much she feared and loathed him, then hernheart suddenly fluttered when he hooked his arm through hers. ------------------------------------- \"Fullnspeed ahead .\" Maureen called upstairs, Santos pushed a levernforwards which throttled Arctic Warrior 2 faster across the waves. nDodge was sitting at the table looking over maps with Murphy. \"Arrmen...thisnis going to take ages. We've been stuck in the same God-damn spotnall this time.\" Dodge's remorse caused his compass' point tonsink through the paper and into the solid wood of the table. Maureennrounded her husband with an arm around his waist, trying to calm him. \"Hownlong is it going to take Dad?\" Murphy stared at the map unsure hownto tell his daughter. His finger remained where they were on thenmap-, he sighed. \"I don't know... 2 weeks, but we're still notneven sure if the Antonia Graza is in the Bering sea.\" Murphy voicenwas beyond reassuring, and all he could do was stare into a pair ofnheartbroken faces, he felt guilty that he couldn't make anynpromises, he felt shit that he couldn't step forward and take carenof everything for them. Jack had put a lot of work into screwing upnpeoples lives, and he had done it successfully with no remorse, hisngranddaughter was with Jack right now doing who-knows-what to tormentnher, and he was helpless...and he could see it in Maureen and Dodgesneyes that they felt the same way too. ------------------------------------------------ Catrinanwas sitting at the bar with Jack, he was pouring out an orangeynliquid. She rested her chin in the palm of her hand lookingnsuspiciously at him. \"Is that...whiskey?\" Jacknbeforehand had considered giving her coke, but had a sudden urge tongive her something stronger in order to have the pleasure of watchingnher squirm at the taste and the after affect. By the look of her shenmight have never drunk in her life. He caught himself off guardnsniggering, and had to calm himself before Catrina looked disturbed. Too late. \"What'snso funny?\" Jacknraised his head and looked upon her with a plain face which he couldndo very well. \"Nothing... just imagining what you would look likendrunk?\" \"Probablynthe same as you.\" Her finger had began to swirl in the orangenliquid. \"Dangerous and always laughing when not necessary.\" \"Andnyou would know that would you?\" He poured himself a glass - a fullnglass. \"Well Cat, you would be wrong, I don't get drunk, mynsystem doesn't allow it - so nothing happens.\" He knocked backnhis full glass of whiskey while observing her over his glass with ankeen eye, he never cringed or pulled a face as he brought the glassnfrom his lips and settled it down opposite hers. Catrina hatednchallenges she knew she couldn't win, she had no chance againstnhim. The whiskey was beginning to burn her finger and she withdrewnher finger from the glass, and used it to push away from her. \"Younhaven't even tried it yet?\" He said in a high mocking tone. \"Indon't have to, I already know it's gonna burn my throat as itngoes down and make me go yack.\" \"It'snalcohol...that's what it does kid, come on just take a sip.\" Ansudden jerky movement he made on his stool to shuffle towards herncaused her to stiffen then hesitantly move her hand off the table,nJack noticing her change in body language - knew he was sitting tonclose, so he turned slightly towards the bar, and placed his nikies'non the foot bar, he glanced sideways to notice to his 'non'-surprise;nher hand was back on the table. \"Surely you must have drunk alcoholnbefore.\" \"Ohnyes I have, but not whiskey, I find whiskey a drink for thendepressed, like those lonely guys in bars, drowning themselves inndrink, and slurring on about their problems to the barmaid or somenrandom guy sitting next to them.\" When she had finished she lookednback at Jack to see him staring at her intently, Catrina couldnactually feel him trying to sift through her mind, and she pullednherself out of his eyes. \"What are you trying to see.\" \"You.\"nHe said plainly, he then indicated to the whiskey. \"Nonthanks.\" \"Donyou smoke?\" \"No...you?\" Catrinanwatched his hand disappear into his coat pocket, he pulled out anpacket of cigarettes and put them onto the table. No sooner had henput the packet down, he had got one out and put it in his mouth, andnwas lighting it. Catrinancouldn't help but stare, they way he smoked was so hypnotic, butnshe thought nigatine was so disgusting. \"Right that's anothernthing I'm going to write on the things I hate about Jack list.\" Jackngrinned with the cig still between his lips. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- SorrynI took so long I've been on holiday.[Chapter 15] Don'tnpanic people... Andnanother thing - sorry about the way I write; more description thannspeech, I don't do it all the time...so bare with me. ----------------------------- Maureennquietly clambered onto the deck of the Antonia Graza with the help ofnher husband who closely followed behind her. The rough surface causednher feet to crunch on the deck and she came to a halt -flagging hernarms down irritably to hush herself, she waited for someone to comenthrough the door -but no one came, and she signalled the others tonfollow. Greer was the last to climb on deck, he tightly clutched ancrowbar in one hand. Maureen was already ahead of them and wasngradually opening a rusty door. The heartache she felt made her blindnas she found herself walking through the hall without checking in anyndirection, she heard her crew dragging their feet and she wasnsurprised to find she didn't care. Her mind was only on herndaughter and her whereabouts. A chill crept down her spine as shenwalked by the infamous Francesca poster, and she imagined Greer'snreaction would be the same too. She felt someone grab her hand andnassumed it was Dodge. \"Okay you guys I was' thinking we shouldnsplit up.\" \"No.\"nThey finished in unison. Maureen nodded and continued on down ancorridor with the rest following behind, she heard Munder mumble. \"Itnhasn't changed much.\" \"Heynas long as don't have to pull your stinking carcass onto the rightnfloor then I don't care.\" Maureennhad her wits about her as she quickly turned the corner shining herntorch up ahead, she felt like the others had held their breath as shendid. \"Clear.\" They exhaled together and proceeded down to thenbottom. Suddenlynan eerie whistle rung out from the bow of the ship, and she heard thenothers come to a dramatic halt behind her, Epps turned towards Dodgenwho was looking slightly unnerved, she felt like she had nothing tonreassure him or the others. \"Okay, lets go that way.\" Maureennindicated back where they had came with her light. Hernboots hardly made a sound when walking along the rusted ironnflooring, but her breath was audible -and came out in faint wisps.nThe mist from her breath cleared and a door came into sight at thenbottom of the hall - Ah...that chill again down the spine, thisnquest seems too easy. It pissed her off slightly at how easy thensituation was becoming - Something must be wrong . Not too soonnhad she thought this, Santos came out with. \"It's too quiet,nisn't something supposed to happen by now?\" Maureennhad a hunch someone was waiting behind the door, and boy did shenfeel ready - She signalled the others to press on with her ahead,nher feet non -hesitantly padded along the floor, her arm extended innfront of her, her hand hit the cold brass of the handle - she turnednit... Herneyes fluttered open, she was staring at her bedroom ceiling on thenArctic Warrior 2. She wiped non existent tears from her eyes andngroggily made her way out, she heard murmuring of a conversationngoing on above her. ...n\"Hey that was one Christmas party I'll remember.\" \"Yeahnit was pretty special, the whole gang...those Swedish girls.\"n(APE NOISES) \"Like an office party really but withnwater...and...err...body shots.\" Maureen heard a few sniggers asnshe made her way upstairs. When she reached the top the room fellnsilent. \"What'sna matter, embarrassed?\" She commented with a sly smirk. Her husbandncheeks tinted slightly. \"You know you never really told me aboutnthe whole Helga and Vanessa incident...\" \"Aaa...wellnyou know honey it was all just a blur.\" Maureennraised her eyebrows. \"Not a minute ago it wasn't.\" Mike coughednuneasily and made his way into the mini-helm, while everyone elsenobserved him with cheesy grins smeared across their faces. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- \"You'vengone quiet.\" Jack was slumped in a couch looking across at the girlnat the bar. Her head was facing the porthole, as if she wasndeliberately avoiding him. A smile came to his features, he wasnbreaking her down, she was becoming slightly fragile - but onlynslightly, her will power had so many layers he couldn't possiblynleave her a blubbering wreck. For about 10 minutes or so he hadnprobed her with questions about her past, and after a few... hensensed a hidden tormented fear and anger buried under the surface ofnher strained answers. He guessed it was a toned down version ofnlosing the will to live, and he didn't know weather to stop - ornkeep going to make her suffer. Then again she might start ...crying. \"Whatndo you think your parents are doing right now?\" Jack propped hisnfeet up upon a coffee table in front of him. \"Mustnyou go on, I know your punishing my parents by keeping me here, fornno apparent reason.\" \"Ingave them their lives, you were the thing your mum dumped to saveneveryone else.\" The corner of his mouth twinged. \"Be thankful.\" \"Justnstop it!\" Catrina banged on the bar with her fist, her head wentndown next - she could feel herself crying. How could he be sonheartless she thought, this was supposed to be a sorry drink not anfurther beating when you're down sort of thing. Catrina reflectednon how nice he was in the first 5 minutes, then suddenly thenatmosphere deteriorated. She sucked in her breath and lifted her headnoff the bar and turned towards him her emerald eyes bright. \"Sontell me about your parents?\" Jack looked slightly taken aback, andnshe sort of marvelled at the punched in the chest look on him, notndwelling on if she was digging too deep. \"What,nwhat, what the fuck...?!\" All Jack could get out, dare she ask. Henput his whiskey glass on the table. \"Woman you did not just ask menthat?\" Catrina sat back slightly, worried he was going to leapnacross the coffee table and pounce on her. \"Heynso you can ask me, but I can't ask you?\" She shrieked standingnup. \"Kidndo you seriously go around asking?\" \"NO...butnyou asked me.\" Jump behind the bar and cower, wait-NO \"Don't call me kid, I'm not a kid, and your not my Dad!\" Jacknsettled down, and took a drag from his cigarette. \"Let's justnleave it.\" After a few sighs and seconds of silence. Catrina foundnherself crossing the room towards him to sit on the couch. He onlynlooked up when she was about to sit sown. \"I wouldn't do that ifnI were you.\" Catrina was half way down, and she turned to look atnhim, \"Ohndear he's fell out with me.\" \"Nonit's not that...all this sexual tension has made me kind of horny.\"nHe finished, Catrina's look of disgust caused him to charminglynsneer. \"Younwouldn't.\" \"OhnI would, but I won't .\" Jack stubbed out his end on the table.n(hehe his end). He didn't know why he had bothered, every singlenthing he would throw out of his mouth to dampen out the vibe keptnbeing thrown back at him with a more intense rush of energy, sexualnenergy that is. He knew the one thing that kind of turned him off wasnblubbering - but that didn't happen, then he thought yelling abusenat her would bring out the hatred he felt towards her - then shenwould kind of turn all angry and cute, which made his loins sing. Henbrought his attention to her once more to find her staring off intonspace, and he craved to know what she was exactly thinking. Catrinanhad a ray of things going through her mind, why was she sitting onnthe couch, what was he going to do with his hands empty. At the timenhis cigarette kept him sort of occupied from him touching her. Damn, she felt all stiff and in the need of a good stretch, she quicklynglanced at Jack, his eyes were closed, and he looked fairly peaceful.nShe thought she might-as-well go. She pulled herself up, denyingnherself a stretch, and began to make her way out cautiously. \"Sitnback down.\" \"I,nI thought you were done with me.\" Catrina had her hand on the doornknob. \"Carento rephrase that.\" She could just imagine the plastered smirk onnhis face. Not daring to disobey him, she dragged her feet back to thencouch and eyed him while plonking herself down. His skin had gonenslightly paler...than usual, she saw his Adam's apple jerk innhis throat as he swallowed - something didn't feel right. His lipsnformed the words. \"Just try and go to sleep.\" Notnto sure she felt like it, she brought her feet up (so they were innbetween her and Jack) and curled up into a ball, Catrina closed herneyes. Silence followed for another 2 minutes. ' Damn- this isncosy...okay I'll just rest my eyes for a bit then sneak outnlater.' Katienwas sitting in front of her now reading her what sounded like anbed-time story. \"Katie what are you doing?.\" \" Justnrelax deary...free your mind, escape your conscience, your in thenland of nod.\" \" I'mnnot asleep, I'm just resting my eyes.\" Catrina replied ratherngroggily. \" Hu...surenyou are, doesn't matter anyway...your safe, it's just you andnme on cloud nine.\" Catrina quirked her eyebrow. \"What'snwrong... don't you trust me?\" Katie questioned putting down hernbook. \" Nonit's not that, it's just if I'm dreaming you...how come it'snweirdly.\" \" Allndreams are weird deary.\" Katie leaned forward and stroked her hair.n\"Just focus on me, and only me...your not in any danger...nonenwhat so ever.\" Catrina's lips twinged with a warm relaxed smile.nSuddenly a gush of air blew over her, she looked up at Katienquestioningly and unable to speak, Katie was glancing away fromnher...her eyes returned to Catrina's once more. \"Nothing tonworry about.\" She sensed something was not quite right and tried tonpull out of her calm mode, she tempted to turn her head, but wasngreeted by Katie's hand which she used to guide her back to focusnon her. Catrinanfound her voice and whispered gently \"What's going on?\" A coldnfinger had started to work it's way up her leg, it felt like anthreat - an invasion of her womanhood as it passed her knee. Justnbefore she could lift her hand up to push the harassing finger awayn-Katie grabbed hold of her arm rather cruelly. \" Thisnis serious now Katie let go of my arm!\" She couldn't think whynshe was doing this, taking away her sense of security, preventing hernfrom protecting herself. Katie during their struggle had decided tonsit on her chest. \"Get off me!\" Thenlittle English girl shook her head. \"Just let him touch you.\" \" NonI won't allow it!\" Catrina shrieked, on the brink of tears. Shenheard distant sniggering and wished to slap who ever was doing it. Anrush of air rushed past her face - she was spinning, then she wasn't.nHer foot clipped something rather sharply and she yelped. Katie wasnnow holding a knife to her throat, she didn't dare twitch ornswallow, fearing the skin on her neck might graze the blade. Catrinandidn't know how she could concentrate on anything else besides thenknife, but she noticed a very smug looking Francesca leering at hernabove Katie's shoulder. Francescanegged Katie on. \"Slice ze bitch, go on, slice ze bitch.\" And withnthat Katie smiled more sinisterly and grappled Cat's hair to bringnher closer. \" Pleasendon't do this.\" Was all Catrina could say. \"I'm your friend,ndon't listen to Francesca she has never liked me.\" \" Francescanis my new friend now -we have more in common, death.\" Fran placed anhand on Kate's shoulder. \"But I guess you could join us...there'snplenty of room for the dead... And I don't think Jack'llnmind shagging a corpse.\" The blade pressed into a throat andnpierced the thin layer of pale skin, Catrina screamed in terror,nexpecting pain as she thrashed around. Her hand came up to pull awaynthe blade to prevent it sinking any deeper...Katie faded away andnwas replaced with Jack clutching her wrists. \"Woahncalm down.\" Jack exclaimed. \"I'mndieing...I'm dieing!!!\" She was yelping like a mad woman, andnbeing heavily restrained. \"You'rennot dieing.\" \"W...where'snthe knife?\" \"Knife?!\" \"Thenblood...\" Catrina felt her neck urgently still eyeing the floor fornthe blade. Jack reached for her head and pushed it back slightly tonstretch her neck skin, Catrina shuddered when she felt him trace hisnfinger down her windpipe. Jack who had seen many throats in his lifen- at that moment in time thought how it was the softness neck he hadnever felt. He reluctantly withdrew his finger after the examinationnwith a disgruntled look upon his features. \"Younwoke me up for this?\" Catrinanshuffled further away on the couch. \"I'm sorry...I I had annightmare.\" She felt awkward and indecent all of a sudden. \"WasnI in it?\" \"No.\" \"Thennit wasn't a nightmare...Goodnight.\" Covers materialised out ofnthin air and fell upon Jack as he settled back down. \"Now don'tnwake me unless your actually being murdered, I hate being awake withnyou around - means I have to fight off my ere...\"Jack fell silentn- he didn't want to reveal too much. 'Why on earth did I asknher to stay...when I knew I would get like this?' his eyesnbecame slits as he shut Catrina out of his mind. Itnwasn't Catrina's fault she was so pretty, wasn't her fault shenhad stayed, wasn't her fault that Jack had deliberately touched hernup in her sleep. Notnwanting to stay any longer and provoke any bad dreams, or Jack'snmisbehaviour - she pushed herself up and crept out of the room andndown the hall to her room. As she came through the door she let out ansqueak as Francesca wispy form eyed her from the bed. \"Yes?\"nStill weary about the events of her dream. Francescansilently leaned and fell back on the covers, an irritated sighnescaped her dead lips. \"Please tell me you haven't.\" \"Howncan he? ...I would be dead wouldn't I?...And what makes younthink I would go ahead with it?\" Catrina wrapped her arms aroundnher - protecting herself from the cold. An uneasy look snuck acrossnher features. --------------------------------------------------------- Sorryntook so long, sorry so short. R&R;[Chapter 16] This is the updated version Dodge was having a run through the kitchen, draws where being opened and shut left - right, and centre. One draw he came across squeaked as it moved along the slider and he cringed. \"Aa...\" \"Hey Maureen we might have to oil-\" His eyes fell on the silver heart locket, he recognised it as the pendant which Maureen had wore on their wedding day. He scooped it up. \"Maureen come 'ere and take a look at this.\" Santos head popped up from the stairwell. \"Hey man she won't hear you, she's outside in the rain.\" Dodge took a gander out through the glass and onto the deck. He was right, she was standing in the rain in her trench coat, looking south. He tapped on the window. Catrina's head popped around the side of the kitchen cupboard, at the same time her hand slid across the floor to balance her current position which ended up slipping through some stale gunk. \"Eew.\" She wiped it on her skirt and pulled her body upright so she was completely hidden behind the cupboard. She stiffened when she heard the door creak behind her. There was a giggle followed by a pale hand suddenly coming from around the corner and grabbing Cat's shoulder. \"Gotcha.\" Katie jeered. \"Damn, when am I going to win.\" She gave an exaggerated pout as she very -unlady like got up. \"Probably when you have the capability of sticking you protoplasmic head through ceilings and walls.\" Catrina tied her redy-brown hair back. \"Alright smarty pants.\" It had already occurred to her they were too old to be playing this game. \"5 out of 6\". \"Only if you get Franny to join in.\" Katie observed Catrina features drop from a smiley exterior to a look of dread. \"Oh come on she isn't that bad.\" Catrina shrugged her shoulders, she knew there wasn't any harm letting Katie's new friend play, but knowing Fran was looking around for her for entertainment she found quite iffy. 'Come to think of that she already does that.' Katie smiled knowing exactly what her companion was thinking, she was immediately pulled out of thought when she felt the sensation of a new soul entering the pack, or something tiltering on the rim of a quota cup. The smell of new born death was in the air and she prayed to God that Catrina couldn't feel it too, or not see the ceiling tiles shaking. Unfortunately Cat was looking at the ceiling, with a totally different look of dread with sickly green cheeks. Kate was sure Catrina could hear the screams, that was probably because there were audible screams. Her eye level came down to meet Katie's once more. Her voice was but a whisper. \"He's done it again hasn't he.\" Katie regretfully nodded. \"Poor woman.\" She had shrunk herself down to the frightened self where she would wrap her arms around herself, and coyly look at her feet. It almost brought her to tears knowing that while she had been dallying, a girl had been murdered in a sexually explicit way. Jack had won that round, had she been aware he was at his little games again, she would of come crashing into the room and separate the ...she thought of a word 'intercoursing coupling', that made her laugh, but she pulled herself together realising how serious the situation was. Katie pitifully stared at her, she was off on one her day dreams again. \"A-hem.\" Catrina jumped causing her spaghetti strap to slip off of her shoulder. \"I'll go hide shall I?\" \"You're a ghost, it's easier for you.\" Before the argument even commenced Katie had already whizzed down the hall, and vanished. Catrina abruptly closed her mouth so she didn't resemble a cod fish. The game had begun again, and she was already bored...and very depressed; another murder, sleepless nights...and she had begun to have vivid dreams of Jack half drowning her in a bath of blood then trying to rape her, she shuddered, luckily she would always wake up before his boxers came down, sadly. She broke into a horrified stare ' Oh shit I was disappointed I didn't see his love stick.' She gasped this time. 'Uek...since when did I use the term love stick, ...huh and where would the love reside exactly.' Catrina came to the conclusion she had finally snapped. \"I sink you've gone mad.\" A drawling voice said, Francesca had faded into view. \"You are staring and gasping aza empty space.\" Catrina eyed her defensively. \"You haven't driven me to edge yet.\" She said folding her arms trying to look tough. \"I was remembering.\" The Italian woman simply clucked her tongue and floated towards her, but not invading her personal space, Catrina uncrossed her arms and adjusted her spaghetti strap. \"You may sink you are a big gurl now, but you a still afraid of ze whole world that 'evolves azound you.\" Catrina hadn't expected for her to come out with something as random as that, and had nothing to say on it. She saw Fran fade slightly, and distinctly felt her spiral her cold protoplasm around her, her red lips inches from her ear. \"Your wallz are showing cracks.\" Catrina quivered she didn't turn her face to meet Fran's. \"In coming.\" Frans had disappeared leaving her with those words as she had left a chill in the air. \"What?\" It came clear when Jack walked around the corner, he was buttoning up his shirt not paying attention to where he as going. Catrina felt all she needed to do was stand dead still and wait for her legs to start working. He looked up last minute to see a girl looking like a deer caught in headlights. \"Catrina.\" He didn't physically say it but she noticed it played on his lips, and his usually cold sadistic eyes had hints of warmth in them, which looked completely alien. He grunted or more like cleared his throat as he finished doing up his last button. \"How long have you been standing there.\" \"Long enough.\". She wanted to pretend she didn't know, so she bolted. There will be no more awkward situations if she kept moving and Jack didn't stop her, he wasn't in the mood. She ran up a stairwell to her floor and rushed passed many ghosts until she came to her room, the door closed by itself before she could reach for it, Catrina calmed when Katie manifested in front of her outstretched hand on the door knob. \"Her name was Lily she was a Con-Artist, she's been to prison once and she married a bank robber.\" \"Oh\". Catrina said and sat on the bed. \"But I bet she has never killed anyone.\" Katie shook her head. \"She only stole\". \"And that was her punishment.\" Her face contorted as if about to cry but she didn't and lay back on her bed. \"How many more.\" \"Until the quotas full.\" Catrina who had her hands pressed over her eyes, she had heard of this quota before. \"How many souls?...left to go that is, not how many he's got already.\" \"Don't know...not many, it's pretty crowded.\" Katie closed her eyes. \"I would say they are pretty lucky now.\" Catrina quirked her eyebrow, and sat up appalled. \"Sorry?\" Katie ashamed to say it cringed at the look on her face. \"I mean the method isn't as terrible as it used to be.\" Catrina's expression had still not changed. \"It's not a total slaughter, it's a little drainy thing.\" \"Any method used to extract a soul out of a living person is inhumane.\" She exclaimed her eyes wild, she flopped back down on the bed, her hair fanned across the duvet. \"I'm not going to escape from this place, I don't want to, I can't bare to leave him doing his dirty work, I have to stop him some how.\" \"You don't think you're the only one that has tried, we've had demon slayers that have hunted him down and have fallen at the last hurdle.\" Katie did the blade across the throat sign with the sound affect. \"Wow, you mean like warriors, like Buffy?\" \"What the bloody hell's a Buffy?\" \"It's not a thing it's a fictional super hero girl that slays vampires and demons.\" Catrina exclaimed. \"...From a tv show.\" She felt stupid adding that in. \"What kind of things do they show on tv nowadays?\" \"Well it's a pretty old tv show now...but please tell me what they were really like...the demon slayers?\" Katie noticed Catrina's excitement, she thought it would be an ideal opportunity to take her mind of things. \"Well it wasn't a girl for starters, it was a half human -half serpent thing, which didn't have any weapons at all, just a force field to repel items and persons away and into walls and such.\" \"Ooo…..similar to stuff seen on Buffy, and Harry Potter.\" \"Yes well, whatever.\" Katie not having a clue what these things were. \"There was this rugged guy, he was human, he carried UV, silver, and gold bullets, not much good though.\" \"We're picking something up on radar.\" Santos was tapping the screen getting the others attention. \"Oooo is this it, is this it ….I'm ready, I'm ready man.\" Greer was jumping on the spot, punching air, while the others looked on in amusement. \"Erm, I don't think it is, we have another 400 hundred miles, I think it's a cruise liner, or a coast prowler.\" \"Oh man I was siked, I was in the mood for War.\" Murphy pulled Greer to his seat. \"How could any one look forward to War.\" It had been awhile since Munder had said anything. \"I know I'm a big mocho man, but I need a plan and some serious ammo before I can stop feeling this ….unnerved.\" \"We have a plan, it involves dynamite.\" Murphy lifted the box up and dropped it. \"And we have no intention of running in blindly, or hunting down Jack to lynch him, we were going to sneak Catrina off.\" \"Gotcha Cap, the old sneak on, sneak off, and light the fuse trick.\" Munder had a sarcastic tone, but Murphy hadn't picked up on that and walked out looking pleased he had settled something. \"That is the perfect why to fight the good fight, and give the ultimate payback.\" Munder added half yelling after him. \"It's the next best thing.\" Maureen piped up, she knew full well she was going to get an earful. \"Why the hell did you reunite the whole gang for this mission if were not going to battle it out with the one thing that almost broke us apart!\" \"You are going to battle it out, but with dynamite.\" \"-Not the same!\" Dodge stepped between the two of them. \"Jack's a demon, you can't win with fists fights, and another thing don't you thing before this mission we were already broken apart, this is what has brought us together again!\" Silence followed. \"…You know what you absolutely right, nothing has been gained, and we are going to lose it again.\" \"You can redeem yourself on 'it's' death, and we will have our daughter back, that's what's important, Munder.\" Dodge walked behind his wife and placed both hands firmly on her shoulder. Catrina splashed her face with water from the basin, the room was cold so the moisture made it icy. She peered over at the cracked mirror on the dressing table, her pale face looked ghostly. The water made her feel clean, but her face wasn't the place she was worried about, she wanted a bath or a shower but there weren't any about, she hadn't bathed properly in weeks, she relied on the basin in her room with working taps with stale water. Catrina recalled her only moment of total freshness during capture was when she jumped over board, but she wasn't going to repeat that moment of madness. She strolled into her bedroom in her underwear, her eyes went to the door that was closed, locked and barricaded, with a t -shirt hanging on the door knob covering the key-hole, for obvious reasons. Her wardrobe which was now missing a door since she had used it to burn on deck one time, was running low on clothes, she had tried cleaning them herself, but the stale water and lack of warm air made it difficult to freshen fabric. Catrina selected a pea green jumper, and track suit bottoms and slipped into them as quickly as possible. She flicked her hair out of the jumper, her locks were dull but not greasy, they had been washed, but without shampoo just stale soap. She missed her coconut shampoo, and strawberry and kiwi shower gel, plus her trusty tin of Vaseline which she would apply to her under eyes and lips. Catrina brought herself back to the room, aha a hairbrush… the only mundane thing which was familiar to her was a hairbrush that sat on the dressing table. Wasn't her hairbrush, it was Katie's, but it was lent to her. Her hair untangled immediately with a stroke, and she felt totally pampered after a minute. The door knob clicked and clunked harshly in the wood, Catrina's head snapped around. \"It's locked.\" she called. The knob continued to twitch, and the t-shirt dropped from the ball onto the chair against the door. \"I said it's locked!\" The sound that followed was a slight bang, followed by a second which lead to the door jutting out of the frame, the chair roared as it was pushed slightly across the boards. The third bang brought the door open, and sent the chair tipping. Jack was leaning on the door, in a position blatantly obvious that he had forced it open. \"I did say it was locked.\" Jack looked up at her sternly. \"Yeah well I knew you weren't going to unlock it.\" He broke into a smile, which went to his eyes...almost. \"What were you doing?\" it was almost like a cheeky question. \"Nothing I wanted privacy.\" She had a desire to smile back but reframed from doing so. \"You know… how you like it sometimes.\" He did a little ecstatic groan. \"Oh yes, and you know how I like it.\" He did a little jerk into to the room, and hipped the door close. Catrina rolled her eyes, he was giving her dirty talk, Jack noticed this and slyly coiled his lip, he picked up the tipped over chair. \"I better return this to its normal position….on all fours.\" Catrina waited. \"Do you like it on all fours.\" Catrina grumbled. \"The chair yes, not as a sexual position!\" \"Oooooo, you got it.\" Jack ruffled her hair, Catrina used her brush to wack him in the abdomen. \"Ooo I like S and M.\" Catrina jumped out of her seat, and backed away. \"Stop it, stop it now, you have no need to do this.\" Jack sat into to her seat. \"I do have a need to do this, I need to get satisfaction one way or another.\" \"You should be more careful.\" She adjusted her jumper. \"You don't understand the danger.\" \"I didn't know you cared.\" \"Not you, it's me I'm scared for, you're just the cause.\" She barged past him, the door was close, but she felt his hand grab her upper arm tightly, she was startled. \"I'm only going to the kitchen.\" \"Oh, that's alright then.\" She heard his voice drawl out, Catrina made for the door again, and again she was stopped by the hand which was still clutching her arm. \"Don't forget your place.\" He then squeezed her arm cruelly. \"I should always leave the room first.\" He gave a little tug, and even though it wasn't forceful, it still sent her back speedily and caused her to be wonky on her feet. She watched him go through the door, he reached for the handle to close it behind him, he paused. \"What I came here to say in the first place was don't go near the engine room or the post room because it totally flooded, due to a gash in the bow.\" It came out calmly. \"We're sinking!\" Catrina freaked she didn't want to be in a sinking ship, it was one of the worst things that could happen apart from being in a fire. \"What are we going to do?\" Jack alien blue eyes cut right through her. \"Nothing.\" He closed door with no expression on his face, which left Catrina wondering if he was just trying to freak her out. She came out of her room to see Jack turning into his room. \"Is this some kind of a joke, if we sink…..we die!\" She was calling in the direction of his room. His voice was clear as bell as it responded through the wall. \"I won't!\" \"Do you want the ship to sink?\" \"It's not going to sink Cat, I won't let it!\" Catrina breathed a sigh of relief. \"What's the plan then…..are we going to land?\" She hid the hopefulness from her voice. \"Salvagers, I will bring them to repair the ship.\" Catrina knew this was a ploy for another massacre, as she remembered her mother and father were salvagers. \"You're not killing them, you let them repair, then you let them go.\" She waltz down the corridor, there wasn't a response which unnerved her. \"Hey, promise me you will let them go.\" No response. She knocked attentively. Oh he's not getting out of it that easily. \"Jack are you listening?\" He couldn't possibly he would have to find some sinning salvagers, and have sex with them all. \"Jack these salvagers are good people they don't need to be collected.\" She turned her head sideways to listen for a response, nothing. Her hand twisted the door knob, it was locked. Catrina sunk onto her knees and pressed her eye to the keyhole, she couldn't see movement, all she could make out was the edge of a bed, a lone chair and the porthole above it. He must have left already . She rushed back to her room and picked up a steel nail, she had never picked a 'door' lock before, but there was a first time for everything. The nail fit into the lock easily, she held the knob and frequently twisted it as she clunked and clicked about. The nail pressed against a spring, and the knob twisted fully around, just by tapping the door it swung open. \"So much stuff, so little time.\" Her voice was hitched up like a witches, and she wiggled her fingers evilly. Her eyes fell on a little box on a dressing table. \"And what's in here.\" She fingered the lid up. There was a ball of paper, and a pendant, and with no surprise to Catrina, a small dagger. She picked up the pendant, it was a black stone surrounded by a coil of steel wire. She opened the paper ball to discover a birth certificate. Her eyes went straight to the date ' 12 th April 1918.' Then she viewed the name with puzzlement Mary Anne O'Riley , the certificate was Irish. ' What in the world is he doing with this?' She folded the paper neatly and put it back into the box. She drew herself away from the dressing table, and investigated the wardrobe, there were clothes but nothing out of the ordinary. A cardboard box sat on the top of a shelf, which she pulled down. She found a personal cassette player, an empty bottle of tequila, and a year book. She didn't hesitate having a flick through that. The date '1953' was inscrolled in gold on the inside cover and was bound to be an interesting read. She looked through it page by page, trying to piece together something significant by looking up names, but it all seemed random. Catrina couldn't find Mary Anne in the book, ' but then again why would she be in the book ,she would be to old to go to high school…But not if she was a teacher.' Her fingers flicked to the back of the book, she went through all the teachers, nothing. A new thought came into her mind. ' Don't be stupid Catrina, Mary is an Irish Citizen.' She closed the book and sat it in its box, her back rested on the bed post observing the box. ' Jack Ferriman.' She brought the book back onto her lap, and focused on the names on every page. There were Several Jacks but none Ferrimans. ' Silly Catrina, Ferriman is an Alias for ferryman, shipper of souls.' She flipped the pages like a pack of cards, and came across a very thick page which happened to be two pages stuck together. Catrina delicately prized them away from each other, her eyes came to rest on the name 'Jack O'Riley' and her capturers face stared right up at her. ' Oh my god, he's old…er than I thought, he's indestructible .' She was horrified, this was beyond her head, he wasn't just a soul collector, he had a life before this, many years before this, and his mother was Irish, and by her own calculations had scandalously at the time, given birth to Jack, aged 19. She brushed the image with her finger. With her mind locked in deep thought she didn't notice Katie floating in through the door. \"Nosy nosy.\" Catrina jumped as she looked up. \"Oh Katie thank god it's you.\" Catrina turned the book in the English girl's direction. \"Look look, Jack aged 16, 1953.\" She poked the page with her digit. \"Yes I already knew.\" \"And you didn't tell me!\" \"Sorry deary.\" \"So this ship is a 1960s….eer ship.\" Catrina said not quite believing it. \"Yep, pretty old.\" Katie responded unfazed. \"Have you figured out the part where Jack's mother is Irish.\" Catrina eyes almost glazed over. \"Yeah, and I feel I know to much.\" Katie feeling slightly sorry for her, sat on the bed and stroked her hair. \"Well I wouldn't say you know everything.\" Katie chimed. Catrina closed the book with a thump. \"I have time.\" \"Actually I can't go into any more details, it's too stressful, and Bobby is nagging me.\" Catrina happened to glance up towards the door and notice a friendly looking steward's head looking at her. Katie continued. \"He's a little over protective.\" \"Can you blame me?\" Santos had made the chair in the helm his home, his body was tugged snugly into a sleeping bag, and his head was drooping to one side, his hat pulled over his eyes. He stirred as someone creaked upstairs behind him. \"I'm awake.\" He sat up knocking over a packet of potato chips. \"Yeah No shit.\" Santos smiled when he recognised Greer's voice \"Is it swap time already?\" \"No no, you just relax, I came up to get away from Munder, he's bugging me.\" Greer cracked his neck, and sat in a chair alongside Santos. \"It's just not the same as it use to be, it's like everyone's a stranger.\" \"Yeah I know what you mean bro, it's like I don't belong here, I feel like every time I walk in a room I'm ease dropping, or trespassing, especially with Murphy.\" \"Yeah I heard about you an' Murphy, you think he could just let it go.\" \"Yes.\" Santos said enthusiastically as if he had finally found someone who agreed with him. \"Sure I was an Asshole in death, but I was pissed…..\". There were more creaks on the stairs, and both of Santos and Greer hushed, and slump down as if hiding. \"Greer you up here.\" Munder's voice paused as if listening. \"I didn't mean to sound so insensitive, it was just a damn question.\" There was a sigh and then retreating footsteps. Santos looked over towards Greer. \"What was that about?\" \"He said something random, and I didn't like it, it might have been simple, but weird…..and well, all I can say is…..err…..it's not for me to answer.\" Greer picked up a potato chip of the floor and nibbled on it with distaste. \"You can't leave it at that, tell me what he said.\" Greer shifted in his seat. \"I'm not repeating it. If he asks you, you will know, and hopefully you will give him the same answer I did.\" \"Come on, if it was disturbing, I'll be used to it.\" He poked Greer's shoulder. \"I'll confront Munder about it if you tell me.\" Greer looked defeated. \"Okay, he said…and these were his exact words, what do you think would be worse for Maureen and Mike, finding their daughter dead, or beaten and raped.\" \"Jesus.\" \"I know.\" \"That's fucked up.\" Santos stood up, and wizzed past Greer before he could say anything. \"Hey Munder!\" Catrina and Katie stood looking down a stairwell that was filled with sea water. \"I was down there a few days ago, now look at it.\" Katie shuck her head. \"Imagine those salvagers will clear this, and find a load of gold down there in the process.\" \"Oh fuck.\" She side glanced at Katie and covered her mouth. \"Err sorry, pardon the language.\" Katie waved her hand as if to say it was okay. \"I totally forgot about the gold, it will drive them insane with greed, it will make them stay….then they will be killed.\" Catrina took a step forward and half of her leg was engulfed in water, Katie grabbed her. \"What you doing, it's submerged, don't say it's driven you m-\" \"No it hasn't, I need to dispose of it.\" Catrina grabbed a bar as she tread down the steps, and sunk even deeper into the cold water, her teeth chattered as it soaked through her clothes. \" Damn me for forgetting it, I could have taken it days ago.\" \"You will drown…again\" \"Not if I hold my breath very well, and find a good air pocket.\" She glanced into the dark murky depth, recalling the moment she drowned, it brought a lump to her throat. \"If I'm quick, say bring it here brick by brick then…. I'll be…..\" She couldn't stop thinking about her death. \"Oh mother.\" She sighed, she sucked in a load of air, and put her head under, she used the railings to pull and guide her down. Katie shook her head dismayed. \"Oh.\" Katie sunk through the railings into the water, and passed through Catrina at the bottom of the stairwell. Catrina was startled, and struggled to keep hold of her breath, she shot up, and luckily into an air pocket. \"Katie, you didn't have to follow, but thanks.\" \"My Aura has a glow, a great light source to help you find your way.\" \"That would be handy, lead the way.\" Catrina smiled, and halted Katie before she disappeared. \"Bless you.\" Katie beamed, No literally she's a bloody ghost she glowed. Catrina followed Katie who floated forward without swimming leading her through the water logged corridors, she frequently saw Katie look back with a look of concern to see if she was having difficulties, and Catrina would give her the thumbs up to not worry her. The truth was she was suffering; the cold water was stinging her face and eyes, she was running out of air, she kept floating to the ceiling and banging her head, and the strength in her arms were failing, and she had nothing to pull her forward, just debris that cluttered the hall. They turned a corner, Katie looked back for the tenth time, Catrina waved her hand in front of her face in distress, Katie looked about in panic…no air pockets. To Catrina it was happening again the air was going, her lungs were failing, there was panic, her arms were all over the place, she was no longer floating to the ceiling but falling towards the debris, strangely enough Katie had grabbed her hand, and it felt solid. Catrina was getting dazed she looked up and saw Katie was pointing towards a doorway, then up. Catrina used her remaining bit of strength to pull her forwards, she grabbed the doorframe and dragged herself through and her head popped up into ….air, sweet sweet air, Catrina gasped loudly. \"Oh god Katie, it nearly happened.\" Katie nodded. \"Doesn't seem like a brilliant idea does it now.\" \"I don't think I can do another trip, well to go back yes.\" She was distraught, she couldn't do the simplest thing. \"I don't think I can move any of the gold, cause it would only be one brick I could bring back.\" Catrina seen her companion nod. She had a brainwave, but it was stupid but simple. \"Katie find a wrench, and something sharp.\" \"Wish I knew what you were thinking.\" \"You won't need to you will see, it's a stupid little thing, it won't work, but I have to do something.\" Catrina's eyes were bloodshot, and saddened by her hopelessness. Jack stalked new meat at the docks, his plan of action; find a sinful bunch of salvagers, or a least a bunch that can be easily converted, preferably dominated by women, lure them to the ship, and feed. He walked by some men who where offloading a vessel, they where singing a sea chantey. ' Not them they will sing throughout the whole journey there.' He approached a very modern looking boat which had by the looks of it had never been on a real journey ever in it's short life, a man was cleaning the helm window. Another man was rigging the sails, then to Jack's contentment he spotted 3 women who seemed to be court up in the Dallas era, who were in there 30s but had 80s permed hair, skirts, jackets, and gold chains and hooped ear-rings, they where pacing the decks ordering the men about. They weren't what he had in mind, they were spoilt, and looked incapable of salvaging. Jack noticed a woman had looked his way, he smiled innocently, and gave a reserved salute before moving towards the bar. He sensed her curiosity, and was pleased to sense her follow him. Catrina's teeth were chattering as she rubbed her hair with a towel. \"You wouldn't happen to have hair dryer would you?\" Katie had her protoplasmic head through the door out of sight, she pulled it back through when she realised she was being addressed. \"Nope sorry.\" \"The hair must be dry before he gets back…..and the clothes, and maybe this…\" She held up her blooded finger. \"Let's just hope he hasn't transformed into Vampire while being away.\" \"I wouldn't be surprised.\" Catrina smiled at Katie who had already begun tittering. \"It won't matter when the salvagers get here, he will find out.\" Katie stopped laughing, Catrina wished she hadn't, it made her feel more insecure about what she had done and where she was. She only wished she had an escape goat, or a special room which had an anti-demon force field. \"He's been gone 3 hours.\" Catrina shrugged. \"That's not long, he's been gone a whole day before.\" She had never seen Jack get on the boat normally, or see him arrive loaded with stuff, he just seemed to be here and there, she greatly questions his ways of boarding with the people he brings 'home'. \"Does he travel with the salvagers?\" \"Course he does, it's the human image, befriends them, travels with them, he can get to know them better in close quarters.\" \"-I bet he does.\" Catrina turned her head and coughed. \"To bad it never ends in friendship.\"[Chapter 17] Normally in my fan fictions I try to put both points of view in the same parts, but I thought I 'd give it a go in this chapter, in another words you'll see a POV thingy. Dark clouds formed over the sea, a low rumble emitted from the morbid sky, rain had not yet fallen but sparks of light came from the eye of the brewing storm. Catrina awoke from her slumber in an odd position on the floor, as she raised her head, her face peeled from the floorboards like masking tape on a reel. Her hair was curly and zig-zaggy, and felt kinda sticky from drying naturally after being soaked with salt water. \"Katie?\" She had been left alone. Or had she, she stumbled up and wrenched open the door. She called half loudly down the corridor \"Jack!\" \"I'm leaving the room.\" She waited, her eyes left the door of Jack's room and wandered back up the corridor then she glanced into a room to see if he had appeared. \"I'm escaping.\" Silence followed. She then mumbled. \"I'm naked.\" This time she sprung in different directions, doing a ninja type dance to check the hall. It was now apparent that he still wasn't onboard. She proceeded down the corridor, towards the main hall which would lead to the reception, to her surprise she came across no ghosts, not even a cold draft. It was a mystery to her where ghosts go to when they weren't hunting, do they wonder back to the realm of the afterlife, and cross back? \"Katie?\" Catrina was now level with the fish tank. \"Francesca?\". It was muggy outside, the heat of the day was trapped beneath brownish clouds. Agoraphobia began to set in as she saw the watery horizon, it was creepy, on a sinking vessel in the middle of nowhere, no life boats, and the water was bloody cold. Her mother would probably love this, not to mention her father she thought, this would be their ideal second honeymoon. Catrina rest her head on folded arms and leant on the side. This is where she could have died, but she hadn't, or raped but she hadn't. She feared spending the start of her adult life here, no chance to make new acquaintances - living that is, or further education, she would be forgotten and referred to as another student who disappeared off the face of the earth, her friends probably thought she had gone bag packing in Europe. ' Have my parents told the law?' Wasn't there a search /rescue party out looking for her. Her mind came to her boyfriend, he was probably the most worried, the last time they had spoke was….crap she couldn't remember, she couldn't remember the last thing she had said to him. 'Was it something like ' call you tomorrow?' That tomorrow was weeks ago. The last few weeks she remembered of their relationship before the abduction were patchy, he was constantly working, and their conversations were short and non- existent, and when it seemed like it was over …there would be another outing together. Then when she would meet up with Emma, she would call him by the wrong name, which would kick up a fuss. He would either assume she hadn't told Emma about him, or she had been cheating on him. Maybe this was a blessing, no more awkward chats with Robert, and she was saving money not going out with him, Emma wouldn't be embarrassing her, though she did find it kind of funny. She felt a spot of rain on her nose, and stood up ready to go inside, she glanced about her and approached the door….Catrina froze, she had saw something, she brought her eye line to the horizon, there was a dark shape, she stumbled to the side. ' Good God.' She gasped in owe at the sight, a boat, could it be Jack's method of getting here and back, or …no….with the salvagers he's going to kill. Or her parents. She made a dash for the helm, Catrina sprinted along A deck, and up a flight of stairs, she banged through a set of doors. The smut covered windows didn't help, so she squeezed herself through the window she had used before, some of the frame gave way, and stumbled 10ft below. She regained her composure and pulled herself onto the roof. She lay down on the rust and watched the boat creep closer and closer to the eagerly awaiting ship…..the main thing is could they see the ship, was it hidden to the naked eye. \"Guys, I'm getting odd readings.\" Santos called down the com. Murphy approached from the rear. \"But we are no where near the same co-ordinates as last time.\" \"Perhaps he moved, it's a ship for christ sake.\" Maureen and Dodge were tearing up the stairs, looking hopeful. \"Is it, is it?\" They said over each other. \"Well if it is it's moved a couple hundred miles, and it's changed shape.\" Murphy announced snatching up a clip board to take down the co-ordinates. \"At least it ain't night time.\" Greer turned the tug sharply. \"I don't see anything, it's just a clear horizon.\" \"It was like that the last time.\" Santos was now facing them. Jack was sitting in a swivel chair in a helm of an old tug, there were 4 men with him, each had been appointed with there own tasks, they had no intention of getting to know him, he was there for merely guidance and insurance, well that's what they thought. He will strand them onto the ship, so they will have no choice but to fix it, then he will kill them, but in the end his quota will gain nothing, it would only be worth it if he braved having sex with the men. But it wasn't just about doing it, he had limitations, and that was getting a hard on for men, which would not come naturally, but by artificial means, Viagra. But he couldn't possibly enjoy himself, and neither will they. There has to be something to work with from the beginning, like primal urges, or lust, but these men seemed like women's men, booze and women, and they stunk of it too, plus cigarettes and fish. Jack began his seasick routine, and began looking queasy and tired. One man who he believed was known as Carl noticed and commented. \"You not gonna barf on me are yeh?\" Jack smiled as pleasantly as he could. \"No just feeling the sway that's all, how long do you think it's going to take?\" \"Well by your co-ordinates, 20 minutes.\" Jack wasn't surprised, but showed it. The shape bobbed up and down in the waves, it was still a speck, Catrina squinted she couldn't make out any colours, or anything. 'You would think they would pick it up a notch.' She fidgeted on the roof, the rough rust pulled threads on her jumper, she could feel the metal beneath her slightly bending and she jumped up, and moved towards the edge where her window was located., she went through the window. As she set her foot down on the flooring, Katie whizzed through the wall. \"Somebody's coming, somebody's coming!\" \"I see it Katie, it's not going very fast, can you sense who it is?\" \"I don't think it's Jack.\" Katie said emphasizing every word and watching for Catrina's reaction. \"But they're coming here, I could approach them immediately on arrival say I've been stranded for ages, nothing's on board…to stop them from snooping. \" Katie nodded in agreement. \"And ask them politely to give me a ride to shore, where I will make my way home. \" Catrina finished out of breath. \"Salvagers don't usually assist without taking a look.\" \"Do you think they will want to explore the part that's sunk?\" \"Yes, they will even probably fix the damn thing and claim it as their own before taking you to shore, because it's what salvagers do!\" \"Damn Salvagers!\" Catrina exclaimed, she paced and tried to see through the dirty glass. \"Damn glass.\" She paced some more, she knew her parents use to do this sort of thing, hell they probably fixed this ship originally, and yet they weren't killed? Is this where the bargain came in, where she came in? Her parents wouldn't offer her in return for their lives, it's sheer cowardess. The little English girl had noticed Catrina's pacing had stopped, and her face had become hard. \"It could be your parents you know?\" Catrina's face softened. \"Could be, but this is their fault in the first place.\" \"So would you rather it not be them, sweetie.\" Catrina turned her back on Katie, she didn't know what to think, her life would have obviously been better off if her parents hadn't been salvagers, then again she probably wouldn't have been born, she knew her parents met through salvaging. A world without her wouldn't have been a total catastrophe she thought, she wouldn't have gone through the pressure of school, she wouldn't have had to stress over dragging herself to parties to make herself fit in, her friends would have probably found better friends that wouldn't have to talk each other into to going to gigs. Her Dad would have never caught her smoking pot, Robert would have probably gone out with Mandy, another mate who sat next to her on that couch at that house party. She wouldn't feel this constant weight or shadow over her, which had lingered over her entire childhood, and made a lot of sense now, then it would've done a year ago. Catrina hadn't realised that her face was streaming with tears, she placed her hands on her heated cheeks and felt the damp and quickly brushed it away with the sleeve of her jumper. \"What a horrible thing to think of?\" Catrina mumbled, hoping Katie wouldn't pry, having Katie think she had lost it wouldn't make her feel worse, and incapable of defeating this. She heard Katie speak quietly. \"Don't you want to be rescued?\" Think. To be rescued by the people who put her in this mess, she would be expected to run to them and throw her arms around them thanking them, and to hear them say 'thank god you're alive', what would that mean exactly? Catrina tore her eyes away from the window, and spied Katie looking at her in an usual way. Crap. She had left her pause to long, and hadn't spoke aloud what she thought, now she is going to get the wrong idea. Crap. Just say something God. Crap. Anything. \"Of course I do.\" \"Oh right…it seemed li-\" \"No, I was just thinking of who it could be.\" 'You didn't have to lie about that, you could have said the truth, damn you.' She smiled warmly at Katie before approaching. \"If I am to be rescued, well.\" Katie tipped her head, Catrina couldn't help but grin at this action. \"I'm going to miss you.\" Katie's ghostly cheeks bloated as she smiled, Catrina could almost see her own smile on the little girl's face. \"And I must say, as an only child, I wouldn't know of what it must be like to have a sibling, but I imagine a little sis would be like you.\" Katie mouthed an 'Awww'. \"Dido.\" Katie replied. \" Sappy but Dido.\" Catrina threw her head back and laughed. Katie couldn't help but laugh aswell, Catrina's was contagious. Roger was hugging his wife. \"You worried.\" He stroked the back of her head while rocking her. \"Kind of worried yes, but not tense.\" She pulled back and gave him a quizzical look. \"You?\" \"I should be but I'm not, at all.\" He stared passed her slightly ashamed. \"Sorry but I want to be honest.\" \"The atmosphere is all wrong, we should know if we are nearly there, and I feel anxious but only because I don't feel we are any where near, there's no war today, and I'm not going to say anything…\"- Roger added. \"Because you think you might be wrong.\" Maureen knew he knew and she herself to him again. After about 5 minutes, Dodge broke the silence. \"You know last night I was thinking of the little things, like did she get that job, and shes missed her first day of College, and did I turn the bathroom light of before I left the house.\" He felt his wife chuckle slightly. \"It's odd but just earlier I thought shes missed her first day of college, she's not going to be happy about that.\" She heard someone coming downstairs and twisted her husband around so she could look over his shoulder at who it was. Munder stopped at the sight before him. \"There's nothing there, we've been searching the water and we spotted a fishing boat, it seems we closer to land than we thought.\" \"Our radar must by on the fritz, we going to have the coast guard tracking us.\" Maureen sighed, the guns and explosives on board won't look good to law enforcers eyes. \"Well we're salvagers we could easily convince them the explosives are used in our trade, the guns….\" \"We have a license for two of them, but for the other 4, we're screwed.\" Dodge had broke away from Maureen and was heading for the crate of ammo. \"Damn murderers walk around with these, and for the people that need them, they get taken away and we get a slap on the wrist.\" It angered him to be defenceless, the guns are nothing up against Jack, he knew it, but he didn't wish to be less of a weapon. She used the wheel within the helm, to rest her chin on as she stared out of the window she had managed to clean. The boat was very close, 250 yards and wasn't showing any signs of slowing down. When she began to hear it she stood up and approached the window, it didn't look familiar. She clattered her way to the door to get a better view of the boat, but avoided showing herself. No signs of life onboard, although they were probably inside the vessel. She couldn't get any closer to the railing for fear of being seen, the tug hummed along side of the Antonio Graza, and stopped completely. Catrina could hear the waves made sloshing on the side of the ship. She backed off into the helm, through the doors, down the stairway from where she came, and into the main hall, she did a little jump over some of the debris, and skidded to a halt in front of a tiny porthole, almost. She had a good view of the boat, a man with a baseball cap had shown himself, and was attempting to throw a grapple hook onto the deck, the clatter could be heard throughout the whole boat. After several attempts the grapple hook hooked onto the railings, the rope pulled taught and she seen he climb up the rope, some more salvagers came out onboard, she had burst of confidence Catrina rushed to a port door, and opened it. She went outside. The man had already made it to the top and was walking towards the prow of the ship, away from her, she went in his direction, she slowed down when she noticed the grapple hook which was locked solid in position, and the rope attached was jolting. Catrina didn't know if she should greet the person coming up, but then decided to proceed to the prow. She looked to the front she spotted the door that lead to the main deck was open, and she could hear someone clattering about inside. Catrina was at ease, and felt ready to get attention, she grumbled to clear her throat, then. \"Hel-\" She never finished her sentence because she felt a hand clamp around her mouth, and a sturdy arm wrap across her own arms. Total alarm went through her head, she hadn't been expecting that and she went stiff as board, she was weirdly aware of her heartbeat in her stomach and throat. Why would a salvager grab her like this, she didn't look that threatening did she? They were pulling her backwards, she snapped into defensive mode. \"WHUT UR OO DOUN!\" Which is all she heard through their hands. \"What am I doing? What are you doing?\" She recognised Jack's drawling voice, well, what made it drawling was the volume he was speaking at. Catrina rolled her eyes. \"I knew I should have checked, it's not like I've trained you to stay put.\" The weight on her feet was gone as she was being lifted and pulled backwards, she was filled with disappointment and dread, she had been discovered by the wrong person, and going to be locked in her room/cell. \"If you were seen I would have to kill them, you do realise, and the ship would surely sink, with you still on it.\" -Jack's POV-5 minutes before He observed the salvagers moving about doing each of there tasks, as his beloved wreck filled the window. Jack smiled with anticipation, more death, a fixed ship, and a not so happy Catrina, and he couldn't wait. These Salvagers were fools, they never read memos at the local bars 'Salvagers missing, boats disappear.' With one ruffle of his hair he stood up and watched Steel outside swinging a grapple hook. Sure it was cheap equipment, but what do you expect? Jack watched Steel make a third attempt, his patience was wearing thin, it would be easier for him to aim if he took that damn baseball cap off. After attempt five the hook locked into place, and Carl let out a \"Yeeehaaa!\" Which made him cringe, he let out a sigh knowing he wasn't going to have to kill them for sheer lack of skill with the grapple hook. \"Woaw that was a high throw.\" He forced out. \"Yes well it's not his first time.\" Carl jeered, giving Jack a little shove out of the helm and up onto the deck. ' You could have fooled me.' Steel to his surprise had already shot up the rope, and had his hand on the railings of the Antonia Graza pulling himself up and over. Shit. Jack snatched the rope before, any of the other crew got the greedy little hands on it. \"Err…Jack wouldn't you want to wear some gloves, or wait till we get a zip cable and harness up for you.\" Jack answered them by speedily climbing up, and reaching the deck in record time, he glanced down, and smirked down at their baffled faces. He swiftly found Catrina walking around the front and disappearing, he let out grunt of displeasure, and with haste walked in the direction of the prow. He felt a pang in his chest as he got a whiff of rose scented soap, and as he reached the bend, Catrina had by then had come to a halt and was staring at the door. ' Aaaa she's chickened out, having second thoughts.' Jack found himself shuffling forward towards her silently, he was right behind her, so close he could smell and feel her hair tickling his face. He heard her take a breathe and he didn't have to act quickly, he was quick, he brought his hand over her soft lips. Jack was frog marching her to her room, he squeezed her shoulders maliciously as they reached the open doorway, with a final shove she was in her room. \"Now you be good now.\" he said waging his finger, a lopsided grin slipped onto his face as he slowly closed the door, just before it clicked shut, through the slit, he saw Catrina fall back onto her mattress. Damn him to hell she thought, she clucked her tongue, ' He's probably soundproofed the room.' The door was indeed locked, and firmly. Jack walked towards the main hall straight into the salvagers having their meeting. \"Hey Jack you looked around already, and without our say.\" Steel seem to emphasize every word, with everyone else nodding in agreement. Jack bubbled under the surface. \"I didn't look everywhere just the deck, and that hallway, no big deal.\" He could feel the weight of his pen knife in his coat pocket, just in case he got irritable. \"Well next time inform us, we're supposed to be a team.\" He turned toward his crew. \"Right Kaminski you go with Carl to the-\" Jack immediately intervened. \"Why don't explore the ship as one, no need to scatter.\" \"We don't want to put our weight in one area of the ship, and we'll get stuff done quicker.\" \"Common sense Jack.\" Jack nodded in his absent minded way, and turned his back on the group and pretended to look around the great hall. He couldn't let go that Catrina was only a few yards away. She wasn't very trusting, and yet now she is behaving, now she knows her place, that wasn't normal. In that moment in time he wished he had an additional power of X-Ray vision, to see what she was currently up to behind the walls, it could be useful for other things aswell. One power he did have was aura sensing, but underwear never seems to show up on auras. He was snagged out of thought by the sight of clicking fingers inches from his face. \"Earth the Jack, let's get going\". He kept his face as neutral as possible before cracking a fake timid smile. \"Okey Dokey.\" The words seemed to drop down from the greatest depth of his mind and fall out of his mouth, he shuddered. \"You will be the first to die.\" He muttered as the guy walked past him. \"What was that?\" \"Erm….I said, I could do with some pie.\" She rattled the door handle, clutching it with both hands, and grunted as it didn't twist. \"JACK!\" Nothing. \"JAAAAAAACK!\" She wasn't just yelling for Jack, but for the whole boat, surely someone would hear something and suspect. \"ANYONE, JACK'S GOING TO KILL YOU!\" Her mouth was running away with her, her mind was blanking out the consequences. \"HE'S GOING TO KILL MORE AFTER YOU, HE LIKES IT, HE FUCKING LIKES IT!\" She followed that with silence so she could listen, she pressed her ear against the door, then she lay on her stomach and listened to the floor. It was like the ship was completely empty. But she knew it was it was now crawling with life, and lingering death.[Chapter 18] So Sorry I took sooooooooooo long, I need to spell check it. Catrina had developed an obsession with the floor boards, she figured if she picked at some long enough they would loosen, and she would have access to the room below. She sighed for the umpteenth time, dropped her slate of metal and rubbed at the cramp in her hand. Her boredom was driving her insane, she knew if she stopped; she would be a blubbering mess, or become some heretic. The worry of that is what brought her to the decision of scratching on the floor boards. Since she had no paper and stationery, Catrina couldn't indulge in her hobby of sketching. Over the next hour she had drew a picture of herself standing on a star, with Katie observing from a great height on the next board. Jack; she had begun to draw as a rat, but then drew him as an Egyptian, she started to draw his mother when the floorboard shifted. Ever since she had been trying to lever the board up and file at the exposed metal. Her trail of thought returned to Jack's mother, a descent attractive woman bringing up a brooding Jack. Katie smoothed into room to quietly observe her. \"You know he's unlocked the door right?\" Maureen wrenched open the helm door, her hood up and flapping, water sprayed in from behind her and into the cabin, she firmly banged the door shut behind her. Everybody looked up. She sniffed, and revealed her wet face. \"I've lost my damn hat.\" She mumbled. Of course as she expected; no reaction, there were more pressing issues at hand. Her husband simply gave her a straight lipped smile. \"Okay... what's wrong?\" She looked from one to the other suspiciously. Murphy grabbed her attention. \"Either our calculations have been wrong, or someone here has been little careless.\" He side glanced at Santos. Her mouth did an impression of a draw bridge. \"We're not in the wrong place are we, I know the radar went funny, but it's okay now, plus we have the old fashion way-.\" \"-He doesn't mean the co-ordination. But the food, the rationing.\" Said Roger. \"It's vanishing.\" She looked at them disbelievingly and walked past them in a huff and wrenched the cupboards open one by one, as she molested each container she got more frustrated as the tell-tale rattle or rustle of empty spaces continued through her search. Maureen finally slammed the last cupboard, and slouched against the unit facing them. \"Jesus Guys you are pigs, what are we supposed to do now?\" \"It's not me, nor Greer he's on a diet!\" \"-Hey...I said that in confidence!\" Greer protested flicking a tooth pick at Munder. \"If you ask me something fucked up is going down here, yesterday in the storage we had 3 burlaps of rice, 10 cans of beans, 5 Jars of beef jerky, and a sack of oranges.\" He didn't even blink. \"When I went down there this morning I found half a burlap, 3 cans of beans, no beef jerky, and one fucking orange!\" \"What the fuck, that's impossible we had one meal yesterday, whose been eating?\" Maureen scolded the crew with her glare. Santos cleared his throat. \"It's not me, it's suspicious I know, but no one is going to own up for it, the question is what are we going to do? We can't ration what we have!\" \"-What do you wanna do smart ass.\" Murphy chuntered. \"I think he's implying we go to the coast.\"Maureen interjected. \"I don't want to, it'll put us back 2 days, but we have to.\" She sighed locking eyes with her husband. \"But it doesn't mean I let this occurrence go, we have to be careful.\" She made her way outside, she had been spending most of her time out there as if smelling the air for her daughter. The door creak behind her, and she assumed it was her husband, Murphy appeared on her right staring at the horizon. \"I don't want to worry you Maureen, love, but it seems something's against us, I'm losing faith.\" Maureen could see it in his eyes, not just the tiredness but betrayal. \"We'll be quick..and we'll find her.\" Murphy's head now faced her, a look of determination. \"That's not what I meant. I smell sabotage in the air, descent in the ranks.\" Katie tugged at Catrina's retreating cardigan. \"They're not onboard.\" \"He hasn't...?\" \"No, they're back at base you might say. Jack's watching you-\" -\"OH WELL I HOPE HE CAN HEAR ME, THE BASTARD!\" Katie placed a cold hand near her mouth. \"Now's not the time to be Queen Bitch, he's pissed and slightly drained.\" Catrina found it funny she was struggling with a ghost. \"Good he'll be easier to swot!\" \"Trust me, you don't want to go near him now, he found your little message written in blood in the box while he with the salvagers.\" She felt Catrina stiffen. Catrina had a moment of revelation, which was now being replaced with stone in the stomach fear. \"And?\" \"It freaked the guys out, Jack was trying to reassure them for half an hour, but he's pissed, I thought he was coming to kill you, he unlocked your door for Christ-sake.\" Katie indicating to door which Catrina was fiddling with, Cat was slightly confused, why hadn't he come in?' Though that's a relief right? Katie continued in her desperate voice. \"I think he's either changed his mind and just allowing you more time, ...or he's waiting for you to go to him.\" Katie's voice quietened towards the end. Catrina's nerves were rattled, she took a step back from the door as if it were Jack himself. \"Why, why would he do that?\" She was looking desperately through Katie. Katie sighed. \"I have no idea, he's rattled himself, you know when I said he's drained?\" Catrina didn't like Katie's sudden need to whisper, she nodded slowly. \"I think he's having one of his funny turns, he's hungry sweetheart, and he's keeping his distance like a good boy, but for how much longer.\" Katie finished, the woman in front of eyed the door once again. For Catrina it started to make sense, his condition, Maybe it'll kill him?..Nare he'd probably live forever. \"The door's open just in case he changes his mind.\" Catrina whispered more to herself than anything. \"By me going to him that will make the decision for him, Oh such a dangerous game.\" She narrowed her eyes at the entrance. Katie leaned towards her ear to snap her out of her trance. \"Barricade yourself in.\" \"Again, I've spent 2 hours thinking about getting out. I get so bored, Katie.\" \"I have something we could do?\" Katie suggested, Catrina merely quirked her eyebrows. \"Yes! I like it, I really, really like it, I've never been so pleased with my genetics than I am now...this is more exciting than getting fitted for my first bra.\" Her hair had been crimped, the old fashioned way; knotted to within in an inch of its life with handkerchiefs. Katie also had spent a lot of effort trying to grip the tube of lipstick, and it had been applied near perfect. Though the thing she was most excited about was the bodice Katie had found, every girls dream was to try on interesting clothes, especially ones that were most unlikely to be worn in everyday life. Though she wasn't wearing it on its own, but over the top of a V neck, it certainly made her feel like a lady...for once. \"I envy you.\" \"Don't worry your time will come soon.\" Catrina smiled curtly, then it hit or in a flash, realising her error, she cringed at the coldness emitting from Katie standing behind her, she turned hoping to look as apologetic as possible, and found she couldn't look round. She placed the mirror back on the vanity. \"I'm sorry Katie, I forgot.\" She reached her hand over her shoulder hoping to make contact with Katie. Protoplasm milked over her hand like silk. \"50 years is a long time.\" Catrina heard a ' woosh ', and she immediately turned to find her room empty. Her heart was in her throat. 50 years is way too long to be a child. An amazing beautiful woman, she gained independence from dependence after her father gave her a $10,000 to find a place to live, she moved into a small apartment in which she painted all the rooms purple, she drove a beetle car, worked in a boutique, and she was one of the first women to go to college from her area. She meets her future husband at a music concert, they date for 8 months before he pops the question. They marry, their first dance as a married couple is to a folk song, the honeymoon is overshadowed by a sudden bout of sickness, which turns out to be none other than morning sickness; she is 5 weeks pregnant. She gives birth to a boy, she names him Charlie. Another 3 years goes by and she gives birth to another boy she names Jacob, it would be another 6 years before she has another child, her final child; a girl named Maureen...her beautiful baby, but of course it's impossible, she's too young to have a baby, she's only 12 years old, she never got to see her parents, she was never given any money by her father, she never meets her husband, she never grows up...because she's already dead. ... ...Katie sighed while floating between two rooms, her face etched in innocent sorrow, her now glossy eyes swirling with the maturity of her true age. ' Some after life!' Sorry I took so long...r&r;[Chapter 19] Catrina felt sick, though, when hadn't she felt sick? Her feeling of absolute calm while playing dress up had reached an anti-climax, and she was now restless. One moment she was talking to Katie the next she felt drowsy. She recalled telling her companion to excuse her flippancy, and she maundered towards her door and out, ignoring Katie's pleas, Why am I ignoring her pleas? Her clothes felt really heavy, and she felt irritable that they were stalling her from her designated destination. Where am I going exactly? She saw the door looming in the distance, Jack's door. A freakish thought of her being possessed into going there, made her claw at the walls to slow her down, and yet her feet calmly continued forward. Her relentless squirms came to a stop, when her hand brushed the door knob and continued down the hall, to her surprise. Then where am I going? Her unease seemed to take away her lapse of drowsiness, but not her strength to fight what was... controlling her? Okay the ballroom . She pushed through the lobby doors and maundered into the living space, before crossing the boards of the dance floor. Catrina glanced at the clock, 5 to 10. Her feet were now shuffling, as if she was finally gaining control, and the involuntary movements were less prominent. With fortitude she made herself stop in front of the dining tables. Her person then abruptly became aware she wasn't alone, an eerie coldness had filled the room, leaving her a sensation as she had just took a step too far and was plummeting to her death. She turned on the spot and faced her greatest fear standing in the doorway. It felt as if she was going to meet her maker. Jack looked...healthy?..meaning; not on the verge of death or crippled with a sweat rendering ailment. What gives? Has he overcome it, or was this...it. She remained where she was frozen as if waiting for him to answer, then he moved casually towards her. Catrina waited, her face neutral as she could allow. His facial expression remained melancholy until a fleeting ripple of twisted gentleness passed over his aristocratic features as he closed in on her. He stopped his advance mere inches away from her, squaring his shoulders and gazing down upon her in a possessive nature which further sent chills down her spine. It was then she smelt it. An unpleasant odour. An unrecognisable scent which had narrowing her eyes with both suspicion and curiosity. Catrina stared straight at the mockingly handsome man, and to her bewilderment the man's clothes dissolved of their colour and shape. She didn't bother to rub her eyes, nothing could be unbelievable in her life time at present. His clothes were now brown, leathery and caked in what could have been blood or mud, to her slight horror. Though what had her reeling was the face, it was morbidly morphing into another. Her hand dropped from her lips as dread lashed through her like a bitch slap and she moved further away from the figure, scared. Her hip collided with a table behind her, though she was too distracted to react. The now unrecognisable man had brown near black eyes, and a beaky nose, greying hair, and a slight stubble. His lips curled into a friendly smile, though his entrance made it seem less so. \"Why hello there, Catrina.\" Her face devoid of expression, but her eyes alert with weariness, the man before her in his unfamiliar glory seemed content with her blankness. She cleared her throat. \"Hello.\" She dryly replied very unsure why she had even bothered replying to someone who was obviously a threat; he displayed traits of that possessed by Jack. Two demons, fuck off! He pretended to look around. \"What are you doing in a place like this?\" She seemed to have lost the ability to make conversation, and nearly gaped at his friendly demeanour. \"Or as they say what's a nice girl like you doing in a shit hole like this?\" Catrina eyed the space around her as if waiting for something to sweep in to prevent her talking to him. Her sudden shyness amused him, and he picked up her hand, an action which startled her into looking into his eyes. \"My dear I am only here to help.\" She noticed his hands were warm. \"Come with me, I fear you're in great danger.\" His eyes were full of sincerity, she had a sudden need to smile gratefully but her commonsense made her slip her hand out of his warm grasp. She found her voice. \"Who are you?\" He smiled. \"A soon to be friend.\" She huffed. \"I don't make a habit out of making friends so quickly, you can quit with this facade...I'm not buying it.\" She tried to remain calm. \"Oo I like you already, not sure if I prefer this or the quiet version. Well never mind...you're coming with me regardless.\" He made a move to grab her arm, and she jumped to the side. \"-Wait just a minute...I don't know who the hell you are, if you wanted me to trust you...then why would you feebly appear to me as Jack!\" Her voice squawked still shuffling away. \"Because it's what you wanted.\"He replied unfazed, holding her now mortified gaze. \"What, what's that supposed to mean?...You succeeded in creeping me out, that's not what I or anyone else would have wanted!\" Her hand fondled for anything on the table behind her as a makeshift weapon. \"We both know that's not true, you can be easily just like any other girl, in it for a cheap thrill, a devil woman waiting to drop her pants and fall at the knees of some tall dark stranger.\" He seemed to almost snarl, but really his eyes were just mocking, did she really come across like that? Catrina didn't hold back her aghast, her mouth fell open and she frowned. How dare he. \"If you seem so confident, why am I not swooning? I never trust anyone her touches me on my first meeting, and I never will trust anyone who speaks to me in that manner!\" She managed to throw herself back so she rolled over the table right to the other side, grabbing a discarded bottle and holding it in front of her as a baton. He had darted forward as if to scratch her eyes out, the table gave her a decent enough barrier, but for how long? She didn't have long to worry about that though- Someone cleared their throat, and it wasn't either of them. \"Now now that isn't a way to treat a girl is it.\" Catrina almost relieved, turned her head towards the familiar voice. Jack was leaning against the opposite wall, breezily observing the scenario playing out before him. His eyes neglected her and remained on the intruder, who was nonchalant towards him. \"And now you make an appearance, you look like hell.\" The man alleged, Catrina now having the attention moved away from her was less relieved that she was in the presence of two possible equals, that seemed to know each other, though Jack's body language suggested some mild hostility. \"Catrina and I were just talking about-.\" \"-I heard.\" Jack interrupted, clearly not interested. \"Why are you here, you don't make social calls.\" \"This is not another warning if that's what you think, I gave you one in the bar, I'm acting on orders.\" Catrina glanced from one to another, hoping the tension would diffuse swiftly...and without her. Watching Jack react to this news seemed to take forever, she couldn't tell if he was confused or angry. Since neither was paying any attention to her she shifted backwards on the balls of her feet. \"I'm not finished with you yet.\" The man called, her limbs tensed, and for the first time Jack briefly glanced over at her, she was hardly going to beg for her freedom or safety from either of them, since they were...demons. \"Didn't know you had her trained?\" The man mocked, Jack's expression was blank and very calm, she felt like shaking him from his stance, she'd rather be crept out by Jack than the other. \"She ain't complicated, so this will be easier for all of us.\" \"I don't see why this has anything to do with you, I told you what was going to happen, I'm still working, very well.\" Jack finished, intent of getting rid of intruder. The man barked, then settled. \"Well that's a lie, and I'm sure what you told me will please management, plus you're quota is almost full, they want the ship, then you can start again from fresh with your new occupation...it isn't hard.\" Catrina was trying to keep herself from fainting with fear, her eyes were focused between them, so she could see both, but fuzzily. \"You don't have to tell me...I know the score, there's no time limit. As far as I know; I'm still doing my job, it's not up to you who my victims will be.\" Catrina forced herself to look at Jack, again he was neglecting her. \"So just go.\" He enunciated every word. The man was dissatisfied, and Catrina could tell both men were bored. \"I can't go till orders have been followed; it's either gonna be me or you, and since you're so reluctant-\" Catrina freaked when the man speedily leapt across the table and had her in a headlock, she squirmed, thinking he was going to snap her neck instantly, but prolonged the agony by just holding her. She was looking to Jack who was just staring at them vacantly. Catrina assumed Jack was of a lower status to the intruder, and couldn't do anything. She felt helpless, and unable to cry, just struggle. \"Has that hunger eaten away at your brain, or is it easier than you thought to just... let things go.\" Giving Catrina a little shake, this made her omit a single dry sob. \"Well...do you want me to make this quick.\" She wasn't sure which one he was asking, Jack or her? Catrina had automatically grabbed the offending arm around her neck, not forcing it away, but holding it to balance her and prevent it squeezing any tighter. The man in question took this as an escape attempt and jolted her, making her hair fall into her face, so she was seething and panting through strands of her hair. Jack broke eye contact from both of them, and sighed. \"I'll do it.\" It seemed more like a suggestion than an affirmative command. Catrina felt the tightness around her neck slacken slightly, but not enough to let her go. \"You'll do what exactly?...kill her?\" \"-Yep.\" Eyes locking with the man cool and calculating. \"Why do you sound so surprised? I'm not being out of character.\" Catrina could feel the rumble of laughter through the guy next to her. \"-I suppose not, but you're stubbornness is a little out of sync, it's a little unpredictable, and annoying may I add.\" Catrina managed to rasp through her hair. \"His annoyance unpredictable?\" She was forced forward which had her tumble to the floor, she let out a harsh groan as her knees impacted. She was on all fours struggling to recover from her fall, her head snapped up to look at the intruder. \"I am not just another victim, I have a life, like all those before me, and it is you that are the wasters, you come and go as you please... devour everything like locusts, not letting it grow or flourish...not giving it the chance to repent-.\" \"-What are you chica, a fucking nun?\" She was rewarded with a single kick to the abdomen, which knocked her to her side in a huff. Catrina hadn't failed to notice Jack had remained silent. Figures. \"I...I would say I'm p..pretty damn close, I haven't sinned, unlike my predecessors, I would be the most wasted...for I have done nothing!\" She was relieved to get it off her chest and unscrambled, though how pointless and feeble it was going to sound after she's been killed was making her a tiny bit more depressed than she already was. She was going to die. The man grabbed a fistful of her hair, and yanked her head back, Catrina kept her face venomous devoid of agony. \"Not a problem for us sweety, with one less like you in the world preaching; the bad eggs out there will just pile up.\" He kicked her again, she managed to curl up slightly before impact so she was protected...slightly. \"That's enough.\" She heard Jack intervene, in a very stable tone, almost as if he was implying it was his turn. \"You're wasting your time, if I'm going to kill her...I'll just kill her, she ain't one of the others; she's nobodies punch bag.\" But yours. His voice was becoming quieter, she wasn't sure if it was her hearing or his deathly tone of voice. She didn't want to hold herself into a semi foetal position any longer than necessary, she didn't want to look too weak. So she kept on her side, a hand in front her, her head cocked up so she could survey her tormentors, Jack was still harder to see being still against the wall, why was he still over there? \"-What makes you think I'm going to rely on you to finish the job, why do you think I snuck in in the first place.\" \"You could have jeopardised my whole procedure by popping in like that, imagine if the salvagers were aboard, for someone with a century's worth of experience you're not very devious .\" This response made the man bark sardonically, Catrina knew Jack took his 'procedures' whatever they were seriously and would have not liked to be laughed at, she strained her neck to see his reaction. He was straight lipped, and callous looking, almost like a teenager that had just been scawned. \"It's child's play Jack, no one uses victims to fix stuff anymore, it was a novel idea when it began-.\" \"-I make them what they are; greedy, before giving them the death penalty...you seemed to have forgotten the gold.\" Jack was starting to sound more diplomatic by the minute, and she was hoping it would buy her more time, she began to creep backwards. \"Wrong way sweetums.\" She jumped when she realised he was speaking to her without looking, and slightly more surprised to realise it was Jack that had addressed her but in a very dark voice, and after so long ignoring her. Great. The intruder looked over at her, this was probably the first time he had witnessed Jack address her, he swept over to her realising she was a full 4ft away from where he had left her. Grabbing her by her hair, this time she didn't hold back her yelps of anguish, dragging her not back to where she was but all the way in 2 metres in front of Jack. Through watery eyes she noticed Jack was looking at anything but her. \"Okay you've proved you have order, how were you planning on doing this?\" The intruder said a matter of factly. This time it was Jack's turn to look bemused. \"What; I have to write a manifesto before you leave.\" \"-No, I want you to show me.\" Catrina's wincing stopped abruptly as she looked up at the stranger. This was worse than she could ever have imagined it, her death being some form of entertainment. Catrina didn't want to meet Jack's gaze, he had shifted uncomfortably knowing full well he hadn't intended this to happen. His hand brushed her hair, he looked conflicted, unnerving her more. He clucked his tongue before he mustered a reply. \"I don't think so, I work alone.\" \"Well of course, silly.\" The man's pitch grated both of them. \"I'm not going to join in, I would if I was invited, but I don't share fuck buddies.\" Catrina eyes were like saucers; that had never come to her mind, this was much worse, death by...that method. She saw Jack falter at his words. \"You thought I was going to fuck her to death.\" His voice was neutral and questioning. \"That's what you intended to see...what are you funny or something?\" Jack's pitch was on the verge of lunacy. \"Why don't you get a fucking video camera, it'll last longer!\" Catrina's sense of humour was completely flat in the circumstances and she felt too ill to smirk. The intruder's facial expression was a picture, with the words 'Are you stupid?' written at the bottom. \"It'd be a waste if you didn't, I mean...look at you.\" He gestured at Jack's dishevelled form. \"You haven't fed in days...you would have done it sooner or later, except you're doing it today.\" Catrina started at the same time as Jack. \"Under fucking supervision.\" Therefore they said it in unison to their surprise, and Jack wagged a finger at her as a warning to keep quiet, she in return gave him an obedient straight lipped smile. The man observed this exchange and quizzed Jack with a dark look. \"You weren't going to do anything were you?...You were being insincere.\" Catrina knew they had both made an error; in a second of feeling slightly safe, it had now been stripped. His words warmed her because effectively she knew it could have been true. She peeped upwards to Jack's deadpan face which was locked with the strangers, waiting. Jack didn't look awkward in his reply, but defiant. \"No, I just don't like taking orders from you.\" Catrina's breath hitched in her throat. Jack finally left the wall, and with slight empathy she could see why he had been there all that time; he was unbalanced and weak, he seemed to grow paler with every step, manoeuvring his body like a drunk. He had kept up the pretence very well when addressing, but now it was obvious he needed...sustenance, in the form of her, she swallowed sharply. He came to be toe to knee with her, and she didn't have the resolve to grace him with any eye contact. He got to his knees, well to her it seemed like he dropped out of sheer lack of energy. He grabbed her wrists in a vice grip, forcing a gasp out of her. \"Jack...\" She whispered guardedly. Without warning his arms encircled her in a lukewarm hug, crushing her face into his shoulder, she nearly bit him but pushed her chin out of the way for air, her lips grazing his jacket. \"That's right Jack.\" The stranger goaded, She grizzled at this annoying attempt to egg Jack on. Oh God Shut up shut up! Apart from the chill of unadulterated fear, she felt a paranormal warmth emit from his body. Catrina's panic set in when she felt the side effects of what she believed to demon induced hormones, and she felt hazy, she was pushing against him aggressively trying to put at least an inch distance between them so she could slap him, but it was all just so feeble. Her voice quivered. \"No Jack.\" She was beginning to droop. She groaned through gritted teeth as his mouth descended on her neck, she half expected him to bite down, but cringed as he drew his tongue up throat. Then she felt someone come into her head, a dark whisper in her inner ear. ' This will have to be quick, hang on.' It was hardly comforting, neither was the surge of energy and the pulling sensation that ripped her from the earth into a spin and she was falling in a whirl of colours...then... Thud![Chapter 20] Catrina hit the deck at full force with a great ' ooof '. Her hands stopped her face smacking the ground, somewhat stunned and dazed she released an unstable breath as she took in her surroundings for the first time. She was shocked, and overcome with emotion when she found she was no longer on the ship. A sense of victory came to her as she pushed herself up, she laughed as she kicked the dust and rocks on the tarmac, and eyed the fencing and lampposts. How had this happened? Where the hell is this? One moment she was being sexually harassed the next she was in land, what had Jack said ...'hang on?' She wasn't even panicked by the turn of events, she was relatively alone and safe, obviously rescued. Just when she was about to set off on her own towards civilization, movement to her left near a fence made her casually glance. Jack was marching in her direction, not necessarily in a belligerent manner, but he looked severe. \"Didn't fall to far then?\" She heard him call across, closing the space between them. He clasped her forearm as he passed and tugged her to follow. She was filled with disappointment, she was once again a prisoner and she deliberately dragged her feet to the annoyance of her captor. \"I get the impression you're not fond of my company.\" Catrina pulled her arm gently away from Jack, but remained walking at his side. \"-What happened?\" Though she had already figured. \"-Saved your ass, and mine. Hopefully he won't assume the worst and think I went against his wishes, but just needed privacy.\" Slightly apprehensive. \"That's not the reason we're here, is it?\" \"Trust me I'm not going to jump you any time soon.\" \"I've heard you say that before. \" She angled herself in front to stall him. \"Where are we?\" Jack sighed, moving around her, she took the hint that he wasn't going to answer her, and grumbled before reluctantly pursuing him. \"So tell me about this ability of jumping from place to place in seconds.\" Jack amused by her interest, quirked an eyebrow. \"I can't make it a habit you understand. It takes up a lot of energy depending on distance, this was an emergency.\" He seemed to shut up at this point, but knew that his charge; being human, would ask more questions. \"Who was that guy?\" She didn't care if it bothered him she was prying, she had the right to know everything. She smiled when he stopped to look at her dubiously. \"He's like me, we share the same employer.\" He couldn't believe he was going to explain. \"He's more of a freelancer, because he's at the top of his game and his ran out of promotions.\" He worded everything carefully, he made sure of that. Catrina though wasn't satisfied, she needed motive, conviction and reassurance that the guy wouldn't return. \"What does he want with you, well us?\" She hated merging him and her as 'us', she bit her tongue. \"Is he your supervisor?\" She could tell he didn't like her smugness. \"No, he's not in charge of me.\" His voice came out slightly aggressive, Catrina was to some extent pleased by this. Finally he's agitated. \"He gets bored, he volunteers to meddle in other colleague's affairs, he hates being a 'has-been' and he's envious at how young I was when I began, he's stuck in that nearly middle-aged body of his, when I'm like this.\" He indicated to his form. \"Young, and a legend.\" Catrina couldn't help but huff. Legend. \"Believe it or not sweetheart; I am.\" Obviously he had picked up her trail of thought. \"Undoubtedly.\" She mocked. \"Can't you just tell him to piss off?\" He let out a single breathy laugh. \"I think I kind of did, if you were paying attention. Though he's still very influential, I don't think he just wanted to pop by to warn me, he was being serious and that...if you know him, means he wasn't just merely meddling, he was sent by someone, and I've got to find out who.\" Jack gestured for her to follow him. Catrina who had been listening intently was dragged out of thought by Jack returning his grasp to her forearm and guiding her along. \"It's most likely management, though I don't see why they would care.\" They had made it to the pavement, the pregnant pause of their conversation still remained as they moved closer towards civilization, the first bit of civilization Catrina had encountered in weeks and felt almost overwhelming. She bit her lip as they walked by a random man, it was a very forgettable moment in her old life, but she felt completely aware she could touch and talk to any of the people she encountered now, though merely out of urgency. Could she receive any help from these people if she screamed at the top of her lungs? Jack noticed her change in demeanour and the calculating expression on her face, and with haste changed his hold on her by placing an arm around her shoulders, limiting her movement, and being uncomfortably intimate. His breath touched the hair by her ear. \"If you do anything stupid I will eradicate the nearest person.\" Jack said. Catrina understood. The people seemed for ever more out of her reach, as a group of pre-teens walked by completely regardless of the hostage situation. The pending doom seemed to make her more scarily eager to seek help, but she once again had to bite her tongue, she felt nervous nausea creep on her. \"So we're just stretching our legs?...Before we go back?\" She looked to her right towards the main street while eyeing Jack. He seemed to have composed his face into that of a decent human being and had a crude smile. \"Is that a yes?\" She then grumbled hoping to coax a response from him. \"You know you're really good fun when you pissed at somebody else.\" \"Am I now?\" Catrina hadn't expected an answer to that and immediately regretted putting that thought into his head. \"So talk to me, there was me thinking you were slightly irritated.\" She felt the rumble in his chest, and she honestly thought he was going to scream 'shut up' in her ear. She earnestly brought him to a halt with a bit of difficulty, trying to get a fully grown man to stop when he had you in a headlock was hard. \"Where are we going?\" He sighed heavy heartedly, that's if he had one. \"A hotel?\" Catrina snorted initially thinking it was some sick joke, when he glanced to gauge her reaction, he just furrowed his eyebrows. \"No.\" She said incredulously. \"I'm not sleeping on the street like some hobo.\" That was a funny mental image that would surely get her through a rainy day. \"It's more than you deserve.\" Jack rolled his eyes. \"Whatever, I'm too tired to argue with you.\" She pulled a face, wondering if that was why he was holding her so tight, because he didn't have the energy to run after her, or maybe more bluntly he couldn't stand up without support. \"Don't even think about it.\" \"Wow-you're so out of it, that was really slow...it crept into my head like 5 minutes ago...and now you're picking that up from me?\" She was triumphant and she didn't miss his wounded look, which didn't come naturally to him. \"Don't expect me to pay for these hotel rooms.\" A dark chuckle escaped his blue lips, blue? \"Rooms?...Don't you want to share?\" She knew that was coming. \"How are you paying?\" She didn't know why this bothered her, it was probably the fear he was going to kill someone to get a room. \"I have money.\" He patted his jacket pocket. \"I have a gun as well but that's pointless.\" Catrina eyed him, where was he keeping this gun? I wonder if he has a mobile too? They awkwardly crossed a road, Jack seemed to stagger and Catrina was forced into this reckless manoeuvre. A hotel loomed in the distance, with seedy red neon lights, not very promising. She had earlier on felt reluctant, but when seeing the plush if not slightly downgraded lounge, and vending machine she felt relieved. Even more so when she saw a row of phone booths.[Chapter 21] Sorry I take so long, college work and other fanfics distract me, please review...even if it's just a smiley face. Catrina threw her captor down on the bed, it was a very odd thought. Her, assisting her kidnapper . She looked down at him, he was a pitiful site, he returned her gaze with a frown. \"Don't rape me.\" He drawled keeping the energy in his voice. She huffed before disappearing into the bathroom. She fixed her hair, while using the mirror to secretly observe Jack, who made no attempt to see what she was doing, she could have been making a weapon for all he cared, but his drowsiness was overwhelming him, which would benefit her greatly. It was a novelty to be in such a cleaner place, and no rust. Though she couldn't get use to it...she'd be out of here in a couple of hours and on her way home. Catrina took a deep breath before gracing Jack with her presence, he turned his head towards her, a dark look in his eye. She made sure her chair was more than an arm's length away, to be on the safe side. \"So you might as well sleep, that's why you brought us here, right?\" She said nonchalantly. \"Yeah, you would like that wouldn't you?\" He awkwardly shuffled to the end of the bed, and Catrina instinctively thought he was going to swipe her, but all he did was turn on his side, so his body was fully facing her. \"I can't sleep.\" She quirked an eyebrow. \"Do you want me to read you a bedtime story?\" \"Piss off.\" He half panted, triggering a smile that dimpled her cheeks. \"You need protection.\" \"-We both need protection.\" Not hesitating to point out the obvious, he was foolish to think he could hold her in one place and protect them simultaneously. \"You're not fit for anything-\" \"Now that's not a nice thing to say to a guy.\" He muttered, staring up at her through heavily lidded eyes. There was a pregnant pause which had Catrina fidget, he drew in a shallow breath, before deliberating. \"I think you should sleep, right here.\" He patted the edge of the bed. She stared at the space he had suggested, hoping it would take her to the underworld and out of his clutches. \"Sleep is the last thing on my mind.\" She rubbed her temples, he observed her wariness and smirked. \"It's the last thing on your mind?...I don't think I'm fit enough to give you the first.\" Catrina narrowed her eyes at his attempt to make a joke out of a sick situation. \"I need to get us something to eat, there's a vending machine downstairs, do you have any change?\" Her hand hovered sheepishly in his face, she tried to sound as innocent as she could allow, even when he remained silent, sucking in his lips as if contemplating. \"You'll have to wait 'till morning.\" \"Why?\" restraining a squawk. \"I could just go. \" She urged. Jack bit back a laugh. \"Then why haven't you?\" The suggestion lilted his face, and he looked very humoured to her displeasure, that was a good question. The pregnant pause was a little too long, and she cringed, she hadn't given him a quick fire answer. Did he really get under her skin that bad? \"Oh... I will.\" She managed. \"I was just making sure you had no magic tricks up your sleeve to drag me back into the room.\" She faked a little arrogance; it never came naturally to her. She caught his wounded look and awkwardly gave him a straight lipped smile, was he seriously using his looks to keep her there? \"If you do decide to go, I'll be forced to come with you.\" He pushed himself up, an action that surprised her, it made the journey to the door look slightly impossible, for he now looked more than capable to pursue her, maybe even drag her to the floor and pin her. \"Are you willing to risk hurting yourself?\" She inquired keeping her voice void of frustration, if she didn't sound concerned enough for his well being he would never let her leave, if she didn't sound willing to come back. \"I'll take the risk honey.\"He stood to his full height, he wavered, his knees were buckling, she shocked herself at what she did next; weeks ago she would have happily witnessed him fall on his smug face, but now she was running to him, her front pressed against his, her arms tucked under his to steady him. \"Careful'\" The word tumbled out of her mouth before she could stop herself, and Catrina sensed the tension in the muscles of his chest cavity, as if he was struggling to breathe. Was her presence affecting his inner demon. She reluctantly pulled back, face flushing. \"Um, right, so...food.\" Coming back to reality, quickly catching his confused facial expression, which was a rarity. \"So those vending machines I seen downstairs...they've gotta work, right?\" She moved away from him, feeling the coolness return to her. She had to get away, she felt warm and confused with him, she almost couldn't trust herself anymore, knowing how his powers can create urges to benefit him. She recalled him saying 'he would protect her', but would he faulter if she willingly threw herself on him. It was crazy, she hated the man, she wasn't sexually attracted to people who forcibly took her from home. Catrina's mother closed her cabin door behind her, her husband turned at the sound, and awarded her a strained smile. \"Did you speak to Murphy?\" She nodded and breezed forward, taking his hand. \"The question is what or who, could be doing this?\" Every creak in the hallway behind her put her on edge, and she softened the tone of her voice to deter eavesdroppers \"We might even have to go to shore.\" Mike snapped, pulling out of her grasp. \"No, no..and no! Don't you understand this is what he wants, this has...it's got to be Jack, it has to be!\" Maureen shushed her husband, inching closer so he could feel her breath, to sooth his current aggressive state. \"Don't you think I might have considered that too. It's not just Jack that's against us here, it's over half of the underworld. Do you remember what I told you about Pavlov, and Robert's mother...the medium?\" Mike gave her a soulful look. \"Yeah...messages from beyond the grave, yadda yadda yadda-\" \"Then you'll know we have forces on our side, Catrina has a little protection.\" She stated, trying to convince herself as well as the man before her. \"But what worries me is our crew, don't you think it's possible they don't want us to get there?\" This played on her mind, it made her grow cold, her trusted friends could ruin everything, just because they were scared and wouldn't admit it. She was startled when dodge cleared his throat. \"Maybe we should call a meeting, instead of talking behind their backs?\" r&r;[Chapter 22] Maureen and her husband piled into the cabin, with severe looks on their faces. The crew met their gaze with apprehension. It had been a long and rough day since their last meeting. And the sky was pink and the sea calm from the previous storm. Cutting to the chase. -\"Our tankard of fresh water has been half drained.\" The others looked at one another, though it convinced her of their innocence, her eyes trained on them longer then necessary. \"Now didn't I tell us to all to be careful?\" Munder stood to attention. \"You did, what are you calling us irresponsible?\" Santos gruffly added. \"Well actually you said be careful with the food.\" \"Oh shut up.\"Murphy retorted eyeballing Santos with distaste. \"Excuses, excuses.\" \"You always do this, picking fights with me, get over yourself, man!\" \"-Well if you stop making smart ass remarks, then I'll stop picking fights with you.\" \"Yeah 'fucking' right!\" Maureen's neck hurt from tennis-ing between the two. \"Guys, this doesn't solve the problem of the water shortage.\" Greer looked quite perplexed by the whole situation, but remained silent, Dodge immediately jumped on this. \"Haven't you got anything to say?\" Greer glared up at him. \"Well I didn't know we were taking turns.\"Removing his cap and slamming it on the table. \"How about we all just go around yelling at each other!\" Maureen raised her arms, this had to stop. \"Enough!\" If these men were going to have a slinging match, it would be a waste of time and energy, and their resources were running thin. \"What are we going to do about this?\" Trying to contain her annoyance, she looked at Dodge for guidance. Murphy stepped in to take the reins. \"Well as former Captain, can I suggest the obvious.\" Everyone turned to listen intently, Maureen had a bad feeling what he was going to say. \"We can't go on without supplies, we can't delay it any longer, we will have to go to the coast, and fast\" There was a ring of groans around the cabin. \"I know, but I don't want Jack to win by having us starve to death, or dehydrate.\" Of course he was right, Maureen would thank him later. 'Clunk' \"It's not accepting it.\" Catrina retrieved the coin from the vending machine, dipping to retrieve it. \"I'll try again.\" Jack leaned rather awkwardly against the machine watching her dainty fingers shove the nickel into the slot. 'Clunk' She grumbled. Fuck. By habit she looked about her as if preparing to ask for change, but she became vaguely aware of the hot sticky blue eyes on her, and she smiled sheepishly at the man next to her. \"Can we go back to the room now?\" Catrina smiled, and pretended to fiddle with the machine. \"Yeah of course you can, I'll meet you there.\" It went quiet next to her, and she ignored the temptation to ogle him, she heard him sigh aggressively. \"Aren't you coming?\" She gave him a blank look. \"I'm busy.\" Soon as it left her lips, she was jolted sideways by Jack cruelly grabbing her wrist, he was still freakishly strong. \"Do you think I was born yesterday.\" He hissed dangerously close to her ear, it ruffled her hair, almost tickling her. \"If I weren't s-\" He stilled, Catrina confused- tried to look around to see if anything was wrong, she was startled by an invasive hand grabbing her ass. EP! Her voice shook. \"What are doing?\" Jack looked darkly from the corner of his eye. And she had the audacity to remain perfectly still, and not pull out of his hold. \"Some guy was looking at you.\" He said simply, staring past her, she figured at the guy in question. \"So you decided to mark your territory!\" She huffed, elbowing him out of the way to try another vending machine, soon as the hand swept off her ass, if felt surprisingly cold – she wouldn't want to admit she missed it. \"I'm surprised you didn't pee on me.\" She added, Jack slowing creeping after her. \"If you're in to that kind of thing, I will.\" She returned a mortified look, hoping he was joking, he didn't smile only grimace. Why did he have to be a damn smartass all the time? She wondered if he was this annoying around her parents, she snorted – that's probably why they didn't stay in touch. She was brought back to the present by a drawl. \"I'm still here you know.\" Fear and embarrassment coursed through her spine. \"Oh my god, were you listening to me!\" She nearly broke a nail slamming the nickel into the slot. \"Ouch..Again, butt out!\" She waved her hand to flush out the pain. This time he laughed, well at least he was not angry. He astonished her again by seizing her hand, and bringing it to his lips in a gentle kiss, his eyes trailing on hers, until she forced them away, clearly uncomfortable by his advances – as usual. \"So tired.\" He sighed, releasing her hand. For a second she pitied him. \"Because you're wasting energy watching over me.\" \"I kind of have to.\" There it was again, that strange- stupid motive. \"Why Jack? I really don't see why you have to.\" She pleaded. It was true, the reason she had been given, if it were true; payment...was stupid, and unbelievable. Revenge maybe, but that was also a waste of time, he could have just killed her. This revelation stilled her and she forced her focus back to the man with the sheepish grin, and crystal blue eyes. \"You've kept me alive all this time.\" He observed her wariness with a glassy stare. \"You're right, maybe I should have some reward?\" She flinched as he tried to reach for her, he finally withdrew with a mocking smile. \"I'll wait though.\" She felt nervous tension build up with every fibre in her body. Was that a promise? Would it be so bad? She recomposed her defiant face and strutted down the hall, in steady pursuit by her capture. It played on her mind, was he waiting for her, or was he waiting for him to be capable... hopefully she wouldn't have long to wait . She froze, and immediately rephrased her thought trial ...because I would have got away by then. Much better. Catrina meandered by the entrance doors, venturing on whether if she bolted now, how far she would get. She felt Jack breathe down her neck once more, and again a moment of dread recoiled her. A hooker was lurking on the curb outside, waiting to be picked up. To Catrina's dismay she noticed Jack was staring at her, with rapt attention. God No! She needed to warn her, though would she be wasting her time, hookers are probably warned all the time – clients are dangerous. She never thought she would say this. \"Jack let's just go back to the room.\" Trying desperately to snag his attention. His eyes were still hungrily locked on the lady of the night. \"Come on let's go.\" She tugged at his jacket, he acknowledged her with a scowl. \"Oh really.\" She was puzzled to what that meant. \"Behave or I will kill them.\" No sooner had he said this he began to inch her closer to a desk, where a man and woman were talking, they looked to be in their thirties. \"Hey.\" He used his human voice. They looked up immediately, very quizzical. \"Could you watch my little sister for me?\" Catrina spotted his serene look, and shook her head disbelievingly. \"What?\" He squeezed her shoulders threateningly and she hiccupped. The woman stepped closer to the desk. \"We don't normally babysit for guests.\" The lady caught Catrina's expression. \"Is she alright?\" \"No.\" Jack grabbed the back of Catrina's neck, forcing her to smile. The woman's companion looked at them suspiciously. \"Aren't you the drunk from earlier?\" Catrina smirked. Jack kindly informed him. \"Why do you care?\" The man looked offended, his girlfriend breezed by it – as if use to the verbal abuse. \"How old are you honey, you look old enough to look after yourself.\" Catrina opened her mouth to answer, but Jack spoke over her. \"She's 15, and she has mild learning disabilities.\" The teenager gapped at him. The-son-of-a-bitch. \"A little schizophrenic, she talks rubbish a lot.\" \"I certainly do not!\" The hand behind her neck squeezed tightly. \"She don't look 15, nor does she look disturbed.\" \"How the hell would you know that? You don't even know her.\" Jack retorted, shoving Catrina forward into the desk. \"Are you going to watch her or not, she can't be left alone, there's fifty dollars in it for ya.\" Now that will wet their appetite. \"Each.\" \"A hundred bucks, just to watch a girl?\" They exclaimed incredulously. \"Where are you going?\" \"Again. Why do you care?\" Catrina felt him fidget behind her, and his hand came up and slapped fifty bucks onto the desk before them. \"Hey, you said a hundred!\" The guy still seemed eager to touch the money. \"You'll get the other fifty when I come back, if she is still in the same room, in one piece.\" The woman did the negotiating. \"How long?\" \"An hour.\" \"That's it?\"The woman looked at him like he was an angel. Far from it. Catrina inwardly cringed. \"Make sure she's kept to herself, no contact with anyone, and calm her down if she gets...hysterical.\" She had to roll her eyes at this point. The woman grabbed her like a prized possession. \"Of course.\" Jack halted her before she could remove Catrina completely from his grasp. He gave her a hug, for appearances, and she went incredibly stiff. He breathed in her ear. \"If anything happens I will kill them.\" He pulled back, his face heavily composed. \"I'll be back soon.\" He spoke down to her as if she were a child, again all an act. Catrina glowered at him as he left her, and disappeared through the double doors into the night.[Chapter 23] She had no affection for the people watching over her, just mindless obedience. They had stored her – that's right stored, in a room on the bottom floor, with a TV set and a couch, an almost seedy looking lounge area, where no one else visited, apart from her babysitters. The woman was painting her nails while watching the TV, occasionally glancing up at her. The man was seated next to her. Her temptation to tell them was unbearable, she felt her head might explode, it almost put her off her packet of potato chips. Maybe if she didn't have such a guilty conscience she could just run and never look back. Jack might not kill them if she said nothing and just ran. She threw down her snack, bored. \"Can I go to the bathroom?\" Would it be that simple? The guy met her girlfriend's gaze questioningly. \"Sure hun, Rick?-Show her to the bathroom.\" Catrina's eyes crinkled with a smile of relief, things really were that simple. She pushed herself up and was ushered out by the guy. His hand seemed to linger on the lower part of her back for too long before slipping down. She lurched forward. \"Hey! I'm not stupid.\" She stated pointing accusingly at him. He gave her a ghost of a smile. \"And neither am I, you're a bit well developed for a 15 year old.\" His hand hovered slightly over her breast, and she slapped it away. \"If you are smart you won't touch me, and I think it's obvious I'm not his little sister.\" She turned on her heel. \"Now where's the bathroom?\" She gestured to the corridor ahead of her, hoping for no further interrogation. He eyed her again, she noticed this from the corner of her vision. \"So how old are you then? Why does that guy want you watched?\" She didn't have time for this, or the energy to go through with the worry over if she was endangering their lives by opening her trap. \"Can't he trust you?\" Sometimes she wished people would just guess, she sighed. \"There's nothing you can do about it.\" She said firmly, keeping her eyes peeled for a toilet symbol. \"Right, I'm guessing you play around a bit, I guess he's caught you in the act a few times huh?\" Catrina tutted, before throwing a nasty look at the Hawaiian shirt clad man. \"That's not it at all-\" She cut herself off, not wanting to be dragged into anything with this man, she didn't want to confess to anything. \"It ain't nothing to be ashamed of, I play around, you play around.\" He caught up with her, and halted her to indicate to a door on her left. She nodded in return and moved towards it, she huffed when he halted her again. Damn she was getting sick of this. \"I bet there are a few things I could do with that mouth of yours.\" He grinned, and she elbowed him in the ribs, he doubled over and she slammed the door behind her. \"I'll be out here if you change your mind!\"She heard him groan. Now she was just nauseas, not because of the offer, but her sudden willingness to let the creep die. How wicked . The window was beckoning her, she could leave...if Jack returned, and they said she just ran off with no explanation- it would be just her own and Jack's problem, surely he would spare them? Unless he chose never to come back at all, it could have been a speedy way to be rid of her. Maybe she was well and truly free? Finally deciding, she wrenched open the window and began her escape. She awkwardly fell from the pane and ambled to her feet, her eyes were sharp, wary of the darkness that was looming. She was in an alleyway between dumpsters, the street light landed on her person in strips, and she squinted from the glare. She knew the most important thing was to put some distance from her keepers, and overall the town, away from Jack. She took to the street at a steady jog, eyeing her surroundings, looking out for navy jackets or green shirts. Her heart was in her throat from excitement, panic and determination. Despite her enthusiasm, her limbs weighed her down; she didn't have energy to the full capacity, since she hadn't eaten a proper meal in days. There were street walkers watching her scurry past, she ignored them. Fleeting moments of remorse flattened by her eagerness to find a phone, preferably a free one. A ride would help, but there is no way she would get a free ride hitchhiking in this town, she would probably be expected to perform oral sex. Catrina cut across a grass verge and through some bushes in order to cross a parking lot. She didn't like being in the open, for obvious reasons, and even if it made her safer being in public, it didn't prevent the harm of the witnesses. She spied a couple eating take-out in a car and her stomach grumbled. No, she wouldn't ask. There was a mall coming off the park lot, and she headed straight to it, she gathered it shut late. The lights were overwhelming inside and made her eyes water, she lowered her head as she went by unsuspecting members of public. A few odd glances later; she spotted a phone booth. She awkwardly stilled, waiting for some teenagers to walk by, before rushing to it. Self-consciously she got there, and a shakily picked up the receiver, so relieved she was to have something so mundane in her hand which would bring her closer to home. Catrina called a reverse charge number at a moment's pause, a voice prompted her to enter the number she wished to call, as well as record her name. \"Catrina Dodge.\" She murmured. She shuddered as it dialled out, when it began to ring; her breath was uncontrollable, it racked her whole body, she felt a nervous happiness consume her over the ring tones. But after about a minute, she nervously coughed, the tone was giving her a headache, this suggested no one had answered, and no one was in, she waited, then the tone stopped completely and she hung up, extremely disappointed. Why weren't her parents at home? She could only assume they were out looking for her. She bit her thumb nail and self consciously looked at various shoppers. Maybe if she called the police, Jack wouldn't be able to kill the entire force. She turned on her heel and dialled 911, when she connected to the police, she automatically burst into a speech. \"Hello this is Catrina Dodge, I think my family may have reported me missing, I was kidnapped-\" \"Hang on, sweetie...Catrina...Dodge.\" She sensed the officer was writing everything down. There was a pause that seemed to go on forever until- \"Okay...well... your name hasn't popped up on the register, you were kidnapped you say? Are you away from your kidnapper?\" \"Yes.\" She said with conviction. \"Where are you now, honey?\" The female officer's concern soothed her. \"I'm in the mall.\" \"What mall is that?\" Catrina blinked, she cursed her hesitance, she didn't know where she was, and she had stupidly intended to send the entire force to rescue her. \"..I don't know.\" She said weakly. \"Can't you trace the call?\" \"I certainly can, give me a few minutes.\" Catrina sighed and leaned against the wall, she smirked as she watched some youths throwing fries into each other's mouth in a nearby food court. They were so carefree, like how she once was with her friends. She smiled sadly, and held the phone closer to her ear. Her eyes panned across the various shops, she noticed the exits were all clear apart from a couple of janitors. She suddenly went cold, she jerked back further into the booth area, nearly dropping the phone. Jack had just waltzed through one of the entrances, his demeanour cool and casual, if not slightly calculating. He looked fresh faced, and agile...not a good sign, someone had died to make him like that. She watched his movements, frozen with fear. The man hadn't seen her, and didn't appear to be looking for her...good sign. Jack had seemed to have mislaid his jacket, or more accurately it was damaged and had to be disposed of. He breezed by some shoppers, and indulged in some window shopping. It was an unusual sight if anything, she was almost gleeful to be spying on him doing something vaguely human. Her body kicked in and she automatically lurched behind of a wide pillar, stretching the phone cable to its limit as she countered his pace, complimenting it with her shifting behind the pillar, keeping out of his line of sight. She pressed the phone to her ear like it was a life line as her body held firm in his blind spot. 'Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!' Her breath hitched, Jack had changed direction and was heading towards her area. Shit. \"I've got to go, he's here.\" Before she could hear a reply, she dropped the phone, so it hung uselessly off the receiver, but allowed the operator to still trace the call. Catrina crept around the pillar as Jack loomed, and there she made a dash across the floor, through a family of shoppers and under some escalators. He was oblivious of her, credit to her stealth. She removed her top layer of clothing and stashed it in a bin. Now her outer colour she gave off was different to how he would remember. From her point of view, she could see his pasty complexion had a bit of a rosy tint, and his aristocratic features were blank, but she could tell he was heavily engrossed by the manikins. She was a little surprised how he was ignoring everyone, there wasn't a look of distaste when someone got considerably close, even when a rowdy load of kids ambled past, he barely bristled. A family walked past her hiding place, and she immediately took her chance; she casually walked along side them, keeping her head down. From the corner of her eye Jack shifted from his position at the window and into the shop. A tremendous weight lifted off her chest, and she broke into a run to the exit.[Chapter 24] Inform me of any spelling mistakes, sorry for the delay...I have a couple more stories going on at the same time and I haven't been at home. \"Land a hoy!\" Munder jeered. \"I'm getting me some sloppy joe's!\" He hopped down from the roof of the helm while Greer told him to take it easy. Maureen heard the commotion and came out to investigate. It was a depressing sight, seeing mountains looming in the distance. She smiled affectionately when she felt an arm encircle her. \"Don't worry it won't take long.\" Murphy soothed. She simply nodded. \"We best keep our eyes peeled.\" Catrina stood behind a parked car, trying to look inconspicuous. Some cars on the main road would slow down and she would eye them suspiciously, the sooner the police came the better. Plus she was getting cold. She couldn't properly bask in her new escape attempt when she knew she could be in immediate danger at any second. Even if she did have an armed escort, someone was bound to get hurt, unlikely Jack. When she caught a glimpse and red and blue light, she stepped out into the open, and a police wagon pulled up as she flagged them down. She was still jittery from the adrenaline and probably looked like some junkie. \"Are you alright ma'am, you got a problem?\" They were out the car in a heartbeat. She hesitated, eyeing around her. \"I called the station earlier, I wanted to be picked up...I was kidnapped. Can you help me?\" The Cop pressed a hand to her back. \"Sure, get in.\" He guided her in, shielding her head as she made to sit in the back. \"Is he still around?\" He leant on the door. \"I don't know, I only just got away.\" \"I understand, I'll take you to the station and you can file a report.\" Her smile was genuine, and as the down was slammed shut and they were pulling away, her nerves dissipated and was replaced with unrelinquished excitement. She was going home. The docks were rife with sailors... well duh . Civilization was a privilege, other people- just seeing new faces was a relief and took the abnormality out of their current task. But knowing these people could hold them back, or easily disillusion by how safe they think they are made them all cringe. Maureen and the others were once one of them. Never bothered by their mortality. They dispersed when they reached the bars and the supermarkets, eager to begin shopping. Maureen and her husband walked down the promenade hand in hand. Getting out of the squad car was a luxury in itself, the seating was plush and the company was professionally escorting her to the official building, this brought her closer to normality...if that's what you would call it? The woman behind the desk observed her sceptically as she gave her details, it occurred to her it was probably a regular thing, young girl runaways gone wrong making a report. It seemed to click when the woman took in her attire, she figured she looked stable and secure and was telling the truth. The aftershock from the turn of events caught up with her as she took in the room she had been placed in. The rape suite. Undoubtedly used to console victims and prepare them to make a rape kit. Catrina shivered. She was relieved she wouldn't have to go through that ordeal, yes, compared to some scum on the planet, Jack had been fairly chivalrous. It nearly made her laugh, but instead she found herself close to tears, she couldn't have imaged weeks ago how her life would suddenly change forever, this would be with her for the rest f her life...and one daunting aspect – she would be running for the rest of her life. Jack was still out there somewhere. Catrina heard a voice outside, it was echoing around the hallway, making it impossible to distinguish one word from the next. They was pacing up and down with restless fervour, it made her anxious. She was tempted to devour her nails. A woman finally entered, obviously to make an account and to counsel her. \"Hello err-\"She glanced at her itinerary.\"Catrina Dodge?\" She merely nodded while fiddling with her sleeves. \"Right, my name is Karen Spencer, now my dear we can go through this slowly...as long as it takes, or we could have a brief session.\" The woman finished before looking moderately severe. \"Now, we have tried contacting your next of kin but we don't seem to be getting through to anybody.\" Catrina cleared her throat. \"Well I suppose they're out looking for me.\" \"Yes I suppose that's it.\" Karen smiled shortly before breezing on. \"Now I know this is hard for you but, could you explain everything you can remember?\" For a fleeting second she felt guilty she didn't feel uncomfortable about delivering her story of woes, but listening to herself explaining what transpired was laughable and unbelievable, she would have to spring clean it make it seem more human and less... supernatural. \"I had just come back from a job interview, I went into my home and...\" Her pause for thought was mistaken for upset and anxiety and Karen delicately soothed her. \"I thought I heard my mother moving around in the house, but it wasn't...that's when I was grabbed.\" The woman hummed as she took it down. \"What else?..Did he restrain you?\" Catrina blinked. \"Erm he...chloroformed me?\" It was the easiest thing to say. \"I went out like a light.\" Further scribbling in front of her made her clear her throat, more anxiety wracked over her, she wondered if this really was an assessment. She sighed with apprehension before ploughing on with the tricky bit. \"I woke up on a ship tied up in a cabin, I had been blind folded.\" \"-I suppose so you're not able to identify your attacker. But I'm curious - how did you know where you were if you were blindfolded?\" She asked sceptically. Catrina grimaced. \"Well it wasn't on all the time, anyhow anyone would tell by the swaying, but I eventually saw my captor.\" Karen's pen hovered over her notes in a thoughtful manner. \"Oh yes...and what did he look like?\" Catrina wet her lips, perhaps she was imagining it but the woman sounded less than satisfied.\"Well he had short cropped brown hair, intense blue eyes, a defined jaw line.\" Okay now she was describing a model. \"He kind of has a natural pout when he relaxes his face.\" \"-Height?\" \"I never really took any notice, but when I was standing up he was about a foot or more taller than me...if that helps?\" Karen merely nodded absently, focus remained on her pad as she further queried. \"So you believed you were on a ship?\" \"No, I know I was on a ship, I saw the ocean all the way around, there was swaying.\" \"-Perhaps you were hallucinating, you had been heavily sedated.\" Catrina didn't mean to snap. \"No Ms Spencer he only sedated me once... to get me to the ship, I was there weeks, unless I was tripping for a month, I was definitely on an abandoned ship!\" Her grumble helped soothe her, she wasn't going to resort to violence. \"An abandoned ship? I'm sorry I find it difficult to believe a wreck wouldn't have been picked up by the authorities or a coast guard, not to mention flybys, but there's no doubt you are a mystery. You're not a runaway, you claimed to have been kidnapped and you haven't been reported missing.\" The tension was dispelled when Karen sucked in a breath. \"Do you come from a broken home Ms Dodge, how is the relationship with your parents?\" Catrina gave a smile full of mirth. \"Are you kidding me?..I have a healthy relationship with my family, I don't know why they haven't reported me, I assume they don't trust the law, unreliable sometimes Ms Spencer.\" The name rolled of her tongue like an insult. \"I think you should be more concerned with the psychopath who abducted me.\" Ms Spencer stared her out, hoping to read her, surely Catrina is a text book case – but the girl was so natural – but the story a little odd. \"Why did he abduct you, ransom, and more importantly why did he let you go?\" \"He didn't.\" Catrina began on bated breath. \"I got away, he left me with some seedy hotel owners and that's when I took off. The abduction I believe was...\" She hadn't a clue, it was still something she hadn't covered with Jack, should she mention she was informed it was out of revenge, or some form of payment – Anything will put her parents into trouble. \"...I think he was lonely.\" She finally got out, wincing at how sympathetic she sounded, the professional frowned. \"Well most classic cases are.\" Karen's face softened, deliberating on Catrina's mental state after her sudden bout of empathy. \"A month is a long time away from home, especially in the company of a mysterious stranger, you may grow close-\" It was Catrina's turn to frown as Ms Spencer continued. \"-You may even feel protected, or special because you feel he has singled you out for mystical purposes, you hate turns to sympathy...then you start to blame yourse-\" Catrina shook her head seeing where this was all going. \"I'm not attached, I'm not suffering from Stockholm syndrome as you adequately put it. It's the only reason I can think of why he abducted me.\" Locking eyes with the woman she could see fleeting moments of doubt and instantly knew what was going to be asked next. \"Did he make you do anything?\" She brought up rather persuasively but in a professional manner – never stalling or showing discomfort. \"Did he touch you in appropriately?..Which I'm assumed he-\" Catrina cut her off with a grimace, now she was increasingly aware of where she was, and what this type of woman was after. She wanted the dirt, something to parade with in court, something to counsel her over, or to pass her on to a therapist...or shrink. \"Sometimes...\" She hesitated. \"Take your time.\" Catrina, once she started she wanted to finish. \"He would touch me, but not there. He would restrain me a lot, sometimes lie next to me on a bed, there was an occasion when he forced me onto his lap-\" \"Did he penetrate you?\" Karen interrupted rather lewdly. Catrina swallowed uncomfortably, she couldn't believe thousands of girls like her could go through something so thorough and degrading – the interview she meant, not just the ordeal. Her eyes prickled with tears – she didn't know why, why did she have to be upset? \"He did not, he never did.\" \"Are you sure, you might not have realised...you could have been while you were sedated?\" Damn, this woman wouldn't give up would she? But she had a point, anything could have happened before she woke up on that ship. She just shook her head. \"No, I would know if I was ( ), I'm not sexually active. There were times when he could have, but didn't.\" She said groggily not sure if she was going to throw up or burst into tears. \"Did he make you do stuff to him?\" Catrina nearly grabbed her pad but instead settled on- \"Okay can we stop now please.\" She said brazenly. The woman stalled in her writing and sat bolt upright. \"It's alright we can stop my dear...it's just while it's still fresh.\" \"-I think you're getting fresh.\" \"Catrina I am only here to help, to document your ordeal...I don't do this for kicks.\" Catrina returned a honest look to her, keeping her hostility under wraps, she smiled weakly before continuing on with this weird topic. \"No, nothing\" She needed to bring up other horrible things to paint a more severe picture of the man. \"He did dislocate my arm, but he fixed it. There were others brought to the boat, but he killed them before I had a chance to communicate with them.\" Ms Spencer gave her a concerned once over before jotting everything down. \"So he is a killer, why do you think he killed them, who were they?\" Catrina blinked. \"Well I don't know, I assume to keep him company but he changed his mind.\" It was getting ridiculous steering from the truth – should she even attempt the demon explanation? That would indeed be futile. \"He moved us off the boat when someone visited and became hostile.\" \"I see. My we have a lot down here.\" She sighed glancing down at her notes. \"I think we will take a break...\" Catrian reached for her hand, and Ms Spencer acknowledged her warmly. \"You do believe me don't you?\" She had to believe it, if it was stripped of the ludicrous truths – what would make her doubt her? \"Of course Ms Dodge, I take everything seriously, get some rest, I will send someone down to assess you in half an hour, have you had a rape kit?\" Catrina went white. \"No. I thought I didn't have to since-\" \"It's alright, you don't have to.\" She soothed. \"We might need your clothes for DNA analysis, I'm afraid we need to check you over for any signs of sexual activity, it's regulations, it doesn't always require...penetration.\" She finished rather stiffly and Catrina withdrew her hand like she had been burned. She was left alone but she could tell she was being monitored by CCTV cameras positioned in the corner of the room.[Chapter 25] This chapter was complicated to write. Inform me of any grammatical errors. and r&r.; Catrina should enjoy the luxury of a closed door, it couldn't have been any simpler. But her over active and dangerously anxious imagination had her bring the door ajar – just so she could watch what was going on -on the other side of it. She wanted to see new people, and hear their voices...they were of the living, something she had taken for granted. For a month she had been listening to voices of the dead. She rocked back on her chair to see further down the hall, she could just make out Ms Spencer drinking coffee while analysing her notes, a man was talking to her in a casual manner – she wasn't quite sure if it was about her, she assumed the worse when Spencer passed him the notes and he glanced up and caught Catrina's eye. She didn't like it, and instantly wanted to kick the door shut. They were passing judgement on her...not the culprit...her! A young woman came in, by the looks of it a med student fresh out of school, she smiled on entry, and closed the door, breaking the man and the woman from her line of sight, she blinked. \"Did you hear me?\" \"Err...sorry.\" She tipped head. \"Just put your clothes in the bag and I will give you this.\" The girl beamed. \"These fetching pink scrubs.\" Catrina could tell she was trying to cheer her up, she returned a weak smile. \"Very nice, thanks...\" \"Lisa.\" She chimed. \"Thanks Lisa.\" She bobbed her head and began to de-robe behind a screen, Lisa appeared next to her almost sensing she was ready by the rustle of a brown bag. \"There you go.\" \"Okay now I need to take a swab, just so we can make sure we don't get your DNA mixed with...err-\" \"I understand perfectly.\" She opened her mouth, she had watched CSI , so she knew how it was done, the cotton bud was rolled around her mouth and then placed in a sealed container. \"Done?\" \"Sorry honey I'll need to do the internal examination, we could go into another room if it makes you feel more comfortable?..I think it's best.\" \"Does it have to be done, I know I haven't been interfered with.\" Lisa shrugged uncomfortably. \"It's regulations, and it's my job...I don't dare ask them to give you a break...it's my first week.\" She grimaced holding her kit to her chest. \"Perhaps-\" A man barged in, the same man who had been conferring with the 'shrink', he stalled in the doorway. \"Sorry am I interrupting?\" Lisa grumbled. \"Yes, learn to knock...this is a private area and I'm in the middle of a-\" \"You won't mind if I snag your patient for a minute will you?\" He asked nonchalantly, leaning on the door, Catrina could tell Lisa wasn't amused in the slightest. \"Thank you, come on.\" He gestured, Catrina didn't look like she had much of a choice and she followed him into the next room. When seating herself down, she awkwardly twiddled with her thumbs on the table top as he closed the door, fleetingly seeing cops and Ms Spencer waltzing by in the hall outside. When the man turned to lean against an opposing wall he appeared to brief himself using a notepad before meeting her gaze sharply. \"Catrina.\" \"Yes, I think I've been through this.\" She stated keeping patient. \"Are you...a fed?\" The man smiled. \"You're good, and I'm flattered I look the part, people normally consider me not so...due to my looks.\" Catrina smiled stiffly, not sure if this was the beginning to sound like a good cop/ bad cop scenario. \"Okay...do you have anything important to say?\" He pushed off the wall, an action which could have startled her if she hadn't have been already on edge. \"You were very tricky to find, for a moment I thought I found you, fleeting glimpses...then you were gone, and now you're here, with me.\" Catrina was stifled, her mouth went dry and she cocked her head. \"What do you mean by that?\" \"I was looking for you. Duh.\" He smiled wolfishly. \"I thought I hadn't been reported missing?\" She began sceptically. \"That's right...you weren't.\" He looked up to the heavens. \"Let's keep it that way.\" Fixing her firmly with a sly smile. Catrina's seat rumbled as she jumped up backing into wall behind her, eyes like saucers. \"You what?\" She exclaimed in shock, hoping she had misheard, or misinterpreted, maybe he'll think she's having a panic attack if her suspicions were wrong. \"What do you mean?\" The man folded his arms. \"Relax honey...everything is okay, you're safe with me.\" She shifted closer to the door. \"Safe? And who is me...who am I exactly here with?\" She felt physically ill, call for help. \"Jack?\" When he stood up she assumed he was confirming it, but his smile wavered into a grimace. \"God no, foolish girl, do you really think Jack would pull off something this sophisticated.\" He yanked his lapels smugly, giving her a death wink. \"You know you're more trouble than you're worth, so...should I bite?\" Her breath hitched and she bolted to the door, but they were faster, they jammed their foot against it and she found herself being dragged backwards towards the table. Her hand came up and she sunk her nails deep into their scalp and dragged, she knew she had drawn blood when they yelped and briefly released her, giving her time to yank open the door and flee towards oncoming policemen. \"That man attacked me!\" She began, she looked back to see the man staggering up with a bloody face. \"She's hostile, restrain her!\" Oh shit, she didn't see that coming . They seized her and were about to take her to a cell when Ms Spencer finally emerged from the office after hearing the hullabaloo. \"Careful she is very delicate, she is a victim of a kidnapping, unhand her this minute!\" The police turned to her still clutching the still fighting girl. \"No can do ma'am, she attacked the chief over there.\" Ms Spencer eyed the smartly dressed man closing the distance. \"It's true...perhaps we should move her to a more secure facility?\" Catrina squawked in her cuffs. \"That man attacked me, don't you have cameras for Christ's sake!\" The woman looked to the cops for confirmation. \"Yeah we do, what should we do chief?\" Looking towards the bloody man. The woman looked incredulous. \"Don't ask him, he's the accused!\" The police paused, before one of them deliberated. \"I'll check the camera.\" He started down the hall but was crudely stopped by a forceful whack from the bloodied chief, the others stared shock stricken. \"What are you doing?\" Ms Spencer began. \"You are out of order!\" \"Oh shut up you stupid bitch, I am order!\" He pulled out a gun and aimed it at the unarmed woman. Catrina flinched and dived for cover before she heard the bang, and then a second bang. She shrieked when the woman fell into her line of vision, Catrina choked back a sob as she staggered back on her feet and elbows away from the seeping blood, before she was roughly brought to her feet by the mad man. \"Right after that little inconvenience-\" He stalled when he spied a police officer not too far away, frozen to the spot. Catrina shrieked with all her breath. \"Run you fool!\" It was too late, another bang reached her ears, deafening her due to the close range. \"It's like shooting ducks.\" He chuckled, she growled and gave him a solid right hook which jarred him and she took the opportunity to race down the hall. The scrubs didn't offer her bust much support and she grumbled as she turned down another hall, some officers had their guns drawn as if they had heard to commotion. \"Freeze!\" Catrina raised her hands and slowed down. \"I'm not armed...a chief is killing his people down there!\" She began futilely. \"Get down on the ground!\" \"I'm not a prisoner, I am a victim brought in earlier!\" Still seeing hesitant guns on her – \"I'm wearing scrubs for heaven's sake!\" \"It's okay men.\" That voice came from around the corner, armed and at her back. \"I've got her, she gunned down a couple of my men.\" Catrina stared horrified and immediately protested. \"No – he's lying, he gunned down the men...I've never fired a fire arm in my life!\" She tried, trying to shift closer to the real officers. \"You can check my hands, no gun residue.\" Thank you CSI . The cops looked confused and still very dangerous, and the man prodding against her back lost his patience. \"Oh fuck it!\" He fired over her shoulder at all men and women officers as she screwed up her face and covered her ears. \"Damn CSI!\" He added. Catrina had pure adrenaline in her system as she ran at a stoop towards the door, even when a sharp hot pain ripped through her arm she still kept on going. The place seemed like a labyrinth, what looked like a decent exit had become a door to another corridor, the gun shots had died down behind her and she was sure the guy was hot on her tail. Catrina was sick to the stomach with villains, and right now she felt she had to puke with terror, this was worse than running from Jack. She yelped when she knocked down somebody who had just calmly left a nearby room, she saw it was the med student from earlier on. \"What the hell is going on?\" \"Get up, Get up now!\" She dragged the girl to her feet, the girl had started to peer down the hall. \"No- not that way!\" She nearly ripped the girl's arm out of her socket as she forced her into a run, which she luckily followed suit. \"Catrina, what the fuck's going-?\" \"-Lisa, where are the emergency exits?\" She demanded. \"I don't know, I'm not familiar with the – I don't think they have any!\" The panic on Catrina was seemingly rubbing off on her companion. \"You've been shot!\" She announced reaching for her arm concerned. \"Who care's doc?\" She wrenched her arm away and gestured for a promising exit, pushing Lisa with her into what appeared to be a stairway. \"Come on!\" They clattered down the stairway, Lisa in the lead. \"What's going on up there?\" The med student asked breathless. \"A shoot out, that fed that came in started it all...where were you?\" Lisa was trying to clip her hair back up so it wasn't in her face with difficulty. \"I'm sorry I was smoking in the lounge!\" \"Right, great!\" She scoffed. \"Well it saved your life!\" She added tersely. That's right smoking had saved her life. Ironically. \"Are you sure you're not having a psychotic episode from captivity?\" Lisa nearly came to a halt on the stairs and Catrina bumped into her. \"No, there are people lying dead upstairs, it's a bloodbath – let's go!\" They heard the sound of a door opening and slamming shut a few floors above them, they quickly share a terrified look before rushing down the steps in unison. A bang followed in their wake which ricocheted. Lisa yelped and stumbled forwards into Catrina who caught her. \"Go on ahead, I'll slow them down!\" She said trying to shove her away. \"Never.\" Catrina swiftly brought the student's arm around her shoulder and jostled her down the remaining stairs, more ricocheting bullets later- the girls squeaked as they tumbled onto the final floor. They recovered and ambled through another set of doors into yet another corridor. They tore down it, Catrina shrieked when 'the shrink' Ms Spencer moved into her line of vision, very fine – very alive. \"Oh my god girls are you alright?\" Catrina skidded and pushed herself in front of Lisa to halt her. \"Why are you stopping?\" Lisa exclaimed clutching at her patient's arm. \"He's on top of us!\" Looking behind her. Catrina couldn't focus on anything else but the woman with the bullet wound through her head. \"That woman is dead.\" Catrina whispered. \"What are you, wait are you...?\" Ms Spencer raised her own gun. \"Shit.\" \"Duck.\" Lisa was a lot faster than Catrina and ended up hurtling herself on top of her as a human shield. There was mighty bang and a thud, and Catrina hardly flinched – wow must be used to it! She stumbled to her feet- helping to support Lisa who seemed to have received an adrenaline rush; for she looked less panicked. She looked down the hall with her companion to see the mad man sprawled on the floor – lifeless. Then in unison with Lisa turned her gaze sceptically towards their saviour. Ms Spencer was positively beaming, her gun still poised, before focusing her attention on the girls. \"Catrina... thank god you're alright.\" She said breezily. She blinked, since the woman hadn't mentioned Lisa - it dawned on her who it was and she rolled her eyes. \"Oh... my... god.\" She murmured dejectedly. \"It's you isn't it?\" \"Would that make you feel more comfortable?\" Ms Spencer waved the gun in a comical gesture which unnerved Catrina because she thought it might go off. She assumed the reason Lisa hadn't moved because she thought Ms Spencer was just being Ms Spencer... which it wasn't . \"Oh- whose your friend?\" After a little wave, Lisa and Catrina scowled right back. \"Oh quit it will you!..Spare my friend and I will go willingly with you.\" She made to step forward but Lisa clung to her worriedly. \"What are you doing?\" \"That's not Ms Spencer, and I'm saving your life.\" She replied from the corner of her mouth. The older woman quirked her eyebrow. \"Wow - didn't think you would make it this easy, I agree to your terms – now get over here!\" Catrina began to shuffle forward, but Lisa stepped forward and angled herself in front of her. \"No!- I don't know what you are doing, but you can't take her away...she is sick, she has had a trauma. She belongs with me.\" She said bravely moving a little closer. Catrina shook her head. \"I'm trying to protect you!\" \"-And I'm trying to protect you, you're my patient.\" Lisa announced. The woman in front rolled her eyes. \"Yes this is very touching.\" She unexpectedly raised her gun. BANG! Catrina remained very still, she didn't even blink as the blood spattered on her, it was only when the body hit the floor she choked out a sob – her teeth clenched and she stared venomously at the monster. \"YOU SON OF A BITCH!\" She charged and grappled as much as she could to knock him down, surely in a woman's body he would be weaker, but 'it' stood firm, grumbling at each futile blow. \"She would have got in the way.\" 'It' reassured. \"FUCK YOU...JUST FUCK YOU, I HOPE YOU SPEND ETERNITY ALONE!\" It appeared to have cut deeply, and Catrina found herself bodily shoved against the wall, knocking all the wind out of her. \"Are you really worth it? I could have just left you for him!\" She spat, pressing the gun brutally hard under Catrina's jaw so that tears prickled her eyes. \"Now we must go before the thing down the hall recovers.\" She gave a firm –\"No.\" And she flinched when 'he' loomed closer. There was a sudden defiant shout from nearby which drew both their attention. \"HEY!\" Catrina was both horrified and shocked as the med student; Lisa aimed a brutal blow with a fire extinguisher at 'Ms Spencer's' head, there was a sickening crack and she went flying backwards onto floor in a pathetic heap. Catrina still had her hands up in defense as she looked at her new friend astonished – who looked a little pissed – and very much alive. \"How are yo-?\" \"-Alive? – Well...I'm... already dead.\" Lisa formulated cockily, she held up the fire extinguisher. \"My favourite weapon – saved your mother with one of these.\" She pursed her lips thoughtfully at Catrina's weird expression, seeing the clockwork clicking in her brain. Ms Spencer on the floor stirred and the fire extinguisher was unceremoniously dropped on her head, her skull completely broke and brain matter seemed to spill out. \"Though she is right you know, that guy down the hall will recover, come on let's go.\" Catrina felt her hand being seized and was dragged all the way out of the building, through the commotion, through surviving policemen and flashing lights. She was very silent, even when she was bundled into a car and 'Lisa' shoved 'herself' in next to her - Tears ran down her face as she was overcome with grief and something else she couldn't identify. She had met so many people she thought were trying to help her, fakes, and so many times she had nearly died, she had guns ringing and blood spurting around in her head, she felt herself being consumed by violent shakes, it was only a matter of time before she would puke, and it wasn't through car sickness. After a minute of driving in silence. \"Jack.\" She croaked. Lisa turned to her while steering. \"And I thought you had forgotten.\" Lisa's smile was a little crooked, she was amazed why she hadn't seen it before. Catrina noticed the rain on the windows, then she felt the touch of a callous hand brushing away a tear and Catrina barely acknowledged the act, she didn't even acknowledge Lisa shape-shifting back into Jack. \"I haven't forgotten unfortunately, and I'm still mad at you.\" He added.[Chapter 26] AN; It seems Emily Browning (Catrina/Katie) have a singing career according to suckerpunch...have you heard her sing – amazing! Munder and Greer were entertaining themselves riding a shopping trolley, they whizzed past a more mature Murphy who was analyzing product labels. Having a family, he had been forced for the sake of his wife to check salt content. He scrutinized that can of soup a few seconds more before he heard some disgruntled cries from down the aisle, he looked up and saw Munder and Greer swerving trying to miss a stack of cans. \"Hey!\" Murphy snapped, drawing a few customers attention, Munder rode next to him, the trolley already full, and the elder plonked a single can on top of their pile. \"Less whiskey more of these.\" Not long had he said this Greer returned with some more appropriate items including a teen magazine, it looked very out-of-place among their survival kit. Munder soon jumped on it. \"You're married, and I still think you're a fag.\" Greer drew his attention to the item in his hand as if suddenly realizing. \"Habit. My daughter's always asking for one, suppose we could get it anyway...for Catrina.\" Greer struggled, fidgeting with it in his mitts. \"Ain't Catrina like 18? She won't be interested in teen magazines, they're normally for 16s and under.\" Munder was very receptive, despite being a clown. \"18 year olds go for the real magazines, fashion and make-up.\" Murphy blinked. \"That's if she into that kind of thing...she could be a tom boy?\" Realizing he didn't know much about the girl in question, despite the dozens of letters. \"I think Epps and Dodge are in charge of what their daughter needs.\" He shrugged it off, returning the magazine to a random shelf. \"That's if she's still alive.\" Everyone shot a wary look at Munder, and he sheepishly moved on with the trolley. \"I'll go look for Santos.\" Jack and Catrina were in some abandoned shack near the harbour. They were perched on an overturned boat, both willing the other to speak first and spoil the silence. They had been driving for about an hour before they dumped their car precariously close to a cliff edge. In the moments leading up to parking the car, Jack had recklessly put his foot down on the peddle and charged through a fence and bombarded up a hill towards the cliff as if they were going to recreate the climax of Thelma and Louise, but a single shriek from Catrina brought the perilous trek to an end. It seemed to her a ploy to gauge a reaction out of her, and she scowled at her driver, who didn't relent. She shifted on the rough surface, drawing the eye of her dedicated stalker. She winced yanking a shard of wood from her thigh. \"Nice Place.\" She murmured. \"Yes well, I didn't really think far ahead...didn't expect you to run away... didn't expect the station to be riddled with demons.\" He tossed a net he had been toying with to the other side of the shack. She scratched her arm, allowing the resulting sound to sooth her.\"Why are you keeping me?\" She finally breathed. \"You are gaining nothing, sure you're irritating my parents to no end, but that could be something I do every day, so really you're like a stubborn teenager.\" She said a matter of factly. \"Probably should have took you when you were young...I could have brought you up as my own, I didn't, I can't take care of kids, and what the fuck would they turn out like if I was their father.\" \"Extremely fucked up.\" Catrina added not looking up, and she heard Jack snort. She blanched as Jack jumped up, he approached a window. The limited light gave the room jagged shadows, and the deafening silence gave her impression that supernaturally they weren't alone. \"There's nothing out here, we're safe for now.\" \"Well that's a relief.\"She was prompted by Jack's pacing and gathered herself. \"What was the plan, to keep me for the rest of my life until my parents die? Or drop me off in their old age, because surely other kidnap victims families move on...they may keep looking, or assume I'm dead, but you at the end you will have nothing.\" Jack had propped himself against the window and was taking out a cigarette. \"I won't have nothing.\" Catrina raised a brow at this. His lips sealed around the tip and he lit it before taking a drag. \"I would have their anguish, and most importantly, I would have you.\" Catrina wasn't sure if he had intended to frighten her with that but it came out so sentimental, she shuddered with a feeling she couldn't quite identify. It seemed a waste of time doing everything to just hurt someone, and she briefly wondered if he was doing it all because he was lonely. Jack seemed to shuffle uncomfortably by the window and mumble something inaudible, he might have been listening to her thoughts. And yet he didn't deny it? \"You have no idea what you're doing, do you?\" She said simply, and she had the audacity to analyse under an innocent gaze, she smirked when he suddenly looked defensive. \"Oh I know what I'm doing, you think by making me doubt myself is going to lower my defences...then you're wrong.\" He said with so much conviction she couldn't hold anymore glee, she sat up straighter allowing him to look over her darkly. \"Doubt yourself, why would you say a thing like that?..That's unless you are beginning to doubt yours-\" \"-Oh shut the fuck up.\" He drawled. \"I don't need some snotty nose kid telling me how I feel.\" She gapped. \"You still see me as a child, and this is how you would treat children, you have done some dodgy stuff with me...you're right, you would be a terrible father.\" She concluded tersely, a silence followed, took up with Jack puffing on his cigarrette and blowing smoke into the air. Her head fell into her hands defeated, everything was dragging on, though a lot faster than it was in her normal life. When she lived at home she was comfortable, but at the back of her mind she felt she was a burden, average grades, couldn't get a job, a dull boyfriend, and party-centric mates. Now she was out of the house, being missing didn't require to have a job or have a boyfriend, no parties. That was an alarming thought – she could get used to this. She jumped as the man pushed away from the window and made his way towards her. She traced his movements until the boat creaked as he sat down beside her. \"You cut yourself.\" His hand hesitantly rose to her hairline under her swept back fringe, she automatically jolted at the contact of his cool fingers tips against her warm forehead. She snapped. \"Ouch!\" She nearly jarred her neck avoiding a further sting. She was about to touch herself but Jack stopped her, easing her hands down with his callous ones. \"What are you doing?\" She said almost meekly, staring straight ahead of her. His hand flattened against her head almost as if he was monitoring her temperature. \"You know I've been shot as well.\" Jack immediately zoned in on her arm, his face inches from the wound, he pressed his finger into it, and Catrina cursed him. \"I'll sort it out myself.\" She jibbed slipping away. \"I'm sure you can, it's just a harmless flesh wound.\" Not sounding at all sympathetic. \"Easy for you to say, you're completely unscathed.\" \"Wrong. You've damaged my trust in you, I gave you a little freedom and you squandered it.\" He bit, the glow from the cigarette the only indication he was still in the shack as he avoided all sources of natural light. \"I took a chance, what any right minded person would do in the circumstances.\" She pleaded her case. \"I wasn't to know your friends were out there hunting for me. I seem to attract trouble.\" He laughed, a genuine laugh. \"Yeah, true, but you know why?..Your parents, they made a deal with the devil to set things in motion, and I'm sticking to a plan while maintaining my job...which seems to have comeback and bit me in the ass!\" He exclaimed, which was followed by a very long smoky drag. \"I was the fucking best. I was goood\" \"Are you sure that's tobacco you're smoking?\" She scoffed, prompting Jack to discard his stick with a humoured huff. During the suspended silence that followed, his hand hovered over her wound again, as if toying with the idea of pressing his thumb into it and drawing a cry from her. She quickly repositioned himself to avoid any more pain to be inflicted upon her. Her bloodstained scrubs were very unflattering, and she wanted to change so badly. \"Did you have to take my clothes?\" She grumbled scrutinizing herself. \"Was it you all along?\" Thinking back to the med student. Jack did a double take. \"Oh, so that's with the get up...this Lisa give it to you.\" He stiffly smiled. \"Nice...very pink.\" Catrina screwed her face up.\"So you weren't in the room when I undressed, you didn't offer me an internal examination...?\" It was an understatement she was more than relieved. \"Wow got there a little late, didn't I?\" He mumbled, and Catrina would have slapped him, he fortunately continued. \"No I wasn't there then, you ran into me in the hall remember...\" \"You were smoking in the lounge of course.\" She chimed. \"I suppose she's dead then?\" She queried with a bitter edge to her voice. \"No, she's lying unconscious in the lounge, I was actually smoking with her, I was drawn to the room by the sweet smell of tobacco and I got chatting with her, then we heard the gun shots and just before she could investigate I knocked her out and borrowed her form...the rest you can fill in.\" Catrina didn't know if she could believe he had let Lisa off that lightly, he would have probably played with her innards while she writhed around in agony. \"Enough!\" Jack announced over loudly to the empty space in front of him, and Catrina was clueless. \"Do you want me to live up to those expectations?\" It was a very strange question, probably hypothetical...\"Just stop thinking, you're doing it very loudly lately, you have a constant inner monologue running through your head, you use to be a complete mystery...very silent, and only occasionally I would tune into Catrina Radio, now I can hear you...judging me.\" Catrina was speechless, she gapped. \"You're offended, it really does bother you what other people think-\" \"Oh no, don't you do that, trying to embarrass me.\" Catrina smirked. \"Look at you, being all...human, you're masculinity is being challenged.\" She began to laugh, and the man frowned, making her laugh harder. \"It's not going to work, you should be embarrassed-\"Catrina began to quieten, wondering what he meant, he continued tersely. \"You talking about your ordinary meaningless life, lonely...yet you have friends who seem a lot more active than you, and a boyfriend, who is dull. Sob stories of a heroin.\" She blinked. \"I'm no heroin, and I've had to carry on...it's a good job I have, despite the pending doom, I had a right to be on edge and drive people away, I chose to be lonely.\" \"And yet you moan.\" \"I don't moan, I just get bored.\" She announced defensively, and Jack had the audacity to pat her back patronizingly. \"You dragged me into this, you dragged my family into this.\" She shrugged him off, but immediately felt a pang in her arm from the unsterile wound and winced. \"Oh ow I think the bullet is still in there.\" \"Let me see.\" Jack coaxed her into allowing him to extensively prod and exam her. \"This is what I've wanted to do before it gets inflamed.\" Catrina didn't have a chance to ask, he pushed his finger deep into the flesh, Catrina nearly shredded her lip biting down, he seemed to know what he was doing – hurting her. Jack's expression was of solid concentration, it distracted her from the searing pain and the tickle of warm blood rolling down her arm. It was like he was touching the bone, she felt something click and she had to look, against her better judgement; the flesh on her arm was puckering at the back and was completely stained red, his finger couldn't be seen, just as she thought she could see the tip poking out, something small and metallic dropped and bounced off the boat. It was unmistakably the bullet, more pain followed as he retracted his finger, the blood was pouring out of her like a slowly running tap and she could literally feel it draining out of her face. She was conscious of the noise she was making, a cross between a hum and a groan. Catrina noticed his foot seemed to toy with the bullet on the floor, testing it's sturdiness by rolling it beneath his shoe, in her dazed like state from the blood loss she started to roll back on the overturned boat, she didn't go very far with Jack's hand suddenly appearing on her thigh holding her down. She huffed as her descent was interrupted and he dragged her by her dodgy arm back into a sitting position. She smiled drunkardly up at him. \"Maybe you could use your voodoo and seal the wound.\" It would be useful, despite her anxiousness of seeing him perform any voodoo tricks. It take didn't take much effort to inch her closer, she positively sagged into him. He shifted her hair so he could whisper in her ear. \"I'm afraid I can't knit flesh and bone together.\" \"But you can bring people back?\" She murmured downwards, her head pressed into the crook of his neck. \"Are you punishing me?\" \"Oh Cat, did you not try and call home?\" Jack rasped against her hypersensitive shell. \"I detected your presence around a phone you had recently used...how's mom and dad?\" The gentleness of it had her on edge and she clumsily shoved him back to take him in. \"Please tell me you haven't done something to my mom and dad.\" She gulped as he caressed the fingers she had pressed into his chest. \"I think they have enough to worry about, don't you think? Besides I really don't want to travel that far...not even to watch them weep.\" He said rather maliciously, she didn't have the energy to swipe at him, and he could read it off her, he simply chuckled at her state. \"Look at you, being all human.\" He echoed back to her mockingly, she grimaced as her injury panged but still steadily held his gaze. \"Shut up.\" \"Does being human offend you?\" He grinned, working his hand up her arm and inching back into his original position. \"Never be ashamed of what you are.\" He added with so much resent she wondered if he ever remembered being one of her. \"The answer's no.\" He retorted to her telepathic question. Catrina dipped her head so their heads wouldn't collide as he jostled forward. \"I bet you do...\" It was like they were both drunk teenagers on the verge of laughing at each other. Catrina felt the words on the tip of her tongue, it was snide and she didn't even know if it would gauge a reaction. \"Paddy O'Reilly.\" His sneer fell, and he became stilted with the strange revelation and old memories. Catrina no longer wanted to feel so vulnerable and positioned the way she was, she wanted to die when his face contorted and his hand flew up to seize a fistful of her hair. She had him bearing down on top of her with sickening hissing and growls of fury. \"DON'T YOU FUCKING SAY THAT TO ME!\" She thought her scalp was being peeled away from her cranium. \"WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT...WHERE DID YOU FUCKING HEAR THAT?\" She was using his shirt to lift herself up to ease the tension off her scalp, and to avoid the spit. \"I didn't hear it...I saw, I could only imagine the term being applied to you.\" She began, not fearing for her life but for the demon to get back in its box. \"It's been used hasn't it...while you were growing up...you can remember can't you?\" Heavy breathing was all she could hear and she didn't want to take in the sight of his anger. \"What happened to not being ashamed of who you are?\" She tried, the hand that was on her arm moved to her throat, and she gasped, her hand shooting to the pressure point. \"I am not ashamed, because I am not one of them, never was...I was American, my mother on the other hand-\" \"Was Irish, shouldn't you stick up for it?\" Catrina rasped. \"Or did you try and get beaten down, is that what made you like this?\" She felt herself on the verge of blacking out, her legs had already gone numb and her mouth dry. Jack jerked her face closer to his, but was no longer able to feel his hot breath. \"You shouldn't go sneaking around poking into other people's business.\" He released and she crumpled to the floor gasping and coughing trying to draw a breath through her bruised windpipe. Catrina had hoped he would just walk away and leave her there, storm out like he usually did – run away from his problems. \"Oh – you would like that wouldn't you?\" He said voice thick with venom. A shiver consumed her, not believing what she was about to say. \"No actually, I would like to die...so finish me!\" She clawed at the dirt before stumbling to her feet. \"Do what you do best.\" The atmosphere was hostile, she didn't know how the shack's foundation could stand it. Blue eyes pierced the dark, they were so cold it burned. \"No I'm afraid you going to live a very long time.\"[Chapter 27] Did this one a bit too quick for my eyes, inform me of grammatical errors. And enjoy! Murphy, Greer and Munder exited the supermarket loaded with shopping bags, they stopped at a curb during rush hour and struggled to creep across the road. They managed to leg it while receiving a load of annoyed honks. Maureen and her husband were basking in the sunlight, free of salt air and chapped lips. \"We should head back, we've been dawdling.\" \"Hardly, we don't have to be on a schedule.\" He tried inching closer to his wife on the grass. \"She's not going to get any more missing for 5 more minutes.\" Maureen turned to him incredulously. \"I'll pretend I didn't hear that, you speak as if she's at school or cooking the dinner at home, she isn't home.\" She said in a harsh tone that made her husband flinch, some passersby had stalled and Maureen grew sheepish. \"Come on let's go.\" When they had reached some fencing they spotted the other's with some shopping. Dodge took note of their more exotic purchases. \"Caribbean Rum? Seriously?\" \"We're not monks!\" Munder jeered bustling past. Munder always looked too pleased with himself, hardly a man on a death mission. \"We have the essentials, and we have some luxuries.\" He called after already ambling towards the harbour. Maureen had shared a pleasant exchange with Murphy before she grew curious about the missing member of the crew. \"Where's Santos?\" \"No idea, I assumed he was calling his family or shopping with you.\" Maureen glanced around the surrounding pavements, no sign of the Latino gent. \"He better be quick.\" Murphy silently agreed, when she spotted a distant bar on the main road, she had a hunch. \"I'll be back in a bit.\" The sound of children squawking distantly arouse her from her slumber, she didn't remember going to sleep especially underneath a boat, she placed her hand on the wood to test it was liftable. She could still hear the children in hysterics and Catrina with a great fete of strength nudged the boat off of her and leapt up, charging through the door, her first thought was how he trying to kill them. When she was outside surveying the cliff edges and various huts, she thought for a moment she had been dreaming, she heard the screams again and Catrina bolted towards the drop, she stopped at the last second to see a group of small children flying a kite and chasing one another harmlessly. She sighed, she had the right to have a morbid imagination. It wasn't long before she heard heavy footfalls behind her and someone tall shimmied to her side. \"Going to jump?\" She was brazen as she left him on his own to return to the hut. She had a memory lapse on what time it was and day, and she unceremoniously draped herself over an overturned boat and murmured sleepily to drown out Jack's entrance. She sensed he was close, and she didn't acknowledge him, not even when he toyed with a makeshift bandage that had miraculously appeared on her upper arm. \"You just rest there for a sec and keep quiet.\" He uttered breezily, moving over her tired body to reach for something on the wall. She heard a clunk and was driven to look up. She saw him lifting an oar and she had to duck so he could manoeuvre over her and drop it to the floor. \"Oh no.\" She mumbled into her arm dazedly. \"I thought we were settling.\" \"Ha, no...we shouldn't have really stopped here, they could have caught up.\" \"So they do have adequate tracking skills?\" \"If they're as good as me, then yes.\" Catrina equalled his dubious look. \"Right, so I have a bounty on my head.\" She went to the window to check they weren't being surrounded. \"I thought last night you said we were safe?\" \"That was last night, I haven't a clue where they are now, so get your things together.\" He had picked up the oars and had chucked them outside. \"So we're rowing to the ship, a little inconspicuous don't you think?\" She unfolded her arms and picked up one end of the boat she had slept under. \"Weren't we miles off the coast?\" Jack watched her struggle with the boat before obligingly assisting her. \"It'll take a few hours, we won't have to go all the way...just until I can sense the ship.\" They had made the way to gradual slope that took them to the shore.\"So you can beam us back?\" Catrina insinuated. \"I need to reserve what I got, you ain't gonna give me any.\" He chimed, he could see she was wincing under the strain of the weight and the injury on her arm was compromising her. He gestured for her to stop and release, and he took the full weight over his head. \"Show off.\" She retorted under her breath before ambling to his side. He turned the boat at a bit of an angle in order for it to clip the back of her head in retaliation. \"Ouch!\" When they were on the beach Catrina had to direct the children away, she didn't want them getting too close to the hostile entity that was 'Jack Ferriman'. She almost forgot how to go about talking to them, she wasn't used to socializing, it had been awhile, especially to children. Jack ploughed on ahead having no wish to get involved, his footprints were deep and severe like he was aggressively plodding, showing his distaste. The children watched them all the way to the water edge. \"Shouldn't we get food for the journey?...I haven't eaten.\" She suggested as he adamantly climbed into the boat. \"I'm not going grocery shopping.\" He drawled. \"Get in.\" She huffed and hopped onto the seat, allowing herself to adjust – after all she would be on it for god knows how long? \"You row, I'll sing a sea chantey.\" \"Please don't.\" He jibbed, placing the oar in the provided hooks. \"We'll take it in turns, I may take my shirt off.\" \"Please don't.\" She echoed with equal enthusiasm. \"If I can't sing, you can't take your shirt off.\" She felt the water pick up the boat and send them adrift, it was mostly oar power that got them past the tide. Catrina consciously gripped onto the sides, she was wary of the water below getting darker, meaning it was getting deeper, when the sky and sea began to hog the horizon she grew agoraphobic, she felt the need to lie down at the bottom of the boat till the sky went away. Jack noticed she was gradually stooping. \"What's the matter...sea sick?\" \"It's the open space around me and this tiny little boat.\" She positioned herself on the floor, Jack exclaimed a profanity when she rocked the boat. \"...Are you kidding me?\" Jack was forced to reposition his legs when she tucked her legs beneath his seat. \"You're pathetic.\" She rolled onto her side to avoid looking at him. \"If you're going to sleep don't let me stop you.\" Catrina chortled. \"Have fun.\" She acknowledged him with a brief smile before closing her eyes. Even when she had got off to sleep and her face had gone relaxed, Jack could still see that smile, it was if it had been burned into his memory, he wasn't sure why. He rarely saw modest pleasant smiles directed at him, and he found he was rowing with a hint of merriment. Maureen had reached the bar and found Santos seated towards the back in a secluded area of the bar \"Hey Santos...what you doing?\" He looked up surprised. \"Oh just getting a drink, you want one?\" He had already drew the attention of the bar man before Maureen could reply. \"Another one of these please, thanks.\" \"Santos, we've got to get going.\" She said perching on a bar stool. \"No rush baby, I only came for a couple.\" \"If you want to stick around in the bar...we could leave without you.\" \"Nah...don't be like that, like you haven't come to land for a little comfort?\"Santos took a heavy swig and Maureen frown. \"What do you mean by that, if you mean comfort as in food, they're necessities!\" Becoming dismayed at Santos ignorance. \"Maybe you should stay here.\" She got up to leave but Santos seized her sleeve. \"Epps wait wait wait, what have I done?...You act like I've committed a mortal sin coming for a drink, calm down lady, I'm coming!\" He finished his own and Maureen's and stood up to amble out with the distraught mother of the group, he felt he was being dragged out by the ear. \"Which way...this way?\" He said pointing disorientated in the wrong direction. Maureen grappled for his hand and guided him down the pavement, he burst out laughing. \"I'm coming mother, jeez!\" Maureen frog marched the hyper Latino down the main street, she rushed by some curious shoppers who noticed their speed. She spied a set of traffic lights to get across the dangerous road and bodily dragged her accomplice, she merely glanced at a man coming out of a nearby drugstore reading a newspaper – her eyes fleetingly caught sight of a headline. ' 1 MISSING GIRL, 1 ROGUE COP, 6 DEAD DURING BIZARRE SHOWDOWN '. Maureen didn't think, she just stalled and snatched the paper of the distracted man, he cursed as she took off with Santos across the road. \"Maureen what's got into you?\" Santos skidded to a halt with the woman and she breaked in an alleyway. She ignored him and flipped to the front page. It was an article about a shootout at a police station hundreds of miles away, what had her attention was a blurred image from a CCTV camera capturing a girl being interviewed. She scrutinized the picture desperately, was the girl her girl? She scanned the article, which was interrupted by more CCTV shots. A girl running, a man pursuing, the man opening fire at police, then the last was of two girls running down a hall. \"Epps what?\" Santos called again. Maureen was dazed as she raised her head. \"It's Catrina, I know it's Catrina.\" She pushed the image into Santos bewildered face. \"Look!\"[Chapter 28] Catrina murmured in her sleep, she dreamt of hamburgers and milkshakes, food that seemed so foreign to her now, though any food was welcome, she would have anything that could be chewed even if she couldn't digest it probably she would be thankful of the nourishment. She made a thrashing movement and clipped her head on the boat seat, this brought her crashing down back to the present. She blinked up at the overpowering sun, when the glare had dissipated, she finally zoned in on Jack rowing, he hadn't been lying when he said he was going to take his shirt off. There he was in all his glory; toned, a little pale with some curly chest hair. She could see every muscle he was using, tensing and relaxing, he looked very human – strong but still fragile, a shark would still manage to tear him to shreds. \"How long do we have?\" She kicked one of her legs up to stretch it. Jack huffed before giving a resigning sigh. \"An hour, so it's your turn to row.\" He clattered his oars down and reached out to assist her up, she obligingly took hold of the hands and was up in an instant. The creak of the boat when she took up the oars was unsettling, as if it didn't like its new driver. \"Put your back into it, straighten your legs.\" He said frugally. He had a bad memory; she had injuries that rendered her inflexible. \"You've never done a hard days graft in your life have you? Too spoiled.\" He jibed, giving her leg a little jab. Why is he trying to gauge an argument from her? As if he enjoyed hearing her whinge. \"Put a shirt on!\" Catrina exclaimed after finally getting a rhythm going on the oars, he had become content watching her to-and- throwing all the while remaining topless, it was like the beginning a soft-core porn film. \"It's not a pretty sight.\" \"Ha- Oh really?..Sorry to disappoint you, I'm not one of your preppy college boys with gym membership.\" She shook her head, clucking her tongue. \"I don't think college boys can afford Gym membership, and wanting an education doesn't make them preppy – nor are they mine.\" You couldn't actually convince someone who didn't have a clue of the real world, Jack had chosen not to be a part of it...criticise all he liked, but presuming all men her age came out of the same mould incensed her. \"Some men would love to go to college, they chose work over education...some steal because they have nothing better to do.\" \"Where has this conversation brought us?\" Jack ridiculed. \"I thought you would defend the human race.\" He tipped his head to scrutinise her, something he did all the time, she assumed to get a picture of the average female in the human race, unfortunately for her she came out of a mould that is often used over and over again – this wasn't symbolism for being damaged, she wasn't damaged, she was pretty normal and boring and had the worries of any social-phobic girl. Good. \"You say human race, I'm not going to justify my species to you – cause' even simple humans like I are capable of some horrible atrocities...like you.\" She beamed and rowed faster to display an impressive agility, it probably wouldn't last long she hadn't eaten since forever. Maureen and her husband had pinned up that picture, the others swarmed around it. \"My God.\" Murphy said, his disbelief at finding their prize printed, proof 'she' was still alive or had been kept alive longer than he had expected. Maureen's tears had still not dried. \"She was at a police station – during a shootout, dear god she must have been so scared.\" She nuzzled into the arm of the man next her who trembled with relief. \"Does this mean she's in land now? I mean she's safer than expected, right?\" He deliberated pouring over the article. \"But she's missing...and with another girl by the looks of it.\" Maureen was flailing over the newspaper as you would in the circumstances. \"As long as she's not alone...I'm okay, not with Jack that's a bonus.\" They all agreed, one major factor eliminated. \"Isn't it a little disconcerting that she happens to show up in the middle of a shootout ?\" Santos chimed, he spoke sense – knowing how unlucky they were it seemed most likely Catrina to be involved. \"I'm thinking maybe she could have been the cause, for all we know she could have been corrupted-\" \"Don't even suggest Catrina would turn rogue!\" Her father defended. \"According to the article a cop turned rogue while she was in the interview room and started shooting everybody, she only got out after the assistance of this woman.\" Dodge assumed his wife would back him up but she was distracted by the other page of the article. \"The woman was a spitting image of a member of the forensics team who was found unconscious in the building.\" Dodge frowned. \"Why would they mention something as tedious as that?\" Everyone looked at Maureen expecting a decent explanation. \"I don't know...they found it odd people identified the woman on the CCTV as this nurse and it turned out the nurse in question was incapacitated...\" Santos nodded. \"So it's a case of mistaken Identity.\" \"-Or the woman was in two places at once.\" Munder scoffed. \"So we got two nurses who look-\" He scrutinised the picture before faltering. \"Identical...err...hot twins?\" \"A detail they would not miss.\" It was Maureen's turn to scoff. Murphy calmed down the argumentative atmosphere. \"So what do you speculate?\" Maureen didn't want to admit it, soon as she had came across that area of the text she had so many doubts, particularly her ease in Catrina's safety had been knocked. \"I really hate to say...but...Demons can imitate people.\" She forced. She had stifled them. \"Oh I don't know, they won't let us off the hook for anything, they'll keep trying to take what's ours...bleed the world dry if they have to, but can't they just let me have my-\" Her voice cracked with emotion, Dodge was at hand to take the reins. \"She's right, Catrina's probably got a member of the underworld tailing her.\" \"You mean the hot nurse could be a demon?\" Munder retorted senselessly. \"Well that's just great.\" Maureen pulled herself together, rubbing her nose. \"We could have had demons following us all along...we have never really been out of shark infested water in a matter of speaking, demons can walk anywhere?\" Greer stepped in. \"Not in church, if they can't go to church on Sundays that's where I'd be, Catrina should follow suit if she really has got away.\" Before sheepishly adding. \"That's if she was taken in the first place, she could be just on the run. Hell Jack could have just been bluffing!\" Santos jumped on this band wagon. \"Couldn't have put it better myself!\" Greer had kept his cool despite the outburst. \"So what are we going to do...stick around and see if she pops up...or continue on our voyage?\" Catrina had come to a grinding halt on the oars, they actually clattered out of her hand in her exhaustion. \"Oh heck...\"She mumbled, sluggishly clawing for them. Jack appeared to have dozed off, or was trying to get a tan and was ignoring her. \"We're losing light.\" She stated over the sound of slopping water as she gained control of the oars. She gave a resigned sigh when he had failed to answer. \"Right, who cares?\" \"Just keep rowing.\" He drawled ending her anticipation, though his eyes remained closed. \"How do you know we are going in the right direction, we have no navigation.\" \"I have the gift of navigation, so shut up and row.\" She huffed, he had the chivalry of an ape. How he had the power to seduce anybody was beyond her, to her dissatisfaction he peeped at her through one eye, she could almost detect he was about to do something in his defence, she pretended not to notice and paddled faster. \"Tell me when.\" He said simply, and it left her thinking for sometime before finally sucking it up and prying. \"What do you mean?\" She asked tersely, her stroke becoming stronger and more tiresome. Jack didn't want to comment on how erotic he found it. He countered her pointed look by pushing himself up onto the seat, giving him some height. \"Tell me when you want me to take up that challenge.\" He said it without a smile which made it a lot more creepy than it was. Catrina didn't want something else to worry about, she already knew her days were numbered. \"I'd consider that more of a threat...don't quit your day job.\" She hesitated her movements when she noticed Jack had actually zoned in on her chest. \"Oh my god...you son of a bitch.\" Jack looked up, giving her more evidence of where his eye line had settled. \"What?\" He said rather cluelessly. And she thought he could read minds! She pulled the oars into the boat in protest. \"I ain't rowing no more.\" He better not deny it. \"What's a matter with you woman? What on earth have I done now?\" Jack exclaimed still holding onto the pretence of being innocence. Catrina screwed her face up. \"You're an ape, demanding, stupid, clueless...and have the wooing skills of an ape, that's what's wrong.\" She shivered against her will, and Jack continued to stare at her incredulously \"What the actual fuck?\" He seemed very good at maintaining his innocence. \"Is it your time of the month or something?\" Catrina gaped, typical man to bring that up. \"Just take over with the rowing, it'll do you some good – relieve some of that tension.\" She kicked the handles at him, and he grudgingly took hold of them shaking his head in defeat. \"You're mad, though most women are.\" \"They'd have to be to go off with you.\" Catrina retorted with an air of confidence, he stalled mid paddle, and she honestly thought he was going to slap her across the face before he mockingly managed- \"You are having trouble thinking straight, obviously I've had my shirt off too long.\" He then redressed himself covering his broad shoulders.[Chapter 29] Let me know if there are any errors. Catrina felt a severe rock of the boat, and she opened her eyes. All the journey consisted of was rowing and sleeping, rowing and sleeping. What energy she had left was only enough to lift her head. The ship loomed above her and she sat bolt upright surprised, regretting it immediately since her reserves had depleted and she nearly fell head over tit into the dark waters. But a quick hand shot out to steady her, the same hand that had steadied her so many times. She blinked up at him sleepily. \"Ah so we're here are we?\" She shrugged him off. \"About time, I'm cold and hungry.\" \"Well you'll just have to wrap up and sleep I'm afraid.\" His thumb ended up on her chin, and she wondered why he was scrutinising her face. \"You're looking a bit peaky.\" She huffed. \"I've lost two stone...I've had no nourishment, I'm bound to be a little peaky.\" She batted his hand away and stumbled over to a rope ladder, she gave it one look and knew immediately she wouldn't make it. She sheepishly turned, gathering herself. \"Erm, a little help?\" Catrina could sense his willingness, which was why she had to watch out. Jack positioned himself next to her, grappling for her wrist, they both looked up to where they were going. It wasn't like last time when she hadn't been expecting it, this time it wasn't a nasty falling sensation more like a fast journey through a vortex before hitting the deck. \"Ow, well that was better.\" She announced before getting up. She noticed Jack rush ahead to look inside the main reception area, probably checking for visitors. She meandered in a few minutes later, being away meant she had a clearer head, so coming back she could notice the stench- of death. \"Jack, are we safe?\" He appeared in the doorway to the corridor, looking very calm but just a little withdrawn. \"Um...Yeah I would say so.\" He scratched his head, the action looking very human, it irked her. \"I'm going to sleep, and I'll expect food when I wake up.\" She trudged by him and back to her rooms. Looking back at it she realized it was a complete dump- she had adapted to the world, now she was back in prison. Jack sighed behind her making her jump. \"Knock.\" She said simply, withdrawing from him to lie on her bed, she hoped it didn't appear as an invitation, she was too tired to fight him off. \"They could come back, and I just need to check on a few things- management, I have no idea what they'll do when I show my face there.\" He really did sound low, like the weight of the world was on him. She didn't like this human side very much, she felt less protected - if that made any sense? She rolled onto her side away from him, succumbing to sleep. Maureen was at a front desk, she had been waiting for about 5 minutes to get seen to, and to keep herself occupied she had been watching people clearing away debris in the hallways. A stout woman approached her. \"Can I help you ma'am?\" \"Err yes, I was wondering if I could speak to someone in charge?\" \"Do you have something to report, cause as you can see we are bit busy after the fiasco-have you seen the papers?\" Maureen nodded assertively. \"Yeah, that's what I want to talk about, the identity of the girl in the paper.\"She retrieved her own copy and spun it in the direction of the desk cop. \"That's confidential information, we don't divulge anything about the case.\"She said as politely as possible, but it still irritated the hell out of her. \"Well you go into great detail in the paper, apart from the names –\" She could see the officer was losing interest. \"Look...I know this girl, I can identify her, I think she's my daughter, Catrina Dodge.\" The woman stilled, she gave her a calm stare before without hesitation picking up a nearby phone. Maureen for a moment thought she had been dismissed until- \"Hello, yes – we have a woman claiming to be Catrina Dodge's mother at the front desk...\" Maureen released a nervous breath, so it was true – though she was far from relieved. \"Yes she's still here, okay.\" She placed the phone into the crook of her neck, a gesture meaning she was going to address her. \"Please wait we're sending someone down.\" She looked about her, all she saw was blood spattered couches, it made her queasy. \"How long?\" Maureen drawled. \"Well... they're here.\" The cop said rather awkwardly, realizing she was still clutching the now useless phone, Maureen turned and saw two very serious looking men in suits. \"Let me guess; the MIB?\" She joshed as they closed in. The men didn't crack a smile and Maureen immediately sobered, right, Catrina...serious trouble . \"Ma'am do you have any proof of identity.\" The tallest man managed, Maureen didn't give them satisfaction of looking offended -she immediately whipped out her driver's licence. \"Seems to be in order.\" \"Now what can you tell me?\" Maureen shot at them. \"Or is there too much paper work for you to assist me?\" The men in black looked at one another, before they chose their answers carefully. \"It's about you helping us Miss Dodge...\" \"-We're the FBI.\" She sneered. \"Mrs Dodge.\" She emphasised. \"Can I see some ID?\" She shot back, and they grudgingly obliged. After inspecting their pristine badges -\"Is my daughter in serious trouble?\" She managed cutting straight to the point. \"That's what we've been asking ourselves, you see the reason she was here was to report her own abduction, the next she was being thoroughly interrogated- according to a member of staff she was put down as a suspect for some suspicious activity going on in this state. Tell me Mrs Dodge; do you know if your daughter was part of any cults?\" Maureen blinked. \"Absolutely not, she wouldn't – she not one of those type of girls that goes looking for trouble, she's laid back. That's until she was taken.\" \"So you can confirm she did go missing.\" The man looked at his colleague incredulously. \"So how come it's taken you this long to report it?\" Maureen went cold, if any suspicion was put on her she could be held back from looking for her daughter. \"I wasn't sure if she was in immediate peril.\" She tried, still having their gaze burn into her. \"You said she was a laid back girl, is it usual for her to take off for this length of time without calling you?\" Now this was tittering on the edge of a cliff of problems. She should have made a report sooner. \"I've been doing my own investigation, I didn't want a lot of fuss...didn't want my daughter to feel she was in a lot of trouble.\" She withheld from gulping in front of them. The tall man straightened. \"I see, well your delay could have put your daughter in even more serious danger.\" They lectured. \"Well let's not focus on my so called bad parenting – what exactly do you think went on here?\" They cleared their throats, her expectations were automatically heightened. \"There appears to be a trend, people disappearing in a certain area without a trace, the people have a history of criminal activity- your daughter doesn't fit this pattern- so we believe Catrina was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, but it's odd how she shows up in the middle of this very mysterious and tragic incident.\" Maureen couldn't agree more. \"So would you say this is supernatural?\" Her query had stifled them, their reluctance to answer said it all. They were uneasy about the territory they were in. \"Supernatural Mrs Dodge, do you think we're into wiji boards and aliens.\" They tried abysmally to laugh it off. \"Ma'am you have watched too much TV.\" Maureen grumbled. \"No they are a lot more professional on TV, they don't laugh in the face of victims of terror.\" Oh yes, this had straightened them out, they once again went very calm and composed- plus a little guilty, to Mrs Dodge's satisfaction . Jack hadn't seen the gates of hell for a decade, he had never been down to call on his associates since he was quite well behaved in their eyes, and he never needed guidance. What humans expect or perceive the gates of hell to look like is far from the truth- there are no iron gates being licked with fire, no pit of despair. No, more like a battleship grey office building, the lower levels where the souls come in is bleak with a sense of bad expectations- you feel you would be put to work there for all of eternity, in some cases you do. The really evil souls are sent to higher levels where the rooms are more metallic and modified to make your stay more irritating- such as people from your past you didn't get on with supervising you and hitting you for no reason. There's a calendar and clock on the wall that never changes, so when souls look up to see how long they've got left they are severely disappointed. Jack had the misfortunate of starting off this way, but for him the clock ticked away and when it reached zero, someone would come in a look up your sorry case to see if you should be kept on, sent to the pit- which he figured had fire, or to be promoted. This was good. If you were bad enough, and had a history you could be smuggled past the reapers and employed by the devil to return to earth and condemn others to hell. Luxury usually followed- and it did, he spent his first day out killing and buying some new clothes, then he was integrated within the demon community to be trained. He walked past some souls using type writers that ran out of ink every minute. The room dissolved as he reached a door, and he felt the prickling heat of hell. \"Mr O'Reilly.\" He turned. \"Number two...shouldn't you be cooking some flesh around about now?\" The disfigured 'person' laughed showing a set of crocodile teeth. \"Your supervisor said you were coming...I have come for your flesh.\" Jack pulled a stern face. \"Perhaps another time, I have no wish to speak to him, he already saw me earlier.\" He tried to shrug of his uneasiness and barge past the non-entity, with no prevail. \"You lie, your supervisor came by weeks ago to warn you- now he's pissed.\" The thing sneered. \"Yes well things take time, did he have to send up some recruits to meddle with things.\" \"If you hadn't have faltered you wouldn't be in this mess.\" It jibed guiding him towards a dark hole, which wasn't as bad as it looked- it was a standard corridor. They stepped into it and instantly arrived elsewhere. Another derelict place where moans of despair could be heard. \"Apparently something beyond our control is on your case...\" Jack blazed. \"Who else apart from management would send down someone to take out a whole army of policemen just to get to my charge.\" The thing huffed. \"Charge...Is that what you call her?\" Jack had little patience with arguing what she was to him. \"You know the way.\" The thing vanished, leaving him to take the heat alone. An ominously glow appeared in the distance, opening up a new place. The smell of sulpha was over powering as he crossed the threshold. \"Jack.\" \"Barilus, the middle man...still here, no promotion then?\" Jack saw the man pull his lips back from his teeth in a vile sneer. \"I am at the top of my game, I can't expect more- that's unless I want to jump into Lucifer's shoes.\" He crossed the room to make himself level with his guest. \"You have a problem with your new responsibilities.\" Jack shifted from foot to foot. \"No, I never asked to be promoted – and these new powers limit me- they weaken me faster and refuelling is an inconvenience.\" Barilus tutted. \"You know people normally say thank you when they get given bonuses.\" \"Bullshit.\" He said without thinking of the consequences. \"Tell me who is responsible for the change, and for the problems – those people after me.\" Barilus looked reluctant- guilt maybe. \"Unfortunately some of your fellow colleagues took it upon themselves to pay you a visit.\" The soul collector was staring right through him and Barilus grew sheepish. \"Yes, we sent someone down to the police station, though he wasn't alone- some unidentified beings invaded the area...they did a lot of damage, and in public, our folks are never that sloppy.\" Jack frowned, 'unidentified beings'. \"How can management not know who started that carnage- you normally seek them out and employ them, can I be reassured they won't come back?\" The two of them had moved closer to a fire place, Barilus had poured himself some scotch. \"I can't control envious colleagues hoping to steal someone else's 'charge' in order to promote themselves. Nor can I control people out of my jurist diction, those unidentifiables.\" The man didn't look too pleased over how little power he had over the predicament. Jack was far from happy either. \"Well since you're useless to my plight I'd better get back to Catrina.\" He was about to leave without permission and Barilus nearly threw the glass towards the door. \"Get back to issue in question!\" He snapped. \"She has caused this trouble.\" \"It's funny how you're threatened by a meek human, she has hardly done much damage – blame her mother!\" The demon barked. \"Oh yes, Maureen the undefeatable – that's what they're calling her.\" \"You're kidding.\" Jack rolled his eyes. \"I won.\" \"Sure you did, I mean Maureen has paid the price...you have her daughter – though you haven't really done anything, accept provide her with free board and lodgings.\" \"I don't believe I asked for your advice on how to take care of prisoners, I bet you would put them out of their misery and kill them on the spot, me; I milk the misery.\" His finger jabbed into the demons ribs, cold and calculating. \"Instruct the people you can to stay more than 200 yards from the ship, or I will kill them.\" Now was the perfect time to leave, so the threat would be freshly hanging in the air. \"Why must we fight?..I freed you from despair-\" \"-No you didn't, that was my supervisor...fat lot of good he is doing me now!\" He marched out into the black hole and he was shifted to the bleak office room, he had lost his cool- he had an unusual pant in his breathing. He made to leave to be ambushed by a load of previous collectors. \"What now?\" \"So it's true, you did crawl back.\" A woman drawled. He huffed. \"You make it seem I was destitute, or on the run- I came here to clean up a little mess.\" A very old fashioned looking gent had reached for his shoulder. \"How's that gone by the way? Promoted and yet you are still on that same godforsaken ship...turn it in before someone else does it for you.\" Jack shrugged off the unwelcome hand. \"I don't see why that's any of your business, are you seeking a promotion? I thought you were on top of things.\" The gent smirked. \"A damn sight better than you, you are refusing to 'get-on-top' of things I hear, it's like you've taken a mistress and haven't pleased her, not like a sailor at all.\" Oh that man, he had had his fair share of wenches alright, all from unstable backgrounds. \"This conversation is getting rather boring, so repetitive- jealous minions poking their noses in because I'm keeping a prisoner longer than necessary. I'm still working, I want to know why everybody cares so much about this prisoner.\" Jack spat. \"Me too, I hear the other world is involved...what is she? The messiah? Ha!\" The woman retorted, losing interest and wiggling away to a dark corner of hell. The Gent though still looked keen to engage Jack. \"Now the rabble is out of the way...perhaps you could share with me her gifts – does she have any talents we don't know about?\" He raised a brow at this. \"Gifts...she isn't a prophet or witch, she's just a girl born and raised in Boston.\" Come to think of it, he knew a lot more about her, though nothing special – and that was just it; she didn't have to be- and yet she was causing such a stir. \"She is a little unnecessary to keep for so long, but these recent turn of events have gave her a little edge...don't you think?\" Review time.[Chapter 30] Inform me of any grammatical errors- I write too quickly, with lengthy breaks. Enjoy! Catrina stepped in and out of a cold bath quickly, she wanted to stay clean but not freeze to death. Her skin had paled considerably over the past few hours, she was starving, energy levels depleting. When she had achieved cleaning her hair, she rubbed till it was damp so she could at least lie down without soaking the bed. She pinned the covers over and under her to trap in her warm breath- it helped, but made her drowsy. She succumbed to sleep rapidly. She landed in something wet and dense, and thought for some crazy reason she had fallen overboard. But no, she was in a swimming pool- I suppose that is less crazy. Oh and it was warm, that was nice. She got showered when someone dive bombed behind her. \"Aaaah.\" \"Boo!\" A girl made herself know next to her, Emma? \"What on earth are you doing here?\" Emma backstroked to the edge. \"Oh really? Is that the way to greet a friend? You invited me remember?\" \"I did?\" She retorted, going blank, before it clicked. \"Right…my 14th birthday party.\" Emma smiled, she could only assume that she was right. Something dark caught her eye, and she clutched at her bangs- they were black. \"Right, definitely my 14th birthday party…now looking back- this didn't work.\" Her friend frowned at her. \"You did it to yourself, to see what the big deal was about girls dying their hair…making a statement.\" \"Well, I wasn't making a statement.\" She quoted with her fingers. \"I was just looking at my hair in a different colour, I wasn't showing off or trying to join a cult…or band of people that refer to themselves as emos.\" She couldn't find the edge of the pool. Emma sniggered. \"Weren't you trying to disguise yourself…to hide from somebody?\" It hadn't come to her mind, then and now – and it was a complete wake up call. The water went tepid. \"Emma, you are my conscience, aren't you?\" Emma reclined on the edge of the pool, basking in the artificial sunlight. \"You've been watching too many movies.\" \"Have I? If you had known what I had seen…you'd think you were in one, and this one I feel doesn't have a happy ending.\" Her rant ended with her friend laughing mirthlessly. \"Boy…you do go on and on and on!\" Catrina swivelled in the pool, finally seeing the other edge of the pool and made for it. \"I prefer the lounger to water; movies with water are always sad flicks.\" She dragged her drenched form out and found the reclining loungers where she remembered them. Soon as she was on it- the one next to her suddenly became occupied, as if by magic. \"Emma! You're not a shape-shifter…don't start imitating one.\" The girl simply laughed. \"It's your brain!\" Catrina felt embarrassed by the entity, her own friend was naturally scatty, but telling off an imitation she had created was silly. \"Yes well…I'm under a lot of stress.\" \"No reason why you should, you have had a happy carefree life- no abuse, no angst, happy home, no identity crisis…not that I know of.\" True. Very true- the only thing that concerned her was the bogeyman, who turned out to be real- Jack. And he had her- but not in that sense of the word, he had come into possession of her because of some screwed up deal made before she was born. Catrina needed counselling with her family on the matter, though Jack would probably see it as a legal battle…for custody. Jesus Christ . \"Perhaps Robert will emerge from the smoke to rescue me?\" Emma laughed heartily. \"Now who's living in a fairytale, Robert won't jump to his feet for this mission, he hasn't even bothered looking for you when you were a mere bus away. And he's boring.\" Catrina huffed. \"He does have the habit of… not trying to be funny.\" The environment had closed in around them, fading away into the surrounding bright light. \"It's like heaven.\" \"You wouldn't know.\" \"Well of course.\" Catrina retorted, beginning to lose her cool. She was up on her feet before the light could swallow her and the chairs, Emma was up too- the ever persistent follower. \"What do you have to pass on?\" \"Hopefully not you, I think Jack may be getting closer to finding a loophole.\" This snagged Catrina's interest immediately. \"What…so you are something aren't you? From the other realm, popping into my head for a quick chat?\" Emma didn't look amused. \"That's right- I'm not Emma, but I am on a tight schedule, good guys are more organised- see I'm on the side of the angels.\" She pointed out accordingly. \"I think the bad would be more organised, they like to cover their tracks.\" \"'They like to cover their tracks?'- So you think you know them more than I do?\" She snapped, giving her companion a contemptible leer. \"You have no patience to be on the side of the angels.\"Catrina folded her arms sceptically. \"Who are you really?\" Emma had raised her hands in an aggressive gesture, Catrina assumed she was about to be strangled, but the girl merely clapped away their environment to end up in a bleached white warehouse. \"You have no faith.\" Catrina was stunned, had she been too busy to think on another level- to have been aware of other worlds watching over her? \"Okay, that doesn't mean I have none, I'm reserved and cautious- this means nothing, my dreams could pull something off like this.\" Her companion scoffed. \"Human's have their fantasies, some people accidently view our world in comas or trances, damn careless gatekeepers.\" This surprised Catrina a lot, who would have believed the good guys could be so strict? Who would want to go to a place like that? \"You don't work for the angels.\" She finally outed dejectedly. \"I would hope not, you seem grumpy, and long suffering…who would want to spend eternity with somebody like that?\" The woman turned on her heel sharply, catching Cat off guard. \"Look I don't have the easy job…I have the paperwork, the angels, the guardians have the good stuff, the glory, the mighty power!\" \"-Too angry, definitely not heavenly….don't guys like you get a break, shouldn't there be a heaven for you?\" She began, keeping to a safe distance, what good it would do?- She had no idea- 'Emma' was in charge of the space. The woman formally known as 'Emma' shook her head. \"I get holidays, people like me have shifts, this is mine.\" Catrina ambled closer. \"So you have a job, some valuable information? Please get to the point- Do I have a search party coming?\" And there it was, the most understated words of her dilemma. Emma gave her a silly smile. \"I like screwing with people, I could see you were uncomfortable with the sly- holier-than-thou attitude.\" She nodded to assert herself, Catrina had more reasons to be confused. \"So Jack has disappeared off our radar-well…we never catch their sort on radar- but we know he paid a visit to management, we're guessing he's inquiring about the mutiny-\" \"-Wait…What?\" She felt she had walked in on a meeting that didn't concern her. \"I don't know these things.\" \"Well of course you don't- you're not supposed to.\" The woman smugly slunk away to the furthest depth of the warehouse, where Catrina obligingly followed. \"You came here to tell me right? Not to prolong my agony in things that don't concern me .\" She needed to learn not to push it, her exposure to these traumatic events had hardened her- and made her ignorant to the dangers when prying. Emma though looked more than game to part with her knowledge. \"Right you are, we have no power over demons that seek asylum on earth…disasters caused by them are incidents, if anything goes overboard we summon an apocalypse to wipe the slate clean...Thank heavens we haven't had to recently.\" Catrina didn't see how this concerned her. \"What's the good news?\" Emma chortled again , probably an irritating flaw . Emma sobered as if she had heard. \"You can't kill a demon, only send them back to hell, and properly…straight into the pit, that's what happens when demons are demoted, it's best to make them fail.\" It sounded like the fail part was directed at her. \"So you really aren't going to do anything?\" She bit the inside of her mouth in irritation. \"Well you suck.\" Emma furrowed her brows. \"If we plucked you from the ship and dropped you off somewhere…you would be fed to the dogs, who knows who could find you and get themselves promoted- we don't need any more of those demons.\" \"You see, that's what I don't understand- I thought demons were after sinners…what good could come to them from my spotless soul?\" \"So you know their motives?- Well you probably have seen it firsthand, demons like to condemn as many souls as possible to hell, it builds up on their quota and they get a better quality of life- good souls can't be sent to hell, but they can be trapped in purgatory- which is basically earth to them.\" \"-As I figured.\" Catrina added bitterly. \"You think you could just save innocent souls…like Katie.\" The woman went quiet, perhaps it was guilt. \"Or is she just an 'incident ' that you can't intervene in?\" It hit a nerve.\"Katie and all those people are a tragic loss, if we could welcome them home we would, but they are bonded to Jack and the ship- if it was as easy as that we could have saved everyone- but there needs to be a balance. Soon as Jack's reign of terror is over- then they can be free.\" Their environment became very sombre and dark, Catrina didn't want to ask if she could turn up the light and the heat, she didn't want to push it- or ' tempt the lord'. \"You want me to kill Jack, why didn't you get to that sooner?\" She had the sneaky suspicion she was going to have to get herself out of this mess. \"Ha, yes… feisty- but indeed good, we can't ask that of you…that's what slayers are for.\" Catrina gapped, 'so slayers were real'- like Katie said. \"Alas, many have met their end to Jack.\" She felt a muscle in her cheek twitch, it almost sounded like good news that Jack couldn't die. \"We were hoping that he will fail his current position and be demoted- or better; be yanked back down into the pit. They're harmless when they are in the pit.\" She zoned in on her opponent. \"So you have a plan?- Let's hear it then.\" Catrina chirped earnestly, after all that was the whole point to the invasion of her mind. It better be good. Emma sucked in her lips apprehensively, gathering herself.\"He just has to fail, change his mind about everything- you have more power than you know.\" Her fixed stare penetrated her, as if to implant that thought in her head to provoke her- she needed little effort. \"That's a problem, I have no faith in him. Most girls get a kick out of the thought of changing a man, that's why most girls go for bad guys- they think they have the power to change them. I know for certain Jack is a cold case.\" Emma wasn't giving up. \"He is protective, a trait he never had in life or ever.\" Catrina was rapidly losing interest, she didn't want to spend her life trying the unachievable. \"A man that can show loyalty to the slightest thing can be capable of compassion.\" \"I don't care.\" Catrina breezed, it was the cold callous hand that seized her and yanked her to face her opponent that made her freak, a yelp escaped her. \"Well then you must try to care!\" Emma seethed. \"It may not have been your destiny to end up doing this, but a higher and good power is asking this of you.\" The hand was cruel, it was crushing her arm, cutting off the circulation. \"All you must do is gain Jack's trust, prevent him taking more souls…\" \"What do you think I've been trying to do?- I can't stop the actions of a demon's feeding habits! If angels aren't capable of stopping evil, what chance do I have?\" Catrina snatched her arm away, it would take some good hard effort to actually walk away and out of this place. Emma's hard mask fell, exposing a gentler and serene face. \"Sorry- we have let you down in the past.\" Catrina thought she had misheard, she turned on her friend incredulously. \"You are?\" There was a severe straight line between her lips. \"Yes, we were warned about this so called deal that your mother made…we were displeased.\" Catrina flicked hair out of her eyes, so it was true? \"It was Maureen's destiny to destroy the ship and free the souls.\" Catrina shook her head fretfully, her mother wouldn't turn her back on a destiny like that. \"I'm afraid so Catrina…Maureen did not know her destiny but she quite nearly followed it, instead something very different happened.\" Catrina clamped her mouth together, tears threatening to fall. \"Am I to blow up the ship? Will that help?\" Emma winced, and shrugged her shoulders- it didn't look too good. \"I suppose, the souls would be free, the quota undone and Jack…in hell, but who's saying he will remain there?\" Thought provoking. Now it was her time to speak. \"The bad souls will go to hell, the good to heaven- I will die also.\" It came out hush and whispy, lost in the big room they were in. \"My mum and dad…\" \"-Will have paid a heavy price for a mistake they made before your existence.\" Catrina snarled. \"That isn't very fair!\" Angel or no angel, they had a shit system that needed fixing. \"All because you have no control.\" \"Now that hardly seems fair.\" Emma tutted. \"Did you want to hear my other option?\" \"No.\" She responded distastefully, turning away from her to bite her thumbnail. \"You must have given Jack an awful life to make him like this.\" \"It isn't our fault, he chose to be a miscreant.\" She said unenthusiastically. \"So…\" She crept her way to Catrina's side, who wanted nothing more than to avoid her like the plague. \"My other option was for you to simply let him fail, if you killed him that would be it- it wouldn't be his fault, on the other hand if he failed because of his actions he would be demoted or sent to the pit….\" Catrina wanted to slap her. \"How is that better? Will the souls be free?\" Emma became shifty. \"Unfortunately we don't know, someone could probably claim the quota and the innocents may be freed, or trapped in purgatory until the quota is full and then accepted.\" Catrina shook her head. \"No one deserves to go to hell, no one.\" Something hit her like a tonne of bricks. \"And if Jack is just demoted, he will be a normal demon- I would be….extremely vulnerable.\" \"Huh…like you are already?\" Emma input, making the situation even more unnerving. \"No pity coming from you I see…What I mean is; he holds back a lot because of his current status.\" Catrina managed, realizing Jack does quite a lot for her, when he owes her nothing. \"How sweet, you can see how easy this is becoming, convert or death.\" Catrina disagreed. \"I have a feeling death- and not him; me…\" She has been plagued with nightmares of when that day comes. She spied her companion check her watch. \"Am I keeping you?\" She added sarcastically. Emma looked up brazenly. \"Yes, our time is up.\"[Chapter 31] This is a short chapter. Catrina sat bolt upright in her shabby little bed. It was night, she had missed a whole day. Her covers were over her as she had supposedly left them, but when she tugged, they didn't budge- they had been tucked in under the mattress. She wasn't sure if Katie had the proper form to do something like that. It took a little more force for what energy she had to untangle herself– so she was drained before she had even got up. When she set her foot on the floor to push herself up, she simply keeled over and off the bed, and probably broke a nail preventing her face hitting the wood. He must have been listening- because seconds later he popped in, leaning heavily on the door. \"What are you doing scavenging on the floor?\" \"I'm not…\" Her arms shook with the effort to push herself up, she gave in and remained there. \"I haven't eaten- so I think I'm dying.\" \"Bullshit, you're just being awkward.\" He gave her an almighty tug up- to show off his flippant manliness , and propped her into a chair, she sagged into it like a rag doll. He pulled a grimace. \"And stop doing that…you're making the room look untidy.\" \"I don't have the strength to laugh so don't try to be funny.\" Her head was resting on the back of the chair so she wasn't even looking at him as she said this. It would be too much to watch him pace the room, but when he had gathered himself- she figured it was to deliver a terrible verdict. \"I went down to management, they weren't much good…apparently we've got company-\" Catrina jerked \"-Not here, not now…but somewhere, not part of management.\" Catrina lolled her head to the side to throw a shrewd look at him. \"Just say hell…it isn't my management, I don't work there!\" \"I thought you were tired?\" He chimed, and she managed a huff. \"I will be dead if you don't help me.\" \"You want my help?\" He used his rare bitch voice. \"I'm giving you free lodgings…you are beginning to out stay your welcome.\" Catrina made a humongous gasp and clutched at her stomach. \"Why are you so damn funny lately?\" She pulled the cover over her head. \"If you don't want me here- send me home.\" \"Send me home- means something else in my dictionary.\" He hinted. She took it he meant death and heaven, which she now knew existed- oh how relieved she was! She broke from her trail of thought when something was chucked on her lap, it was wrapped in grease paper- could it be? \"A cheeseburger!\" She almost ate it with the wrapper still on, during her merriment and hums of bliss- Jack retrieved a grocery bag, stood by the side of the bed, and emptied a mountain of burgers onto her lap. She whooped loudly, grabbing and devouring what she could in a short amount of time. Over one of the baps she caught him observing her with a finger pressed analytically to his lips. She dropped her meal, rustling the debris. \"This isn't what you call a last supper, is it?\" He scoffed. \"So morbid…No, death is not a journey I'm going to put you on.\" The bed dipped as he seated himself next to her. \"I'm turning over a new leaf.\" The cheeseburgers returned to her mouth, giving her time to think of something to say. So he was going to be nice to her?- Which will make it a lot easier to cosy up to him, then hopefully his mission will be abandoned- therefore he will fail. \"We should have dinner.\" She managed, swallowing a big mouthful. Jack smiled in unison with her as she chose to offer him one burger. She was having a dejavu- certain she had done this before. \"Consider it a date.\" Jack's current stoop was like an awkward teenager. She just hoped it all wasn't just an act. \"Well you paid for it, so I suppose it kinda is.\" Silence consumed them, apart from the rustling of grease paper and the sound of munching. Catrina didn't know what to say next, she had exhausted herself being…well, horrible. And being nice with Jack was out of her comfort zone- which she was sure it was for Jack as well. Perhaps this was a test? \"My energy is returning.\" She added, shielded by her food and paper. \"So strenuous activities are back in your books then?\" He didn't even look at her when he said that, so she assumed it was entirely innocent. She noted he was on the same burger, where she had consumed 3 since. She hadn't thought he probably didn't need to eat. \"I'm not going to do a few laps of the ship- I think I've lost enough weight.\" \"Are you vain?\" Jack continued to eat while she pondered on this- staring at him like he had swore. \"No.\" She retorted dubiously, waiting for an explanation. When it didn't come she felt compelled to speak- it sounded like their truce was about to come to an abrupt end. \"Why would you think a girl concerned about her weight is vain- especially when she's insinuating she's underweight?\" \"Forgive me, I have been surrounded by women all by life who scrutinise themselves with other women. It got kinda tiresome.\" Another bite was taken out of his morsel. Quick- he was getting into his personal life, find out more. \"Women like your mother?\" He continued to eat more fiercely, at least he wasn't taking it out on her. Jack paused mid chew, and Catrina's ears perked up. \"She wasn't vain- she was too close to her god to be vain.\" \"She was a religious woman?\" Interesting. \"And she bore the spawn of satan.\" Jack looked at her sharply, dropping a ball of grease paper. \"She was good, she didn't judge people, she had so much damn faith in humanity…then it all changed.\" His voice was angry and hurt, his fist became white and he shoved it against his mouth to silence himself. Catrina wanted to rip the hand away to make him pour his heart out. Catrina empathy kicked in. \"And so she should, humanity was god's greatest creation.\" She very tentatively reached for his back, laying a hand on him- but Jack suddenly jumped into a standing position, she retreated slightly on her bed- about to kick out in case he attacked her. \"You sound like her.\" He said so deathly quiet, it irked her- he hadn't yelled. \"And I hated her because of it….\" Catrina felt herself shaking. \"I hated her because she was so good, and I knew I was nothing like her.\" She swallowed down a lot of fear with remnants of her burgers. \"So Sundays must have been like flu-shot day.\" \"-Like you wouldn't believe!\" The bed cushioned his buttocks once more, he turned to engage her. \"Mothers want the best for their children right?\" Catrina nodded to this- she would have nodded to anything he had said though. \"What if the best thing was to leave them to their own devices, stop trying to 'save' them.\" \"So you were aware your mother was trying to save you from damnation?- Well that's a start.\" She chimed, allowing the strain to leave her voice, the fear went with it. \"What did she do wrong, other than love you?\" Catrina detected she was approaching rough territory which could result in violence- on her. Jack went still beside her, staring at her rather sedulously, as if she was about to answer her own question. \"Perhaps her arrogance over her ability to change me?\" Well that trumped her. \"-Wait, are you talking about your mother or me?\" Jack huffed at her sudden bout of stupidity. \"Arrogance that isn't even present- who says I want to change you?!\" Catrina was on the verge of a rant, not something you would want to be an audience of, she could go on for hours defending herself, long after everyone had left the room. \"You are a cold case my friend, something that could be left on the shelf for years- and believe me, no one is capable of changing your sorry ass but yourself.\" Jack remained nonplus. \"I'm not here as an intervention for your demonic ways, you have to want to change, in order to change, that was probably your mother's mistake…\" There was clapping ringing in her ear hole, she stalled long enough to see Jack applauding her with a deadpan face. Didn't he know mocking her would just egg her on some more? \"Does your mother see you when you turn into a diva?\" He said with such dark humour, that didn't exactly anger her- so she laughed, into his face, in short bursts enough to ruffle his hair. Her face was pink by the time she had finished.\"I would never speak to my mother like this… my dad would kill me.\" \"-Is that how a normal family works?\" He asked shrewdly. \"-I answer one question and then receive another.\" He was turning the conversation onto her. \"Healthy families have parents who try to defend each other, sometimes either parent wants to look like the good guy- but this can lead to an argument later when they're on their own…\" She shrugged off going into more detail. \"I suppose single parent families don't have that, am I right?\" Jack perked up. \"They have underachieved kids, with no fear of authority.\" This was turning into a political debate. \"There's no proof of that, some single parent families are closer than two parent ones.\" \"Someone's been watching too much Gilmore girls.\" Jack droned, slinking off the bed. She thought for a moment. \"How the hell do you know what the Gilmore girls' is about?\" This should be interesting. He snuck a glance at her, it was impossible for him to appear sheepish. \"I've been around long enough to hear about such atrocities. \" \"And there was me thinking you watched something hearty in between your doses of porn.\" She fell back onto her pillow, all the air left it and expelled dust into the atmosphere. The demon observed her from his position by the door- poised to leave. \"How did she die?\" His face betrayed him before he left.[Chapter 32] Sorry, it's been awhile. I can't proof read it. Probably has errors, tell me if there are any imposing ones. Jack had finally given her something of use, a Nintendo DS. Though it wasn't quite a book, or a sketch pad, she would have to make do with Mario, and Sudoku electronically. But she craved a sketch pad. It was kind of funny asking him, he would give her this rather dubious look and retort- \"You are not drawing me like one of your french girls.\" That had been a hilarious day. She had laughed till she cried, scaring the shit out of him. So much for trying to win him over, you can't flirt if you laugh at them like a spaz. Well she couldn't flirt anyhow. Catrina was on a very good level on Mario when she realised she was supposed to be plotting instead of wallowing her hours away on some stupid toy. She shot a meticulous look over to the man at the bar, it wasn't Jack, she frowned. Catrina hadn't been careful enough in suppressing her surprise, she had moved- triggering a look from 'not Jack'. A male ghost was looking right back at her, well she could only assume he was a ghost. The figure was neither misty nor floating, but he was pale and he wore smart but dated clothes. \"Are you my watchdog?\" The way he raised his head, and had no slouch suggested he had been a wealthy man, she noted that what she thought was a dinner jacket was a uniform, so he had been a member of the crew. \"I'm just in visitation, I do that.\" He shrugged in a rather ordinary manner, it took the edge off him slightly. \"Forgive me, it's rare occasions I'm actually seen, I don't like to bother the living. Please continue to amuse yourself with that plastic remote.\" Catrina hadn't expected that. Not only no sly remarks, but manners- and no begging. The younger woman hadn't realised she sought more information till the silence consumed the room. She smiled politely. \"Where do you go when you're not in visitation?\" \"The same place Katie goes, into the darkness, we stop existing in that place.\" He appeared comforted, perhaps it was the whisky he was managing to hold and drink? \"How are you doing that?\" He knew instantly what she was referring to. \"It's just a memory, I can hold onto items that I used quite often in life, especially if it took place on the ship.\" His next gulp was a demonstration. \"Don't you recall Katie brushing your hair?\" She nodded in acceptance. \"Right, how silly of me. \" There was an awkward pause between that her next question. \"Do you associate with other ghosts you never met in life?\" \"Yes, only ones on the boat, I can't meet and greet relatives, sadly.\" And on that sombre note, he appeared to flicker, she didn't want to question this. It was obviously a regular occurrence, there are probably so many questions a ghost can take. \"I must take my leave, I don't like to be in one place so long.\" His flickering accelerated, and he disappeared in a pattern of white noise. The lights in the room came on brighter, she wasn't aware they had dimmed in the first place. Jack came into the room in a dramatic fashion, perhaps this was the cause of the ghost's haste. Catrina forced on a smouldering look, it can only be achieved after something as sombre as that. He nearly missed it, but his double take acknowledged her. \"I have a drawing pad for you, if that's what you were working for?\" \"Give it to me.\" She drawled, flexing her hand. Jack eyed it and then plonked the item firmly in her grasp. There was a funny sort of retreat, he didn't seem to like the air. He took his seat which the ghost had vacated. Catrina had two objects of amusement in her lap, she flicked her gaze over the edge of the pad.\"You're being a bit scatty, aren't you?\" His whisky had gone down, he swished what was left and signalled her with the bottle. \"Didn't think you liked this stuff.\" \"I haven't touched it.\" She retorted simply. \"I doubt that, there're only so many you things you can get your hands on, I bet in your boredom you're bound to knock back a few.\" He emptied the dregs into his mouth. He coughed. She hadn't heard him emit this sound before- it was too human even for him. \"Are you alright?\" \"-No!\" She blanched. \"Sorry I asked.\" She stifled her glee, she sensed a disturbance within his demeanour, it had been like this since they had got back from land. Catrina noticed she was watching him a lot more than he was watching her. It felt like the barb wire in her prison had been removed, and she was on the verge of freedom, hence her glee. And probably why Jack was so irritable with it. He must have known he no longer posed as a threat to her anymore. She pushed her hair back, allowing her fingers to linger on her scalp, the strands of hair fell back into place, her face was very open- and used the opportunity to take a breath. \"Must you breath so loudly?\" She heard him rumble. \"Yes, I'm of the living.\" She didn't take her eyes of her sketch pad. A smirk threatened to crawl onto her face. \"I sometimes worry for you, you take on a lot of responsibility, it seems your work doesn't give you any time to reap the benefits.\" She sensed him pivot on his stool. \"What are you getting at?\" Catrina began to fill in the outline she had begun of him on the stool, though she didn't look at him full on- she used what she could make out in the corner of her eye to amuse herself. \"You were pulled from hell, and rewarded with a job, a new purpose- and this reward is giving you nothing back in return. You seemed to be giving them more of your time.\" \"I say that to myself everyday, hell is hell, you're not supposed to enjoy it. But the freedom I get is better than nothing.\" The whisky bottle was empty, but he still held it in order to gesture. \"Don't see what that's got to do with you.\" \"It has everything to do with me.\" She imagined his harsh features searching her, so she drew them in. \"I have to live with this, watch you make the stupid decisions.\" Some details she couldn't really put down through guessing, she would have to look at the origin. She looked up at him, his flesh was pale, and his steel blues eyes looked a lot livelier than she had imagined. \"Oh.\" She mouthed, and corrected her mistake. She was met with confusion, from him. \"Well these stupid decisions have kept you alive, and in existence.\" It was a rather redundant comeback. Catrina vaguely knew the back-story and rolled her eyes. \"Right, but what's the point of living if you can't enjoy yourself.\" She was moving onto very thin ice, she wasn't sure if she was gutsy enough to say the rest. She prepared her smoulder. \"Imagine what we could be doing right now.\" Don't lay it on too thick. The look he gave her spurned her. \"Aye-what?\" Jack was so human right now, it was unbelievable. She was beginning to add depth to her drawing, he was becoming a very good subject. \"Anything could happen.\" She quirked a brow at him. \"But it won't will it? Because you're not willing to trade it all in.\" She left that hanging in the air like a fog. It appeared to have a profound effect on him, he stared her down dubiously, before his thoughts consumed him so much he had to turn away. \"Who are you, and what have you done with Catrina?\" She should have expected this. \"I'm in a better place than what I was.\" \"Does that mean you're not Catrina?\" Great , her technique had been to come on strong, now she had to prove her identity. \"I am myself, after what we've been through; I've had a change of heart.\" \"Okay, fine.\" He couldn't hide the doubt from his voice. \"But what does this mean exactly?\" His dark voice cut up by this high pitch of curiosity. \"You are open to the idea, you wouldn't be repulsed by it- you would be up for it?- If I wasn't an incubus?\" The young woman continued to sketch, prolonging his agony. \"You know I can take that pad away…\" Catrina placed her chin on the edged of the propped up pad. \"You won't, it'll keep me occupied until then…\" She might as well hold the smouldering look since she was using it quite often, she was turning it on and off at a ridiculous rate. If he hadn't been sitting down, he probably would have fallen down. \"What?\" She stifled a laugh, you couldn't laugh at a man's sensitivity- it was a turn off- for him that is. That's when the lip biting came into play, it had been an accident, but it was a lot more effective she found than the smoulder. \"You're being so coy.\" \"-Yeah, well right back at yah.\" He jibbed, turning away from her to search the counter for more whisky. \"I don't need this shit.\" She could have added. 'I know what you need.' But it would be overkill, she didn't need to turn into a nymph to get things to go her way. Hopefully everything shouldn't backfire and he won't just pounce and kill her in the process. \"You have given too much of your time to hell.\" \"It sounds like you are giving up.\" He suddenly stopped looking for the whiskey. \"You have a death wish, that must be it.\" He leapt up from his stool as if he had the answer to the whole universe.\"You want me to end you, you don't want me at all, you don't want to be a prisoner anymore.\" Catrina's pad was flat on her lap, revealing the picture she had drew, Jack merely glanced at it, before his eyes glared at her again. \"Sure.\" She chided. \"If I want to shed my mortal coil; I would want to go in style, fucked to death. Though I have many easier options available- stab myself, drown myself- No, that's not good enough for me, I want-\" She seemed to forget the reason she was doing this. She should have cut this short, instead of going off on a sarcastic rant, now he must know everything before had been insincere. Catrina had to recover. \"Or maybe I wish to set you free.\" She mustered with all the honesty she could. \"Maybe I'm just telling you I'll be right here when you get back?\" That had stumped him. Jack looked the opposite of imposing. \"You did drink the whisky, didn't you?\" R&R;[Chapter 33] I'm writing this simultaneously with another story. Check for errors. Catrina spied what appeared to be a big boat – or small ship on the dusky horizon. It wasn't the first boat she had seen, obviously. Maybe this time this crew will make it, and survive. She scrutinised it and began to draw what it might look like if it were closer. The next page she decided to fill with what the crew might look like. Katie flickered into place at her side in time to see her friend draw a load of cut throat pirates. \"Hm, I see.\" Katie chided, reframing from stating the obvious. She stared at one of the pirates. \"Ha, that's Jack!\" She indicated at the graphite. \"That's a good likeness, you should do this professionally.\" \"What, piracy?\" Together they laughed like musketeers. \"No. Make some good honest cash, sell some of your work.\" The young ghost had some good ideas for the future, Catrina's future. And Catrina hopefully thought she will be able to pay her back- with freedom. \"I think I'm going to take that advice, soon.\" Katie gave her a rather perplexed if not suggestive leer. \"Has something come up?\" Her voice was quiet, she was aware Jack could make an unwanted appearance. \"I've found that fighting isn't the answer, well not the kind of fight I had in mind. My victory will probably be my end or everybody's freedom.\" Katie's eyes were almost translucent. \"You're giving up?\" \"No.\" Catrina had to object to that. \"It's not like that, I'm going beyond that- Jack will realise how far I'm willing to go and he'll sever ties with whomever he works for, and you might be free, me included- ish. \" Their faces mirrored each other, not just because they looked similar- but they both believed, and were determined to be free, in some form. \"A little dangerous, because if he doesn't sever ties- you will die.\" Katie added morbidly. \"Yes, I did mention that, but you won't be stuck on this ship, in limbo.\" The sun had disappeared below the horizon, the lack of light made the air go considerably cold. Katie was already naturally cold.\"I don't like it, sorry. It seems like someone is going to get screwed over. You have no idea where our souls go if you win or lose, severing ties with management, we might get stuck here, if he doesn't- we might go to hell!\" \"The bad ones might go to hell, you will be sent upwards.\" Catrina gestured to the heavens with her pencil, before carrying on drawing. \"You can't know that.\" Katie was severe when it came to the afterlife. \"Why would he capture my soul if he knew it wasn't going to hell?\" Catrina was consumed with thought, before saying slowly and defeated. \"I don't know how it works, but you're not bad, good people can't be damned to hell. God wouldn't let that happen.\" Even Katie's sigh of resignation had an accent. \"God doesn't have anything to do with this, he wouldn't have put me through this shit, 60 years….not 40, miscounted.\" She sounded old and beyond her years. \"So many years…you think God would have intervened by now?\" The English ghost had the most manic expression. Catrina shook her head, trying to rid herself of the image. \"You need faith, don't darken your heart, it'll only feel longer. Don't become a restless spirit.\" \"I'm a floating protoplasm- I have no heart!\" Tears sprung to Katie's eyes, which was sort of reflection Catrina's. \"I can't help it.\" She said with a rumble of both anger and despair. \"I'm on the verge of going mad…\" This was evident, Katie's misty hands were starting to shake, and was she beginning to flicker from existence? \"You've only been here over a month- and you are telling me to have faith!\" There was no doubt her protoplasm was flickering and becoming taller, and darker. \"Maybe just one more soul will do it?\" That manic face returned- \"You wanted to make a sacrifice…now do it!\" Further flickering, so violent it was audible. \"Katie.\" Catrina said calmly, wondering if what she was witnessing was really bad. \"Katie, don't you see what's happening?\" \"I don't care!\" She raged, her breath was a blast of wind that nearly knocked her companion off her feet. \"Please Katie!\" Catrina knew she had to get her voice to match hers to get through, but it was hard to get some steady ground with the wind picking up, and they were losing precious light. \"This has escalated really quickly!\" She spoke over a distant roar and through darkness. It was night now, and terrible time to be having a face-off with a ghost. A ghost which was now 8 ft tall. \"The sacrifice will come in all due time!\" She knew what she had to say to calm things down, give the ghost what it wanted to hear. Some of it might soon come to pass anyway. With noisy wind came a mist, rendering her unable to see Katie fully. \"I will save you!\" She was showered with what she believed was sea water blown up by the storm, she clutched at the railings behind her back because she had no choice- the wind had pinned her there, and her hair was spiralling out of control. \"Katie!\" Katie no longer had a recognisable feature on her, it was just a grey mass. What Catrina believed to be a face turned into a black hole of a mouth- sucking all remaining light or life. Catrina screamed loudly, to save herself, to be rid of the spirit, to scare it away. It instead, contorted and twisted violently and rushed towards the alarmed woman like a tornado. Catrina closed her eyes tightly as it whipped through her clothes and hair, heavy and cold. Then it was gone. Catrina peered through anxious eyes, before dropping to the deck. \"Katie?\" Some light returned to her surroundings, there was no more wind. It had been awful, and it still did feel that way- a time like this she would seek comfort with her only contact…. A void had been left in her spirit, Catrina's spirit. It seemed her very anchor that kept her sane on the ship, and remotely human was the little ghost girl- but she had obliterated herself in front of her, and in absolute rage, directed at herself. It had seemed final. Had Katie crossed over some plane? \"Katie?\" Maybe that wasn't Katie? Things are never what they seem in this new supernatural world she had been introduced to. Catrina at a snail's pace began to stand up and found someone was there lurking on the decking, not necessarily there to help her, but confront her. \"What did you do?\" Jack was deathly calm. She wondered how long he had been on the ship, and in hearing range. How was she to know? \"Katie, I think…and I'm emphasizing 'think'; she crossed over.\" She took a much needed breath and swallowed her heart , well it felt like she was holding her heart in her throat. \"Not in the way you think.\" Jack was mocking, and she couldn't fathom why. \"She went somewhere!\" \"To get away from you.\" He didn't even match her raised voice. Normally when someone was yelling, the other would feel compelled to compete. \"She has crossed over to the restless side.\" \"That's your fault!\" \"Whatever.\" He didn't even care about the insubordination, she did it so often nowadays. \"I bet you don't even know what I'm talking about.\" The strain was starting to show on her face, madness was beginning to set in. \"I think I might join her.\" She had shed many tears in her captivity, and been very snarky while skulking about the ship. Despite the circumstances, Catrina believed she had handled herself better than anyone could when put into that situation. But surely being on the verge of manic laughter wasn't exactly handling it. \"Will I be expecting any poltergeist activity from her, or what?\" She waited for him to drawl something utterly useless and cold, and when nothing came, she glanced up. He stood there very unanimated, disinterested in anything. She didn't know him well enough to know if this was out of character, but she already knew he was soulless. \"Right, thanks.\" \"I don't have time to talk, I've got to get back before they realise I'm not onboard.\" Right, he was in the middle of ferrying . \"Then why did you come back? You could have ignored your spidey senses.\" She put her back to him, expecting him to vanish. \"You wasted 2 minutes just standing there gawking.\" He had indeed vanished, but it didn't mean he couldn't not hear. \"You missed me.\" Catrina teased at no one, and very half heartedly, after all she might have just lost Katie. She was also aware she might have scuppered her chances at softening his heart.[Chapter 34] \"I'm a fucking lunatic, for thinking that this entire….\" What was it? \"Journey, was all going to blow over by just calling my mom.\" She wore away the floor boards pacing. \"Which I haven't managed to do yet.\" Catrina had resorted to talking to herself, since the only human presence left was herself, since Katie blew herself up. She heard the whooshing of the waves outside and the creaking of metal. Going quiet had given her the heebie jeebies. She felt her eyes well up at the doom that lay ahead, and the boredom before she got to it. \"Still here, not entirely sane.\" She said ominously, she was past physically crying, it didn't help. In what scenario did crying help? Another creak wrung from the hall way, and she was crazy enough to think it was Katie. \"Katie?\" For there to be a creak there had to be some weight causing it, Katie was lighter than air, in fact she was air. She immediately lost interest when she worked out it was anything but the little dead girl. It was Jack coming in with a peace offering. \"Here. Eat it.\" It was hardly gesture of goodwill, food was just to keep her alive and prisoner. Catrina blanked \"Are they onboard?\" Ignoring the scraps completely. He let out a sigh of irritancy, dropped the food on the bed, and he turned and left. Was that it? She stared at the space he had once occupied. He was losing interest, and his drive she figured, it was either her fault or management was to blame. It was hard to break the damn repetition that was going on, she hadn't acted on her plans, in fact she had gone backwards- back to the protesting. And Jack was behaving like an unhappily married man in a bread cue. For the next couple of hours she listened to the sound of life on the ship, people exploring corridors, missing her room- because it was in a perception field. There were clanks and bangs of curiosity, and the murmurs of a conversations. Catrina waited gormlessly for the sounds of merriment, they would soon find the gold. There was sunlight coming in through her porthole, it warmed the room, and it wasn't long before she dozed off. Now what she was going to dream?! She was wondering the ship's corridors, and she was perfectly aware this was a dream- though normally her conscious puts away such rationality. But nevertheless this was a dream. She steered herself into Katie's old room, stepped over some toys and opened the cupboard. The body was no longer there, but this didn't irk her- whether or not in truth, it was logical to think that Jack may have moved it, or did she do it?- No it must have been her? Wait of course she did move it. This was a memory that was imbedded in another part of her brain, separate from the one controlling her dreams. She turned, and as if she had been expecting it, she saw Jack sitting in the lounge chair. \"Any words of wisdom?\" Catrina asked with resignation. Jack opened his mouth. \"It couldn't have drifted too far, it's doomed to stay in one place, it's not even operational.\" Catrina felt her heart in her throat, that was her mother's voice- coming out of Jack! But it didn't mean anything, it was a god damn dream! She dropped into the chair opposite Jack, he continued to speak. \"It must have a perception field.\" Catrina was perched on the edge of her seat. Was she actually hearing her mother?- Were they close, had they cracked it? Though with some simple rational thinking, since she had been thinking about salvagers and perception fields earlier on, it would make sense it would crop up in her dream. But it was her mother's voice. Sure you never forget a mother's voice, but surely positive thinking wasn't the only thing a play here, maybe this was a premonition or some other plane where she could hear family. Maybe she had died during that nap? \"Something messing with the radar, evp?\" Jack mouthed. She was having a hard time coping with the imagery and the clashing voice. \"Mom?\" Jack frowned at her, it was a crude frown of mockery. Catrina persisted.\"Mom?\" Jack was sitting fully upright with limited motion, apart from the confused gaze. Catrina came forward out of her chair and onto her knees. \"Mom?\" She could hear waves crashing up against the side of the ship, and seagulls- she never heard these sounds before. The ship always sucked all sounds of normality away. Jack remained frozen, and frustratingly silent…until. \"Are you hearing this?\" Catrina blinked. \"Mom, can you hear me?\" \"-Oh my god, Catrina… Catrina?! Is that you?\" Jack's face had never displayed so much emotion, it was alien to him. \"Mom I'm on the ship, I'm here!\" Catrina felt her eyes welling up as she yelled into Jack's face like he was a microphone. \"You must be close mom.\" The ferryman's mouth closed slowly, mechanically . There was silence, for an extended period. \"Are you still there?\" She seized his knees and shook them. \"Mom?\" She had gotten ridiculously close to his face, her irises darting as she tried to read that face for an incoming signal. \"Psst…mom, it's the ship , the Antonia Grazia from your past, I'm on it.\" She drew back warily after a lengthy period had passed, she became more aware it was Jack staring right back at herwith those steely blue eyes. How could you forget? \"Never mind.\" It occurred to her if her mother was close; should she bring her here- to Jack? Who would no less slaughter her on sight, possibly using his new method. Catrina shuddered to think. She reversed back into her chair, and lolled her head off the back. The ceiling had swirly patterns, dancing and shimmering, like waves and moonlight. It wasn't long before the disjointing patterns formed words. Arctic warrior 2 . Catrina felt her lids click open, she was lying on her bed feeling groggy and hot, the sunlight had steamed her in her sleep, she felt damp and warm underneath against the sheets. But she remained where she was, reflecting on her previous vision. The Arctic Warrior 2 was her parents ship, the one that had been holed up in some shack. It was the only thing that could get them from A to B without any troublesome paperwork. But was it all just memories seeping into a dream, or reality?
